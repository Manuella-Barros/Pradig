When the possibility of the Pauls and Kelces squaring off in a tag-team match was mentioned, Gargano seemed interested.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\n\"Yeah, that'd be big. You never know,\" Gargano told Fox News Digital with a laugh. \"Look, it's in Cleveland Browns Stadium, I will say. There are members of the Cleveland Browns roster that are wrestling fans. I'll mention David Njoku especially. I know Myles Garrett's done a Shawn Michaels pose a few times as well. I would not rule out any Cleveland Browns being in attendance that night.\n\n\"But Paul brothers versus Kelce brothers, that is definitely box office. Big headlines. You never know.\"\n\nWWE's last premium live event in Cleveland was Fastlane in 2019, and that was an arena show. This time around, the football stadium will play host to the premium live event. It will also be the first PLE in the U.S. WWE will hold most of them outside the country.\n\nTo have it in Cleveland means more for Gargano.\n\n\"I heard a few months ago that it was a possibility. And when I heard it was a possibility, I said, 'Please, just please,'\" he told Fox News Digital. \"You know how freaking cool that would be? This is something I've been waiting for, I don't want to say my whole life, but essentially my whole life, for the majority of my life. A huge big four WWE event in Cleveland, Ohio. The fact that it's in Cleveland Browns Stadium is something I never thought would happen.\"\n\nGargano said he dreamed about possibly wrestling in the stadium when he was a child. But he didn't think it would ever happen because Cleveland isn't considered a major market, and doing open-air shows wasn't really a thing years ago.\n\nDRAKE, KENDRICK LAMAR RECEIVE INVITE FROM WWE LEGEND TO SETTLE RAP BEEF ON SHOW\n\n\"The fact that it's actually happening, it's actually a real thing, not just a daydream ... the fact that SummerSlam is coming to Cleveland, Ohio, and I am an active member of the WWE roster, and I have a chance to wrestle in that stadium on that show, it feels like destiny, man. It really, really does.\"\n\nWWE just finished with Backlash in Lyon, France, and for those even watching at home, the crowd roared over commentators Michael Cole and Corey Graves.\n\nGargano said he has \"faith\" in the fans to bring their all and follow in the \"footsteps of all the international PLEs.\"\n\nBy the time Aug. 3 rolls around, it's unclear where Gargano will be in the championship picture. He and his tag-team partner, Tommaso Ciampa, were recently drafted to SmackDown and have yet to capitalize on the opportunities to hold tag-team gold.\n\nGargano said he still believes he can win gold in 2024 and accomplish his goal of being a WWE champion.\n\n\"I just want to be on SummerSlam in any way, shape or form,\" he said. \"But if it were to shake out that way, if we were to get a shot at the WWE tag-team titles at SummerSlam in my hometown, and the fact that it's in Cleveland Browns Stadium. I had my senior prom in Cleveland Browns Stadium. I had my 30th birthday party, thanks to my lovely wife, in Cleveland Browns Stadium.\n\n\"I trained for Takeover: New York for my NXT championship in Cleveland Browns Stadium. I have so much history in that building. I pride myself on being the Cleveland professional wrestler because I am very proud to rep it wherever I go.\n\n\"If I were to get the opportunity to win the WWE tag-team titles in that stadium for my family and friends, that would be ... something I would remember for a very, very long time.

For example, the past month saw two nights of WrestleMania and Backlash: France all take place. Now, the promotion looks ahead to a series of other big events.\n\nThe King and Queen of The Ring PLE will take place later this month. From there, Triple H and company officials will book cards for Clash at The Castle Scotland, Money in The Bank, and most notably, SummerSlam.\n\nSummerSlam 2024 will be taking place on Saturday, August 3rd. The big-time event is set to air live from the Cleveland Browns Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio. Tens of thousands of fans are expected for the massive stadium show and it is guaranteed to be an awesome experience.\n\nThe company has many big stars, so it isn't yet clear who will appear on the SummerSlam card. Still, there are some who really shouldn't miss out when the promotion returns to Ohio. This article will take a look at five wrestlers who absolutely should be included on the biggest wrestling show of the summer.\n\nBelow are five WWE stars who should not be omitted from SummerSlam 2024.\n\n#5. LA Knight should win gold at WWE SummerSlam\n\nLA Knight is one of the biggest stars in pro wrestling today. He very easily couldn't have been, seeing as he was saddled with the Max Dupri gimmick in 2022. Thankfully, his own talent, and Triple H taking over WWE led to him returning to the LA Knight name and he has taken off as a major star since.\n\nThe Megastar could be in for a big push in the coming weeks. He has entered himself in the 2024 WWE King of The Ring Tournament. While it hasn't yet been made clear what winners receive, a victory could mean a title opportunity in the future.\n\nKnight was involved in a Slim Jim Battle Royal during last year's show. While it has meant becoming a spokesman for the brand, some were disappointed with his role at the event. He must not only be in a better spot this year, but he should arguably win a title. Perhaps he can dethrone Logan Paul?\n\n#4. IYO SKY's big push needs to continue\n\nIYO SKY is one of the best wrestlers in WWE today and has thankfully been pushed as such. While it took time, she won the Women's Tag Team Titles, Women's Money in The Bank briefcase, and the Women's Championship in the last year and a half or so. Her push has been steady, but rock solid.\n\nMuch like LA Knight, IYO SKY is looking to win a massive WWE tournament. She is in the Queen of The Ring Tournament and already picked up a big win. She defeated Natalya on Monday Night RAW in what was a standout bout.\n\nSKY has a lot of history at SummerSlam. She debuted at SummerSlam 2022 and then won the Women's Championship at the 2023 event. Given her skill level and her history at the big summer show, it is crucial that IYO SKY is included at the event and her big push continues.\n\n#3. Tommaso Ciampa & #2. Johnny Gargano, DIY must be on the show\n\nDIY is a tag team who barely made it to WWE. The duo of Johnny Gargano and Tommaso Ciampa were brought onto NXT with a unique contract that saw them also work the indies. Over time, however, they won over management, earned a proper contract, and then took over the brand.\n\nToday, DIY are together on the main roster. They were moved to SmackDown in the WWE Draft 2024 after failing in their pursuit to win tag team gold on RAW. As frustrating as it was for the duo, their shortcomings may not be an issue now that they're able to start fresh on the blue brand.\n\nIt is essential that this duo appear at SummerSlam in Cleveland. Johnny Wrestling is from Ohio, which means DIY will be treated as hometown heroes. The two could fight A-Town Down Under for the prized titles and finally win their first main roster belts and do it on a big stage.\n\n#1. Gunther hasn't wrestled at many premium live events\n\nGunther is one of the most dominant performers in WWE history. He joined the company through NXT UK where he won the United Kingdom Championship and had the longest reign the title ever had. He then replicated the feat on the main roster with the prized Intercontinental Title. He's a true star.\n\nAn interesting tidbit has made the rounds recently on social media. The Ring General has only had six singles matches on a WWE main roster premium live event. With two years on the main roster, and an Intercontinental Championship run that lasted 666 days, this is surprising to say the least.\n\nTriple H and company officials have done a great job with Gunther's push, but he should have more singles matches at major PLEs. The next step may be to have The Ring General battle a big name in a singles match at WWE SummerSlam. This would only further add to his legacy.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ken@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Ken", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LA_Knight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LA Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WWE Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SummerSlam", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SummerSlam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ring_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Ring (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_H", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triple H"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlash_(2009)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Backlash (2009)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIY_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DIY (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "House show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimmick_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gimmick (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logan Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalya_Neidhart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natalya Neidhart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_royal_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battle royal (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Gargano", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Johnny Gargano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tag team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WWE_pay-per-view_and_livestreaming_supercards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of WWE pay-per-view and livestreaming supercards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlash_(2023)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Backlash (2023)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_United_Kingdom_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NXT United Kingdom Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_UK_(WWE_brand)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NXT UK (WWE brand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WWE draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Intercontinental_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WWE Intercontinental Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommaso_Ciampa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommaso Ciampa"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard Wrestling", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/eb559-17152259467196-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551493", "eventUri": "eng-9551493", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-08-03", "textStart": 499, "textEnd": 509}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

January kicks things off with The Royal Rumble. Following that show, WrestleMania takes place, typically in April. Then SummerSlam will happen in August and Survivor Series in November.\n\nTwo of the aforementioned massive events have already taken place. The next of the \"big four\" is SummerSlam. The Biggest Party of The Summer will take place on Saturday, August 03, 2024, at the Cleveland Browns Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nWith three Premium Live Events before SummerSlam for the main roster alone, no matches have been announced. Triple H and company officials are instead focused on King and Queen of the Ring, Clash at the Castle Scotland, and Money in the Bank.\n\nStill, tickets are on sale for SummerSlam 2024, and many fans are wondering what bouts we could see. The show could be home to some pretty epic title rematches. This article will take a look at a handful of potential championship bouts that we could see once again.\n\nBelow are four title rematches that must happen at WWE SummerSlam:\n\n#4. Drew McIntyre could come for his rematch\n\nDrew McIntyre had a mixed WrestleMania 40. The Scottish Warrior started Night Two of The Show of Shows by defeating Seth Rollins for the World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nUnfortunately, Drew's ego got the better of him. He taunted CM Punk, who was sitting on the commentary desk, with his newly won title. The Straight Edge Superstar proceeded to attack him, which then allowed Damian Priest to cash in his Money in the Bank briefcase and capture the World Title.\n\nThe Scottish Psychopath's reign lasted for just five minutes and 46 seconds. It no doubt eats him up inside. If Priest is still the World Heavyweight Champion come SummerSlam, perhaps the two can clash in a proper match this time around.\n\n#3. Becky Lynch could defend against Rhea Ripley\n\nBecky Lynch is the new Women's World Champion. She won the prestigious title by standing tall in a Women's Battle Royal held on a recent edition of Monday Night RAW. Sadly, she didn't dethrone a champion to win the belt.\n\nThe former champion, Rhea Ripley, had to vacate the title. She suffered an injury during a backstage fight with Liv Morgan and will remain out of action for the time being. Still, she'll be back on WWE television sooner or later, and it could happen at SummerSlam.\n\nIf Rhea is back by SummerSlam, she will immediately target The Man. The Eradicator managed to defeat Lynch on Night One of WrestleMania XL, so she'd likely believe that she could do it again. The two put on a great match, so fans would certainly like to see which one stands tall in round two.\n\n#2. Bayley and Naomi could clash over the WWE Women's Championship\n\nBayley is the WWE Women's Champion. After years of struggling to get back to the top of the company, she won the 2024 Women's Royal Rumble Match and then dethroned IYO SKY on The Grandest Stage of Them All last month.\n\nThe Role Model defended her title against Naomi on a recent episode of WWE Friday Night SmackDown. However, Tiffany Stratton showed up and laid both women out. This led to a Triple Threat Match at Backlash France last weekend.\n\nWhile Bayley ultimately retained her title in France, Naomi still hasn't gotten a fair one-on-one match. This could change at SummerSlam. Two of the biggest stars in the women's division clashing at a massive event would just make sense. Maybe Nick Aldis can make sure nobody interferes to keep it fair.\n\n#1. Roman Reigns may challenge Cody Rhodes one more time\n\nRoman Reigns is arguably the biggest star WWE has had in a decade. His stellar, multi-year reign as world champion stands out as one of the best in history. It is also the longest since the 1980s.\n\nHis reign came to an end at The Show of Shows last month, thanks to Cody Rhodes. The American Nightmare battled The Tribal Chief for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship at WrestleMania XL. In the end, Rhodes defeated Reigns to win the prized gold.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean the story between the two is over. Both Roman and Cody now have a major win over each other at the biggest event of the year. A rematch between the two at The Biggest Party of The Summer would make a lot of sense and would drive fans to the Browns Stadium.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Patrick Mahomes hands Super Bowl championship rings to Logan Paul in exciting WWE cameo\n\nWWE SummerSlam promises to be one of the most electric events to come to Cleveland this summer as it heads to the Cleveland Browns Stadium. But it would be one of the events of the year throughout the United States if a mooted clash between the Paul brothers and Kelces was agreed, according to one professional wrestler.\n\nThe Ohio city was home to Logan and Jake Paul when they were growing up before they became YouTubers. They then took their passion for fighting into the combat world, with Jake now a reputable boxer and Logan a bonafide member of the WWE clan.\n\nAnd those who follow the NFL will be familiar with the Kelce name, with Travis, 34, a three-time Super Bowl winner for the Kansas City Chiefs and Jason, 36, a recently retired Philadelphia Eagles icon.\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of the two pairs going against each other in a tag-team match, Johnny Gargano was keen on the idea, describing it as a \"box office\" clash.\n\n\"Yeah, that'd be big. You never know,\" Gargano told Fox News Digital with a laugh. \"Look, it's in Cleveland Browns Stadium, I will say.\n\n\"There are members of the Cleveland Browns roster that are wrestling fans. I'll mention David Njoku especially. I know Myles Garrett's done a Shawn Michaels pose a few times as well. I would not rule out any Cleveland Browns being in attendance that night.\n\n\"But Paul brothers versus Kelce brothers, that is definitely box office. Big headlines. You never know.\"\n\nJason Kelce's cameo at WrestleMania XL in Philadelphia was so impressive that WWE bosses want him to take part in future events, with Travis along for the ride.\n\nHowever, it is not yet known if the retired star is keen on fighting again, having featured with Eagles right tackle Lane Johnson.\n\n\"The WWE loved having Jason and Lane be a part of WrestleMania,' a source told DailyMail.com in April. \"The WWE is always at the cusp of what is hot in entertainment and pop culture and to have a Philly legend like Jason at their fingertips to be a part of the show was a no-brainer.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

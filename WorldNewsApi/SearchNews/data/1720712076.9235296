{"id": 231930630, "title": "Can US and China overcome mutual mistrust to agree rules on military use of artificial intelligence?", "text": "The United States and China will struggle to work together on regulating the military use of artificial intelligence because of a lack of trust and their race for supremacy in the field, analysts have warned. Military AI was not among the topics discussed during the first face-to-face meeting between China\u2019s defence minister Dong Jun and his US counterpart Lloyd Austin on the sidelines of the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore this month. Some observers said there may have been more \u201cpressing\u201d issues to discuss, such as Taiwan and the South China Sea, but there is growing international concern regarding the risks of military AI, which both countries are trying to integrate with their armed forces. \u201cThe US is applying artificial intelligence to weapons systems as quickly and extensively as possible. This brings more risks to the world,\u201d a senior officer with the People\u2019s Liberation Army said during the security conference in Singapore, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \u201cAnd what are the consequences if the US uses artificial intelligence in nuclear weapon systems? This should attract the attention of the world.\u201d The PLA officer also outlined Beijing\u2019s efforts to manage the risks posed by the technology through the United Nations, as well as through Beijing\u2019s own proposals in the Global AI Governance Initiative launched last year. The United States has also attempted to give a lead through a political declaration on the responsible military use of AI and autonomy, joined by more than 50 countries, which did not include China. The technology has already been used on the battlefield in the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine. Zhao Tong, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace\u2019s nuclear policy programme, said the US and China had to overcome a series of obstacles to address the issue, but \u201cthe fundamental obstacle is this increasingly competitive bilateral relationship\u201d. The two countries held their first talks on AI in early May in Geneva, where US officials raised concerns about China\u2019s \u201cmisuse of AI\u201d while Beijing rebuked Washington over its \u201crestrictions and suppression\u201d. Zhao said Beijing is particularly hesitant to limit its development of military AI because of its potential uses in any future confrontation with Washington. He added that the US-led declaration has \u201climited appeal\u201d in China in line with its broader objections to what it sees as Western constructs such as the rules-based international order. In early May, US State Department arms control official Paul Dean said in an online briefing that the US had made a very \u201cclear and strong\u201d commitment that only humans, and never artificial intelligence, would make decisions on deploying nuclear weapons. He also called on China and Russia to make a similar statement. The two sides so far are not known to have held any specific talks on the military uses of AI, although the broader risks from the technology came up in the talks in Geneva, which were not attended by military representatives. Sam Bresnick, a research fellow at Georgetown\u2019s Centre for Security and Emerging Technology said: \u201cThough military AI is certainly an important topic, it\u2019s a new addition to an already robust suite of US-China security issues, some of which appear more pressing than others.\u201d He said the barriers to an agreement on regulating the military use of AI include \u201cthe lack of bilateral trust\u201d and \u201cconcerns about revealing information about their capabilities... or the desire not to limit the development and deployment of AI-enabled military systems just as the related technologies appear to be developing more quickly\u201d. Senior Colonel Zhu Qichao, the deputy director of the National Defence Science and Technology Strategic Research think tank at the National University of Defence Technology, recently accused the US in being \u201ctwo-faced\u201d about discussing AI. He told the nationalist newspaper Global Times that it was only seeking discussions on the topic with China to learn more about its capabilities. Admiral Rob Bauer, chairman of Nato\u2019s military committee, told a panel discussion at the Shangri-La forum: \u201cI am deeply concerned about the unrestricted use of new technologies on the battlefield...And as technology is increasing our ability to destroy, our ability to regulate is rapidly decreasing.\u201d After two world wars, a worldwide belief arose that great power struggle should never again be fought on the battlefield and that weapon systems needed to be regulated and controlled, he said. \u201cIf the tectonic plates of power are shifting and the world is split up into several parallel systems with different sets of rules, can they coexist?,\u201d he added.", "summary": "The topic was not discussed when the two countries\u2019 defence chiefs met despite increasing concerns about the risk the technology poses.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3265960/can-us-and-china-overcome-mutual-mistrust-agree-rules-military-use-artificial-intelligence", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/06/09/26f3fd31-2705-42a4-b298-3f85110f73fb_8dba925e.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:01:08", "author": "Amber Wang", "authors": ["Amber Wang"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": -0.061}

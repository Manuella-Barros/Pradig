He received the backing of the rest of rail labor, several key regulators and a number of the railroad's customers. Ancora had argued that Norfolk Southern should implement the industry standard Precision Scheduled Railroading operating model that is designed to minimize the number of workers, locomotives and railcars a railroad needs. The Precision Scheduled Railroad operating model relies on running fewer, longer trains on a tighter schedule and switching cars between trains less often to streamline operations. Shaw had argued that running the railroad too lean would jeopardize the improvements in safety and service Norfolk Southern has seen since its disastrous February 2023 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. Rail unions have said they believe Precision Scheduled Railroading has made the industry more dangerous and derailments more likely because inspections are so rushed and preventative maintenance may be neglected. For now, Shaw and the Chief Operating Officer he just hired in March, John Orr, will have more time to prove their strategy will work. But if they don't bring Norfolk Southern's profit margins in line with the rest of the industry their jobs could still be in jeopardy. Ancora wanted to hire former UPS Chief Operating Officer Jim Barber to be the railroad's next CEO and former CSX railroad operating chief Jaimie Boychuk as the chief operating officer. The investors had projected their plan would cut more than $800 million in expenses in the first year and another $275 million by the end of three years. Ancora said say they didn't plan layoffs, but wanted to use attrition to eliminate about 1,500 jobs over time. Norfolk Southern has said it's own plan to make the railroad more efficient would generate about $400 million in cost savings over two years and improve its profit margin. But analysts have said its profits might still lag behind the other major freight railroads because they are all working to get more efficient too. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below. Norfolk Southern shareholders will decide Thursday morning whether to back an activist investor's bid to take over the railroad's board and replace management. Ancora Holdings picked up significant support during the campaign from major investors like EdgePoint Investment Group, two major rail unions and some customers. But the rest of rail labor, several key regulators and a number of other customers backed management. If all seven of Ancora's nominees are elected, that would give them the votes they need to move forward with their plan to fire the CEO and overhaul the operations of the railroad, which has been in the spotlight since its disastrous February 2023 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. If shareholders only support some of their board candidates, then Ancora won't be able to make sweeping changes right away. The railroad and Ancora disagree over whether CEO Alan Shaw's strategy of keeping more workers on hand during a downturn to be ready to handle the eventual rebound is the best way to run Norfolk Southern and whether he is the best man to lead the railroad. Ancora's CEO candidate, Jim Barber, who was formerly UPS' chief operating officer, has said keeping more workers on hand during slower times is wasteful. That's why Ancora wants to implement the industry standard Precision Scheduled Railroading that is designed to minimize the number of workers, locomotives and railcars a railroad needs. Ancora's plan would rely on running fewer, longer trains on a tighter schedule and switching cars between trains less often to streamline operations. Shaw argued that running the railroad too lean would jeopardize the improvements in safety and service Norfolk Southern has seen since the derailment. Rail unions have said they believe Precision Scheduled Railroading has made the industry more dangerous and derailments more likely because inspections are so rushed and preventative maintenance may be neglected. If Ancora succeeds in getting all seven of its nominees elected, it will have the power to fire Shaw and his new chief operating officer John Orr, who he just hired in March after paying another railroad $25 million to get permission. Ancora wants to install Barber as CEO and hire former CSX railroad operations chief Jaimie Boychuk to be Norfolk Southern's chief operating officer. Ancora has projected that it will be able to cut more than $800 million in expenses in the first year and another $275 million by the end of three years. The investors say they don't plan layoffs, but want to use attrition to eliminate about 1,500 jobs over time. Norfolk Southern has said its own plan to make the railroad more efficient would generate about $400 million in cost savings over two years and improve its profit margin. Analysts have questioned whether Norfolk Southern will be able to catch up to the other major freight railroads, which are all working to get more efficient too. If Ancora doesn't get all of its directors elected, the investors will likely be able to put more pressure on Shaw to deliver results.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@medicinehatnews.com", "name": "Canadian Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Southern_Railway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norfolk Southern Railway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derailment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Derailment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conway, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Conway, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotive", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Locomotive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief operating officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Palestine,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "East Palestine, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Palestine, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Proxy voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railcar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Railcar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Profit margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Orr_(bishop)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Orr (bishop)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Parcel_Service", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Parcel Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSX_Transportation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CSX Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_freight_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rail freight transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wedding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Rail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Rail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/Rail-fanning_and_Train-spotting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/Rail-fanning and Train-spotting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://medicinehatnews.com/wp-content/uploads/cp/20240509030512-663c7748167b340b87534754jpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547002", "eventUri": "eng-9547002", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-06-", "textStart": 90, "textEnd": 97}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

The key support Ancora picked up from major investors, two major rail unions and proxy advisory firms wasn't enough to persuade shareholders to elect Ancora's entire slate.\n\nAncora executive Jim Chadwick blamed passive investors for failing to support the investors' nominees. Chadwick promised to hold CEO Alan Shaw accountable and keep fighting to improve the railroad.\n\n''For the passive investors: If anything should go wrong here and there's another derailment and people die, this is on you,'' Chadwick said. ''You ignored the recommendation of the proxy advisors, the unions, the largest customer of the company. You gave us literally no support and we still won three board seats without you. What happens at Norfolk Southern now is on your firms and your conscience.''\n\nThe Norfolk Southern board members voted out included Chair Amy Miles.\n\nNorfolk Southern's stock price, which soared after Ancora announced its campaign to oust Shaw, immediately fell after the results of the vote were announced and finished Thursday down 2.5% at $226.33.\n\nShaw had argued that Ancora's plan would cut the railroad too deep and jeopardize the improvements in safety and service Norfolk Southern has made since its disastrous February 2023 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.\n\nShaw's plan calls for keeping more workers on hand during a downturn to make sure the railroad is prepared to handle the eventual rebound in shipments once the economy recovers and continuing to invest in safety improvements to prevent derailments. He received the backing of the rest of rail labor, several key regulators and a number of the railroad's customers.\n\n''Norfolk Southern has persevered through several challenges over the last year. We have met every challenge and never lost sight of where we are taking our powerful franchise,'' Shaw said. ''We are keeping our promises and delivering tangible results, and there is more to do.''\n\nAncora had argued that Norfolk Southern should implement the industry standard Precision Scheduled Railroading operating model that is designed to minimize the number of workers, locomotives and railcars a railroad needs.\n\nThe Precision Scheduled Railroad operating model relies on running fewer, longer trains on a tighter schedule and switching cars between trains less often to streamline operations.\n\nRail unions have said they believe Precision Scheduled Railroading has made the industry more dangerous and derailments more likely because inspections are so rushed and preventative maintenance may be neglected.\n\nSo the unions that backed Shaw celebrated shareholders' decision to turn back this attack from ''corporate raiders'' that would have put pressure on all the major railroads to double down on dangerous cost cuts.\n\n'Today all railroaders can be assured that the progress they have witnessed in their quality of life, and the security they and their families count on from their paychecks are no longer at dire risk,\" said Jeremy Ferguson, president of the SMART-TD union that represents conductors and is the single largest rail union.\n\nThe Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen union that backed Ancora encouraged Shaw to keep improving safety and consider adopting some of the proposals the investors made to expand the railroad's pilot program to let workers use an anonymous federal safety hotline to report concerns and abandon all talk of trying to cut train crews down to one person.\n\nThe leaders of the BLET union on Norfolk Southern -- Dewayne Dehart, Jerry Sturdivant and Scott Bunten -- said they were alarmed when Shaw said this spring that he would also implement a version of Precision Scheduled Railroading.\n\n''Alan Shaw and his team showed real leadership after the East Palestine disaster and made major moves to make the railroad safer and more competitive,\" the BLET union officials said. ''However, changes in his team and strategy in recent weeks left many stakeholders and shareholders feeling uncertain about the railroad's future direction.''\n\nFor now, Shaw and the chief operating officer he just hired in March, John Orr, will have more time to prove their strategy will work. NS paid CPKC railroad $25 million to get permission to hire Orr. But if they don't bring Norfolk Southern's profit margins in line with the rest of the industry, their jobs could still be in jeopardy.\n\n''Your CEO has missed earnings estimates for six quarters in a row and destroyed a town in our own state,'' said Chadwick, whose firm is based in Ohio. ''And if this underperformance continues, we will hold you accountable. But we will work with you for the mutual benefit of all stakeholders.''\n\nEdward Jones analyst Jeff Windau said it's clear Ancora is going to keep up the pressure on Shaw, and if results don't improve then the investors may nominate additional directors next year to try to take control of the board.\n\nYale University management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld said Ancora will have an inconsequential minority on the board that won't be able to push through major changes. He noted Ancora could have saved millions of dollars that it spent on the proxy campaign if it had just accepted a settlement the railroad offered weeks ago that would have given the investors three seats on the board.\n\nAncora had projected their plan would cut more than $800 million in expenses in the first year and another $275 million by the end of three years. Ancora said it didn't plan layoffs, but wanted to use attrition to eliminate about 1,500 jobs over time.\n\nNorfolk Southern has said its own plan to make the railroad more efficient will generate about $400 million in cost savings over two years and improve its profit margin.

The key support Ancora picked up from major investors, two major rail unions and proxy advisory firms wasn't enough to persuade shareholders to elect Ancora's entire slate.\n\nAncora's Jim Chadwick blamed passive investors for failing to support the investors' nominees. Chadwick promised to hold CEO Alan Shaw accountable and keep fighting to improve the railroad.\n\n\"For the passive investors. If anything should go wrong here and there's another derailment and people die, this is on you,\" Chadwick said. \"You ignored the recommendation of the proxy advisors, the unions, the largest customer of the company. You gave us literally no support and we still won three board seats without you. What happens at Norfolk Southern now is on your firms and your conscience.\"\n\nThe board members voted out included Chair Amy Miles.\n\nNorfolk Southern's stock price, which soared after Ancora announced its campaign to oust Shaw, immediately fell after the results of the vote were announced. It was trading down nearly 4% at $223.43 Thursday morning.\n\nShaw had argued that Ancora's plan would cut the railroad too deep and jeopardize the improvements in safety and service Norfolk Southern has seen since its disastrous February 2023 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.\n\nShaw's plan calls for keeping more workers on hand during a downturn to make sure the railroad is prepared to handle the eventual rebound in shipments once the economy recovers and continuing to invest in safety improvements to prevent derailments. He received the backing of the rest of rail labor, several key regulators and a number of the railroad's customers.\n\n\"Norfolk Southern has persevered through several challenges over the last year. We have met every challenge and never lost sight of where we are taking our powerful franchise,\" Shaw said. \"We are keeping our promises and delivering tangible results, and there is more to do.\"\n\nAncora had argued that Norfolk Southern should implement the industry standard Precision Scheduled Railroading operating model that is designed to minimize the number of workers, locomotives and railcars a railroad needs.\n\nThe Precision Scheduled Railroad operating model relies on running fewer, longer trains on a tighter schedule and switching cars between trains less often to streamline operations. Shaw had argued that running the railroad too lean would jeopardize the improvements in safety and service Norfolk Southern has seen since its disastrous February 2023 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.\n\nRail unions have said they believe Precision Scheduled Railroading has made the industry more dangerous and derailments more likely because inspections are so rushed and preventative maintenance may be neglected.\n\nFor now, Shaw and the Chief Operating Officer he just hired in March, John Orr, will have more time to prove their strategy will work. NS paid CPKC railroad $25 million to get permission to hire Orr. But if they don't bring Norfolk Southern's profit margins in line with the rest of the industry, their jobs could still be in jeopardy.\n\n\"Your CEO has missed earnings estimates for six quarters in a row and destroyed a town in our own state,\" said Chadwick, whose firm is based in Ohio. \"And if this underperformance continues, we will hold you accountable. But we will work with you for the mutual benefit of all stakeholders.\"\n\nAncora wanted to hire former UPS Chief Operating Officer Jim Barber to be the railroad's next CEO and former CSX railroad operating chief Jaimie Boychuk as the chief operating officer. Barber has said keeping more workers on hand during slower times is wasteful and compared it to UPS keeping all its seasonal workers it hires for the holiday season on the payroll year round.\n\nThe investors had projected their plan would cut more than $800 million in expenses in the first year and another $275 million by the end of three years. Ancora said say they didn't plan layoffs, but wanted to use attrition to eliminate about 1,500 jobs over time.\n\nNorfolk Southern has said it's own plan to make the railroad more efficient would generate about $400 million in cost savings over two years and improve its profit margin.

Its financial performance has suffered.\n\nA series of other Norfolk Southern accidents also led to heightened concerns about a safety crisis and prompted the National Transportation Safety Board to launch a special probe into the company's safety culture.\n\nNorfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw last year pledged to \"rebuild our safety culture from the ground up.\" He has also led a strategy to improve the railroad's operations and address service problems.\n\nThe NTSB's final findings on the East Palestine wreck are scheduled for a June 25 meeting in Ohio.\n\nWhat is Ancora Holdings Group?\n\nAncora is the activist investor firm that has outlined a detailed proposal to replace the majority of Norfolk Southern's board, appoint its own picks for CEO and chief operating officer and change the way the company operates.\n\nOhio-based Ancora is an investment firm that owns an equity stake in Norfolk Southern, and offers investment advisory, wealth management, retirement plan and insurance services to clients. It also calls itself \"a long-term supporter of union labor.\"\n\nThe company's CEO, Fred DiSanto, is a former executive vice president of Fifth Third Bank's investment advisers division, who is on multiple boards, including steelmaker Ampco-Pittsburgh Corp. and manufacturing firm The Eastern Company.\n\nAncora also has a group of professional firms advising it in its Norfolk Southern campaign, including proxy solicitor D.F. King & Co., communications and strategy adviser Longacre Square Partners, and legal adviser Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.\n\nWhat is Ancora's proposal?\n\nAncora wants to replace seven of Norfolk Southern's 13 board members with its own picks.\n\nIt also proposes to make former UPS executive Jim Barber the railroad's CEO, and wants to install former CSX executive Jamie Boychuk as chief operating officer.\n\nAncora says its leadership picks can improve Norfolk Southern's service, safety and long-term value.\n\n\"Norfolk Southern has good bones, structure. It just needs to be stripped down to the studs and we need to rebuild this thing,\" Boychuk said during a town hall for shareholders.\n\nAncora's board picks include John Kasich, former Republican Ohio governor; Sameh Fahmy, a former Kansas City Southern railroad executive; and William Clyburn Jr., a Democrat and former vice-chair of the U.S. Surface Transportation Board.\n\nOther proposed board members include Betsy Atkins, founder of venture capital firm Baja Corp.; Gilbert Lamphere, chairman of MidRail Corp.; Allison Landry, a former Credit Suisse analyst of railroads and transportation companies; and Barber.\n\nDiSanto was introduced to Barber through a golfing buddy.\n\n\"He said, have you ever talked to Jim Barber,\" DiSanto said in an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \"Got on the phone, and I tell you, we were thoroughly impressed. ... I got to know him extremely well over the last year and a half.\"\n\nHow has Norfolk Southern responded?\n\nUnder pressure from Ancora's proposal, Norfolk Southern has taken its own steps for reform, including replacing its chief operating officer.\n\nThe railroad in March announced it was replacing its COO Paul Duncan with John Orr, who was chief transformation officer at Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC).\n\nThe appointment of Orr as COO cost Norfolk Southern $35 million, a recent filing said. That includes $25 million Norfolk Southern previously said it had agreed to pay CPKC for a waiver of Orr's noncompete provisions and other \"financial and commercial considerations.\"\n\nNorfolk Southern also proposed to add two new independent directors to its board: Richard Anderson, former CEO of Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines and Amtrak; and Mary Kathryn \"Heidi\" Heitkamp, a former Democratic U.S. Senator from North Dakota.\n\nThe company is also on a path to reduce its total head count by 2% by the end of the year.\n\nNorfolk Southern has launched its own vigorous campaign, advocating for its strategy and asking for shareholders' votes ahead at the railroad's annual meeting. The company disclosed that it recorded $21 million in costs associated with shareholder advisory matters in the first quarter.\n\nWhat are others saying?\n\nAncora has won some support from unions and shareholder advisory firms. Others have criticized its plan.\n\nA major union that represents some of Norfolk Southern's workforce, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) division of the Teamsters union, has switched allegiance from management to Ancora. The Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees Division of the Teamsters has also voiced its support for Ancora's plan.\n\nTogether, the two labor groups make up about half the unionized workers at Norfolk Southern, according to Ancora.\n\nAnother major union at Norfolk Southern, the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers Transportation Division (SMART-TD), is opposed to a takeover by Ancora and accused BLET of \"deciding to buy in with a hedge fund.\"\n\nThe AFL-CIO has also urged Norfolk Southern shareholders to reject Ancora's takeover, which it said could derail safety and service improvements underway.\n\nShareholder advisory firms have lent their support to at least some of Ancora's proposed board members.\n\nBut Ancora's plan has also drawn deep skepticism.\n\nIn published remarks last week, the retiring chairman of the Surface Transportation Board, the economic regulator of the railroads, warned of \"serious concerns\" about Ancora's plans.\n\n\"There is little doubt in my mind that if Ancora succeeds in taking control of NS and strips it down as it promises, service will suffer a significant deterioration,\" said Martin Oberman, who is stepping down from his role later this month.\n\n\u00a92024 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

The key support Ancora picked up from major investors, two major rail unions and proxy advisory firms wasn't enough to persuade shareholders to elect Ancora's entire slate.\n\nAncora's Jim Chadwick blamed passive investors for failing to support the investors' nominees. Chadwick promised to hold CEO Alan Shaw accountable and keep fighting to improve the railroad.\n\n\"For the passive investors. If anything should go wrong here and there's another derailment and people die, this is on you,\" Chadwick said. \"You ignored the recommendation of the proxy advisors, the unions, the largest customer of the company. You gave us literally no support and we still won three board seats without you. What happens at Norfolk Southern now is on your firms and your conscience.\"\n\nThe board members voted out included Chair Amy Miles.\n\nNorfolk Southern's stock price, which soared after Ancora announced its campaign to oust Shaw, immediately fell after the results of the vote were announced. It was trading down nearly 4% at $223.43 Thursday morning.\n\nShaw had argued that Ancora's plan would cut the railroad too deep and jeopardize the improvements in safety and service Norfolk Southern has seen since its disastrous February 2023 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.\n\nShaw's plan calls for keeping more workers on hand during a downturn to make sure the railroad is prepared to handle the eventual rebound in shipments once the economy recovers and continuing to invest in safety improvements to prevent derailments. He received the backing of the rest of rail labor, several key regulators and a number of the railroad's customers.\n\n\"Norfolk Southern has persevered through several challenges over the last year. We have met every challenge and never lost sight of where we are taking our powerful franchise,\" Shaw said. \"We are keeping our promises and delivering tangible results, and there is more to do.\"\n\nAncora had argued that Norfolk Southern should implement the industry standard Precision Scheduled Railroading operating model that is designed to minimize the number of workers, locomotives and railcars a railroad needs.\n\nThe Precision Scheduled Railroad operating model relies on running fewer, longer trains on a tighter schedule and switching cars between trains less often to streamline operations. Shaw had argued that running the railroad too lean would jeopardize the improvements in safety and service Norfolk Southern has seen since its disastrous February 2023 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.\n\nRail unions have said they believe Precision Scheduled Railroading has made the industry more dangerous and derailments more likely because inspections are so rushed and preventative maintenance may be neglected.\n\nFor now, Shaw and the Chief Operating Officer he just hired in March, John Orr, will have more time to prove their strategy will work. NS paid CPKC railroad $25 million to get permission to hire Orr. But if they don't bring Norfolk Southern's profit margins in line with the rest of the industry, their jobs could still be in jeopardy.\n\n\"Your CEO has missed earnings estimates for six quarters in a row and destroyed a town in our own state,\" said Chadwick, whose firm is based in Ohio. \"And if this underperformance continues, we will hold you accountable. But we will work with you for the mutual benefit of all stakeholders.\"\n\nAncora wanted to hire former UPS Chief Operating Officer Jim Barber to be the railroad's next CEO and former CSX railroad operating chief Jaimie Boychuk as the chief operating officer.

(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File)Norfolk Southern's CEO will be under more pressure to improve profits after the railroad's shareholders voted Thursday to elect three of the board members an activist investor nominated, but he won't be fired right away. Ancora Holdings had nominated seven directors as part of a bid to take control of the railroad's 13-member board and overhaul its operations. The key support Ancora picked up from major investors, two major rail unions and proxy advisory firms wasn't enough to persuade shareholders to elect Ancora's entire slate. Ancora's Jim Chadwick blamed passive investors for failing to support the investors' nominees. Chadwick promised to hold CEO Alan Shaw accountable and keep fighting to improve the railroad. \"For the passive investors. If anything should go wrong here and there's another derailment and people die, this is on you,\"\u009d Chadwick said. \"You ignored the recommendation of the proxy advisors, the unions, the largest customer of the company. You gave us literally no support and we still won three board seats without you. What happens at Norfolk Southern now is on your firms and your conscience.\"\u009d The board members voted out included Chair Amy Miles. Norfolk Southern's stock price, which soared after Ancora announced its campaign to oust Shaw, immediately fell after the results of the vote were announced. It was trading down nearly 4% at $223.43 Thursday morning. Shaw had argued that Ancora's plan would cut the railroad too deep and jeopardize the improvements in safety and service Norfolk Southern has seen since its disastrous February 2023 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. Shaw's plan calls for keeping more workers on hand during a downturn to make sure the railroad is prepared to handle the eventual rebound in shipments once the economy recovers and continuing to invest in safety improvements to prevent derailments. He received the backing of the rest of rail labor, several key regulators and a number of the railroad's customers. \"Norfolk Southern has persevered through several challenges over the last year. We have met every challenge and never lost sight of where we are taking our powerful franchise,\"\u009d Shaw said. \"We are keeping our promises and delivering tangible results, and there is more to do.\"\u009d Ancora had argued that Norfolk Southern should implement the industry standard Precision Scheduled Railroading operating model that is designed to minimize the number of workers, locomotives and railcars a railroad needs. The Precision Scheduled Railroad operating model relies on running fewer, longer trains on a tighter schedule and switching cars between trains less often to streamline operations. Shaw had argued that running the railroad too lean would jeopardize the improvements in safety and service Norfolk Southern has seen since its disastrous February 2023 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. Rail unions have said they believe Precision Scheduled Railroading has made the industry more dangerous and derailments more likely because inspections are so rushed and preventative maintenance may be neglected. For now, Shaw and the Chief Operating Officer he just hired in March, John Orr, will have more time to prove their strategy will work. NS paid CPKC railroad $25 million to get permission to hire Orr. But if they don't bring Norfolk Southern's profit margins in line with the rest of the industry, their jobs could still be in jeopardy. \"Your CEO has missed earnings estimates for six quarters in a row and destroyed a town in our own state,\"\u009d said Chadwick, whose firm is based in Ohio. \"And if this underperformance continues, we will hold you accountable. But we will work with you for the mutual benefit of all stakeholders.\"\u009d Ancora wanted to hire former UPS Chief Operating Officer Jim Barber to be the railroad's next CEO and former CSX railroad operating chief Jaimie Boychuk as the chief operating officer. Barber has said keeping more workers on hand during slower times is wasteful and compared it to UPS keeping all its seasonal workers it hires for the holiday season on the payroll year round. The investors had projected their plan would cut more than $800 million in expenses in the first year and another $275 million by the end of three years. Ancora said say they didn't plan layoffs, but wanted to use attrition to eliminate about 1,500 jobs over time. Norfolk Southern has said it's own plan to make the railroad more efficient would generate about $400 million in cost savings over two years and improve its profit margin.

Ancora also wants former UPS executive Jim Barber as the CEO of the Atlanta-based railroad, and wants to install a former CSX executive as chief operating officer.\n\nOn Thursday, shareholders will decide the fate of Norfolk Southern's leadership at the company's virtual annual meeting.\n\nSince the February 2023 fiery derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, of a Norfolk Southern train carrying hazardous materials, the railroad has been beleaguered by public criticism and well over $1 billion in charges related to the wreck. Last month, the company reported a steep decline in first quarter profit, after tallying hundreds of millions of dollars of expenses in the fallout from the derailment.\n\nNorfolk Southern management and Ancora and its allies have bombarded investors and analysts with last minute appeals for support, turning this into a sort of corporate version of a presidential campaign. And like an unpredictable election season, there's already been an October surprise.\n\nAmajor union that represents some of Norfolk Southern's workforce, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) division of the Teamsters union, has switched allegiancefrom management to Ancora.\n\nIn February, after Ohio-based Ancora launched its takeover bid, BLET's general chairmen called Ancora's proposal \"reckless,\" \"bad for investors\" and \"likely to lead to more train wrecks.\"\n\nBut in late April, Ancora announced it had won the support of BLET, along with the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees Division of the Teamsters. Together, the two labor groups make up about half of the unionized workers at Norfolk Southern, according to Ancora.\n\nNorfolk Southern had roughly 20,000 employees, and about 80% of them are unionized.\n\nAnother major union at Norfolk Southern, the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers Transportation Division (SMART-TD), is opposed to a takeover by Ancora and accused BLET of \"deciding to buy in with a hedge fund.\"\n\nSMART-TD contendsthe BLET union, by reaching a memorandum of understanding with Ancora to get better work rules, severance, representation on committees and other terms, \"decided to sell out to catch up.\"\n\nThe AFL-CIO has also urged Norfolk Southern shareholders to reject Ancora's takeover, which it said could derail safety and service improvements underway.\n\n'Down to the studs'\n\nThe support of some, but not all, unions at Norfolk Southern comes after Jamie Boychuk, the former CSX executive who Ancora wants to install as COO of Norfolk Southern, said during a town hall for shareholders: \"Norfolk Southern has good bones, structure. It just needs to be stripped down to the studs and we need to rebuild this thing.\"\n\nA major Norfolk Southern customer, steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs, has also announced support for Ancora. Other customers have voiced support of Shaw and current management.\n\nWhile unions and customers of Norfolk Southern are not necessarily shareholders that vote on the matter, Jason Seidl, an analyst with investment bank TD Cowen, wrote in a note to investors that their support of Ancora \"has the potential to influence the shareholder vote.\"\n\nNorfolk Southern has mounted a vigorous defense and rolled out some of its own reforms, including the replacement of its chief operating officer with John Orr, who was Canadian Pacific Kansas City's (CPKC) chief transformation officer.\n\nThe appointment of Orr as COO cost Norfolk Southern $35 million, a recent filing said. That includes $25 million Norfolk Southern previously said it had agreed to pay CPKC for a waiver of Orr's noncompete provisions and other \"financial and commercial considerations.\"\n\nThe company is also on a path to reduce its total head count by 2% by the end of the year.\n\nBeyond the unions and investment community, others have spoken out. In published remarks last week, the retiring chairman of the Surface Transportation Board, the economic regulator of the railroads, warned of \"serious concerns\" about Ancora's plans.\n\n\"There is little doubt in my mind that if Ancora succeeds in taking control of NS and strips it down as it promises, service will suffer a significant deterioration,\" said Martin Oberman, who is stepping down from his role later this month.\n\nIn recent days, shareholder advisory firms have lent their support to at least some of Ancora's proposed board members.\n\nAdvisory firm Egan-Jones recommended that shareholders vote for all seven of Ancora's board nominees, saying the East Palestine tragedy and other derailments \"demonstrate the lack of adequate operational plans for emergency operations that led to value destruction and loss of public confidence and trust.\"\n\nGlass Lewis, another shareholder advisory group, said\"Ancora has publicly laid out a fairly detailed, three-year plan\" focused on precision scheduled railroading principles, to cut costs and increase efficiency, improve safety and service. It said \"Ancora has presented a compelling case for supporting a substantial overhaul\" of Norfolk Southern's leadership, and supported six of Ancora's seven nominees to the 13-member board.\n\nInstitutional Shareholder Services, another advisory firm, recommended shareholders support five of Ancora's seven nominees, but did not support the replacement of Shaw, the CEO.\n\n\"Although there is a clear case for change, (Norfolk Southern)is not a broken company, and operational performance does not reflect a situation so dire as to suggest that a change in board control and an accompanying overhaul of strategy and leadership is immediately required,\" ISS wrote in its report.\n\nNorfolk Southern called ISS's recommendation \"a clear endorsement of the company's management and strategy,\" noting that it supports a majority of Norfolk Southern's board nominees.\n\n\"ISS's recommendation against (Ancora CEO candidate) Jim Barber is a clear indication that a change in management is not warranted, and further, adding him to the board may create an unfavorable dynamic in the boardroom that would impede the Company's progress and momentum,\" Norfolk Southern said in a statement last week.\n\nMeanwhile, Norfolk Southern and Ancora have inundatedshareholders with filings advocating for their respective strategies and asking for shareholders' votes ahead at the railroad's annual meeting.\n\nNorfolk Southern disclosed that it recorded $21 million in costs associated with shareholder advisory matters in the first quarter.", "source": {"uri":

The key support Ancora picked up from major investors, two major rail unions and proxy advisory firms wasn't enough to persuade shareholders to elect Ancora's entire slate.\n\nAncora's Jim Chadwick blamed passive investors for failing to support the investors' nominees. Chadwick promised to hold CEO Alan Shaw accountable and keep fighting to improve the railroad.\n\n\"For the passive investors. If anything should go wrong here and there's another derailment and people die, this is on you,\" Chadwick said. \"You ignored the recommendation of the proxy advisers, the unions, the largest customer of the company. You gave us literally no support, and we still won three board seats without you. What happens at Norfolk Southern now is on your firms and your conscience.\"\n\nThe board members voted out included Chair Amy Miles.\n\nNorfolk Southern's stock price, which soared after Ancora announced its campaign to oust Shaw, immediately fell after the results of the vote were announced. It was trading down 3% at $224.84 the morning of May 9.\n\nShaw's plan calls for keeping more workers on hand during a downturn to make sure the railroad is prepared to handle the eventual rebound in shipments once the economy recovers and continuing to invest in safety improvements to prevent derailments. He received the backing of the rest of rail labor, several key regulators and a number of the railroad's customers.\n\n\"Norfolk Southern has persevered through several challenges over the last year. We have met every challenge and never lost sight of where we are taking our powerful franchise,\" Shaw said. \"We are keeping our promises and delivering tangible results, and there is more to do.\"\n\nAncora had argued that Norfolk Southern should implement the industry standard Precision Scheduled Railroading operating model that is designed to minimize the number of workers, locomotives and railcars a railroad needs.\n\nRELATED: Norfolk Southern Urges Shareholders to Reject Takeover Plan\n\nThe Precision Scheduled Railroad operating model relies on running fewer, longer trains on a tighter schedule and switching cars between trains less often to streamline operations. Shaw had argued that running the railroad too lean would jeopardize the improvements in safety and service Norfolk Southern has seen since its disastrous February 2023 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.\n\nRail unions have said they believe Precision Scheduled Railroading has made the industry more dangerous and derailments more likely because inspections are so rushed and preventive maintenance may be neglected.\n\nThe Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen union that backed Ancora encouraged Shaw to keep improving safety and consider adopting some of the proposals the investors made to expand the railroad's pilot program to let workers use an anonymous federal safety hotline to report concerns and abandon all talk of trying to reduce the current two-person train crews down to one.\n\nThe leaders of the BLET union on Norfolk Southern -- Dewayne Dehart, Jerry Sturdivant and Scott Bunten -- said they were alarmed when Shaw said this spring that he would also implement a version of Precision Scheduled Railroading and they would call out decisions they deem bad for workers and investors.\n\n\"Alan Shaw and his team showed real leadership after the East Palestine disaster and made major moves to make the railroad safer and more competitive,\" the BLET union officials said. \"However, changes in his team and strategy in recent weeks left many stakeholders and shareholders feeling uncertain about the railroad's future direction.\"\n\nFor now, Shaw and the chief operating officer he just hired in March, John Orr, will have more time to prove their strategy will work. NS paid CPKC railroad $25 million to get permission to hire Orr. But if they don't bring Norfolk Southern's profit margins in line with the rest of the industry, their jobs could still be in jeopardy.\n\n\"Your CEO has missed earnings estimates for six quarters in a row and destroyed a town in our own state,\" said Chadwick, whose firm is based in Ohio. \"And if this underperformance continues, we will hold you accountable. But we will work with you for the mutual benefit of all stakeholders.\"\n\nEdward Jones analyst Jeff Windau said it's clear Ancora is going to keep up the pressure on Shaw, and if results don't improve, then the investors may nominate additional directors next year to try to take control of the board.\n\n\"The spotlight is still going to be there even though this election is over,\" Windau said.\n\nAncora wanted to hire former UPS COO Jim Barber to be the railroad's next CEO and former CSX railroad operating chief Jaimie Boychuk as the chief operating officer. Barber has said keeping more workers on hand during slower times is wasteful and compared it to UPS keeping all its seasonal workers it hires for the holiday season on the payroll year round.\n\nThe investors had projected their plan would cut more than $800 million in expenses in the first year and another $275 million by the end of three years. Ancora said it didn't plan layoffs but wanted to use attrition to eliminate about 1,500 jobs over time.\n\nNorfolk Southern has said its own plan to make the railroad more efficient would generate about $400 million in cost savings over two years and improve its profit margin. But analysts have said its profits might still lag behind the other major freight railroads because they are all working to get more efficient too.", "source": {"uri": "ttnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Transport Topics"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_funk@ttnews.com", "name": "Josh Funk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Proxy voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Southern_Railway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norfolk Southern Railway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derailment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Derailment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activist_shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Activist shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Locomotive_Engineers_and_Trainmen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maritime pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railcar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Railcar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Locomotive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Palestine,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East Palestine, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Palestine, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Pacific_Kansas_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Pacific Kansas City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_freight_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rail freight transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Parcel_Service", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Parcel Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_and_holiday_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christmas and holiday season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSX_Transportation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CSX Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Profit margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief operating officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventspils", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ventspils"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ventspils"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Latvia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Rail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Rail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/Rail-fanning_and_Train-spotting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/Rail-fanning and Train-spotting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.ttnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/600x314_with_tt_orange_bar_overlay/public/2024-05/NS-1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547002", "eventUri": "eng-9547002", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 110, "textEnd": 115, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

Its financial performance has suffered.\n\nA series of other Norfolk Southern accidents also led to heightened concerns about a safety crisis and prompted the National Transportation Safety Board to launch a special probe into the company's safety culture.\n\nNorfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw last year pledged to \"rebuild our safety culture from the ground up.\" He has also led a strategy to improve the railroad's operations and address service problems.\n\nThe NTSB's final findings on the East Palestine wreck are scheduled for a June 25 meeting in Ohio.\n\nWhat is Ancora Holdings Group?\n\nAncora is the activist investor firm that has outlined a detailed proposal to replace the majority of Norfolk Southern's board, appoint its own picks for CEO and chief operating officer and change the way the company operates.\n\nOhio-basedAncora is an investment firm that owns an equity stake in Norfolk Southern, and offers investment advisory, wealth management, retirement plan and insurance services to clients. It also calls itself \"a long-term supporter of union labor.\"\n\nThe company's CEO, Fred DiSanto, is a former executive vice president of Fifth Third Bank's investment advisers division, who is on multipleboards, including steelmaker Ampco-Pittsburgh Corp. and manufacturing firm The Eastern Company.\n\nAncora also has a group of professional firms advising it in its Norfolk Southern campaign, including proxy solicitor D.F. King & Co., communications and strategy adviser Longacre Square Partners, and legal adviser Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.\n\nWhat is Ancora's proposal?\n\nAncora wants to replace seven of Norfolk Southern's 13 board members with its own picks.\n\nIt also proposes to make former UPS executive Jim Barber the railroad's CEO, and wants to install former CSX executive Jamie Boychuk as chief operating officer.\n\nAncora says its leadership picks can improve Norfolk Southern's service, safety and long-term value.\n\n\"Norfolk Southern has good bones, structure. It just needs to be stripped down to the studs and we need to rebuild this thing,\" Boychuk said during a town hall for shareholders.\n\nAncora's board picks include John Kasich, former RepublicanOhio governor; Sameh Fahmy, a former Kansas City Southern railroad executive; and William Clyburn Jr., a Democrat and former vice-chair of the U.S. Surface Transportation Board.\n\nOther proposed board members include Betsy Atkins, founder of venture capital firm Baja Corp.; Gilbert Lamphere, chairman of MidRail Corp.; Allison Landry, a former Credit Suisse analyst of railroads and transportation companies; and Barber.\n\nDiSanto was introduced to Barber through a golfing buddy.\n\n\"He said, have you ever talked to Jim Barber,\" DiSanto said in an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \"Got on the phone, and I tell you, we were thoroughly impressed. ... I got to know him extremely well over the last year and a half.\"\n\nHow has Norfolk Southern responded?\n\nUnder pressure from Ancora's proposal, Norfolk Southern has taken its own steps for reform, including replacing its chief operating officer.\n\nThe railroad in March announced it was replacing its COO Paul Duncan with John Orr, who was chief transformation officer at Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC).\n\nThe appointment of Orr as COO cost Norfolk Southern $35 million, a recent filing said. That includes $25 million Norfolk Southern previously said it had agreed to pay CPKC for a waiver of Orr's noncompete provisions and other \"financial and commercial considerations.\"\n\nNorfolk Southern also proposed to add two new independent directors to its board: Richard Anderson, former CEO of Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines and Amtrak; and Mary Kathryn \"Heidi\" Heitkamp, a former Democratic U.S. Senator from North Dakota.\n\nThe company is also on a path to reduce its total head count by 2% by the end of the year.\n\nNorfolk Southern has launched its own vigorous campaign, advocating for its strategy and asking for shareholders' votes ahead at the railroad's annual meeting. The company disclosed that it recorded $21 million in costs associated with shareholder advisory matters in the first quarter.\n\nWhat are others saying?\n\nAncora has won some support from unions and shareholder advisory firms. Others have criticized its plan.\n\nAmajor union that represents some of Norfolk Southern's workforce, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) division of the Teamsters union, has switched allegiancefrom management to Ancora. The Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees Division of the Teamsters has also voiced its support for Ancora's plan.\n\nTogether, the two labor groups make up about half the unionized workers at Norfolk Southern, according to Ancora.\n\nAnother major union at Norfolk Southern, the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers Transportation Division (SMART-TD), is opposed to a takeover by Ancora and accused BLET of \"deciding to buy in with a hedge fund.\"\n\nThe AFL-CIO has also urged Norfolk Southern shareholders to reject Ancora's takeover, which it said could derail safety and service improvements underway.\n\nShareholder advisory firms have lent their support to at least some of Ancora's proposed board members.\n\nBut Ancora's plan has also drawn deep skepticism.\n\nIn published remarks last week, the retiring chairman of the Surface Transportation Board, the economic regulator of the railroads, warned of \"serious concerns\" about Ancora's plans.\n\n\"There is little doubt in my mind that if Ancora succeeds in taking control of NS and strips it down as it promises, service will suffer a significant deterioration,\" said Martin

The key support Ancora picked up from major investors, two major rail unions and proxy advisory firms wasn't enough to persuade shareholders to elect Ancora's entire slate.\n\nAncora's Jim Chadwick blamed passive investors for failing to support the investors' nominees. Chadwick promised to hold CEO Alan Shaw accountable and keep fighting to improve the railroad.\n\n\"For the passive investors. If anything should go wrong here and there's another derailment and people die, this is on you,\" Chadwick said. \"You ignored the recommendation of the proxy advisors, the unions, the largest customer of the company. You gave us literally no support and we still won three board seats without you. What happens at Norfolk Southern now is on your firms and your conscience.\"\n\nThe board members voted out included Chair Amy Miles.\n\nNorfolk Southern's stock price, which soared after Ancora announced its campaign to oust Shaw, immediately fell after the results of the vote were announced. It was trading down more than 4% at $221.73 Thursday morning.\n\nShaw had argued that Ancora's plan would cut the railroad too deep and jeopardize the improvements in safety and service Norfolk Southern has seen since its disastrous February 2023 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.\n\nShaw's plan calls for keeping more workers on hand during a downturn to make sure the railroad is prepared to handle the eventual rebound in shipments once the economy recovers and continuing to invest in safety improvements to prevent derailments. He received the backing of the rest of rail labor, several key regulators and a number of the railroad's customers.\n\n\"Norfolk Southern has persevered through several challenges over the last year. We have met every challenge and never lost sight of where we are taking our powerful franchise,\" Shaw said. \"We are keeping our promises and delivering tangible results, and there is more to do.\"\n\nAncora had argued that Norfolk Southern should implement the industry standard Precision Scheduled Railroading operating model that is designed to minimize the number of workers, locomotives and railcars a railroad needs.\n\nThe Precision Scheduled Railroad operating model relies on running fewer, longer trains on a tighter schedule and switching cars between trains less often to streamline operations. Shaw had argued that running the railroad too lean would jeopardize the improvements in safety and service Norfolk Southern has seen since its disastrous February 2023 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.\n\nRail unions have said they believe Precision Scheduled Railroading has made the industry more dangerous and derailments more likely because inspections are so rushed and preventative maintenance may be neglected.\n\nFor now, Shaw and the Chief Operating Officer he just hired in March, John Orr, will have more time to prove their strategy will work. NS paid CPKC railroad $25 million to get permission to hire Orr. But if they don't bring Norfolk Southern's profit margins in line with the rest of the industry, their jobs could still be in jeopardy.\n\n\"Your CEO has missed earnings estimates for six quarters in a row and destroyed a town in our own state,\" said Chadwick, whose firm is based in Ohio. \"And if this underperformance continues, we will hold you accountable. But we will work with you for the mutual benefit of all stakeholders.\"\n\nAncora wanted to hire former UPS Chief Operating Officer Jim Barber to be the railroad's next CEO and former CSX railroad operating chief Jaimie Boychuk as the chief operating officer. Barber has said keeping more workers on hand during slower times is wasteful and compared it to UPS keeping all its seasonal workers it hires for the holiday season on the payroll year round.\n\nThe investors had projected their plan would cut more than $800 million in expenses in the first year and another $275 million by the end of three years. Ancora said they didn't plan layoffs, but wanted to use attrition to eliminate about 1,500 jobs over time.\n\nNorfolk Southern has said its own plan to make the railroad more efficient would generate about $400 million in cost savings over two years and improve its profit margin. But analysts have said its profits might still lag behind the other major freight railroads because they are all working to get more efficient too.\n\nPictured at top: Norfolk Southern locomotives are moved through the Conway Terminal in Conway, Pa., on June 17, 2023.

Its financial performance has suffered from the additional expense as the company has spent much attention on responding to the disaster and its aftermath.\n\nOn Thursday, the company's shareholders voted in 10 of Norfolk Southern's 13 proposed board members, and voted out three of the company's nominees, including its board chair Amy Miles.\n\nInstead, shareholders voted in three of activist investor firm Ancora Holdings Group's seven proposed board nominees, placing on the board William Clyburn Jr., a Democrat and former vice-chair of the U.S. Surface Transportation Board; Sameh Fahmy, a former Kansas City Southern railroad executive; and Gilbert Lamphere, chairman of MidRail Corp.\n\nThe results signal shareholders' are showing some dissatisfaction with the company's current management by voting in some of Ancora's proposed board members.\n\nBut management also said the vote -- for most of the company's proposed board slate -- means \"shareholders recognize that positive change is underway at Norfolk Southern.\"\n\n\"Together, we are building a safer, more profitable railroad, closing the margin gap with our peers, and ultimately growing value for our shareholders,\" Norfolk Southern said in a statement after the vote. The company announced results of a preliminary vote count at the meeting, with final results to be tabulated and certified in coming days.\n\nOhio-based Ancora is an investment firm that owns an equity stake in Norfolk Southern, and offers investment advisory, wealth management, retirement plan and insurance services to clients.\n\nAncora wanted to replace seven people on the 13-member board to gain majority control and replace Shaw with former UPS executive Jim Barber as CEO. Ancora also wanted to install former CSX executive Jamie Boychuk as chief operating officer.\n\nAncora had argued that its plans to revamp the railroad would improve its service, safety and long-term value.\n\nShaw said during the meeting that he was \"grateful to our shareholders for their continued valuable feedback. We want you to know that we are listening.\"\n\nAncora's president of its alternatives group, Jim Chadwick, gave a fiery statement during the shareholders meeting, saying: \"This was a referendum for change.\"\n\n\"We intend to keep on fighting,\" he said. \"Our newly elected board candidates will work to repair the strained relationships at Norfolk Southern.\"\n\nChadwick said Shaw \"has missed earnings estimates for six quarters in a row\" and said the railroad has \"destroyed a town in our own state.\"\n\nHe also said he had a message for shareholders who did not support Ancora's proposals.\n\n\"For the passive investors, if anything should go wrong here, and there's another derailment and people die, this is on you. ... What happens at Norfolk Southern now is on your firms and your conscience.\"\n\nShaw took a more conciliatory approach during the meeting, saying: \"We are confident that Norfolk Southern will build a strong and constructive relationship with our new directors.\"\n\nThe new board members nominated by Ancora will be joined by two new members nominated by Norfolk Southern and elected to the board: former Delta Air Lines CEO Richard Anderson and Mary Kathryn \"Heidi\" Heitkamp, a former U.S. senator from North Dakota.\n\nIt's yet to be seen how the shift in the makeup of the board could affect the company's direction in the future.\n\nNorfolk Southern had defended its strategy by saying under Shaw's leadership and its board, it was \"building a more resilient, productive railroad to deliver long-term shareholder value.\"\n\nDuring the meeting, Norfolk Southern fielded questions from shareholders, including one who asked why the company this year hired as its chief operating officer John Orr, who was chief transformation officer at Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC).\n\nThe appointment of Orr as COO as the railroad faced pressure from Ancora's bid for control cost Norfolk Southern $35 million, a recent filing said. That includes $25 million Norfolk Southern previously said it had agreed to pay CPKC for a waiver of Orr's noncompete provisions and other \"financial and commercial considerations.\"\n\nShaw said Orr's \"performance history as a disciplined and thoughtful operator makes him an ideal fit as we look to execute our balanced strategic plan that will deliver top-tier earnings and revenue growth and industry competitive margins.\"\n\nThe Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen union, which represents workers at Norfolk Southern and switched allegiance from management to Ancora before the vote, on Thursday issued a statement from its general chairmen saying: \"It's understandable why shareholders made a split decision.\"\n\n\"Alan Shaw and his team showed real leadership after the East Palestine disaster and made major moves to make the railroad safer and more competitive,\" the union said. \"However, changes in his team and strategy in recent weeks left many stakeholders and shareholders feeling uncertain about the railroad's future direction.\"\n\nInstitutional Shareholder Services (ISS), a shareholder advisory firm, recommended before the vote that shareholders support five of Ancora's seven nominees and voting out Miles as board chair, but did not support the replacement of the company's leaders.\n\nISS in a report cited an \"ongoing failure by the board to prioritize the best interest of shareholders\" and said Miles' leadership of the board \"coincided with many of the concerning developments\" underpinning Ancora's case for change.\n\n\"Although there is a clear case for change, (Norfolk Southern) is not a broken company, and operational performance does not reflect a situation so dire as to suggest that a change in board control and an accompanying overhaul of strategy and leadership is immediately required,\" ISS wrote in its report.\n\n\u00a92024 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

A defeat of current Norfolk Southern management, credited with improving safety practices at the railroad since the February 3, 2023 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, could make management at other railroads reluctant to take steps to improve safety if it means reduced profit margins.\n\nThe fight has split the railroad's unions, who disagree which management team - the current Norfolk Southern leadership or one proposed by activist investor Ancora Holdings - would be best for safety and the railroad's employees.\n\nAncora, which seeks to have its own slate of directors elected and a new CEO and COO put in charge of the railroad, insist current management has proven incapable of running a safe and profitable railroad. It wants to improve profitability at the railroad by greater emphasis on the operating philosphy known as Precision Scheduled Railroading, or PSR, which leads to longer trains making fewer stops at customers' locations to pick-up or drop-off rail cars.\n\nPSR is generally opposed by both rail unions and many rail customers, and Norfolk management appeared to be taking steps away from PSR in the wake of the East Palestine derailment.\n\nNorfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw and his management team received praised by some who, in the past, criticized the railroad's performance, including Amit Bose, administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration, the nation's rail regulator.\n\nIn a letter to Norfolk Southern in February soon after the takeover effort started, Bose praise the railroad instituting a \"confidential close call reporting system\" similar to one in place for decades at the nation's railroads to allow employees to report safety issues without fear of reprisal, as well as increasing staffing and training. He said Shaw's safety efforts \"are important and demonstrate the ability to make progress when railroads make safety a priority.\" And he said that NS was the only Class I railroad to achieve significant reductions in the rate of mainline derailments last year.\n\nHis letter suggested his concerns that that progress could be lost due to the takeover battle.\n\n\"While I recognize NS for the meaningful steps and results seen so far, often in notable contrast to industry peers, I want to emphasize the importance of a durable and lasting path forward that continues to prioritize safety,\" he wrote. \"Any backsliding, as a result of a change in leadership or otherwise, on the safety-oriented path you have laid out and communicated to us will likely attract renewed oversight attention from my office.\"\n\nUnions split on which side should win\n\nAfter initially being united in opposition to the takeover effort, the railroad's unions are now split on the takeover battle.\n\nMost of the unions remain supportive of current CEO Alan Shaw and Norfolk Southern's current board.\n\n\"NS and Shaw have placed a unique focus on establishing a culture that addresses safety concerns that other carriers have not,\" said a letter from Jeremy Ferguson, president of SMART-TD, the union that represents more than 5,000 conductors at the railroad.\n\nThe Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET), which represents more than 3,000 engineers at the railroad, joined the other unions at the railroad in initially endorsing Norfolk management, saying that Ancora's plans for Norfolk would be \"reckless\" and \"likely to lead to more train wrecks.\" It said Ancora's PSR plan \"requires railroads to do more with less which equates to longer trains, deferred maintenance of track and equipment, shorter inspections of rolling stock and a reduction in staffing numbers.\"\n\nAnd it praised the changes that Shaw had made to improve safety since the February 2023 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.\n\n\"Shaw was only on the job for a few months prior to the disaster. Since the derailment last year, NS' CEO has risen to the occasion and, through his leadership, NS has become a safer, more efficient and customer focused company again,\" said Jerry Sturdivant, a BLET union official at Norfolk Southern, back in February.\n\nReversing course\n\nBut the BLET said the changes that Norfolk Southern has made to try to answer Ancora's takeover efforts are taking the railroad in the wrong direction. It is particularly upset with the work of the railroad's new chief operating officer, John Orr, hired in March from Canadian Pacific Kansas City, for a pay package with a target value of $10.3 million.\n\nBLET said that Orr's appointment shows that Norfolk Southern is committed to additional use of PSR, no matter which side wins the the proxy fight. And it said it has received assurances of other safety improvements from Ancora, including dropping all plans to have single-person crews on long-distance trains.\n\nThe current labor contract requires both an engineer and a conductor in the locomotive, and a recent proposed federal rule would codify the requirement. Although that rule has yet to take effect and could be reversed in the future. And the nation's major railroads would still prefer to remove the conductors from the trains, arguing it can be done without reducing safety.\n\n\"Although we initially supported Mr. Shaw and Norfolk Southern's management in this contest, today he leads a different team with an unproven strategy,\" said a statement from three BLET officials at the railroad. \"The ever-changing and inconsistent policies that we have been hearing from the railroad's current leadership in recent weeks forced BLET to take another look at Ancora and its nominees. We ultimately made a final decision to support the Ancora slate and CEO choice.\"\n\nThe Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees Division (BMWED) whose members perform track maintenance, joined the BLET in switching support to Ancora.\n\n\"For many months since East Palestine, the BMWED has not been able to get assurances from the current leadership to implement needed policy and procedural changes to prevent such tragedies from reoccurring,\" it said. \"At this juncture, seeing no path forward, we see no reason to support the current administration at Norfolk Southern.\"\n\nAncora has tapped former UPS executive Jim Barber to be the next CEO if it wins. Both BLET and BMWE are part of the Teamsters union, which has more than 300,000 members working for UPS.\n\nShaw and Norfolk Southern's management still has the support of the other unions at the railroad, which between them represent about 60% of the unionized employees there. SMART-TD issued a statement calling the BLET \"Judas,\" saying union leadership \"should be ashamed.\"\n\n\"They were willing to hand over everything our movement has done to defend our men and women against PSR at NS,\" said SMART-TD.\n\nShaw and current Norfolk Southern management \"have made a conscious effort to diverge from the operating ratio-obsessed mentality that has degraded rail service and safety... and have made safety, employees and customers their priority,\" it said in a separate statement.\n\nUp to investors\n\nBut no matter what the unions and safety regulator thinks about the choices, the decision will ride with shareholders who are likely displeased by the performance of the company's stock, and the financial results.\n\nShares of Norfolk Southern are down 8% from where they were before the February 3 2023 derailment, compared to a 5% gain in CSX shares and 13% rise in shares of Union Pacific. Norfolk's profit margin is also lower than industry averages and it shrank in the first quarter compared to a year earlier, even when stripping out the cost of the derailment.\n\nThe Ancora takeover effort has gotten endorsement from two leading shareholder services firms, Glass Lewis and ISS.\n\n\"Having given due consideration to the arguments presented by each side, we believe Ancora has presented a compelling case for supporting a substantial overhaul of the Company's current leadership,\" said a statement from Glass Lewis.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at

EASTERN THURSDAY\n\nNorfolk Southern shareholders will decide Thursday morning whether to back an activist investor\u00b4s bid to take over the railroad\u00b4s board and replace management.\n\nAncora Holdings picked up significant support during the campaign from major investors like EdgePoint Investment Group, two major rail unions and some customers. But the rest of rail labor, several key regulators and a number of other customers backed management.\n\nIf all seven of Ancora\u00b4s nominees are elected, that would give them the votes they need to move forward with their plan to fire the CEO and overhaul the railroad\u00b4s operations. If shareholders only support some of their board candidates, then Ancora won\u00b4t be able to make sweeping changes right away.\n\nThe railroad and Ancora disagree over whether CEO Alan Shaw \u00b4s strategy of keeping more workers on hand during a downturn to be ready to handle the eventual rebound is the best way to run Norfolk Southern and whether he is the best man to lead the railroad.\n\nAncora\u00b4s CEO candidate, Jim Barber, who was formerly UPS\u00b4 chief operating officer, has said keeping more workers on hand during slower times is wasteful. That\u00b4s why Ancora wants to implement the industry standard Precision Scheduled Railroading that is designed to minimize the number of workers, locomotives and railcars a railroad needs.\n\nFILE - Norfolk Southern locomotives are moved through the Conway Terminal in Conway, Pa., June 17, 2023.

Puskar, File)\n\nAncora\u00b4s plan would rely on running fewer, longer trains on a tighter schedule and switching cars between trains less often to streamline operations. Shaw argued that running the railroad too lean would jeopardize the improvements in safety and service Norfolk Southern has seen since its disastrous February 2023 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.\n\nRail unions have said they believe Precision Scheduled Railroading has made the industry more dangerous and derailments more likely because inspections are so rushed and preventative maintenance may be neglected.\n\nIf Ancora succeeds in getting all seven of its nominees elected, it will have the power to fire Shaw and his new Chief Operating Officer John Orr that he just hired in March after paying another railroad $25 million to get permission to hire him. Ancora wants to install Barber as CEO and hire former CSX railroad operations chief Jaimie Boychuk to be Norfolk Southern\u00b4s Chief Operating Officer to overhaul the way the railroad schedules and operates its trains.\n\nAncora has projected that it will be able to cut more than $800 million in expenses in the first year and another $275 million by the end of three years. The investors say they don\u00b4t plan layoffs, but want to use attrition to eliminate about 1,500 jobs over time.\n\nNorfolk Southern has said it\u00b4s own plan to make the railroad more efficient would generate about $400 million in cost savings over two years and improve its profit margin. Although analysts have questioned whether Norfolk Southern will be able to catch up to the other major freight railroads, which are all working to get more efficient too.\n\nIf Ancora doesn\u00b4t get all of its directors elected, the investors won\u00b4t be able to make sweeping changes immediately, but they will likely be able to put more pressure on Shaw to deliver results.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winslow_Township,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Winslow Township, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winslow Township, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Southern_Railway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norfolk Southern Railway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotive", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Locomotive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief operating officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway,_Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conway, Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Conway, Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derailment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derailment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Parcel_Service", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Parcel Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railcar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Railcar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Orr_(bishop)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Orr (bishop)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_freight_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rail freight transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSX_Transportation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CSX Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Profit margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Palestine,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East Palestine, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Palestine, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Rail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Rail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/Rail-fanning_and_Train-spotting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/Rail-fanning and Train-spotting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/09/08/wire-84648521-1715238977-982_636x382.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547002", "eventUri": "eng-9547002", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-06-", "textStart": 1570, "textEnd": 1577}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Of course, I am talking about the proxy battle initiated and being fiercely -- I might even say viciously -- waged by Ancora against the current leadership of Norfolk Southern.\"\n\nWhether Oberman's comments would have made any difference weeks ago is questionable. It is even less certain whether they had an impact just nine days before Norfolk Southern's (NYSE: NSC) annual meeting, as many proxy votes presumably have already been cast.\n\nAncora is seeking to oust Shaw as well as Norfolk Southern's newly appointed COO, John Orr, and several members of the board of directors, including Chair Amy Miles. Ancora's picks to replace Shaw and Orr are, respectively, Jim Barber, a former UPS executive, and Jamie Boychuk, a former CSX executive.\n\nWhile Oberman has often discussed railroad staffing levels in his critiques, one of the first issues he raised in his Chicago address was what he said was a plan by Ancora to deemphasize intermodal traffic in favor of manifest trains, which have multiple cars carrying different types of freight.\n\n\"They want to deemphasize intermodal -- for only one reason,\" he said. \"Manifest traffic is carried at a lower OR than intermodal. Not that intermodal isn't profitable. It's just not as profitable, Ancora says, to make their shareholders richer faster. This is a short-sighted strategy which cannot be sustained in the long run.\"\n\nOberman said intermodal is crucial. \"Intermodal now accounts for about 50% of all rail traffic, and that is where the future is,\" he said.\n\nHe cited the work of well-respected rail consultancy Oliver Wyman, which he said sees $177 billion in revenue that would be jeopardized if trains keep losing business to trucks at the current pace.\n\n\"If railroads just hold on to their current percentage of intermodal, they will keep that $177 billion,\" Oberman said. \"But most importantly, if they simply employ their existing capacity, they can not only keep the $177 billion but add an additional $61 billion in intermodal by 2030. And that is profitable traffic.\n\n\"Rather than detailing plans for adding carloads to the railroad, what you find in the endless pages of Ancora's presentations are detailed spreadsheets how they are going to cut, cut, cut resources and how fast their [operating ratio] is going to come down in the next few years if they prevail.\"\n\nOberman said Norfolk Southern \"has made more progress in building a resilient railroad\" than any other Class 1 railroad in recent years.\n\n\"But Ancora has missed the boat on resiliency,\" he added. \"Indeed, its attack on NS is centered on its view that resiliency is a huge mistake and needs to be eliminated.\"\n\nHe then turned his attention to Barber. According to Oberman, Barber, a former executive at UPS, has boasted of hiring 100,000 employees around Christmas who would then be let go, with the idea that a new round of employees could be hired the next holiday season. According to Oberman, Barber will seek similar \"resiliency\" at Norfolk Southern.\n\nAnd in characteristic bluntness, Oberman said, \"Indeed, with due respect to the hard-working folks at UPS, it just doesn't take as much skill and training to load a cardboard carton into the back of a van as it does to drive a locomotive or handle complex rail car movements in a yard.\"\n\nNS published a press release Monday touting Oberman's comments. That press release became the basis for a proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nProxy filings submitted to the SEC by either Ancora or Norfolk Southern total 16 just since May 1. Eight were filed on Monday alone.\n\nIn a sign that Ancora considers everything fair game, one of the activist investor's two filings Monday called for the resignation of board member Claude Mongeau because of his role as a board member of TD Bank. TD Bank is the subject of a recently launched money laundering probe.\n\nMeanwhile, the six proxy filings from Norfolk Southern besides Oberman's comments also included pro-management statements from several shippers, including such companies as Lincoln Energy Solutions and Centennial Energy. It included a pair of tweets posted by the railroad as well.\n\nMore articles by John Kingston\n\nRXO, still suffering from weak market, touts Q1 volume growth\n\nC.H.

Norfolk Southern and Ancora were not immediately available for comment.\n\nAncora assembled a director slate that includes former Kansas City Southern executive Sameh Fahmy, Gilbert Lamphere, a former chairman of the Illinois Central Railway, and William Clyburn who served on the U.S. Surface Transportation board.\n\nIt has argued new directors are needed to improve Norfolk Southern's financial performance and reach operational targets.\n\nThree proxy advisory firms -- Institutional Investor Services, Glass Lewis and Egan-Jones -- recommended that Norfolk Southern investors elect at least a handful of Ancora's nominees. They said the company's board should be refreshed after a string of safety problems including a derailment in East Palestine, Ohio in 2023.\n\nAncora also argued that Norfolk Southern's chief executive Alan Shaw should be ousted.\n\nNorfolk Southern has told investors it has taken appropriate action by refreshing its board and hiring a new chief operating officer.\n\nAmong the new board directors Norfolk Southern tapped are Richard Anderson, a former head of passenger railway Amtrak, and former U.S. Senator Heidi Heitkamp. The company also hired John Orr from Canadian Pacific Kansas City as its chief operating officer. Norfolk Southern paid the rival railroad $25 million to buy Orr out of his non-competition agreement.\n\nAncora won the support of large railroad unions and steel maker Cleveland-Cliffs, a big Norfolk Southern client.\n\n(Reporting by Svea Herbst-BaylissEditing by Greg Roumeliotis and Chizu Nomiyama)", "source": {"uri": "money.usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@money.usnews.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Southern_Railway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norfolk Southern Railway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hedge fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_Investor_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Institutional Investor (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Proxy firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_Central_Railroad", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Illinois Central Railroad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Southern_Railway", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Southern Railway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_Lewis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glass Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Pacific_Kansas_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Pacific Kansas City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland-Cliffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland-Cliffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi_Heitkamp", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heidi Heitkamp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derailment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derailment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amtrak", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amtrak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief operating officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Palestine,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East Palestine, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Palestine, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/History", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/Rail-fanning_and_Train-spotting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/Rail-fanning and Train-spotting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/Photographs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/Photographs", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/55ad31a/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2Ffd%2F75deade3eff55227fec26155b6681a%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK480H9%3A22024-05-09T114623Z_2_LYNXMPEK480H9_RTROPTP_3_NORFOLK-SOUTHERN-ANCORA-ISS.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547002", "eventUri": "eng-9547002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Ancora also wants former UPS executive Jim Barber as the CEO of the Atlanta-based railroad, and wants to install a former CSX executive as chief operating officer.\n\nOn Thursday, shareholders will decide the fate of Norfolk Southern's leadership at the company's virtual annual meeting.\n\nSince the February 2023 fiery derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, of a Norfolk Southern train carrying hazardous materials, the railroad has been beleaguered by public criticism and well over $1 billion in charges related to the wreck.

Their strong backing underscores the company's balanced strategy, driven by the decisive leadership of CEO Alan Shaw and guided by the Norfolk Southern board, is the best path to drive long-term value for shareholders and deliver reliable, resilient service.\n\n\"Hub Group continues to value its long-term partnership with Norfolk Southern that allows us collectively to deliver a cost-effective, environmentally sensitive intermodal service offering to shippers throughout the eastern United States. The commitment that you and your management team have made to maintaining consistently strong service levels is critical to our mutual success in converting over-the-road shipments to rail which is leading to significant growth.

To that end, we support strategies from our Class I partners, including the current Norfolk Southern strategy, dedicated to these same goals.

During that time our annual freight volumes have increased thirty-fold, and we are looking to doubling that in the next twelve months. [The Norfolk Southern] team - from the CEO down to the local operating folks - have been extremely helpful and supportive these past five years. A large part of our success has come from their team and our partnership. Although we would never presume to tell your shareholders how to vote, and we will always remain a good NS customer, they should be aware that we would be concerned if the existing operating and marketing support changed.\"\n\n- Bill Gay, Division Vice President\n\nArrowhead Environmental Partners/Waste Connections\n\n\"As one of the key logistics partners, I want to express my confidence and support for Norfolk Southern's current management team headed by Alan Shaw.

Since Covid - all departments have been focused on 'the customer' which is critical to success in any business. While I have never personally dealt with Mr. Shaw, I know that I can see and feel a very positive change that has been evident to me over the last few years. I truly did not think that a CEO or COO could impact the overall organization the size of NS - but the last 3 or so years something has changed. From what my NS contacts tell me, it comes down from the top. So based on this feedback, Mr. Shaw must be having this positive effect on the performance and attitude of the organization. - I have been a witness to it.\"\n\n- Von Friesen, Principal\n\nStrategic Transload Services, LLC\n\n\"One Earth Energy, LLC has been a customer of Norfolk Southern railroad for 15 years, prior to that, I was General Manager from 1990 to 2007 with Alliance Grain Co...Norfolk Southern's enhanced service has enabled us at One Earth Energy to expand our rail business and invest in additional track space to accommodate our growth in production capacity along with rail shipments.

Their strong backing underscores the company's balanced strategy, driven by the decisive leadership of CEO Alan Shaw and guided by the Norfolk Southern board, is the best path to drive long-term value for shareholders and deliver reliable, resilient service.\n\n\"Hub Group continues to value its long-term partnership with Norfolk Southern that allows us collectively to deliver a cost-effective, environmentally sensitive intermodal service offering to shippers throughout the eastern United States. The commitment that you and your management team have made to maintaining consistently strong service levels is critical to our mutual success in converting over-the-road shipments to rail which is leading to significant growth. We appreciate that a sustained dedication to maintaining strong service levels is a key element of your strategic plan...We support you and your management team in the ongoing execution of your strategy.\"\n\n- Phillip Yeager, President, CEO, and Vice Chairman\n\nHub Group, Inc.\n\n\"As a group we are focused on fostering long-term volume and revenue growth for the rail industry. To that end, we support strategies from our Class I partners, including the current Norfolk Southern strategy, dedicated to these same goals. We believe growth is most effectively achieved through a commitment to providing operating resilience and consistent customer service, and to do so over a full business cycle.\"\n\n- Chuck Baker, President & CEO\n\nAmerican Short Line & Regional Railroad Association\n\n\"Arrowhead (now part of Waste Connections) has been [a] customer since 2019. During that time our annual freight volumes have increased thirty-fold, and we are looking to doubling that in the next twelve months. [The Norfolk Southern] team - from the CEO down to the local operating folks - have been extremely helpful and supportive these past five years. A large part of our success has come from their team and our partnership. Although we would never presume to tell your shareholders how to vote, and we will always remain a good NS customer, they should be aware that we would be concerned if the existing operating and marketing support changed.\"\n\n- Bill Gay, Division Vice President\n\nArrowhead Environmental Partners/Waste Connections\n\n\"As one of the key logistics partners, I want to express my confidence and support for Norfolk Southern's current management team headed by Alan Shaw. CONSOL has been a beneficiary of some of the operational and safety improvements made by Alan. This has allowed us to grow our export business and benefitted thousands of direct and indirect workers in Southwest PA, WV, and MD.\"\n\n- Jimmy Brock, Chairman and CEO\n\nCONSOL Energy Inc.\n\n\"HC Minerals (formerly Hi-Crush) unequivocally supports Alan Shaw and the rest of the NS management team, as well as the NS strategy.\"\n\n- Will Barker, General Counsel and Chief Commercial Officer\n\nHC Minerals\n\n\"Norfolk Southern has made significant service improvements following the implementation of their new operating strategy. Consistent and rateable manifest service is critical to the success of our processing business. It allows us to meet our customers' needs and supports our growth initiatives. We support NS's strategic vision for service improvements while maintaining a customer centric approach.\"\n\n- Gordon Russell, Executive Vice President\n\nLouis Dreyfus Company\n\n\"The 'new' focus on smart expansion opportunities was truly refreshing and had been lost since 2008-2010. Since Covid - all departments have been focused on 'the customer' which is critical to success in any business. While I have never personally dealt with Mr. Shaw, I know that I can see and feel a very positive change that has been evident to me over the last few years. I truly did not think that a CEO or COO could impact the overall organization the size of NS - but the last 3 or so years something has changed. From what my NS contacts tell me, it comes down from the top. So based on this feedback, Mr. Shaw must be having this positive effect on the performance and attitude of the organization. - I have been a witness to it.\"\n\n- Von Friesen, Principal\n\nStrategic Transload Services, LLC\n\n\"One Earth Energy, LLC has been a customer of Norfolk Southern railroad for 15 years, prior to that, I was General Manager from 1990 to 2007 with Alliance Grain Co...Norfolk Southern's enhanced service has enabled us at One Earth Energy to expand our rail business and invest in additional track space to accommodate our growth in production capacity along with rail shipments.

A defeat of current Norfolk Southern management, credited with improving safety practices at the railroad since the February 3, 2023 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, could make management at other railroads reluctant to take steps to improve safety if it means reduced profit margins.\n\nThe fight has split the railroad's unions, who disagree which management team - the current Norfolk Southern leadership or one proposed by activist investor Ancora Holdings - would be best for safety and the railroad's employees.\n\nAncora, which seeks to have its own slate of directors elected and a new CEO and COO put in charge of the railroad, insist current management has proven incapable of running a safe and profitable railroad. It wants to improve profitability at the railroad by greater emphasis on the operating philosphy known as Precision Scheduled Railroading, or PSR, which leads to longer trains making fewer stops at customers' locations to pick-up or drop-off rail cars.\n\nPSR is generally opposed by both rail unions and many rail customers, and Norfolk management appeared to be taking steps away from PSR in the wake of the East Palestine derailment.\n\nNorfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw and his management team received praised by some who, in the past, criticized the railroad's performance, including Amit Bose, administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration, the nation's rail regulator.\n\nIn a letter to Norfolk Southern in February soon after the takeover effort started, Bose praise the railroad instituting a \"confidential close call reporting system\" similar to one in place for decades at the nation's railroads to allow employees to report safety issues without fear of reprisal, as well as increasing staffing and training. He said Shaw's safety efforts \"are important and demonstrate the ability to make progress when railroads make safety a priority.\" And he said that NS was the only Class I railroad to achieve significant reductions in the rate of mainline derailments last year.\n\nHis letter suggested his concerns that that progress could be lost due to the takeover battle.\n\n\"While I recognize NS for the meaningful steps and results seen so far, often in notable contrast to industry peers, I want to emphasize the importance of a durable and lasting path forward that continues to prioritize safety,\" he wrote. \"Any backsliding, as a result of a change in leadership or otherwise, on the safety-oriented path you have laid out and communicated to us will likely attract renewed oversight attention from my office.\"\n\nUnions split on which side should win\n\nAfter initially being united in opposition to the takeover effort, the railroad's unions are now split on the takeover battle.\n\nMost of the unions remain supportive of current CEO Alan Shaw and Norfolk Southern's current board.\n\n\"NS and Shaw have placed a unique focus on establishing a culture that addresses safety concerns that other carriers have not,\" said a letter from Jeremy Ferguson, president of SMART-TD, the union that represents more than 5,000 conductors at the railroad.\n\nThe Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET), which represents more than 3,000 engineers at the railroad, joined the other unions at the railroad in initially endorsing Norfolk management, saying that Ancora's plans for Norfolk would be \"reckless\" and \"likely to lead to more train wrecks.\" It said Ancora's PSR plan \"requires railroads to do more with less which equates to longer trains, deferred maintenance of track and equipment, shorter inspections of rolling stock and a reduction in staffing numbers.\"\n\nAnd it praised the changes that Shaw had made to improve safety since the February 2023 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.\n\n\"Shaw was only on the job for a few months prior to the disaster. Since the derailment last year, NS' CEO has risen to the occasion and, through his leadership, NS has become a safer, more efficient and customer focused company again,\" said Jerry Sturdivant, a BLET union official at Norfolk Southern, back in February.\n\nReversing course\n\nBut the BLET said the changes that Norfolk Southern has made to try to answer Ancora's takeover efforts are taking the railroad in the wrong direction. It is particularly upset with the work of the railroad's new chief operating officer, John Orr, hired in March from Canadian Pacific Kansas City, for a pay package with a target value of $10.3 million.\n\nBLET said that Orr's appointment shows that Norfolk Southern is committed to additional use of PSR, no matter which side wins the the proxy fight. And it said it has received assurances of other safety improvements from Ancora, including dropping all plans to have single-person crews on long-distance trains.\n\nThe current labor contract requires both an engineer and a conductor in the locomotive, and a recent proposed federal rule would codify the requirement. Although that rule has yet to take effect and could be reversed in the future. And the nation's major railroads would still prefer to remove the conductors from the trains, arguing it can be done without reducing safety.\n\n\"Although we initially supported Mr. Shaw and Norfolk Southern's management in this contest, today he leads a different team with an unproven strategy,\" said a statement from three BLET officials at the railroad. \"The ever-changing and inconsistent policies that we have been hearing from the railroad's current leadership in recent weeks forced BLET to take another look at Ancora and its nominees. We ultimately made a final decision to support the Ancora slate and CEO choice.\"\n\nThe Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees Division (BMWED) whose members perform track maintenance, joined the BLET in switching support to Ancora.\n\n\"For many months since East Palestine, the BMWED has not been able to get assurances from the current leadership to implement needed policy and procedural changes to prevent such tragedies from reoccurring,\" it said. \"At this juncture, seeing no path forward, we see no reason to support the current administration at Norfolk Southern.\"\n\nAncora has tapped former UPS executive Jim Barber to be the next CEO if it wins. Both BLET and BMWE are part of the Teamsters union, which has more than 300,000 members working for UPS.\n\nShaw and Norfolk Southern's management still has the support of the other unions at the railroad, which between them represent about 60% of the unionized employees there. SMART-TD issued a statement calling the BLET \"Judas,\" saying union leadership \"should be ashamed.\"\n\n\"They were willing to hand over everything our movement has done to defend our men and women against PSR at NS,\" said SMART-TD.\n\nShaw and current Norfolk Southern management \"have made a conscious effort to diverge from the operating ratio-obsessed mentality that has degraded rail service and safety... and have made safety, employees and customers their priority,\" it said in a separate statement.\n\nUp to investors\n\nBut no matter what the unions and safety regulator thinks about the choices, the decision will ride with shareholders who are likely displeased by the performance of the company's stock, and the financial results.\n\nShares of Norfolk Southern are down 8% from where they were before the February 3 2023 derailment, compared to a 5% gain in CSX shares and 13% rise in shares of Union Pacific. Norfolk's profit margin is also lower than industry averages and it shrank in the first quarter compared to a year earlier, even when stripping out the cost of the derailment.\n\nThe Ancora takeover effort has gotten endorsement from two leading shareholder services firms, Glass Lewis and ISS.\n\n\"Having given due consideration to the arguments presented by each side, we believe Ancora has presented a compelling case for supporting a substantial overhaul of the Company's current leadership,\" said a statement from Glass Lewis.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

EASTERN THURSDAY\n\nLAYDOWN TO MOVE OVERNIGHT AHEAD OF NORFOLK SOUTHERN'S THURSDAY MORNING ANNUAL MEETING THAT IS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN AT 8:30A.M. EASTERN THURSDAY\n\nNorfolk Southern shareholders will decide Thursday morning whether to back an activist investor's bid to take over the railroad's board and replace management.\n\nAncora Holdings picked up significant support during the campaign from major investors like EdgePoint Investment Group, two major rail unions and some customers. But the rest of rail labor, several key regulators and a number of other customers backed management.\n\nIf all seven of Ancora's nominees are elected, that would give them the votes they need to move forward with their plan to fire the CEO and overhaul the railroad's operations. If shareholders only support some of their board candidates, then Ancora won't be able to make sweeping changes right away.\n\nThe railroad and Ancora disagree over whether CEO Alan Shaw 's strategy of keeping more workers on hand during a downturn to be ready to handle the eventual rebound is the best way to run Norfolk Southern and whether he is the best man to lead the railroad.\n\nAncora's CEO candidate, Jim Barber, who was formerly UPS' chief operating officer, has said keeping more workers on hand during slower times is wasteful. That's why Ancora wants to implement the industry standard Precision Scheduled Railroading that is designed to minimize the number of workers, locomotives and railcars a railroad needs.\n\nAncora's plan would rely on running fewer, longer trains on a tighter schedule and switching cars between trains less often to streamline operations. Shaw argued that running the railroad too lean would jeopardize the improvements in safety and service Norfolk Southern has seen since its disastrous February 2023 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.\n\nRail unions have said they believe Precision Scheduled Railroading has made the industry more dangerous and derailments more likely because inspections are so rushed and preventative maintenance may be neglected.\n\nIf Ancora succeeds in getting all seven of its nominees elected, it will have the power to fire Shaw and his new Chief Operating Officer John Orr that he just hired in March after paying another railroad $25 million to get permission to hire him. Ancora wants to install Barber as CEO and hire former CSX railroad operations chief Jaimie Boychuk to be Norfolk Southern's Chief Operating Officer to overhaul the way the railroad schedules and operates its trains.\n\nAncora has projected that it will be able to cut more than $800 million in expenses in the first year and another $275 million by the end of three years. The investors say they don't plan layoffs, but want to use attrition to eliminate about 1,500 jobs over time.\n\nNorfolk Southern has said it's own plan to make the railroad more efficient would generate about $400 million in cost savings over two years and improve its profit margin. Although analysts have questioned whether Norfolk Southern will be able to catch up to the other major freight railroads, which are all working to get more efficient too.\n\nIf Ancora doesn't get all of its directors elected, the investors won't be able to make sweeping changes immediately, but they will likely be able to put more pressure on Shaw to deliver results.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Southern_Railway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norfolk Southern Railway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief operating officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derailment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derailment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Parcel_Service", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Parcel Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railcar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Railcar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Locomotive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_freight_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rail freight transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSX_Transportation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CSX Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Profit margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Palestine,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East Palestine, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Palestine, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Rail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Rail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/Rail-fanning_and_Train-spotting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/Rail-fanning and Train-spotting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1714769250", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547002", "eventUri": "eng-9547002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Ancora also urged investors to oust CEO Alan Shaw who was re-elected.\n\nThe fight was one of the year's most closely watched votes because Ancora was pushing for so many seats at such a sizable company at a time railroad safety has been in the headlines following several derailments, analysts and bankers said.\n\nInvestors reacted poorly to the vote news as many hoped for a new chief executive and sent shares down as much as 6% in early trading. By mid-morning the shares were at $224.56, down 3.3%.\n\n\"We expect investors who owned the stock for a 'change event' will sell the stock today (and this could leak to tomorrow as well). Importantly, though, change is already afoot,\" wrote Evercore analyst Jonathan Chappell.\n\nAncora nominees William Clyburn, Sameh Fahmy and Gilbert Lamphere won seats, according to preliminary voting results. Investors ousted board chair Amy Miles, Jennifer Scanlon, chair of the governance and nominating committee, and John Thompson, chair of the human capital management and compensation committee.\n\nThe company said positive change is happening at the railway, adding \"we will continue building on the significant progress Alan Shaw, John Orr, and the entire team have already achieved.\"\n\nEarlier this year Norfolk Southern reacted to disgruntled investors by recruiting John Orr as chief operating officer.\n\nOrr, who has expertise in precision scheduled railroading or PSR, was hired away from Canadian Pacific Kansas City and Norfolk Southern paid its rival railroad $25 million to buy Orr out of his non-competition agreement.\n\nThe hedge fund argued new blood was needed to improve financial and operational metrics and said on Thursday that it will continue to hold the company accountable for any future railway accidents or underperformance.\n\nAncora had proposed investors push Alan Shaw off the board and elect Jim Barber, a former chief operating officer at UPS, so that he could eventually replace Shaw as CEO. Ancora also proposed Jamie Boychuk, who had worked with legendary railroad executive Hunter Harrison at CSX, to become Norfolk Southern's chief operating officer.\n\nThree prominent proxy advisory firms last week recommended that investors elect at least five of Ancora's seven candidates, arguing that change is needed at the railway which is valued at $52 billion. Institutional Shareholder Services endorsed Shaw for re-election while Glass Lewis and Egan-Jones recommended investors not remove him.\n\nAncora had won support of large railroad unions and steel maker Cleveland-Cliffs, a big Norfolk Southern client.\n\nAs some of the vote was still coming in late on Wednesday just hours before Thursday's annual meeting, much of the outcome hinged on large index funds.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Ancora's Chadwick had harsh words for the index funds and how they voted.\n\n\"For the passive investors: If anything should go wrong here and there's another derailment and people die, this is on you,\" Chadwick said at the annual meeting. \"You gave us literally no support and we still won three board seats without you. What happens to Norfolk Southern now is on your firms and your conscience,\" Chadwick added.\n\nLast month Norfolk Southern agreed to pay $600 million to settle lawsuits related to last year's train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.

The three seats are short of the full seven that the activist had been seeking but still a clear indication of shareholders' desire for change at a railroad plagued by underperformance.\n\nNorfolk Southern's board had fought hard to stave off Ancora's biggest demand: firing current CEO Alan Shaw. Ancora had rebuffed past settlement offers that didn't include Shaw's ouster.\n\nThe boardroom victory is a milestone for Ancora, a $10 billion Ohio investment firm that launched an activism practice just 10 years ago and scored a series of smaller wins leading up to the election at Norfolk Southern. It caps an impressive campaign that saw the activist win unexpected support from unions, customers, and, perhaps most importantly, Glass Lewis and ISS, the influential proxy advisory firms.\n\nAncora's Jim Chadwick and Frederick DiSanto said in a statement that the results showed the activist had driven \"significant change\" at the railroad, and noted they believed Shaw was handed a \"resounding vote of no confidence based on preliminary voting results.\"\n\n\"We will work constructively and collaboratively on behalf of our shareholders unlocking the full potential of our powerful franchise,\" Norfolk Southern said in a statement, adding it welcomed the arrival of three new directors.\n\nWhile Shaw's ouster was Ancora's most pressing demand, the activist firm laid out broader accusations of failed governance and asserted that the company's proposed operating approach was unproductive.\n\nThe activist had argued that Norfolk Southern should adopt a model known as precision-scheduled railroading, or PSR, which has delivered impressive shareholder returns at other railroads. However, critics have said the model leaves railroads ill-equipped to handle surges in demand.\n\nNorfolk Southern had first argued against PSR in favor of its proposed resiliency model, which would keep rail crews and cars on standby to handle those cyclical surges in demand.\n\nBut the company abruptly changed tack during the fight, hiring a well-known PSR operator as chief operating officer and implementing some of those precision principles.\n\nGovernment officials, who had previously voiced their support for Norfolk over Ancora, were momentarily silenced by the reversal. Labor groups accounting for some 40% of Norfolk's union employees shifted their support to Ancora, and major customer Cleveland Cliffs endorsed Ancora's proposed picks and plan.\n\nThe dissident also won support from proxy advisors Glass Lewis and ISS. ISS recommended that shareholders support five of Ancora's seven picks but did not recommend electing Ancora CEO pick Jim Barber to the board. Glass Lewis endorsed six of Ancora's nominees. Both said change was needed at the railroad.\n\n\"Given that we have no standstill agreement and a clear mandate from a critical mass of shareholders, we will continue to hold Mr. Shaw to account and push for the appointment of a qualified operator who can actually drive shareholder value,\" Ancora's Chadwick and DiSanto said in the statement.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Southern_Railway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norfolk Southern Railway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Proxy voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissident", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dissident"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Proxy firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_Lewis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glass Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Labor Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief operating officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norfolk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norfolk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/02/107231688-1682543857645-IMG_1135r.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547002", "eventUri": "eng-9547002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

You gave us literally no support, and we still won three board seats without you. What happens at Norfolk Southern is now on your firm's and your conscience.\"\n\nThe reference to the \"largest customer\" refers to the fact that Cleveland-Cliffs (NYSE: CLF), the steelmaker and producer of iron ore, backed the Ancora slate. Several Norfolk Southern unions did as well.\n\nNorfolk Southern, in a statement announcing the proxy vote results, cited Chadwick's previous comments in a CNBC interview regarding what constituted success for Ancora.\n\n\"Look, there's a lot of versions of success, but I think the message around the vote for seven, ultimately, that's how we control our own fate and we have a plan and we believe we're going to execute it,\" Chadwick said in the interview, according to the transcript supplied by NS.\n\nA statement put out by Ancora was more upbeat.\n\n\"It's an extremely positive development for shareholders that this campaign has driven significant changes at Norfolk Southern, including the ouster of the Board Chair, Governance Committee Chair and Compensation Committee Chair,\" Ancora said in a joint quote from Chadwick and Frederick DiSanto, chairman and CEO of Ancora. \"This represents a loud and clear message to replace the Company's unqualified CEO and reconsider its ineffective strategy, which has driven industry-worst customer delivery times, severe derailments and persistent share price underperformance.\"\n\nAncora also said Shaw's vote to return as director \"barely\" topped 50%.\n\nThe incumbent board members defeated besides Miles, and whose positions were cited by Chadwick and DiSanto, were Jennifer Scanlon and John Thompson. Scanlon was chair of the Governance and Nominating Committee, and Thompson was chair of the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee.\n\nCiting those defeats, the Ancora statement said the vote was \"a referendum for change.\"\n\n\"We aren't here to fight with you,\" Chadwick said at the annual meeting. \"But your CEO missed earnings estimates for six quarters in a row. It has destroyed a town in our own state. [Ancora is Cleveland-based.] And if this underperformance continues, we will hold you accountable.\"\n\nOne of the Ancora nominees who was elected to the board at Norfolk Southern is Jim Barber Jr. who had a long career with UPS (NYSE: UPS), including stints as president and COO. He's also on the board at C.H. Robinson (NYSE: CHRW).\n\nBarber was also Ancora's pick to be CEO if it was able to oust Shaw.\n\nThe other Ancora nominees elected to the board were William Clyburn Jr., a former federal regulator and now an independent rail consultant, and Gilbert Lamphere, chairman of MidRail Corp. and co-founder of MidSouth Rail Corp. who has been on the boards of Canadian National (NYSE: CNI) and CSX (NASDAQ: CSX).\n\nWith the three Ancora-backed members now on the board, the joint Chadwick/DiSanto statement said \"the campaign for change at this great American railroad will continue.\"\n\nIt will be doing so on a board where more than half the members are new. Four existing Norfolk Southern board members did not stand for reelection to a one-year term, and their replacement will be joined by the three Ancora nominees.\n\nIn his remarks on the call, Shaw gave an upbeat outlook for Norfolk Southern without attacking Ancora.\n\nHe cited recent contracts with labor unions, a reduction in the mainline accident rate of 38%, a reduction in terminal dwell time, an increase in train speed and numerous other positive indicators.\n\n\"We are not done,\" Shaw said. \"We will deliver on the promise to remake ourselves in a more productive and efficient way.\"\n\nMore articles by John Kingston\n\nAs Norfolk Southern battle nears climax, STB head Oberman backs management\n\nNorfolk Southern to create executive role as part of safety revamp", "source":

Activist investor Ancora Holdings Group came away with a partial victory as it placed three of its nominees on the board.\n\nThe results, which still must be certified, mark the culmination of a campaign that had become increasingly acrimonious in recent months, with Ancora accusing Shaw of poor decision-making that led to weak operating results and an underperforming stock. The activist was also critical of the rail giant's handling of the fallout from a derailment last year in Ohio that spilled toxic chemicals and caused a national uproar.\n\nRead More: Activist Wants to Fire Railroad CEO for His Lack of Ruthlessness\n\nWhile the vote likely means that Shaw will remain in place, he'll need to find common ground with a firm that now has several board seats. Norfolk said in a statement that it \"will work constructively and collaboratively\" on behalf of shareholders with the new-look board.\n\nThe company's shares fell 2.5% in New York.\n\nAncora's aim was to win majority board representation in order to force out Shaw and the chief operating officer, arguing that the executives weren't focused enough on profitability and shareholder returns. The firm had intended to install Jim Barber, a former executive at United Parcel Service Inc., as Norfolk's CEO and hire railroad executive Jamie Boychuk as COO.\n\nThe campaign led to the ouster of Chair Amy Miles, who was voted out Thursday. Norfolk said it would elect a new chair at its next meeting, to be scheduled in the coming weeks.\n\nAmong Ancora's seven-person slate, it won support for three: William Clyburn Jr., Sameh Fahmy and Gilbert Lamphere. The investment firm said in a statement after the vote that it would \"continue to hold Mr. Shaw to account and push for the appointment of a qualified operator who can actually drive shareholder value.\"\n\nThe outcome was \"disappointing\" for Ancora, TD Cowen analyst Jason Seidl said in a note.\n\n\"With just three directors, Ancora only has a minority representation on the board and will likely find it difficult to steer change in their desired direction,\" he said. \"We believe the activist will continue to advocate for its CEO and COO candidates, but to little avail.\"\n\n'Overwhelming Support'\n\nSpeaking at Thursday's meeting, Ancora said it received \"overwhelming support\" from active shareholders but failed to get necessary backing from passive investors.\n\n\"For passive shareholders, if anything goes wrong here or if there is another derailment, it's on you,\" said Jim Chadwick, president of alternatives at Ancora. He added that his firm would still work with those investors.\n\nThe campaign generated heated rhetoric and split opinion among various stakeholders. A pair of Teamsters union divisions, proxy adviser Glass Lewis & Co. and customer Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. backed Ancora. In Norfolk's corner were Lincoln Energy Solutions and Centennial Energy, as well as departing Surface Transportation Board Chair Martin Oberman. Adviser Institutional Shareholder Services also supported Shaw and several Norfolk board candidates.\n\nShaw took the helm in 2022, calling for a rethink of the precision scheduled railroading efficiency strategy that has dominated in the industry for more than a decade. His plans for change were upended by the derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, which damaged the company's reputation and performance.\n\nUnder pressure from Ancora, Shaw acquiesced to making profitability metrics a more explicit part of executives' compensation. He also hired John Orr, a PSR acolyte, as chief operating officer.\n\n--With assistance from Brooke Sutherland.\n\n(Updates with analyst comment, additional detail throughout)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

A defeat of current Norfolk Southern management, credited with improving safety practices at the railroad since the February 3, 2023 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, could make management at other railroads reluctant to take steps to improve safety if it means reduced profit margins.\n\nThe fight has split the railroad's unions, who disagree which management team - the current Norfolk Southern leadership or one proposed by activist investor Ancora Holdings - would be best for safety and the railroad's employees.\n\nAncora, which seeks to have its own slate of directors elected and a new CEO and COO put in charge of the railroad, insist current management has proven incapable of running a safe and profitable railroad. It wants to improve profitability at the railroad by greater emphasis on the operating philosphy known as Precision Scheduled Railroading, or PSR, which leads to longer trains making fewer stops at customers' locations to pick-up or drop-off rail cars.\n\nPSR is generally opposed by both rail unions and many rail customers, and Norfolk management appeared to be taking steps away from PSR in the wake of the East Palestine derailment.\n\nNorfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw and his management team received praised by some who, in the past, criticized the railroad's performance, including Amit Bose, administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration, the nation's rail regulator.\n\nNorfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw, third from left, listens to testimony during a hearing held by the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee on March 22, 2023 in Washington, DC. The committee heard testimony on \"Improving Rail Safety in response to the East Palestine Derailment.\" Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nIn a letter to Norfolk Southern in February soon after the takeover effort started, Bose praise the railroad instituting a \"confidential close call reporting system\" similar to one in place for decades at the nation's railroads to allow employees to report safety issues without fear of reprisal, as well as increasing staffing and training. He said Shaw's safety efforts \"are important and demonstrate the ability to make progress when railroads make safety a priority.\" And he said that NS was the only Class I railroad to achieve significant reductions in the rate of mainline derailments last year.\n\nHis letter suggested his concerns that that progress could be lost due to the takeover battle.\n\n\"While I recognize NS for the meaningful steps and results seen so far, often in notable contrast to industry peers, I want to emphasize the importance of a durable and lasting path forward that continues to prioritize safety,\" he wrote. \"Any backsliding, as a result of a change in leadership or otherwise, on the safety-oriented path you have laid out and communicated to us will likely attract renewed oversight attention from my office.\"\n\nUnions split on which side should win\n\nAfter initially being united in opposition to the takeover effort, the railroad's unions are now split on the takeover battle.\n\nMost of the unions remain supportive of current CEO Alan Shaw and Norfolk Southern's current board.\n\n\"NS and Shaw have placed a unique focus on establishing a culture that addresses safety concerns that other carriers have not,\" said a letter from Jeremy Ferguson, president of SMART-TD, the union that represents more than 5,000 conductors at the railroad.\n\nThe Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET), which represents more than 3,000 engineers at the railroad, joined the other unions at the railroad in initially endorsing Norfolk management, saying that Ancora's plans for Norfolk would be \"reckless\" and \"likely to lead to more train wrecks.\" It said Ancora's PSR plan \"requires railroads to do more with less which equates to longer trains, deferred maintenance of track and equipment, shorter inspections of rolling stock and a reduction in staffing numbers.\"\n\nAnd it praised the changes that Shaw had made to improve safety since the February 2023 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.\n\n\"Shaw was only on the job for a few months prior to the disaster. Since the derailment last year, NS' CEO has risen to the occasion and, through his leadership, NS has become a safer, more efficient and customer focused company again,\" said Jerry Sturdivant, a BLET union official at Norfolk Southern, back in February.\n\nReversing course\n\nBut the BLET said the changes that Norfolk Southern has made to try to answer Ancora's takeover efforts are taking the railroad in the wrong direction. It is particularly upset with the work of the railroad's new chief operating officer, John Orr, hired in March from Canadian Pacific Kansas City, for a pay package with a target value of $10.3 million.\n\nBLET said that Orr's appointment shows that Norfolk Southern is committed to additional use of PSR, no matter which side wins the the proxy fight. And it said it has received assurances of other safety improvements from Ancora, including dropping all plans to have single-person crews on long-distance trains.\n\nThe current labor contract requires both an engineer and a conductor in the locomotive, and a recent proposed federal rule would codify the requirement. Although that rule has yet to take effect and could be reversed in the future. And the nation's major railroads would still prefer to remove the conductors from the trains, arguing it can be done without reducing safety.\n\n\"Although we initially supported Mr. Shaw and Norfolk Southern's management in this contest, today he leads a different team with an unproven strategy,\" said a statement from three BLET officials at the railroad. \"The ever-changing and inconsistent policies that we have been hearing from the railroad's current leadership in recent weeks forced BLET to take another look at Ancora and its nominees. We ultimately made a final decision to support the Ancora slate and CEO choice.\"\n\nThe Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees Division (BMWED) whose members perform track maintenance, joined the BLET in switching support to Ancora.\n\n\"For many months since East Palestine, the BMWED has not been able to get assurances from the current leadership to implement needed policy and procedural changes to prevent such tragedies from reoccurring,\" it said. \"At this juncture, seeing no path forward, we see no reason to support the current administration at Norfolk Southern.\"\n\nA Norfolk Southern train passes underneath a bridge on February 25, 2023 in East Palestine, Ohio. On February 3rd, a Norfolk Southern Railways train carrying toxic chemicals derailed causing an environmental disaster. Michael Swensen/Getty Images\n\nAncora has tapped former UPS executive Jim Barber to be the next CEO if it wins. Both BLET and BMWE are part of the Teamsters union, which has more than 300,000 members working for UPS.\n\nShaw and Norfolk Southern's management still has the support of the other unions at the railroad, which between them represent about 60% of the unionized employees there. SMART-TD issued a statement calling the BLET \"Judas,\" saying union leadership \"should be ashamed.\"\n\n\"They were willing to hand over everything our movement has done to defend our men and women against PSR at NS,\" said SMART-TD.\n\nShaw and current Norfolk Southern management \"have made a conscious effort to diverge from the operating ratio-obsessed mentality that has degraded rail service and safety... and have made safety, employees and customers their priority,\" it said in a separate statement.\n\nUp to investors\n\nBut no matter what the unions and safety regulator thinks about the choices, the decision will ride with shareholders who are likely displeased by the performance of the company's stock, and the financial results.\n\nShares of Norfolk Southern are down 8% from where they were before the February 3 2023 derailment, compared to a 5% gain in CSX shares and 13% rise in shares of Union Pacific. Norfolk's profit margin is also lower than industry averages and it shrank in the first quarter compared to a year earlier, even when stripping out the cost of the derailment.\n\nThe Ancora takeover effort has gotten endorsement from two leading shareholder services firms, Glass Lewis and ISS.\n\n\"Having given due consideration to the arguments presented by each side, we believe Ancora has presented a compelling case for supporting a substantial overhaul of the Company's current leadership,\" said a statement from Glass Lewis.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Activist investor Ancora Holdings Group came away with a partial victory as it placed three of its nominees on the board.\n\nNorfolk Chair Amy Miles was not elected. The company said it would elect a new chair at its next meeting, to be scheduled in the coming weeks.\n\nThe results, which still must be certified, mark the culmination of a campaign that had become increasingly acrimonious in recent months, with Ancora accusing Shaw of poor decision-making that led to weak operating results and an underperforming stock. While the vote likely means that Shaw will remain in place, he'll need to find common ground with a firm that now has several board seats.\n\nNorfolk said in a statement that it \"will work constructively and collaboratively\" on behalf of shareholders with the new-look board.\n\nAncora's aim was to win majority board representation in order to force out Shaw and the chief operating officer. The firm had intended to install Jim Barber, a former executive at United Parcel Service Inc., as Norfolk's CEO and hire railroad executive Jamie Boychuk as COO.\n\nAmong the investor's seven-person slate, it won support for three: William Clyburn Jr., Sameh Fahmy and Gilbert Lamphere. Ancora said in a statement after the vote that it would \"continue to hold Mr. Shaw to account and push for the appointment of a qualified operator who can actually drive shareholder value.\"\n\nThe firm said at Thursday's meeting that it received \"overwhelming support\" from active shareholders and thanked unions that supported its nominees. However, Ancora said it failed to receive backing from passive investors.\n\n\"For passive shareholders, if anything goes wrong here or if there is another derailment, it's on you,\" said Jim Chadwick, president of alternatives at Ancora. He added that his firm would still work with those investors.\n\nThe campaign generated heated rhetoric and split opinion among various stakeholders. A pair of Teamsters union divisions, proxy adviser Glass Lewis & Co. and customer Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. backed Ancora. In Norfolk's corner were Lincoln Energy Solutions and Centennial Energy, as well as departing Surface Transportation Board Chair Martin Oberman. Adviser Institutional Shareholder Services also supported Shaw and several Norfolk board candidates.\n\nShaw took the helm in 2022, calling for a rethink of the precision scheduled railroading efficiency strategy that has dominated in the industry for more than a decade.

Ancora had rebuffed past settlement offers that didn't include Shaw's ouster.\n\nThe boardroom victory is still a milestone for Ancora, a $10 billion Ohio investment firm that launched an activism practice just 10 years ago and scored a series of smaller wins leading up to the election at Norfolk Southern. It caps an impressive campaign that saw the activist win unexpected support from unions, customers, and, perhaps most importantly, Glass Lewis and ISS, the influential proxy advisory firms.\n\nWhile Shaw's ouster was Ancora's most pressing demand, the activist firm laid out broader accusations of failed governance and asserted that the company's proposed operating approach was unproductive.\n\nThe activist had argued that Norfolk Southern should adopt a model known as precision-scheduled railroading, or PSR, which has delivered impressive shareholder returns at other railroads. However, critics have said the model leaves railroads ill-equipped to handle surges in demand.\n\nNorfolk Southern had first argued against PSR in favor of its proposed resiliency model, which would keep rail crews and cars on standby to handle those cyclical surges in demand.\n\nBut the company abruptly changed tack during the fight, hiring a well-known PSR operator as chief operating officer and implementing some of those precision principles.\n\nGovernment officials, who had previously voiced their support for Norfolk over Ancora, were momentarily silenced by the reversal. Labor groups accounting for some 40% of Norfolk's union employees shifted their support to Ancora, and major customer Cleveland Cliffs endorsed Ancora's proposed picks and plan.\n\nThe dissident also won support from proxy advisors Glass Lewis and ISS. ISS recommended that shareholders support five of Ancora's seven picks but did not recommend electing Ancora CEO pick Jim Barber to the board. Glass Lewis endorsed six of Ancora's nominees.

Of course, I am talking about the proxy battle initiated and being fiercely -- I might even say viciously -- waged by Ancora against the current leadership of Norfolk Southern.\"\n\nWhether Oberman's comments would have made any difference weeks ago is questionable. It is even less certain whether they had an impact just nine days before Norfolk Southern's (NYSE: NSC) annual meeting, as many proxy votes presumably have already been cast.\n\nAncora is seeking to oust Shaw as well as Norfolk Southern's newly appointed COO, John Orr, and several members of the board of directors, including Chair Amy Miles. Ancora's picks to replace Shaw and Orr are, respectively, Jim Barber, a former UPS executive, and Jamie Boychuk, a former CSX executive.\n\nWhile Oberman has often discussed railroad staffing levels in his critiques, one of the first issues he raised in his Chicago address was what he said was a plan by Ancora to deemphasize intermodal traffic in favor of manifest trains, which have multiple cars carrying different types of freight.\n\n\"They want to deemphasize intermodal -- for only one reason,\" he said. \"Manifest traffic is carried at a lower OR than intermodal. Not that intermodal isn't profitable. It's just not as profitable, Ancora says, to make their shareholders richer faster. This is a short-sighted strategy which cannot be sustained in the long run.\"\n\nOberman said intermodal is crucial. \"Intermodal now accounts for about 50% of all rail traffic, and that is where the future is,\" he said.\n\nHe cited the work of well-respected rail consultancy Oliver Wyman, which he said sees $177 billion in revenue that would be jeopardized if trains keep losing business to trucks at the current pace.\n\n\"If railroads just hold on to their current percentage of intermodal, they will keep that $177 billion,\" Oberman said. \"But most importantly, if they simply employ their existing capacity, they can not only keep the $177 billion but add an additional $61 billion in intermodal by 2030. And that is profitable traffic.\n\n\"Rather than detailing plans for adding carloads to the railroad, what you find in the endless pages of Ancora's presentations are detailed spreadsheets how they are going to cut, cut, cut resources and how fast their [operating ratio] is going to come down in the next few years if they prevail.\"\n\nOberman said Norfolk Southern \"has made more progress in building a resilient railroad\" than any other Class 1 railroad in recent years.\n\n\"But Ancora has missed the boat on resiliency,\" he added. \"Indeed, its attack on NS is centered on its view that resiliency is a huge mistake and needs to be eliminated.\"\n\nHe then turned his attention to Barber. According to Oberman, Barber, a former executive at UPS, has boasted of hiring 100,000 employees around Christmas who would then be let go, with the idea that a new round of employees could be hired the next holiday season. According to Oberman, Barber will seek similar \"resiliency\" at Norfolk Southern.\n\nAnd in characteristic bluntness, Oberman said, \"Indeed, with due respect to the hard-working folks at UPS, it just doesn't take as much skill and training to load a cardboard carton into the back of a van as it does to drive a locomotive or handle complex rail car movements in a yard.\"\n\nNS published a press release Monday touting Oberman's comments. That press release became the basis for a proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nProxy filings submitted to the SEC by either Ancora or Norfolk Southern total 16 just since May 1. Eight were filed on Monday alone.\n\nIn a sign that Ancora considers everything fair game, one of the activist investor's two filings Monday called for the resignation of board member Claude Mongeau because of his role as a board member of TD Bank. TD Bank is the subject of a recently launched money laundering probe.\n\nMeanwhile, the six proxy filings from Norfolk Southern besides Oberman's comments also included pro-management statements from several shippers, including such companies as Lincoln Energy Solutions and Centennial Energy. It included a pair of tweets posted by the railroad as well.\n\nMore articles by John Kingston\n\nRXO, still suffering from weak market, touts Q1 volume growth\n\nC.H.

Activist investor Ancora Holdings Group came away with a partial victory as it placed three of its nominees on the board.\n\nNorfolk Chair Amy Miles was not elected. The company said it would elect a new chair at its next meeting, to be scheduled in the coming weeks.\n\nThe results, which still must be certified, mark the culmination of a campaign that had become increasingly acrimonious in recent months, with Ancora accusing Shaw of poor decision-making that led to weak operating results and an underperforming stock. While the vote likely means that Shaw will remain in place, he'll need to find common ground with a firm that now has several board seats.\n\nRead More: Activist Wants to Fire Railroad CEO for His Lack of Ruthlessness\n\nNorfolk said in a statement that it \"will work constructively and collaboratively\" on behalf of shareholders with the new-look board.\n\nThe company's shares fell 4.5% at 9:32 a.m. in New York after the results were revealed.\n\nAncora's aim was to win majority board representation in order to force out Shaw and the chief operating officer. The firm had intended to install Jim Barber, a former executive at United Parcel Service Inc., as Norfolk's CEO and hire railroad executive Jamie Boychuk as COO.\n\nAmong the investor's seven-person slate, it won support for three: William Clyburn Jr., Sameh Fahmy and Gilbert Lamphere. Ancora said in a statement after the vote that it would \"continue to hold Mr. Shaw to account and push for the appointment of a qualified operator who can actually drive shareholder value.\"\n\nThe firm said at Thursday's meeting that it received \"overwhelming support\" from active shareholders and thanked unions that supported its nominees. However, Ancora said it failed to receive backing from passive investors.\n\n\"For passive shareholders, if anything goes wrong here or if there is another derailment, it's on you,\" said Jim Chadwick, president of alternatives at Ancora. He added that his firm would still work with those investors.\n\nThe campaign generated heated rhetoric and split opinion among various stakeholders. A pair of Teamsters union divisions, proxy adviser Glass Lewis & Co. and customer Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. backed Ancora. In Norfolk's corner were Lincoln Energy Solutions and Centennial Energy, as well as departing Surface Transportation Board Chair Martin Oberman.

vote", "body": "The leadership battle at US railroad Norfolk Southern (NS) has ramped up in the last week as unions, customers, and even regulators have taken sides in the company's fight against new board member proposals from investor group Ancora.\n\nBoth sides of the proxy battle have received support from industry figures recently as the fight comes to a head this week with NS' Annual General Meeting on 9 May where votes on all the board nominees will be tallied and key leadership figure such as CEO Alan Shaw could be ousted in favour of Ancora's CEO nominee Jim Barber.\n\nThis week, NS leadership touted the support of Surface Transportation Board (STB) Chairman Martin Oberman who described Ancora's campaign to install new leadership, including a new COO, as causing \"serious concerns to all rail stakeholders.\"\n\nSpeaking at a North American rail conference, Oberman said that Ancora seemed to be \"operating on a different planet\" in regard to its proposals to decrease NS' focus on intermodal traffic, saying that the investment firm was \"unaware of changes in the railroad industry over the last 20 years\" that had highlighted intermodal as the \"future of growth\".\n\nMeanwhile, Ancora has been highlighting support from two unions that represent 41.5% of NS workers, with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen Division (BLET) Teamsters and the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees Division (BMWED) Teamsters both backing the activist investment firm.\n\nBMWED President Tony Cardwell said that after a \"reasonably constructive\" meeting with Ancora's proposed leadership team, his union had decided to support their changes.\n\nHe said: \"The BMWED-IBT, after more than a year of non-committal hedging on reasonable, needed changes and untenable shakiness in management at Norfolk Southern, has determined that a change in leadership is needed for the freight rail carrier and its employees.\"\n\nThe months long battle for the future of NS has seen frequent accusations and barbs thrown between the two sides, with Ancora's complaints about current leadership focussing on issues such as the railroad's safety record, maximising operating and staff efficiencies, and implementing Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR) more extremely.\n\nOn the last point in particular, Ancora has said that increasing the level of PSR used at NS would reduce the volume of trains in operation, install a timetable that \"supports more predictable costs\", and lead to a reduced headcount, particularly pointing to its COO candidate's, Jamie Boychuk, experience with the system at rival railroad CSX.\n\nHowever, some industry sources such as union group the Transportation Trades Department (TTD) of AFL-CIO have warned that Ancora's proposals would be doubling down on a \"failed strategy\" while Oberman said that the changes promoted by Boychuk at CSX caused \"immediate and catastrophic consequences\" to the industry.", "source":

Ancora had rebuffed past settlement offers that didn't include Shaw's ouster.\n\nThe boardroom victory is still a milestone for Ancora, a $10 billion Ohio investment firm that launched an activism practice just ten years ago and scored a series of smaller wins leading up to the election at NSC. It caps an impressive campaign that saw the activist win unexpected support from unions, customers and, perhaps most importantly, Glass Lewis and ISS, the influential proxy advisory firms.\n\nWhile Shaw's ouster was Ancora's most pressing demand, the activist firm laid out broader accusations of failed governance and asserted that the company's proposed operating approach was unproductive. The activist had argued that Norfolk Southern should adopt a model known as precision-scheduled railroading, which has delivered impressive shareholder returns at other railroads but which its critics have said leaves railroads ill-equipped to handle surges in demand.\n\nNorfolk Southern had first argued against PSR in favor of its proposed resiliency model, which would keep rail crews and cars on standby to handle those cyclical surges in demand. But the company abruptly changed tack in the midst of the fight, hiring a well-known PSR operator as COO and implementing some of those precision principles.\n\nGovernment officials, which had previously voiced their support for Norfolk over Ancora, were momentarily silenced by the reversal. Labor groups accounting for some 40% of Norfolk's union employees shifted their support to Ancora, and major customer Cleveland Cliffs endorsed Ancora's proposed picks and plan.\n\nThe dissident also won support from proxy advisors Glass Lewis and ISS. ISS recommended that shareholders support five of Ancora's seven picks but did not recommend electing Ancora CEO pick Jim Barber to the board. Glass Lewis endorsed six of Ancora's nominees. Both said change was needed at the railroad.", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNBC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rohan_goswami@cnbc.com", "name": "Rohan Goswami", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Southern_Railway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norfolk Southern Railway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Proxy firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_Lewis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glass Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proxy voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Labor Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief operating officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norfolk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norfolk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107231688-1682543857645-IMG_1135r.jpg?v=1682544063&w=1920&h=1080", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547002", "eventUri": "eng-9547002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

On Thursday, NS shareholders will have their say during the railroad's annual shareholder meeting.\n\nOn one side of the battle is CEO Alan Shaw, who is hoping to keep the job that he has held for just two years. On the other is Ancora Holdings, a major shareholder that is offering up its own board nominees and executive leadership team on the belief that they can squeeze more profit out of the Class I railroad. In the weeks leading up to the May 9 vote, shippers, unions, and regulators have all had their say about who they believe is best fit to lead the railroad.\n\nAt the core of Ancora's critique of Shaw is that the CEO kept too many additional resources on hand during a traffic downturn and that he made missteps following last year's fiery train wreck in East Palestine, Ohio. Ancora would like to bring in former UPS chief operating officer Jim Barber in as NS' new CEO and former CSX executive Jamie Boychuk as the new chief operating officer. Ultimately the shareholders' group wants NS to implement Precision Scheduled Railroading -- a practice that is known to squeeze maximum profit out of railroads -- at a more rapid pace.\n\nAncora's attempt to oust Shaw began earlier this year and they have taken every opportunity to criticize him. In March, after a derailment in Pennsylvania, Ancora called for the CEO's resignation.\n\nAncora has been able to line up some support for its bid, including from major shippers like steel producer Cleveland-Cliffs. It also got the support of two unions, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees. But documents published by a competing union suggest that BLET is trying to get a better deal for its members by supporting new management.\n\nFor his part, Shaw said the railroad is getting back on track after the fallout from East Palestine and that shareholders should stay the course.\n\n\"The choice really couldn't be any more clear for our shareholders,\" Shaw told the Associated Press. \"We make promises and we've continued to keep our promises, and we will continue to deliver. And we've got a long-term vision for Norfolk Southern where shareholders win, as opposed to the activists who've got a short-term and erratic approach where shareholders lose.\"\n\nAmong Shaw's defenders is retiring U.S. Surface Transportation Board Chair Martin Obermann, who has been heavily critical of the push to PSR.\n\n\"It's not my position to urge shareholders how to vote in this election,\" he said at a shipper's conference last week. \"It is my responsibility to call out serious threats to the national rail network.\"\n\nHe went on to say that running a railroad with the bare minimum of people and equipment might work when \"the sun is shining\" but not when problems arise, as history has shown.\n\n\"We are now confronting a situation where one group is either completely ignorant of these recent past lessons or has willfully chosen to ignore them in an effort to make a quick buck,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "railfan.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Railfan & Railroad Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "justin_franz@railfan.com", "name": "Justin Franz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad_classes", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Railroad classes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Southern_Railway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norfolk Southern Railway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railfan_&_Railroad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Railfan & Railroad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief operating officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Palestine,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Palestine, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Palestine, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland-Cliffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland-Cliffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Locomotive_Engineers_and_Trainmen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derailment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derailment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Parcel_Service", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Parcel Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSX_Transportation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CSX Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Transportation_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surface Transportation Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/History", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/History", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/Art_and_Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/Art and Graphics", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/Rail-fanning_and_Train-spotting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/Rail-fanning and Train-spotting", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/Photographs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/Photographs", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://railfan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/rfr-prr-signals-lily-eb.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547002", "eventUri": "eng-9547002", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 549, "textEnd": 554}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Following a months-long proxy battle launched by activist investor Ancora Holdings Group and punctuated by harsh rhetoric and personal attacks, 10 of Norfolk Southern's existing Board members remain in place. Ancora won three seats. President and CEO Alan Shaw will not be replaced. Nor will Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer John Orr.\n\nGil Lamphere, Sameh Fahmy and William Clyburn Jr. -- all excellent additions, in my humble opinion -- will join Richard H. Anderson, Philip S. Davidson, Francesca A. DeBiase, Marcela E. Donadio, Mary Kathryn \"Heidi\" Heitkamp, John C. Huffard, Jr., Christopher T. Jones, Thomas C. Kelleher, Claude Mongeau and Alan H. Shaw on Norfolk Southern's 13-member board. Once finalized, each will serve a one-year term expiring in 2025.\n\n(The results are considered preliminary until final results are tabulated and certified by the independent Inspector of Elections. Final results will be reported on a Form 8-K that will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.)\n\nLamphere is Chairman of MidRail Corporation and co-founder of MidSouth Rail Corporation. Fahmy is former EVP of Precision Scheduled Railroading at Kansas City Southern. Clyburn Jr. is a former Commissioner and Vice Chairman of the U.S. Surface Transportation Board.\n\n\"We appreciate the support of our shareholders and the valuable perspectives they have shared with us in the months leading up to our Annual Meeting,\" said NS in a statement. \"Our shareholders recognize that positive change is under way at Norfolk Southern. Moving forward, we will continue building on the significant progress Alan Shaw, John Orr and the entire team have already achieved. Together, we are building a safer, more profitable railroad, closing the margin gap with our peers, and ultimately growing value for our shareholders. We welcome William Clyburn, Jr., Sameh Fahmy, and Gilbert Lamphere to our board. We will work constructively and collaboratively on behalf of our shareholders unlocking the full potential of our powerful franchise.\n\n\"We thank Amy E. Miles, Jennifer F. Scanlon, and John R. Thompson for their dedication and service to our franchise. We also thank outgoing directors Thomas Bell, Mitchell Daniels, Steven Leer and Michael Lockhart, each of whom did not stand for re-election to the Board, for their multiple years of service to Norfolk Southern.\"\n\n\"We have the best team in the industry,\" said Shaw. \"I'm confident that we will have a strong and constructive relationship with our new directors. Our work is not done.\"\n\nSo, for the second time in as many years, Ancora failed to achieve its objective. Curiously, iins separate interviews with CNBC \"Closing Bell: Overtime\" co-anchor Morgan Brennan and Wall Street Journal reporter Esther Fung, Ancora Alternatives LLC President Jim Chadwick provided two very different perspectives.\n\n\"What does success look like?,\" asked Brennan roughly two months ago. \"I know you have seven board nominees, which would be the majority of the board, looking to change the management, but it could go a variety of ways here. How are you gaming it out, and what are the lessons learned from some of your previous proxy fights, including at other freight and logistics companies like C. H. Robinson?\n\n\"That's a good example because that probably is one of the primary lessons learned is when you're in a situation where you're trying to drive change at the top. When I mentioned those rail activists, examples of Canadian Pacific and CSX, that was involving change at the CEO position. Whenever you're trying to change out the CEO, and that's what's required to drive ultimate value in the company, it requires a greater amount of change in support on the board. We've seen in the case of C.H. Robinson, even when you have phenomenal people as potential candidates to run those companies, if you don't have really the numbers on the board to make that happen, a board that is prone to making bad decisions will continue to make bad decisions. This board here at Norfolk Southern has shown over and over again, just as they did here with this Meridian Speedway arrangement for John Orr, that they are concerned about themselves and entrenchment. And ultimately, I think if shareholders want a plan and want a team that's going to execute and really win that, look, there's a lot of versions of success, but I think the message around the vote for seven, ultimately, that's how we control our own fate and we have a plan and we believe we're going to execute it.\"\n\n\"We have repeatedly stated a desire to settle for minority change of the board and an orderly CEO transition, which appears inevitable at this point given fading confidence in Mr. Shaw,\" Ancora told the WSJ in a May 6 statement.\n\nChadwick, as expected, took a few final, exaggerated parting shots in his allocated three-minute remarks prior to the call for final proxy votes. He mentioned how the East Palestine accident -- which of course was awful -- \"destroyed a town in my home state.\" It did not, and Norfolk Southern's response was not \"tone deaf,\" as Ancora said at the outset.\n\nNow that the dust has just about settled, and cooler, experienced heads -- Lamphere, Fahmy and Clyburn -- have prevailed (and I have it on good authority that none of the new board members were pleased with the nasty rhetoric spewed by Ancora and its public relations outfit, but nevertheless had little recourse but to swallow it), the work will continue at NS. As Alan Shaw said, \"Our work is not done.\"\n\nBy Jason Seidl (Railway Age Wall Street Contributing Editor), Matt Elkott, Elliott Alper and Uday Khanapurkar\n\nNSC's proxy battle concluded with disappointing results for activist Ancora, which secured only three Board seats and was unable to dislodge current CEO Alan Shaw. Shareholders voted to reinstate 10 NSC directors but did not support the Board Chair, conveying the expectation that operational improvements should continue to be the focus at the Eastern Class I, in line with ISS's commentary ahead of the meeting.\n\nWith just three directors, Ancora only has a minority representation on the Board and will likely find it difficult to steer change in their desired direction in our view. We believe the activist will continue to advocate for its CEO and COO candidates, but to little avail. We saw this pattern play out during Ancora's activist campaign at CHRW which resulted in only two Board seats and the inability to place Jim Barber in the CEO role (we note that is the second time Ancora has failed to place him in a CEO role).\n\nWhile shares are down on the news, operating changes have already been put into motion at NSC with John Orr's appointment (early improvements in service metrics were discussed extensively on the 1Q earnings call). We expect NSC to remain committed to its 2024 exit OR rate of 64%-65% and further convergence with peers beyond that as the Class I continues to reorient toward traditional PSR implementation. We also note that price action today should moderate the valuation gap between NSC and CSX ($34, Hold). With today's intraday decline, our $253 PT currently implies ~13% upside to the stock.", "source": {"uri": "rtands.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Railway Track and Structures"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shaw_(bowls)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alan Shaw (bowls)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Orr_(bishop)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Orr (bishop)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Southern_Railway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norfolk Southern Railway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_fight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Proxy fight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_H._Anderson_(general)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard H.

The accident, which raised questions about safety across the North American rail freight industry, has been blamed for spreading dangerous pollutants in the area -- a claim that the Atlanta-based company has denied.\n\nAncora's board appointments, which include a former executive at the US railway regulator Surface Transportation Board, mark a partial victory for the $10bn hedge fund.

the railway operator drew criticism from many industry observers, who warned it could leave railroads under-resourced.\n\nHatch said the activists' assertion that the railroad needed a comprehensive revamp -- to be \"taken down to the studs\", as they said -- might have been decisive in shifting the mood against their campaign.\n\nThe campaign by the activists had been an opportunistic attack after the problems caused by the East Palestine disaster, Hatch added.\n\n\"They just saw the slowest gazelle in the herd and pounced,\" he said.\n\nTheir strategy had also faced criticism from Martin Oberman, the outgoing chair of the STB.\n\nOberman, who leaves his post on Friday, told a meeting of North American rail shippers earlier this month that, while he would not tell anyone how to vote, it was his responsibility to \"call out serious threats to the national rail network\".\n\n\"Everything about Ancora's campaign should cause serious concerns to all rail stakeholders,\" he said.\n\nHenry Posner, a veteran rail executive who is chair of the Iowa Interstate Railroad, said Norfolk Southern's management had been wrestling with issues including its market share and recovery from the East Palestine disaster.\n\n\"You have an investor group that senses weakness and a chance to implement a short-term strategy which will have negative implications for the long term in terms

Ancora had rebuffed past settlement offers that didn't include Shaw's ouster.\n\nThe boardroom victory is still a milestone for Ancora, a $10 billion Ohio investment firm that launched an activism practice just ten years ago and scored a series of smaller wins leading up to the election at NSC. It caps an impressive campaign that saw the activist win unexpected support from unions, customers and, perhaps most importantly, Glass Lewis and ISS, the influential proxy advisory firms.\n\nWhile Shaw's ouster was Ancora's most pressing demand, the activist firm laid out broader accusations of failed governance and asserted that the company's proposed operating approach was unproductive. The activist had argued that Norfolk Southern should adopt a model known as precision-scheduled railroading, which has delivered impressive shareholder returns at other railroads but which its critics have said leaves railroads ill-equipped to handle surges in demand.\n\nNorfolk Southern had first argued against PSR in favor of its proposed resiliency model, which would keep rail crews and cars on standby to handle those cyclical surges in demand. But the company abruptly changed tack in the midst of the fight, hiring a well-known PSR operator as COO and implementing some of those precision principles.\n\nGovernment officials, which had previously voiced their support for Norfolk over Ancora, were momentarily silenced by the reversal. Labor groups accounting for some 40% of Norfolk's union employees shifted their support to Ancora, and major customer Cleveland Cliffs endorsed Ancora's proposed picks and plan.\n\nThe dissident also won support from proxy advisors Glass Lewis and ISS. ISS recommended that shareholders support five of Ancora's seven picks but did not recommend electing Ancora CEO pick Jim Barber to the board. Glass Lewis endorsed six of Ancora's nominees.

I truly did not think that a CEO or COO could impact the overall organization the size of NS - but the last 3 or so years something has changed.

Based on preliminary vote results, shareholders voted to elect Ancora nominees William Clyburn, Jr., Sameh Fahmy and Gilbert Lamphere to the Company's Board of Directors (the \"Board\") at the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the \"Annual Meeting\"). This means that a majority of Norfolk Southern's Board will now be comprised of directors nominated or unopposed by Ancora.\n\nFrederick D. DiSanto, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ancora, and James Chadwick, President of Ancora Alternatives LLC, commented:\n\n\"It's an extremely positive development for shareholders that this campaign has driven significant changes at Norfolk Southern, including the ouster of the Board Chair, Governance Committee Chair and Compensation Committee Chair. This represents a loud and clear message to replace the Company's unqualified CEO and reconsider its ineffective strategy, which has driven industry-worst customer delivery times, severe derailments and persistent share price underperformance. Notably, CEO Alan Shaw received what we deem a resounding vote of no confidence based on preliminary voting results that indicate he barely received support from holders of 50% of the Company's outstanding shares. The first step toward turning around Norfolk Southern has been taken by electing Messrs. Clyburn, Fahmy and Lamphere. Given that we have no standstill agreement and a clear mandate from a critical mass of shareholders, we will continue to hold Mr. Shaw to account and push for the appointment of a qualified operator who can actually drive shareholder value. The campaign for change at this great American railroad will continue.\"\n\nFounded in 2003, Ancora Holdings Group, LLC offers integrated investment advisory, wealth management, retirement plan services and insurance solutions to individuals and institutions across the United States.

Following a months-long proxy battle launched by activist investor Ancora Holdings Group and punctuated by harsh rhetoric and personal attacks, 10 of Norfolk Southern's existing Board members remain in place. Ancora won three seats. President and CEO Alan Shaw will not be replaced. Nor will Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer John Orr.\n\nGil Lamphere, Sameh Fahmy and William Clyburn Jr. -- all excellent additions, in my humble opinion -- will join Richard H. Anderson, Philip S. Davidson, Francesca A. DeBiase, Marcela E. Donadio, Mary Kathryn \"Heidi\" Heitkamp, John C. Huffard, Jr., Christopher T. Jones, Thomas C. Kelleher, Claude Mongeau and Alan H. Shaw on Norfolk Southern's 13-member board. Once finalized, each will serve a one-year term expiring in 2025.\n\n(The results are considered preliminary until final results are tabulated and certified by the independent Inspector of Elections. Final results will be reported on a Form 8-K that will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.)\n\nLamphere is Chairman of MidRail Corporation and co-founder of MidSouth Rail Corporation. Fahmy is former EVP of Precision Scheduled Railroading at Kansas City Southern. Clyburn Jr. is a former Commissioner and Vice Chairman of the U.S. Surface Transportation Board.\n\n\"We appreciate the support of our shareholders and the valuable perspectives they have shared with us in the months leading up to our Annual Meeting,\" said NS in a statement. \"Our shareholders recognize that positive change is under way at Norfolk Southern. Moving forward, we will continue building on the significant progress Alan Shaw, John Orr and the entire team have already achieved. Together, we are building a safer, more profitable railroad, closing the margin gap with our peers, and ultimately growing value for our shareholders. We welcome William Clyburn, Jr., Sameh Fahmy, and Gilbert Lamphere to our board. We will work constructively and collaboratively on behalf of our shareholders unlocking the full potential of our powerful franchise.\n\n\"We thank Amy E. Miles, Jennifer F. Scanlon, and John R. Thompson for their dedication and service to our franchise. We also thank outgoing directors Thomas Bell, Mitchell Daniels, Steven Leer and Michael Lockhart, each of whom did not stand for re-election to the Board, for their multiple years of service to Norfolk Southern.\"\n\n\"We have the best team in the industry,\" said Shaw. \"I'm confident that we will have a strong and constructive relationship with our new directors. Our work is not done.\"\n\nSo, for the second time in as many years, Ancora failed to achieve its objective. Curiously, iins separate interviews with CNBC \"Closing Bell: Overtime\" co-anchor Morgan Brennan and Wall Street Journal reporter Esther Fung, Ancora Alternatives LLC President Jim Chadwick provided two very different perspectives.\n\n\"What does success look like?,\" asked Brennan roughly two months ago. \"I know you have seven board nominees, which would be the majority of the board, looking to change the management, but it could go a variety of ways here. How are you gaming it out, and what are the lessons learned from some of your previous proxy fights, including at other freight and logistics companies like C. H. Robinson?\n\n\"That's a good example because that probably is one of the primary lessons learned is when you're in a situation where you're trying to drive change at the top. When I mentioned those rail activists, examples of Canadian Pacific and CSX, that was involving change at the CEO position. Whenever you're trying to change out the CEO, and that's what's required to drive ultimate value in the company, it requires a greater amount of change in support on the board. We've seen in the case of C.H. Robinson, even when you have phenomenal people as potential candidates to run those companies, if you don't have really the numbers on the board to make that happen, a board that is prone to making bad decisions will continue to make bad decisions. This board here at Norfolk Southern has shown over and over again, just as they did here with this Meridian Speedway arrangement for John Orr, that they are concerned about themselves and entrenchment. And ultimately, I think if shareholders want a plan and want a team that's going to execute and really win that, look, there's a lot of versions of success, but I think the message around the vote for seven, ultimately, that's how we control our own fate and we have a plan and we believe we're going to execute it.\"\n\n\"We have repeatedly stated a desire to settle for minority change of the board and an orderly CEO transition, which appears inevitable at this point given fading confidence in Mr. Shaw,\" Ancora told the WSJ in a May 6 statement.", "source": {"uri": "railwayage.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Railway Age"}, "authors": [{"uri": "william_c_vantuono@railwayage.com", "name": "William C.

This represents a loud and clear message to replace the Company's unqualified CEO and reconsider its ineffective strategy, which has driven industry-worst customer delivery times, severe derailments and persistent share price underperformance. Notably, CEO Alan Shaw received what we deem a resounding vote of no confidence based on preliminary voting results that indicate he barely received support from holders of 50% of the Company's outstanding shares. The first step toward turning around Norfolk Southern has been taken by electing Messrs. Clyburn, Fahmy and Lamphere. Given that we have no standstill agreement and a clear mandate from a critical mass of shareholders, we will continue to hold Mr. Shaw to account and push for the appointment of a qualified operator who can actually drive shareholder value.

It's understandable why shareholders made a split decision.\n\nAlan Shaw and his team showed real leadership after the East Palestine disaster and made major moves to make the railroad safer and more competitive. However, changes in his team and strategy in recent weeks left many stakeholders and shareholders feeling uncertain about the railroad's future direction. BLET members in particular were alarmed by Shaw's pivot to Precision Scheduled Railroading. Ancora's nominees also backed PSR, a business model that has been proven to return short-term profits, but is unsafe, chases away customers, and wears out rolling stock over the long run. PSR is a recipe for decline and ultimate failure.\n\nDespite our issues with Ancora over PSR, the activist investors made commitments to expand the C3RS incident reporting program systemwide and they were committed to improvements in training programs, among other positive changes. They made it clear they had no issue with maintaining two-person crews.\n\nAnyone with common sense should see that as trains carrying dangerous cargoes get longer the crews shouldn't be getting smaller. But Alan Shaw, in clear contrast to Ancora's nominees, is arguably the industry's leading spokesman in opposition to maintaining two-person crews. He should reconsider that position.\n\nBLET's leaders look forward to working with the new board and the railroad's leadership on strategies that will grow the railroad, make it more competitive and safer for both workers and the communities served.

Read to learn more about the 25-year-old who secured the bronze medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics and went viral in one night!\n\nTo anyone watching NBC's live coverage of the gymnastics all-around men team final event on Monday night, the loomingcountdown clock for \"Nedoroscik Pommel\" was contrasted by a calm -- sometimes slumbering -- Nedoroscik, pommel horse specialist for the United States. .\n\nWith the bronze medal in reach for the three different teams going into the gymnastics team final, it came down to Nedoroscik's 45-second routine to endTeam USA's 16-year podium drought.\n\nGlasses off and game face on, Nedoroscik mounted the horizontal bar and delivered thehighest-scoring pommel horse performance of the day, exactly what team needed to hold off Great Britain and Ukraine men's gymnastics teams and win the bronze by a 2.266-point differential to the eventual fourth place finishers.\n\nIn addition to Nedoroscik's clutch pommel horse routine, the USA gymnasts A posted crucial scores on high bar with a 14.833 fromFrederick Richard andAsher Hong's 14.833 on vault to seal their bronze medal fate.\n\nMeet viral gymnastics sensation Stephen Nedoroscik\n\nThe Paris stadium erupted once Nedoroscik stuck the landing and viewers at home took to social media, making Nedoroscik viral not only for his clutch performance but also innocuously 'nerdy' appearance.\n\nBorn and raised in Worcester, Massachusetts , Nedoroscik attendedPenn State where he majored in electrical engineering and became a two-time NCAA national champion on the pommel horse while competing on the gymnastics team.\n\nHe is a four-time pommel horse champion and took home the gold medal on the pommel horse at the 2021 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. He is tied forthe most U.S. pommel horse titles in U.S. history.\n\nHis signature glasses -- sadly not worn for the purposes of cosplaying as superman's civilian alter ego -- are forstrabismus, or crossed eyes, a condition that can lead to double vision.\n\nNotoriouslythe most technically difficult event in men's artistic gymnastics, pommel horse has been a sore spot on Team USA's lineup for several years.\n\nOriginally hoping for a spot in the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, Nedoroscik missed a place on Team USA's squad after acostly fall during the trials.\n\nNedoroscik had a second chance at his dream during the trials for the 2024 Summer Olympics and realized that dream when he wasnamed to the team in June of this year.\n\nA score of 14.850 on the final day of the trials was enough to punch his ticket to Paris as a pommel horse specialist -- an acquisition that paid off ten-fold for Team USA on Monday night.\n\n\"This feels almost like, you know, my vengeance, right? Coming back swinging,\" Nedoroscik said aboutqualifying for the 2024 Olympic Games.\n\nWhat's next for Stephen Nedoroscik?\n\nThe only member of Team USA to qualify for the final of any individual

(Photo by Daniela ... [+] (Porcelli/Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images)\n\nKey information about Getty Images\n\nNedoroscik waited hours to perform on the pommel horse while his teammates went through the other five men's gymnastics events, and his routine was so anticipated that NBC aired an on-screen countdown.\n\nA photo of Nedoroscik waiting for his turn to perform with his glasses on and his eyes closed went viral on social media, with one post on X liked more than 370,000 times indicating that he sat there until he was activated as a sleeper agent, took off his glasses like Clark Kent and did a pommel horse routine that helped give the team its first medal in 16 years.\n\nNedoroscik helped introduce gymnastics to new fans: I've been rooting for this guy ever since I heard about him five minutes ago, one post, featuring a picture of Nedoroscik with his eyes closed, liked 100,000 times, says.\n\nNBC also got in on the memes, referring to Nedoroscik as the Clark Kent of the pommel horse in a post following his performance with side-by-side photos of the gymnast and Kent.\n\nPenn State University, where Nedoroscik attended and competed for the NCAA gymnastics team, posted an image of Nedoroscik with her eyes closed with the text superimposed: 1. Finish, 2. Pommel, 3. Start.\n\nWhen will Stephen Nedoroscik next compete?\n\nNedoroscik will compete in the men's pommel horse final on Saturday at 11:16 a.m. EDT, his final appearance during the Olympics. Nedoroscik is expected to be a medal contender. He advanced to the final with a score tied for the highest 15.200, although Irish gymnast Rhys McClenaghan won the tiebreaker, which is decided by the gymnast with the highest execution score.\n\nKey context\n\nNedoroscik, 25, was born and raised in Worcester, Massachusetts, and began gymnastics in 2003. Nedoroscik's coach, Syque Caesar, told The Washington Post that the gymnast is quirky, funny, goofy and dances to his own beat. Early in his career, Nedoroscik became known for his skills on the pommel horse, but he also gained attention for wearing glasses or goggles while competing. The glasses, which are not prescription, were a Secret Santa gift from his Penn State teammate Ben Cooperman, who joked that Nedoroscik should wear them while competing. \"I started to develop a goofy side when it came to competing and I was like, you know what? It would be fun to wear them. Let's wear them,\" Nedoroscik said. He didn't wear the glasses at the Olympics, telling Olympics.com after the team finals that he hadn't felt like wearing them lately. He's also known for solving Rubik's Cubes. On Monday, before the team finals, Nedoroscik said on Instagram that he had solved a Rubik's Cube in 9.32 seconds, which he considered a good omen. According to his TikTok bio, his Rubik's Cube record is 8.664 seconds. Nedoroscik competed for Penn States' NCAA gymnastics team from 2017 to 2020, where he became a two-time NCAA national champion on the pommel horse. He graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering.\n\nSurprising fact\n\nNedoroscik has competed exclusively on pommel horse for much of his career, unlike his Olympic teammates, who compete in all six men's gymnastics events. Nedoroscik won a gold medal on pommel horse at the 2021 World Gymnastics Championships, a first for the United States and the first gold medal by an American in any event since 2011. He is a four-time national champion on pommel horse.\n\nTangent\n\nNedoroscik scored 14.866 on the pommel horse in the men's team final Monday, the second-highest score on the apparatus that day. His performance helped the U.S. gymnasts claim the bronze medal, the first for the U.S. men's gymnastics team since 2008. Nedoroscik and four other gymnasts Asher Hong, Paul Juda, Frederick Richard and Brody Malone had a total score of 257.793, more than four points higher than their qualifying score of 253.229, where they placed fifth. The U.S. team won bronze behind Japan, the gold medalist, and China, which took silver.\n\nFurther reading\n\nU.S. Men's Gymnastics Team Wins First Olympic Medal in 16 Years (Forbes)\n\nStephen Nedoroscik waited his whole life for a number.

He breathed slowly to lower his heart rate, he told Today.\n\nWhen it was his turn, Nedoroscik ditched his glasses and Team USA jacket and headed to the pommel horse. And in a near-perfect 40-second routine of quickly swinging both legs around his body and flinging himself into a walking handstand, Nedoroscik secured the team's bronze medal. His teammates' reactions were as euphoric as they might have been if they'd won gold.\n\n\"I don't know what's happening, did we do it?\" he asked his teammates after they hoisted him into the air, triumphant.\n\nThough they won together, it's Nedoroscik who's broken out as the fan favorite, even with his limited performance time. He's earning Clark Kent comparisons for the unassuming demeanor and similar specs he wears before losing both to become a confident pommel horse hero.\n\nNedoroscik, for his part, thinks the memes he's inspired are \"awesome.\"\n\n\"I'm representing people who wear glasses well,\" he said, beaming, in a Tuesday appearance on \"Today.\"\n\nHere's what to know about Nedoroscik, the US men's gymnastics team's very own Superman.\n\nHe's Team USA's pommel horse pro\n\nStephen Nedoroscik defied gravity on the pommel horse at Monday's men's gymnastics team final.\n\nAbbie Parr/AP\n\nWhile teammates like Brody Malone and Fred Richard flit between events like rings and vault, Nedoroscik only performs on one apparatus: pommel horse. He's the first American gymnast to make the Olympic team as a specialist in a single event, according to his training gym, Evo Gymnastics in Sarasota, Florida.\n\nHe dropped the other events in artistic gymnastics seven year ago, he told USA Gymnastics, after winning two Junior Olympic National titles in pommel horse and joining Penn State's men's gymnastics program.\n\nSpecializing has succeeded: Commentators said that he's perhaps the best in the world at what he does.\n\nNedoroscik, it seems, takes himself less seriously than he does his sport.\n\n\"I go internationally and I see all the other (pommel) horse specialists. It seems to be a universal thing that we're quirky people that are kind of just fun,\" he said.\n\nHe was a world champion before Paris\n\nNedoroscik and the US men's gymnastics team earned a bronze medal in Paris, but on another world stage, he's won gold.\n\nAt the 2021 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Kitakyushu, Japan, conditions were less than ideal for Nedoroscik to medal at all: The phenom had broken his hand.\n\nIt didn't matter: Nedoroscik still came in first -- the first time the US had ever earned a gold medal for pommel horse at a world championship.\n\nStateside, he's been crowned the US pommel horse champion four times, tying the record for most pommel horse wins, per USA Gymnastics.\n\nThe Paris Games are Nedoroscik's first Olympics -- he missed the chance in 2020 after a disappointing performance in the Olympic trials.\n\n\"I messed up,\" he told CNN affiliate WBBH in Fort Myers, Florida, ahead of this year's Games. \"I felt the pressure and kind of crumbled under it.\"\n\nBut the blow didn't keep him down for long. Nedoroscik decided to \"redirect that energy immediately,\" get back in the gym and keep training. He followed up those disappointing trials with his thrilling performance at the world championships, and since then, he's kept on winning.\n\nHe's a puzzle fiend\n\nAs if competing at the highest level of gymnastics weren't enough, Nedoroscik is also an \u00fcber-competitive puzzler. His personal record for solving a Rubik's Cube is 8.6 seconds.\n\nHe took time off from \"cubing,\" though, after a particularly hard puzzle consumed his downtime. His gymnastics teammate Fred Richard turned him on to \"killer sudoku,\" a version of the puzzle that involves more math. Nedoroscik found a killer sudoku puzzle that claimed to be the \"world's hardest,\" and after 45 hours of puzzling, he became the 43rd person in the world to solve it.\n\nThe experience nearly ruined the Rubik's Cube for him, he said.\n\n\"I tried to get back into cubing, and it wasn't the same,\" he told USA Gymnastics ahead of the Olympics. \"I was kind of lost.\"\n\nHis cubing slump ended along with the US men's gymnastics drought at the Olympics. He brought his trusty cube with him to Paris and solved it on the day of the team final in just over nine seconds.\n\n\"It's stress relief,\" he said on his Tuesday \"Today\" appearance. \"Sometimes I make the excuse that it's good for wrist rehab, too.\"\n\nHe competes with an eye sensitivity\n\nThe specs are cool for Clark Kent comparisons, but without them, Nedoroscik wouldn't be able to see his adoring crowd at the Olympics. Nedoroscik has strabismus, or crossed eyes, and has trouble seeing without them.\n\nOn \"Today,\" while wearing host Hoda Kotb's borrowed Ray-Bans, Nedoroscik said that when he's up on the pommel horse without his glasses, he depends not on sight but feel.\n\n\"I don't even really see when I'm doing my gymnastics,\" he said. \"It's all in the hands. I can feel everything.\"\n\nHe hasn't always competed with limited vision. Nedoroscik used to wear goggles on the pommel horse during his time at Penn State, but he said in June that he \"hadn't really felt like\" wearing them on the Olympic stage.\n\nHe hinted that the new look may have had something to do with testing his own limits.\n\n\"Sometimes, I like to push the boundaries,\" he said.\n\nPushing paid off in Paris. His kryptonite is not, it seems, the pressure of performing on the world's biggest stage in sports.\n\nHe'll have a brief break between the Olympics and his next venture: Swinging around the US with Simone Biles and some of his men's gymnastics teammates on the Gold Over America tour. The pommel horse pro will take the stage beginning in September.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scottie_andrew@cnn.com", "name": "Scottie

Due to his specialty, the U.S. men's gymnastics team walked away from the Olympics with a bronze medal -- the team's first in men's gymnastics since 2008.\n\nMikulak, a three-time Olympian turned coach, told the athlete that he didn't need to go all out. That 80% would be good enough, even though Mikulak knew full well that Nedoroscik never does anything -- whether in his sport or solving a Rubik's Cube -- at 80%.\n\nThe announcers struggled to put into words the pressure Nedoroscik was under as Team USA closed in on its first team medal since 2008. \"You have to trick yourself,\" said Mikulak. \"You've got to make sure you don't let all the noise get into your head.\"\n\nThe pommel horse was the final event for Team USA's rotation, and the Penn State grad was the last member of Team USA to attempt his only routine. The NBC broadcast even included a timer for the lead-up to Nedoroscik's event.\n\nAfter a long wait, the Olympian performed his moves on the pommel horse in just 40 seconds. His score put Team USA ahead of Team Great Britain, which came in fourth place, by two points.\n\nBecause the pommel horse has long been a weakness for the U.S. men's national team program, Nedoroscik essentially decided to dedicate himself to a single pursuit. His attitude of \"there's still something to improve\" paid off for Team USA.\n\n\"Going up to pommel horse, the last guy up in the whole competition, I had a good feeling that our team was in a great spot. I just knew I had to go up there and do my job,\" he told NBC in an interview after the event.\n\nAnd landing the dismount, he said, was the \"best moment of my life.\"\n\nHere's everything you need to know about Team USA's closer ...\n\nNedoroscik is from Worcester, Massachusetts, and majored in electrical engineering at Penn State.\n\nThe 25-year-old competed in college from 2017 to 2019, winning two NCAA titles on the pommel horse in 2017 and 2018 and finishing as the runner-up in 2019.\n\nIn 2014, a coach who had trained the national pommel-horse champion the previous year approached Nedoroscik and told him he could be the national champion one day, Time magazine reported.\n\nHe went on to become the first American to win a gold medal on the pommel horse at the 2021 World Championships.\n\nThe 2024 Olympics marked his first time making Team USA at the Olympic Games.\n\nNedoroscik was just one competitor on one event in the team final for Team USA. To get him in position to perform that routine for the bronze medal were Paul Juda, Fred Richard, Asher Hong, and Brody Malone. Richard and Juda both compete for Michigan, while Hong and Malone competed for Stanford.\n\nTeammates Richard, Malone, Juda, and Hong had completed 17 straight routines without a miss, putting the Americans in position to reach the medal stand for the first time since 2008 in Beijing.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodlife.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hollywood Life"}, "authors": [],

He breathed slowly to lower his heart rate, he told Today.\n\nWhen it was his turn, Nedoroscik ditched his glasses and Team USA jacket and headed to the pommel horse. And in a near-perfect 40-second routine of quickly swinging both legs around his body and flinging himself into a walking handstand, Nedoroscik secured the team's bronze medal. His teammates' reactions were as euphoric as they might have been if they'd won gold.\n\n\"I don't know what's happening, did we do it?\" he asked his teammates after they hoisted him into the air, triumphant.\n\nThough they won together, it's Nedoroscik who's broken out as the fan favorite, even with his limited performance time. He's earning Clark Kent comparisons for the unassuming demeanor and similar specs he wears before losing both to become a confident pommel horse hero.\n\nNedoroscik, for his part, thinks the memes he's inspired are \"awesome.\"\n\n\"I'm representing people who wear glasses well,\" he said, beaming, in a Tuesday appearance on \"Today.\"\n\nHere's what to know about Nedoroscik, the U.S. men's gymnastics team's very own Superman.\n\nHe's Team USA's pommel horse pro\n\nWhile teammates like Brody Malone and Fred Richard flit between events like rings and vault, Nedoroscik only performs on one apparatus: pommel horse. He's the first American gymnast to make the Olympic team as a specialist in a single event, according to his training gym, Evo Gymnastics in Sarasota, Florida.\n\nHe dropped the other events in artistic gymnastics seven year ago, he told USA Gymnastics, after winning two Junior Olympic National titles in pommel horse and joining Penn State's men's gymnastics program.\n\nSpecializing has succeeded: Commentators said that he's perhaps the best in the world at what he does.\n\nNedoroscik, it seems, takes himself less seriously than he does his sport.\n\n\"I go internationally and I see all the other (pommel) horse specialists. It seems to be a universal thing that we're quirky people that are kind of just fun,\" he said.\n\nHe was a world champion before Paris\n\nNedoroscik and the US men's gymnastics team earned a bronze medal in Paris, but on another world stage, he's won gold.\n\nAt the 2021 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Kitakyushu, Japan, conditions were less than ideal for Nedoroscik to medal at all: The phenom had broken his hand.\n\nIt didn't matter: Nedoroscik still came in first -- the first time the U.S. had ever earned a gold medal for pommel horse at a world championship.\n\nStateside, he's been crowned the US pommel horse champion four times, tying the record for most pommel horse wins, per USA Gymnastics.\n\nThe Paris Games are Nedoroscik's first Olympics -- he missed the chance in 2020 after a disappointing performance in the Olympic trials.\n\n\"I messed up,\" he told CNN affiliate WBBH in Fort Myers, Florida, ahead of this year's Games. \"I felt the pressure and kind of crumbled under it.\"\n\nBut the blow didn't keep him down for long. Nedoroscik decided to \"redirect that energy immediately,\" get back in the gym and keep training. He followed up those disappointing trials with his thrilling performance at the world championships, and since then, he's kept on winning.\n\nHe's a puzzle fiend\n\nAs if competing at the highest level of gymnastics weren't enough, Nedoroscik is also an \u00fcber-competitive puzzler. His personal record for solving a Rubik's Cube is 8.6 seconds.\n\nHe took time off from \"cubing,\" though, after a particularly hard puzzle consumed his downtime. His gymnastics teammate Fred Richard turned him on to \"killer sudoku,\" a version of the puzzle that involves more math. Nedoroscik found a killer sudoku puzzle that claimed to be the \"world's hardest,\" and after 45 hours of puzzling, he became the 43rd person in the world to solve it.\n\nThe experience nearly ruined the Rubik's Cube for him, he said.\n\n\"I tried to get back into cubing, and it wasn't the same,\" he told USA Gymnastics ahead of the Olympics. \"I was kind of lost.\"\n\nHis cubing slump ended along with the US men's gymnastics drought at the Olympics. He brought his trusty cube with him to Paris and solved it on the day of the team final in just over nine seconds.\n\n\"It's stress relief,\" he said on his Tuesday \"Today\" appearance. \"Sometimes I make the excuse that it's good for wrist rehab, too.\"\n\nHe competes with an eye sensitivity\n\nThe specs are cool for Clark Kent comparisons, but without them, Nedoroscik wouldn't be able to see his adoring crowd at the Olympics. Nedoroscik has strabismus, or crossed eyes, and has trouble seeing without them.\n\nOn \"Today,\" while wearing host Hoda Kotb's borrowed Ray-Bans, Nedoroscik said that when he's up on the pommel horse without his glasses, he depends not on sight but feel.\n\n\"I don't even really see when I'm doing my gymnastics,\" he said. \"It's all in the hands. I can feel everything.\"\n\nHe hasn't always competed with limited vision. Nedoroscik used to wear goggles on the pommel horse during his time at Penn State, but he said in June that he \"hadn't really felt like\" wearing them on the Olympic stage.\n\nHe hinted that the new look may have had something to do with testing his own limits.\n\n\"Sometimes, I like to push the boundaries,\" he said.\n\nPushing paid off in Paris. His kryptonite is not, it seems, the pressure of performing on the world's biggest stage in sports.\n\nHe'll have a brief break between the Olympics and his next venture: Swinging around the U.S. with Simone Biles and some of his men's gymnastics teammates on the Gold Over America tour. The pommel horse pro will take the stage beginning in September.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Nedoroscik is expected to be a contender for a medal. He qualified into the final with a tie for the highest score -- 15.200 -- though Irish gymnast Rhys McClenaghan won the tiebreak, which is decided based on which gymnast has the higher execution score.\n\nNedoroscik, 25, was born and raised in Worcester, Massachusetts, and started gymnastics in 2003. Syque Caesar, Nedoroscik's coach, told the Washington Post the gymnast is \"quirky, funny, goofy\" and \"dances to his own tune.\" Early in his career, Nedoroscik became known for his abilities on the pommel horse -- but he also garnered attention for wearing glasses or goggles during competition. The goggles, which aren't prescription, were a Secret Santa gift from his teammate at Penn State University, Ben Cooperman, who joked that Nedoroscik should wear them during competition. \"I started to form a goofiness when it came to competing and I was like, you know what? It'd be fun to put them on. Let's put 'em on,\" Nedoroscik said. He hasn't worn the goggles at the Olympics, telling Olympics.com after the team finals that he hasn't felt like wearing them lately. He is also known for solving Rubik's Cubes. On Monday, before the team final, Nedoroscik said on Instagram he solved one in 9.32 seconds, which he considered a \"good omen.\" According to his TikTok bio, his Rubik's Cube record is 8.664 seconds. Nedoroscik competed for Penn State's NCAA gymnastics team between 2017 and 2020, where he became a two-time NCAA national champion on the pommel horse. He graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering.\n\nNedoroscik has solely competed on the pommel horse for much of his career -- a contrast to his Olympic teammates, who compete on all six events in men's gymnastics. Nedoroscik won a gold medal on the pommel horse at the 2021 world gymnastics championships, a first for the United States and the first gold medal for an American man in any event since 2011. He is a four-time national champion on the pommel horse.\n\nNedoroscik scored a 14.866 on the pommel horse during the men's team final on Monday, a tie for the second-highest score on the apparatus that day. His performance helped the U.S. men's gymnasts clinch the bronze medal, the first for the American men's gymnastics team since 2008. Nedoroscik and the other four gymnasts -- Asher Hong, Paul Juda, Frederick Richard and Brody Malone -- earned a total team score of 257.793, more than four points higher than their qualification round score of 253.229, where they ranked fifth. The U.S. team won the bronze behind Japan, the gold medal winning team, and China, which took the silver.\n\nU.S. Men's Gymnastics Team Wins First Olympic Medal In 16 Years (Forbes)", "source":

He won the 2024 U.S. National Championships title in the event, leading to his selection to compete in the Olympic Trials. His impressive performance officially earned him a spot on Team USA alongside fellow gymnasts Brody Malone, Fred Richard, Asher Hong and Paul Juda.\n\nWhen the competition began in Paris, Nedoroscik quickly stole viewers' hearts with one crucial accessory: his glasses.\n\n\"Obsessed with this one guy on the US men's gymnastics team who looks like he's getting his phd in anthropology and his only job is pommel horse,\" one viewer tweeted as Nedoroscik prepped for the men's team finals on Monday, July 29.\n\nAnother fan wrote, \"I know nothing about gymnastics and here I am living and dying with whether this nerdy guy in glasses named Steve can pommel that horse. The Olympics are a curse.\"\n\nAs a specialist, Nedoroscik doesn't compete in other events in the rotation, including vault, floor, parallel bars and more. During Monday's team final, Nedoroscik was the last to hit the pommel horse -- and NBC's Olympics broadcast even included a countdown clock to his routine. A pic of Nedoroscik taking a nap (or resting his eyes? meditating?) while waiting for his moment instantly went viral.\n\nWhen it's his time to compete, Nedoroscik takes his glasses off. \"It's not necessarily clear,\" he told Today of his vision. \"But the thing about pommel horse is if I keep [my glasses] on, they're gonna fly somewhere.\"\n\nHe continued, \"When I go up on the pommel horse, it's all about feeling the equipment.

Japan surged to gold in the final rotation, while China took silver.\n\nIt's the first time the American men have been on the Olympic podium since 2008, when Jonathan Horton led them to bronze. And ultimately, they finished closer to second-place China (1.3 points off) than they did fourth-place Great Britain (2.2 points).\n\nStephen Nedoroscik, a pommel horse specialist whose only contribution to the team score came on the very last routine of the night, helped clinch the bronze for Team USA with a solid performance. But every member of the team hit clutch routines, including Paul Juda and Asher Hong on vault and Frederick Richard on high bar.\n\nThe Americans finished fifth at each of the previous three Summer Olympics, and they finished fifth again in Saturday's qualifying. The difference on Monday largely revolved around Malone.\n\nMalone, 24, had been expected to qualify for the all-around individual final and perhaps even contend for a medal, but he had a dreadful showing in qualifying - with falls on pommel horse, floor and even high bar, the event in which he won a world championship in 2022. It was such a jarring performance that some of his teammates later said he apologized to them afterwards.\n\n\"I know Brody's a dog and a competitor,\" Hong said. \"So I know he's going to come into team finals and full send.\"\n\nAnd he did. Malone improved upon or matched his performances on every apparatus, including a significantly better showing on high bar that helped keep the U.S. ahead of its bronze rivals. After falling twice on the apparatus in qualifying, he looked much more comfortable - and stuck the landing - for a score that was nearly two full points higher than his score Saturday.\n\nHong, Juda and Richard, meanwhile, each competed in four events - each pumping up their teammates, and the crowd, between routines. Chants of \"U-S-A!\" rang out at Bercy Arena at multiple points over the course of the night.\n\nAlthough China and Japan were long considered the favorites, the U.S. knew for months that it would benefit from the absence of Russia, which is banned from team competitions at these Olympics because of its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe Americans knew the bronze medal was there for the taking. And they took it.\n\nStephen Nedoroscik dazzles on pommel horse\n\nStephen Nedoroscik closed out the U.S. men's rotation on pommel horse, nailing his routine and enciting a massive cheer from the crowd, including a chant of \"USA! USA!\" His teammates threw him in the air in celebration.

He breathed slowly to lower his heart rate, he told Today.\n\nWhen it was his turn, Nedoroscik ditched his glasses and Team USA jacket and headed to the pommel horse. And in a near-perfect 40-second routine of quickly swinging both legs around his body and flinging himself into a walking handstand, Nedoroscik secured the team's bronze medal. His teammates' reactions were as euphoric as they might have been if they'd won gold.\n\n\"I don't know what's happening, did we do it?\" he asked his teammates after they hoisted him into the air, triumphant.\n\nThough they won together, it's Nedoroscik who's broken out as the fan favorite, even with his limited performance time. He's earning Clark Kent comparisons for the unassuming demeanor and similar specs he wears before losing both to become a confident pommel horse hero.\n\nNedoroscik, for his part, thinks the memes he's inspired are \"awesome.\"\n\n\"I'm representing people who wear glasses well,\" he said, beaming, in a Tuesday appearance on \"Today.\"\n\nHere's what to know about Nedoroscik, the US men's gymnastics team's very own Superman.\n\nWhile teammates like Brody Malone and Fred Richard flit between events like rings and vault, Nedoroscik only performs on one apparatus: pommel horse. He's the first American gymnast to make the Olympic team as a specialist in a single event, according to his training gym, Evo Gymnastics in Sarasota, Florida.\n\nHe dropped the other events in artistic gymnastics seven year ago, he told USA Gymnastics, after winning two Junior Olympic National titles in pommel horse and joining Penn State's men's gymnastics program.\n\nSpecializing has succeeded: Commentators said that he's perhaps the best in the world at what he does.\n\nNedoroscik, it seems, takes himself less seriously than he does his sport.\n\n\"I go internationally and I see all the other (pommel) horse specialists. It seems to be a universal thing that we're quirky people that are kind of just fun,\" he said.\n\nNedoroscik and the US men's gymnastics team earned a bronze medal in Paris, but on another world stage, he's won gold.\n\nAt the 2021 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Kitakyushu, Japan, conditions were less than ideal for Nedoroscik to medal at all: The phenom had broken his hand.\n\nIt didn't matter: Nedoroscik still came in first -- the first time the US had ever earned a gold medal for pommel horse at a world championship.\n\nStateside, he's been crowned the US pommel horse champion four times, tying the record for most pommel horse wins, per USA Gymnastics.\n\nThe Paris Games are Nedoroscik's first Olympics -- he missed the chance in 2020 after a disappointing performance in the Olympic trials.\n\n\"I messed up,\" he told CNN affiliate WBBH in Fort Myers, Florida, ahead of this year's Games. \"I felt the pressure and kind of crumbled under it.\"\n\nBut the blow didn't keep him down for long. Nedoroscik decided to \"redirect that energy immediately,\" get back in the gym and keep training. He followed up those disappointing trials with his thrilling performance at the world championships, and since then, he's kept on winning.\n\nAs if competing at the highest level of gymnastics weren't enough, Nedoroscik is also an \u00fcber-competitive puzzler. His personal record for solving a Rubik's Cube is 8.6 seconds.\n\nHe took time off from \"cubing,\" though, after a particularly hard puzzle consumed his downtime. His gymnastics teammate Fred Richard turned him on to \"killer sudoku,\" a version of the puzzle that involves more math. Nedoroscik found a killer sudoku puzzle that claimed to be the \"world's hardest,\" and after 45 hours of puzzling, he became the 43rd person in the world to solve it.\n\nThe experience nearly ruined the Rubik's Cube for him, he said.\n\n\"I tried to get back into cubing, and it wasn't the same,\" he told USA Gymnastics ahead of the Olympics. \"I was kind of lost.\"\n\nHis cubing slump ended along with the US men's gymnastics drought at the Olympics. He brought his trusty cube with him to Paris and solved it on the day of the team final in just over nine seconds.\n\n\"It's stress relief,\" he said on his Tuesday \"Today\" appearance. \"Sometimes I make the excuse that it's good for wrist rehab, too.\"\n\nThe specs are cool for Clark Kent comparisons, but without them, Nedoroscik wouldn't be able to see his adoring crowd at the Olympics. Nedoroscik has strabismus, or crossed eyes, and has trouble seeing without them.\n\nOn \"Today,\" while wearing host Hoda Kotb's borrowed Ray-Bans, Nedoroscik said that when he's up on the pommel horse without his glasses, he depends not on sight but feel.\n\n\"I don't even really see when I'm doing my gymnastics,\" he said. \"It's all in the hands. I can feel everything.\"\n\nHe hasn't always competed with limited vision. Nedoroscik used to wear goggles on the pommel horse during his time at Penn State, but he said in June that he \"hadn't really felt like\" wearing them on the Olympic stage.\n\nHe hinted that the new look may have had something to do with testing his own limits.\n\n\"Sometimes, I like to push the boundaries,\" he said.\n\nPushing paid off in Paris. His kryptonite is not, it seems, the pressure of performing on the world's biggest stage in sports.\n\nHe'll have a brief break between the Olympics and his next venture: Swinging around the US with Simone Biles and some of his men's gymnastics teammates on the Gold Over America tour. The pommel horse pro will take the stage beginning in September.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Meet the Olympic Gymnast (and Viral Meme!) Capturing Hearts", "body": "U.S. men's gymnast Stephen Nedoroscik helped Team USA secure their first medal in 16 years at the 2024 Olympics\n\nStephen Nedoroscik proved himself to be the Clark Kent of the pommel horse at the 2024 Olympics.\n\nThe Olympic gymnast helped propel his team to win bronze at the men's gymnastics team final at the Paris Olympics -- their first medal in 16 years. While the team is composed of five men -- including Paul Juda, Fred Richard, Brody Malone and Asher Hong -- Nedoroscik was the only member to qualify for a single event -- pommel horse -- at the team final on July 29, whereas his teammates each performed across the other five events. Despite his seemingly smaller role, his high score ultimately clenched the team's bronze win.\n\n\"It was just the greatest moment of my life, I think,\" the athlete told reporters, including PEOPLE, after excelling at his routine. \"[I'm] so happy to have been there.\"\n\nIn addition to being an Olympian, Nedoroscik quickly became an internet sensation thanks to his thick glasses, which social media users likened to Clark Kent. Though he was previously referred to as the \"goggles guy\" for the sports glasses he wore while he competed, Nedoroscik went sans glasses during his performance, explaining that he doesn't need his eyes to see the pommel horse.\n\n\"I don't think I actually use my eyes on pommel horse,\" he told The Washington Post. \"It's all feeling. I see with my hands.\"\n\nSo who is Stephen Nedoroscik? Here's everything to know about the pommel horse hero who helped the U.S. men's gymnastics team secure their first Olympic medal in nearly two decades.\n\nNedoroscik was born on Oct. 28, 1998, and raised in Worcester, Mass. He grew up attending the Sterling Academy of Gymnastics in Sterling, Mass., where he was cheered on during a watch party of the men's team finals.\n\n\"My parents started this business in 1992 with the smallest of dreams,\" owner Matt Carbone told NBC Boston. \"But 32 years later, we now have an Olympic bronze medalist, and he's still going on to compete in event finals on Saturday. It's absolutely incredible.\"\n\nCarbone remembered Nedoroscik as a \"goofy\" boy, whose banner now hangs in the gym for other children in the academy to look up to.\n\n\"He was a typical goofy little boy that would play around on the equipment and get in trouble at times and just had fun with gymnastics,\" Carbone said.\n\nNedoroscik committed to Pennsylvania State University in his senior year of high school to join their gymnastics team, announcing his decision on Instagram in November 2015.\n\n\"It took a long time to decide but I'm excited to announce I've verbally committed to Penn State, and in the process of signing the letter of intent, can't wait for college!\" he wrote in the caption of his announcement.\n\nThe athlete enrolled at Penn State in August 2016 and graduated four years later in December 2020 with a degree in electrical engineering. Since he finished school during the COVID-19 pandemic, Nedoroscik celebrated his graduation at home with a televised commencement.\n\n\"No recruiting trips. Didn't know collegiate gymnastics was an option until junior year,\" he wrote in his graduation post on Instagram. \"Penn State took a serious risk in taking me in, and I will forever be grateful for that opportunity.\"\n\nUnlike the other gymnasts on the U.S. men's team, Nedorocsik is a specialist in just one skill: the pommel horse. His task includes spinning around the figure and performing a 45-second routine filled with skills and tricks that he's trained for years but often may need to improvise in the moment depending on a number of factors.\n\nPicking a specialist for the Olympics was a controversial move. However, the pommel horse is where the U.S. men's team has historically struggled and Nedorocsik was the U.S. selection committee's answer to the problem.\n\n\"I was completely aware of it,\" Nedoroscik told the Post of the criticism he received. \"I really wanted to make the Olympic team, and I knew that there was going to be backlash to it. I do one event compared to these guys that are phenomenal all-arounders. And I am a phenomenal horse guy. But it's hard to fit on a five-guy team.\"\n\nNedoroscik isn't just a one-trick pony -- he can also solve a Rubik's cube at an incredibly fast speed. Before his performance at the finals on July 29, the gymnast posted a photo of his Instagram Stories of himself completing a Rubik's cube in 9.321 seconds, writing \"Good omen\" above the image.\n\nPer his TikTok bio, his personal best is 8.664 seconds.\n\nThe Olympian has made waves on social media not only for his incredible athletic prowess, but also for his thick glasses. Nedoroscik has strabismus, a condition where one eye is turned in a direction that's different from the other. Commonly known as crossed eyes, the athlete has control over which is the dominant eye, demonstrating his ability to switch in an August 2022 TikTok.\n\nAfter his performance, social media users began comparing Nedoroscik's appearance to that of Clark Kent, who also wears thick glasses when he's not his alterego, Superman. Even NBC's official Olympics account shared a post on X comparing a side-by-side photo of Nedoroscik with Christopher Reeves as Kent, calling the gymnast \"the Clark Kent of pommel horse.\"\n\n\"I think they're awesome,\" Nedoroscik said on TODAY of the comparison posts a day after his performance. \"You know, representing the people that wear glasses well.\"\n\nHowever, during competition Nedoroscik takes his glasses off, explaining on the show that he doesn't need them to perform well or see the pommel horse.\n\n\"When I go up on the pommel horse, it's all about feeling the equipment,\" he said. \"I don't even really see when I'm doing my gymnastics. It's all in the hands. I can feel everything.\"\n\nBefore his turn was up at the finals, Nedoroscik was getting himself in the zone, leaving the arena at one point to practice in the warmup gym. Minutes before he was up, a camera captured Nedoroscik leaning his head back and sitting with his eyes closed and glasses on -- a meme that quickly went viral.\n\n\"I'm doing my breathing exercises,\" he shared on TODAY. \"We always try to keep our heart rate down and through that five minutes I'm sitting there, I'm just visualizing my routine over and over ... that's all I'm doing in my head.\"\n\nAfter his teammates performed in the five other events for the artistic gymnastics men's team finals, it was Nedoroscik's turn to secure a medal for the team. He nailed his routine, earning a score of 14.866 and a bronze for Team USA.\n\nThough he was last after a \"long day,\" Nedoroscik told reporters, including PEOPLE, he was happy to go last.\n\n\"I framed that in my head as a positive, like I can be the exclamation point,\" he said.\n\nWith his teammates cheering for him on the sidelines and his coach's pep talk, Nedoroscik knew when he finished his performance that they had found success.\n\n\"I kind of, in that moment, was like, 'Alright, let's run it back, then. Let's go out there and do our thing,' \" he said. \"I have [coach] Sam Mikulak as just like, the greatest coach of all time. He's up there, helping me keep the nerves in check. He knows exactly what to say to me. So when we got that chalk bucket, he kind of just settled me down and said, 'You're ready for this.' I went up there, did my routine and during that dismount, I was just like, already smiling.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors":

Japan surged to gold in the final rotation, while China took silver.\n\nIt's the first time the American men have been on the Olympic podium since 2008, when Jonathan Horton led them to bronze. And ultimately, they finished closer to second-place China (1.3 points off) than they did fourth-place Great Britain (2.2 points).\n\nGet Olympics updates in your texts! Join USA TODAY Sports' WhatsApp Channel\n\nStephen Nedoroscik, a pommel horse specialist whose only contribution to the team score came on the very last routine of the night, helped clinch the bronze for Team USA with a solid performance. But every member of the team hit clutch routines, including Paul Juda and Asher Hong on vault and Frederick Richard on high bar.\n\nThe Americans finished fifth at each of the previous three Summer Olympics, and they finished fifth again in Saturday's qualifying. The difference on Monday largely revolved around Malone.\n\nMalone, 24, had been expected to qualify for the all-around individual final and perhaps even contend for a medal, but he had a dreadful showing in qualifying - with falls on pommel horse, floor and even high bar, the event in which he won a world championship in 2022. It was such a jarring performance that some of his teammates later said he apologized to them afterwards.\n\n\"I know Brody's a dog and a competitor,\" Hong said. \"So I know he's going to come into team finals and full send.\"\n\nAnd he did. Malone improved upon or matched his performances on every apparatus, including a significantly better showing on high bar that helped keep the U.S. ahead of its bronze rivals. After falling twice on the apparatus in qualifying, he looked much more comfortable - and stuck the landing - for a score that was nearly two full points higher than his score Saturday.\n\nHong, Juda and Richard, meanwhile, each competed in four events - each pumping up their teammates, and the crowd, between routines. Chants of \"U-S-A!\" rang out at Bercy Arena at multiple points over the course of the night.\n\nAlthough China and Japan were long considered the favorites, the U.S. knew for months that it would benefit from the absence of Russia, which is banned from team competitions at these Olympics because of its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe Americans knew the bronze medal was there for the taking. And they took it.\n\nStephen Nedoroscik closed out the U.S. men's rotation on pommel horse, nailing his routine and enciting a massive cheer from the crowd, including a chant of \"USA! USA!\" His teammates threw him in the air in celebration. He earned a score of 14.866.\n\nBrody Malone on pommel horse\n\nBrody Malone scored a 13.700 on pommel horse, leaving only Stephen Nedoroscik's turn on the rotation left.\n\nPaul Juda on pommel horse\n\nPaul Juda opened the U.S. men's rotation on pommel horse and stuck his landing, drawing a huge roar from the crowd. He scored a 13.900.\n\nU.S. men's gymnastics in medal position entering last rotation\n\nThe U.S. is sitting in third place with just one rotation left to go. Unfortunately, that last rotation is in a notoriously tricky event: Pommel horse.\n\nThe U.S. has a 1.8-point lead over Ukraine, which is in fourth place, after a solid showing on floor exercise. Asher Hong, Paul Juda and Frederick Richard all notched scores about 14.100 on floor, with Richard's routine the highlight.\n\nNow, it just needs to hang on. The U.S. will put up Juda, Brody Malone and Stephen Nedoroscik on pommel horse. Nedoroscik is a one-event specialist whose only routine of the night will be Team USA's last -- with a medal on the line.\n\nU.S. men's gymnastics has monster high bar set\n\nWhat a difference a couple of days make. The U.S. men are in third place with two events to go thanks to a monster performance on high bar.\n\nFrederick Richard and Brody Malone improved their scores from qualifying by nearly three points, including a hit by Malone. The 2022 world champ on high bar has been struggling on his signature event all summe, but he came through when it counted most. And Richard was simply magnificent, his release series setting off chants of \"USA! USA!\" China still has a commanding lead, and Ukraine leapfrogged the Americans. But the Americans are hanging in there.\n\nBrody Malone put up an impressive high bar routine and scored a 14.166.\n\nFrederick Richard on high bar\n\nMonster high bar routine from Frederick Richard. He stuck the landing and scored a 14.833 -- roughly seven-tenths better than his routine in qualifying.\n\nU.S. men's gymnastics in second halfway through Olympic team final\n\nThe U.S. men are still in medal contention halfway through the team final.\n\nThe Americans are 1.201 points behind China after three events, with a score of 130.163. They got a big boost on parallel bars, where Asher Hong improved his score from qualifying by more than a half-point. Frederick Richard also picked up about 1.2 points, offsetting a slightly lower score from Brody Malone.\n\nIt's not just that the Americans are doing their jobs, they're getting help from the other contenders. Japan is probably out of the running for gold after Daiki Hashimoto fell off pommel horse in the second rotation. They're more than three points behind China and are almost two points behind the Americans. Britain had to count a 13.033 on vault and are 1.7 points back from the U.S. But the Americans must now go on high bar, a high-risk, high-reward event.\n\nParallel bars: Brody Malone (14.433), Frederick Richard (14.566), Asher Hong (14.400)\n\nAsher Hong amped after big vault\n\nOne of the keys for Team USA, and every team in this final, is to have its stars on each apparatus put up big scores. And Asher Hong certainly did that on vault, which is one of his best events.\n\nHong took a slight hop on his Ri Se-gwang vault -- a full twisting, double back somersault -- but nevertheless notched a strong score of 14.833, pumping his fist and yelling in celebration as he walked off the podium. Between that vault, Paul Juda's stuck landing, and dramatic improvement on this apparatus by Brody Malone, the U.S. put up another strong showing and moved into first place in the overall team standings -- at least for a brief moment.\n\nIf you're simply comparing Team USA's performance to its performance in the qualifying round, then things are looking good. The Americans improved by four-tenths on still rings and roughly 0.9 points on vault.\n\nThe gold will go to either China or Japan, and Daiki Hashimoto's mistake on pommel horse might loom large.\n\nThe reigning Olympic and world champion wound up on his back on top of the horse midway through his routine and dropped off. The crowd gasped, and Hashimoto put his head in his hands after he finished, knowing what a costly error it was. His score of 13.1 was almost 1.4 points below his score in qualifying. Unlike in qualifying, when teams can drop their lowest score, every score counts tonight.\n\nThe only positive is that the mistake occurred early enough in the competition that Japan has time to make up ground. Still, the reigning world champs are a half-point behind China.\n\nU.S. men's gymnastics on still rings\n\nThere's a lot of gymnastics left to go, but the U.S. got to off to a solid start on still rings. Frederick Richard led off with a 14.033 -- which was a half-point improvement on his rings score in qualifying -- while Brody Malone and Asher Hong finished right around their scores Saturday. The result was a net positive of four-tenths for Team USA over qualifying, where they finished more than three full points behind third-place Great Britain.\n\nIn Monday's eight-team final, the Americans will be rotating from one apparatus to another with Italy and start off on still rings. And they'll end with arguably the trickiest event in men's gymnastics: Pommel horse, which is often compared to balance beam on the women's side.\n\nAfter a rough showing in the qualifying round, reigning U.S. champion Brody Malone will have the busiest night in the final, competing in every event except floor. Asher Hong, Paul Juda and Frederick Richard will have four routines apiece, and Stephen Nedoroscik will wrap up the night with his only event: Pommel horse.\n\nHere's the complete lineup for Team USA in Monday's final, and their order of events:\n\nNBC is airing the men's team final, Peacock is live streaming it.\n\nWhat time is men's gymnastics on today ?\n\nThe men's team final is happening now, after starting at 11:30 a.m. ET. The U.S. men's gymnastics team is vying to win its first medal since 2008. The Simone Biles and the U.S. women's gymnastics team competes in the team final on Tuesday at 12:15 p.m. ET.\n\nStephen Nedoroscik to step into pommel horse pressure-cooker\n\nThere was a bit of controversy over Stephen Nedoroscik's inclusion on Team USA. He only competes in one event -- pommel horse -- but he is one of the best in the world on that apparatus when he hits.\n\nThat means there's a ton of pressure for the Penn State product to nail his routine in the team final Monday.\n\nThe timing, or rather order of events, only further adds to that pressure. The Americans will go last on pommel horse, and Nedoroscik will be the third and final member of the team to compete. Meanwhile, Great Britain and Ukraine, who are expected to be Team USA's biggest rivals for the bronze medal, will be on floor exercise -- where Great Britain recorded the highest score in qualifying.\n\nThe rub: When Nedoroscik steps up to the pommel horse, there could very well be a medal on the line.\n\nA gymnastics routine gets two scores: One for difficulty, also known as the D score or start value, and one for execution. Every gymnastics skill has a numerical value, and the D score is the sum total of the skills in a routine. The execution score, or E score, reflects how well the skills were done. A gymnast starts with a 10.0, and deductions for flaws and form errors are taken from there. Add the D and E scores together, and that's your total for an apparatus. (Vault scores will always be higher because it's a single skill.)\n\nWhy US men's gymnastics team has best shot at an Olympic medal since 2008\n\nWinning an Olympic team medal is difficult. Difficulty doesn't have to be what keeps the U.S. men's gymnastics team from winning one, however. Since the Tokyo Olympics, where they finished fifth for a third straight Games, the Americans have prioritized making their routines harder in hopes of breaking what is now a 16-year medal drought. You can do the most beautiful gymnastics in the world and it won't matter if your skills aren't as difficult as what the top teams are doing.\n\n\"I hate to say that about Tokyo but yeah, that was kind of what that was,\" said Brody Malone, referring to the 7-point gap between the U.S. men and China, the bronze medalists.\n\nIn the gymnastics scoring system, there is one score for the difficulty value of a routine and another for how well it's executed. The Americans still lag well behind Japan and China, perennial favorites in men's gymnastics. But with no Russia, which won the team title both in Tokyo and at the world championships before it, the bronze medal is there for the taking.", "source": {"uri": "eu.telegram.com", "dataType":

This week, during the US men's gymnastics final, viewers were given yet another breakout star - lovingly nicknamed by the internet as \"pommel horse guy\".\n\nStephen Nedoroscik, a 25-year-old Penn State alum, secured Team USA an Olympic medal in men's gymnastics for the first time in 16 years. While Japan and China finished in first and second place, respectively, Nedoroscik and his teammates received the third place bronze medal.\n\nDuring Monday's final, viewers couldn't take their eyes off Nedoroscik, who waited nearly three hours for his turn to compete in the very last event. With his thick black frame glasses, the gymnast was seen napping, playing charades, solving Rubik's cubes, and cheering on his teammates - Brody Malone, Paul Juda, Frederick Richard, and Asher Hong - until it was time to mount the pommel horse.\n\nNedoroscik, known as the pommel horse \"specialist,\" delivered a nearly perfect routine with a score of 14.866. But it wasn't his impressive skills on the mat that made Nedoroscik into a viral sensation. Rather, it was his unassuming, \"nerdy\" Clark Kent-turned-Superman energy that transformed Nedoroscik into everyone's favorite Olympic athlete.\n\n\"Obsessed with this guy on the US men's gymnastics team who's [sic] only job is pommel horse,\" wrote user Megan on X, formerly Twitter, after Nedoroscik's stunning performance. \"He just sits there until he's activated like a sleeper agent, whips off his glasses like Clark Kent and does a pommel horse routine that helps deliver the team its first medal in 16 years.\"\n\nAcross social media, fans were amazed that Nedoroscik's entire gymnastics career has been focused on perfecting the pommel horse. In fact, he was tapped to join the five-member US men's gymnastics team after he came in first place at the 2024 US pommel horse championship. Much like Ken in the Barbie movie, whose sole job is beach, Nedoroscik's one job at the Olympics is essentially pommel horse.\n\n\"Absolutely sick that America brought Stephen Nedoroscik, some nerd from Massachusetts, to Paris who's [sic] sole purpose in life is to ball out on the pommel horse,\" said user Sam after Monday's final. \"Long live pommel horse guy.\"\n\nMany sports fans admitted that they were unaware of Nedoroscik, or his pommel horse skills, up until his jaw-dropping performance. Now, some have declared him a \"national hero\" and \"American icon\".\n\nOthers made comparisons to Clark Kent, who famously takes off his glasses before transforming into Superman. Nedoroscik was seen wearing his square-framed glasses up until the last men's gymnastics event. When it was finally his turn to take to the pommel horse, Nedoroscik whipped off his frames and balanced himself on the apparatus with near perfection. Although Nedoroscik has previously told fans he suffers from strabismus - a condition also known as crossed eyes - even someone with 20/20 vision wouldn't come close to such a performance.\n\n\"Taking off your glasses to then perform a near perfect routine on the pommel horse is so freaking metal,\" one person said, while the official account for NBC Olympics & Paralympics captioned a side-by-side image of Nedoroscik and Superman actor Christopher Reeve: \"Stephen Nedoroscik, the Clark Kent of pommel horse!\"\n\nThe Massachusetts native, who graduated from Penn State in 2020 with a degree in mechanical engineering, won two NCAA championships during his college career. In 2021, he became the first US gymnast to win a world championship gold medal on pommel horse, according to ABC. After scoring 14.866 during Monday's event, Nedoroscik will be given another chance to score a medal on Saturday, August 3.\n\nIt also seems that Nedoroscik has caught wind of the viral reaction to his pommel horse performance. Speaking to Today co-hosts Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie on Tuesday, the gymnast was asked how he feels about becoming the latest internet meme.\n\n\"I think they're awesome,\" he said. \"I'm representing people that wear glasses well.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Surprise Heartthrob Of The Olympics", "body": "An unassuming member of the US gymnastics team competing in the Olympics has become a viral sensation overnight. Stephen Nedoroscik is a nerdy Clark Kent type passionate about Rubik's cubes. So why can't the internet get enough of him?\n\nFirstly, 2024 has been the year of the geeky guy with \"Rodent Boy Summer\"; geeky guys with Stewart little vibes are the new heartthrobs. Ironically, the sporting movie Challengers sent the trend viral, with Josh O'Connor and Mike Faist leading the charge. Stephen Nedoroscik, the bespectacled hero of the Olympics who can allegedly solve a Rubik's cube in 10 seconds, fits the bill.\n\nStephen Nedoroscik is a member of the men's artistic gymnastics team. The 25-year-old gymnast specialises in \"the pommel horse\", a part of the gym routine that requires strength, rhythm and precision. It's a move that takes 40 seconds. But Nedoroscik's performance helped the men's Team USA gymnasts break their 16-year medal drought, winning them bronze with his flawless execution of the difficult\"pommel horse\" move.\n\nCompeting in one Olympic event means waiting for three hours on the day (according to NBC News). As the bespectacled hunk sat on the sideline, he caught the attention of X users who wondered what he was up to.\n\nOne user wrote, \"I'm obsessed with this one guy on the US men's gymnastic team who looks like he's getting his PhD in anthropology, and his only job is pommel horse.\"\n\nAt one point, the pommel horse guy seemed to be taking a kip, but apparently, he was meditating. The internet went wild, \"he just sits there until he's activated like a sleeper agent, whips off his glasses like Clark Kent and does a pommel horse routine that helps deliver the team its first medal in 16 years.\" He scored a phenomenal 14.866, helping put them 2 points ahead of team Britain and scraping them a bronze medal. It also cinched his superhero vibes. Nedoroscik told press it was \"just the greatest moment of my life, I think\", the gymnast told People.\n\nThe internet was right; Stephen Nedoroscik is a geek outside of pommel horsing. The pommel horse king is an electrical engineering graduate. He's from Massachusetts and attended the Sterling Academy of Gymnastics in Sterling, Massachusetts. His small-town academy has been cheering him on. The ebullient owner, Matt Carbone, told NBC Boston, \"My parents started this business in 1992 with the smallest of dreams, but 32 years later, we now have an Olympic bronze medalist.\" He remembered Stephen Nedoroscik as a \"goofy boy\" who would \"get into trouble at times\" and.\n\nNedoroscik went to college at Penn State and joined their gymnastics team. He said on Instagram the prestigious Penn State took a \"serious risk\" taking him in, and I will forever be grateful for that opportunity.\"\n\nMen's gymnastics comprises five team members -- Nedorosciks team members are Brody Malone, Asher Hong, Paula Juda, and Fred Richard. These four are all-rounders, but as established, Stephen Nedoroscik focuses only on the pommel horse. According to People, the US has typically lost out on this part of the competition. Bringing someone in solely to execute this routine is not standard. Indeed, there was a backlash when Nedoroscik was selected, given the many \"all-rounder\" gymnasts who wanted to compete in the Olympics.\n\nNedoroscik told the press he was aware of the criticism and came to his own defence in the most charmingly modest way possible. \"I really wanted to make the Olympic team, and I knew there would be backlash to it. I do one event compared to these guys, who are phenomenal all-rounders. And I am a phenomenal horse guy. But it's hard to fit on a five-guy team.\"\n\nThe pommel horse routine involves spinning around the \"horse\" for forty-five seconds with his entire body weight on his arms.\n\nWe don't see many athletes wearing thick frames at the Olympics. But Stephen Nedoroscik wears glasses because he has strabismus, in which one eye turns in a direction different from the other. Nedoroscik isn't self-conscious about it, though. Indeed, he showed his ability to switch \"dominant\" eyes in a TikTok in August 2022.\n\nNedoroscik says he's pleased with the comparisons to Christover Reeves as Clark Kent because he's happy to represent people who \"wear glasses well.\" Indeed.\n\nHe also said that the condition doesn't hold him back when he's on the pommel horse, where he unsurprisingly has to remove his specs. \"I don't even really see when I'm doing my gymnastics.

This week, during the US men's gymnastics final, viewers were given yet another breakout star - lovingly nicknamed by the internet as \"pommel horse guy\".\n\nStephen Nedoroscik, a 25-year-old Penn State alum, secured Team USA an Olympic medal in men's gymnastics for the first time in 16 years. While Japan and China finished in first and second place, respectively, Nedoroscik and his teammates received the third place bronze medal.\n\nDuring Monday's final, viewers couldn't take their eyes off Nedoroscik, who waited nearly three hours for his turn to compete in the very last event. With his thick black frame glasses, the gymnast was seen napping, playing charades, solving Rubik's cubes, and cheering on his teammates - Brody Malone, Paul Juda, Frederick Richard, and Asher Hong - until it was time to mount the pommel horse.\n\nNedoroscik, known as the pommel horse \"specialist,\" delivered a nearly perfect routine with a score of 14.866. But it wasn't his impressive skills on the mat that made Nedoroscik into a viral sensation. Rather, it was his unassuming, \"nerdy\" Clark Kent-turned-Superman energy that transformed Nedoroscik into everyone's favorite Olympic athlete.\n\n\"Obsessed with this guy on the US men's gymnastics team who's [sic] only job is pommel horse,\" wrote user Megan on X, formerly Twitter, after Nedoroscik's stunning performance. \"He just sits there until he's activated like a sleeper agent, whips off his glasses like Clark Kent and does a pommel horse routine that helps deliver the team its first medal in 16 years.\"\n\nAcross social media, fans were amazed that Nedoroscik's entire gymnastics career has been focused on perfecting the pommel horse. In fact, he was tapped to join the five-member US men's gymnastics team after he came in first place at the 2024 US pommel horse championship. Much like Ken in the Barbie movie, whose sole job is beach, Nedoroscik's one job at the Olympics is essentially pommel horse.\n\n\"Absolutely sick that America brought Stephen Nedoroscik, some nerd from Massachusetts, to Paris who's [sic] sole purpose in life is to ball out on the pommel horse,\" said user Sam after Monday's final. \"Long live pommel horse guy.\"\n\nMany sports fans admitted that they were unaware of Nedoroscik, or his pommel horse skills, up until his jaw-dropping performance. Now, some have declared him a \"national hero\" and \"American icon\".\n\nOthers made comparisons to Clark Kent, who famously takes off his glasses before transforming into Superman. Nedoroscik was seen wearing his square-framed glasses up until the last men's gymnastics event. When it was finally his turn to take to the pommel horse, Nedoroscik whipped off his frames and balanced himself on the apparatus with near perfection. Although Nedoroscik has previously told fans he suffers from strabismus - a condition also known as crossed eyes - even someone with 20/20 vision wouldn't come close to such a performance.\n\n\"Taking off your glasses to then perform a near perfect routine on the pommel horse is so freaking metal,\" one person said, while the official account for NBC Olympics & Paralympics captioned a side-by-side image of Nedoroscik and Superman actor Christopher Reeve: \"Stephen Nedoroscik, the Clark Kent of pommel horse!\"\n\nThe Massachusetts native, who graduated from Penn State in 2020 with a degree in mechanical engineering, won two NCAA championships during his college career. In 2021, he became the first US gymnast to win a world championship gold medal on pommel horse, according to ABC. After scoring 14.866 during Monday's event, Nedoroscik will be given another chance to score a medal on Saturday, August 3.\n\nIt also seems that Nedoroscik has caught wind of the viral reaction to his pommel horse performance. Speaking to Today co-hosts Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie on Tuesday, the gymnast was asked how he feels about becoming the latest internet meme.\n\n\"I think they're awesome,\" he said. \"I'm representing people that wear glasses well.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Meet the Olympic Gymnast (and Viral Meme!) Capturing Hearts", "body": "Rebecca Aizin is an Editorial Assistant at PEOPLE. She has been working at PEOPLE since 2023. Her work has previously appeared on Elle, HGTV and Backstage.\n\nStephen Nedoroscik proved himself to be the Clark Kent of the pommel horse at the 2024 Olympics.\n\nThe Olympic gymnast helped propel his team to win bronze at the men's gymnastics team final at the Paris Olympics -- their first medal in 16 years. While the team is composed of five men -- including Paul Juda, Fred Richard, Brody Malone and Asher Hong -- Nedoroscik was the only member to qualify for a single event -- pommel horse -- at the team final on July 29, whereas his teammates each performed across the other five events. Despite his seemingly smaller role, his high score ultimately clenched the team's bronze win.\n\n\"It was just the greatest moment of my life, I think,\" the athlete told reporters, including PEOPLE, after excelling at his routine. \"[I'm] so happy to have been there.\"\n\nIn addition to being an Olympian, Nedoroscik quickly became an internet sensation thanks to his thick glasses, which social media users likened to Clark Kent. Though he was previously referred to as the \"goggles guy\" for the sports glasses he wore while he competed, Nedoroscik went sans glasses during his performance, explaining that he doesn't need his eyes to see the pommel horse.\n\n\"I don't think I actually use my eyes on pommel horse,\" he told The Washington Post. \"It's all feeling. I see with my hands.\"\n\nSo who is Stephen Nedoroscik? Here's everything to know about the pommel horse hero who helped the U.S. men's gymnastics team secure their first Olympic medal in nearly two decades.\n\nNedoroscik was born on Oct. 28, 1998, and raised in Worcester, Mass. He grew up attending the Sterling Academy of Gymnastics in Sterling, Mass., where he was cheered on during a watch party of the men's team finals.\n\n\"My parents started this business in 1992 with the smallest of dreams,\" owner Matt Carbone told NBC Boston. \"But 32 years later, we now have an Olympic bronze medalist, and he's still going on to compete in event finals on Saturday. It's absolutely incredible.\"\n\nCarbone remembered Nedoroscik as a \"goofy\" boy, whose banner now hangs in the gym for other children in the academy to look up to.\n\n\"He was a typical goofy little boy that would play around on the equipment and get in trouble at times and just had fun with gymnastics,\" Carbone said.\n\nNedoroscik committed to Pennsylvania State University in his senior year of high school to join their gymnastics team, announcing his decision on Instagram in November 2015.\n\n\"It took a long time to decide but I'm excited to announce I've verbally committed to Penn State, and in the process of signing the letter of intent, can't wait for college!\" he wrote in the caption of his announcement.\n\nThe athlete enrolled at Penn State in August 2016 and graduated four years later in December 2020 with a degree in electrical engineering. Since he finished school during the COVID-19 pandemic, Nedoroscik celebrated his graduation at home with a televised commencement.\n\n\"No recruiting trips. Didn't know collegiate gymnastics was an option until junior year,\" he wrote in his graduation post on Instagram. \"Penn State took a serious risk in taking me in, and I will forever be grateful for that opportunity.\"\n\nUnlike the other gymnasts on the U.S. men's team, Nedorocsik is a specialist in just one skill: the pommel horse. His task includes spinning around the figure and performing a 45-second routine filled with skills and tricks that he's trained for years but often may need to improvise in the moment depending on a number of factors.\n\nPicking a specialist for the Olympics was a controversial move. However, the pommel horse is where the U.S. men's team has historically struggled and Nedorocsik was the U.S. selection committee's answer to the problem.\n\n\"I was completely aware of it,\" Nedoroscik told the Post of the criticism he received. \"I really wanted to make the Olympic team, and I knew that there was going to be backlash to it. I do one event compared to these guys that are phenomenal all-arounders. And I am a phenomenal horse guy. But it's hard to fit on a five-guy team.\"\n\nNedoroscik isn't just a one-trick pony -- he can also solve a Rubik's cube at an incredibly fast speed. Before his performance at the finals on July 29, the gymnast posted a photo of his Instagram Stories of himself completing a Rubik's cube in 9.321 seconds, writing \"Good omen\" above the image.\n\nPer his TikTok bio, his personal best is 8.664 seconds.\n\nThe Olympian has made waves on social media not only for his incredible athletic prowess, but also for his thick glasses. Nedoroscik has strabismus, a condition where one eye is turned in a direction that's different from the other. Commonly known as crossed eyes, the athlete has control over which is the dominant eye, demonstrating his ability to switch in an August 2022 TikTok.\n\nAfter his performance, social media users began comparing Nedoroscik's appearance to that of Clark Kent, who also wears thick glasses when he's not his alterego, Superman. Even NBC's official Olympics account shared a post on X comparing a side-by-side photo of Nedoroscik with Christopher Reeves as Kent, calling the gymnast \"the Clark Kent of pommel horse.\"\n\n\"I think they're awesome,\" Nedoroscik said on TODAY of the comparison posts a day after his performance. \"You know, representing the people that wear glasses well.\"\n\nHowever, during competition Nedoroscik takes his glasses off, explaining on the show that he doesn't need them to perform well or see the pommel horse.\n\n\"When I go up on the pommel horse, it's all about feeling the equipment,\" he said. \"I don't even really see when I'm doing my gymnastics. It's all in the hands. I can feel everything.\"\n\nBefore his turn was up at the finals, Nedoroscik was getting himself in the zone, leaving the arena at one point to practice in the warmup gym. Minutes before he was up, a camera captured Nedoroscik leaning his head back and sitting with his eyes closed and glasses on -- a meme that quickly went viral.\n\n\"I'm doing my breathing exercises,\" he shared on TODAY. \"We always try to keep our heart rate down and through that five minutes I'm sitting there, I'm just visualizing my routine over and over ... that's all I'm doing in my head.\"\n\nAfter his teammates performed in the five other events for the artistic gymnastics men's team finals, it was Nedoroscik's turn to secure a medal for the team. He nailed his routine, earning a score of 14.866 and a bronze for Team USA.\n\nThough he was last after a \"long day,\" Nedoroscik told reporters, including PEOPLE, he was happy to go last.\n\n\"I framed that in my head as a positive, like I can be the exclamation point,\" he said.\n\nWith his teammates cheering for him on the sidelines and his coach's pep talk, Nedoroscik knew when he finished his performance that they had found success.\n\n\"I kind of, in that moment, was like, 'Alright, let's run it back, then. Let's go out there and do our thing,' \" he said. \"I have [coach] Sam Mikulak as just like, the greatest coach of all time. He's up there, helping me keep the nerves in check. He knows exactly what to say to me. So when we got that chalk bucket, he kind of just settled me down and said, 'You're ready for this.' I went up there, did my routine and during that dismount, I was just like, already smiling.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Japan surged to gold in the final rotation, while China took silver.\n\n\"I can't even describe it,\" said Brett McClure, a silver medalist with the U.S. men in 2004 and now the team's high-performance director. \"I was rooting for them the whole way, every single routine just kept getting better and better and better.\"\n\nIt's the first time the American men have been on the Olympic podium since 2008, when Jonathan Horton led them to bronze. And ultimately, they finished closer to second-place China (1.3 points off) than they did fourth-place Great Britain (2.2 points).\n\nGet Olympics updates in your texts! Join USA TODAY Sports' WhatsApp Channel\n\nStephen Nedoroscik, a pommel horse specialist whose only contribution to the team score came on the very last routine of the night, helped clinch the bronze for Team USA with a solid performance. But every member of the team hit clutch routines, including Paul Juda and Asher Hong on vault and Frederick Richard on high bar.\n\n\"Stephen was in the hardest seat of the entire competition, being last up on the last event, knowing that if you hit a routine, you're probably going to medal,\" McClure said. \"And he did it.\"\n\nThe Americans finished fifth at each of the previous three Summer Olympics, and they finished fifth again in Saturday's qualifying. The difference on Monday largely revolved around Malone.\n\nMalone, 24, had been expected to qualify for the all-around individual final and perhaps even contend for a medal, but he had a dreadful showing in qualifying - with falls on pommel horse, floor and even high bar, the event in which he won a world championship in 2022. It was such a jarring performance that some of his teammates later said he apologized to them afterwards.\n\n\"I know Brody's a dog and a competitor,\" Hong said. \"So I know he's going to come into team finals and full send.\"\n\nAnd he did. Malone improved upon or matched his performances on every apparatus, including a significantly better showing on high bar that helped keep the U.S. ahead of its bronze rivals. After falling twice on the apparatus in qualifying, he looked much more comfortable - and stuck the landing - for a score that was nearly two full points higher than his score Saturday.\n\n\"They went out and they did their job,\" said Sam Mikulak, a three-time Olympian who now coaches Malone and Nedoroscik. \"They went 18 for 18 ... the part we're most proud of is they didn't count any falls. They showed heart. They showed heart. They enjoyed every step of it.\n\nHong, Juda and Richard, meanwhile, each competed in four events - each pumping up their teammates, and the crowd, between routines. Chants of \"U-S-A!\" rang out at Bercy Arena at multiple points over the course of the night.\n\nAlthough China and Japan were long considered the favorites, the U.S. knew for months that it would benefit from the absence of Russia, which is banned from team competitions at these Olympics because of its invasion of Ukraine. The Americans knew the bronze medal was there for the taking. And they took it.\n\n\"We're trending or trending in the right direction,\" McClure said. \"Obviously Japan and China are still in another category ... This is gonna be motivating. Extremely motivating. So, tonight, celebrate like you know we did something we haven't done in so long, since 2008.\n\nCheck out all the highlights from the team final.\n\nStephen Nedoroscik dazzles on pommel horse\n\nStephen Nedoroscik closed out the U.S. men's rotation on pommel horse, nailing his routine and enciting a massive cheer from the crowd, including a chant of \"USA! USA!\" His teammates threw him in the air in celebration. He earned a score of 14.866.\n\nU.S. men's gymnastics in medal position entering last rotation\n\nThe U.S. was sitting in third place with just one rotation left to go. That last rotation was in a notoriously tricky event: Pommel horse.\n\nThe U.S. had a 1.8-point lead over Ukraine, which was in fourth place, after a solid showing on floor exercise. Asher Hong, Paul Juda and Frederick Richard all notched scores about 14.100 on floor, with Richard's routine the highlight.\n\nU.S. men's gymnastics has monster high bar set\n\nWhat a difference a couple of days make. The U.S. men were in third place with two events to go thanks to a monster performance on high bar.\n\nFrederick Richard and Brody Malone improved their scores from qualifying by nearly three points, including a hit by Malone. The 2022 world champ on high bar has been struggling on his signature event all summe, but he came through when it counted most. And Richard was simply magnificent, his release series setting off chants of \"USA! USA!\"\n\nHigh bar: Paul Juda (13.366), Frederick Richard (14.833), Brody Malone (14.166)\n\nU.S. men's gymnastics in second halfway through Olympic team final\n\nThe Americans are 1.201 points behind China after three events, with a score of 130.163. They got a big boost on parallel bars, where Asher Hong improved his score from qualifying by more than a half-point. Frederick Richard also picked up about 1.2 points, offsetting a slightly lower score from Brody Malone.\n\nIt's not just that the Americans were doing their jobs to this point, they were also getting help from the other contenders. Japan's Daiki Hashimoto fell off pommel horse in the second rotation. Britain had to count a 13.033 on vault and were 1.7 points back from the U.S.\n\nParallel bars: Brody Malone (14.433), Frederick Richard (14.566), Asher Hong (14.400)\n\nThe USA TODAY app brings you every Team USA medal -- right when it happens. Download for full Olympics coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and much more.\n\nAsher Hong amped after big vault\n\nOne of the keys for Team USA, and every team in this final, is to have its stars on each apparatus put up big scores. And Asher Hong certainly did that on vault, which is one of his best events.\n\nHong took a slight hop on his Ri Se-gwang vault -- a full twisting, double back somersault -- but nevertheless notched a strong score of 14.833, pumping his fist and yelling in celebration as he walked off the podium. Between that vault, Paul Juda's stuck landing, and dramatic improvement on this apparatus by Brody Malone, the U.S. put up another strong showing and moved into first place in the overall team standings -- at least for a brief moment.\n\nVault: Paul Juda (14.666), Brody Malone (14.533), Asher Hong (14.833)\n\nU.S. men's gymnastics on still rings\n\nThe U.S. got to off to a solid start on still rings. Frederick Richard led off with a 14.033 -- which was a half-point improvement on his rings score in qualifying -- while Brody Malone and Asher Hong finished right around their scores Saturday. The result was a net positive of four-tenths for Team USA over qualifying, where they finished more than three full points behind third-place Great Britain.\n\nStill rings scores: Frederick Richard (14.033), Brody Malone (14.166), Asher Hong (14.533).\n\nWhen does Simone Biles compete next?\n\nSimone Biles will next compete in Paris in the women's gymnastics team final on Tuesday (12:15 p.m. ET). Here's her full Olympics schedule:\n\nThe women's team final begins at 12:15 p.m. ET Tuesday, July 30. Biles will compete in all four events in the team final, even after tweaking her calf in qualifying on Sunday.\n\nThe women's all-around final is at 12:15 p.m. ET Thursday, Aug. 1.\n\nThe women's vault final is at 10:20 a.m. ET Saturday, Aug. 3.\n\nThe women's balance beam final (6:36 a.m. ET) and floor exercise final (8:20 a.m.) are Monday, Aug. 5.\n\nStephen Nedoroscik to step into pommel horse pressure-cooker\n\nThere was a bit of controversy over Stephen Nedoroscik's inclusion on Team USA. He only competes in one event -- pommel horse -- but he is one of the best in the world on that apparatus when he hits.\n\nThat means there's a ton of pressure for the Penn State product to nail his routine in the team final Monday.\n\nThe timing, or rather order of events, only further adds to that pressure. The Americans will go last on pommel horse, and Nedoroscik will be the third and final member of the team to compete. Meanwhile, Great Britain and Ukraine, who are expected to be Team USA's biggest rivals for the bronze medal, will be on floor exercise -- where Great Britain recorded the highest score in qualifying.\n\nThe rub: When Nedoroscik steps up to the pommel horse, there could very well be a medal on the line.\n\nOlympic gymnastics schedule\n\nHere is the complete Paris Olympics gymnastics schedule.\n\nThe men's team final begins today at 11:30 a.m. ET.\n\nThe women's team final begins at 12:15 p.m. ET Tuesday, July 30.\n\nThe women's all-around final is at 12:15 p.m. ET Thursday, Aug. 1.\n\nThe women's vault final is at 10:20 a.m. ET Saturday, Aug. 3.\n\nThe women's uneven bars final is at 9:40 a.m. ET Sunday, Aug. 4.\n\nThe women's balance beam final (6:36 a.m. ET) and floor exercise final (8:20 a.m.) are Monday, Aug. 5.\n\nU.S. men's gymnastics team: Meet all five members\n\nFrederick Ricahrd, Paul Juda, Brody Malone, Asher Hong and Stephen Nedoroscik are looking to end the Americans' 16-year medal drought in the men's gymnastics team final. Here's what to know about them.\n\nOlympic gymnastics scoring: How does it work?\n\nA gymnastics routine gets two scores: One for difficulty, also known as the D score or start value, and one for execution. Every gymnastics skill has a numerical value, and the D score is the sum total of the skills in a routine. The execution score, or E score, reflects how well the skills were done. A gymnast starts with a 10.0, and deductions for flaws and form errors are taken from there. Add the D and E scores together, and that's your total for an apparatus. (Vault scores will always be higher because it's a single skill.)\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Olympic gymnastics live results: US men win bronze medal in team final", "source":

Bush's administration, so USA Gymnastics hired a specialist to try to fix that.\n\nTheir gamble paid off.\n\nThe U.S. men won the bronze medal in Monday's team final, clinching their first team Olympic medal since 2008.\n\nStephen Nedoroscik qualified for the Olympic team solely on the strength of his pommel horse routine.\n\nHe was forced to sit on the sidelines for nearly three hours during the first five rotations before anchoring the U.S. on his specialty event. Nedoroscik stayed warm and focused, and appeared to be meditating on the NBC broadcast before his routine.\n\nWhen the time came, he hit it out of the park and secured a podium finish for Team USA.\n\nWhat made the 25-year-old Nedoroscik a unique  --  and somewhat controversial Olympic selection -- is that he does only one of six events. Typically high-level gymnasts are expected to be representative in several, if not all events.\n\nThe math worked well for the Penn State alum Nedoroscik and he gave Team USA its best shot at winning a team medal, as well as individual Olympic glory.\n\nHe's the only American man who qualified to an individual apparatus final in Paris, though Fred Richard won all-around bronze at last year's world championships and Brady Malone won the world title on the horizontal bar in 2022.\n\nRichard and Paul Juda qualified to the all-around final. Nedoroscik qualified in second place to the pommel horse final with an enormous score of 15.200.\n\nIn the men's team final, three gymnasts from each squad performed in six events -- floor, pommel horse, still rings, vault, parallel bars and horizontal bar.\n\nThere's no limit or minimum number of events a gymnast can perform as long as all six events get three performances from each team. All scores count.\n\n\"What it comes down to is that [Nedoroscik's] scores on pommel horse are so much higher than everybody else on that one event that he adds a tremendous amount of potential score,\" said NBC Sports gymnastics analyst Tim Daggett, a 1984 gold medalist.\n\nNedoroscik's strength happens to be a weakness for the rest of the U.S. squad, making him more valuable to the team score than an all-around gymnast who has the same strengths as the other athletes.\n\n\"That one routine from Nedoroscik gives Team USA basically a full point over the next guy in line for the USA,\" Daggett said.\n\nIn the three years between the Tokyo and Paris Olympics, the U.S. men's program has worked to increase their start values, or difficulty scores, to help close the gap against Japan, China and Great Britain, who regularly medal in the team event.\n\nJapan won gold, China took silver and Great Britain finished fourth.\n\nThe relative lack of difficulty on the men's team made the Nedoroscik gamble all the more necessary.\n\n\"We're in a much different position now,\" high performance director Brett McClure said of the Paris Olympic team at Olympic trials. \"We're gonna be able to control our own destiny. We're gonna get back on that podium. That's the expectation and that's our goal.\"\n\nMcClure estimated the U.S. men's scoring potential, including Nedoroscik's pommel horse routine, to be third in the world heading into Paris, behind China and Japan. In the qualifying round, they struggled with consistency and placed fifth.\n\nThe skills being performed by the current team increased in difficulty by over a point since last year's world championships, where the U.S. team also won a historic bronze medal.\n\nThe men's Olympic medal drought is in stark contrast to the U.S. women, who have won a team medal at every Olympics since 1992. They won the gold medal in 1996, 2012 and 2016.\n\nThe women's team is loaded from top to bottom with gymnasts who perform the world's most difficult skills, giving them a buffer equal to multiple falls. The U.S. men don't have the same advantage, but they can finally hang with the best in the world when they execute well.\n\nThey were close to flawless on Monday, while other top teams suffered falls.\n\nIn Tokyo three years ago, Russia took men's team gold, host Japan silver and China bronze. Fourth-place Great Britain and the fifth-place Americans missed the podium. Russian gymnasts will not compete in Paris due to the ongoing war in Ukraine.\n\nThe men's all-around final takes place on Wednesday at Bercy Arena in Paris.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horizontal bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_George_W._Bush", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of George W.

We'll see if they make an appearance in one of the next couple of competitions I have.\"\n\nCompeting in his first Olympics, the 25-year-old former pommel horse world champion performed so well during qualification he edged out two-time Olympic champion Max Whitlock of Britain, scoring 15.200 to Whitlock's 15.166.\n\nHis qualifying score tied with Ireland's Rhys McClenaghan for the highest among the eight finalists.\n\n\"Going out to Pommel Horse, last guy up there in the whole competition, I had a good feeling that our team was in a great spot,\" Nedoroscik said in an interview. \"I just knew I had to go up there and do my job.\"\n\nBy the time Nedoroscik approached his dismount with a huge smile on his face, he knew his job was done. The celebration started before he even touched the mat, followed by a score of 14.866. The gymnastic superhero revealed he had goosebumps, calling it the best moment of his life.\n\nMany fans are buzzing on social media about the 25-year-old from Worcester, Massachusetts.\n\nNedoroscik was well aware of the daunting history of the pommel horse, an apparatus the American men have historically struggled with for decades. This understanding drew him to the apparatus, as it demands qualities he excels in -- stamina, strength, and, most notably, creativity.\n\nHe loved the pommel horse since childhood, practicing on it for hours after his parents installed one in their backyard.\n\nNedoroscik graduated from Penn State University in 2020 with a degree in electrical engineering and competed in gymnastics throughout all four years.\n\nThe athlete has his friends, family, and girlfriend Tess supporting him.\n\n\"What a lucky man I am to have you by my side throughout this journey,\" Nedoroscik took to Instagram. \"I can't imagine where I'd be without you supporting me every day.\"\n\nIn 2021, Nedoroscik became the first U.S. gymnast to win a world championship gold medal on the pommel horse.\n\n\"Running into trouble on the apparatus early on taught me how to fight, how to stay on, how to really go for that routine,\" he told AP. \"And I think that has stuck with me throughout.\"\n\nA few feet away, his four teammates -- Brody Malone, Asher Hong, Paul Juda, and Frederick Richard -- cheered wildly after his performance.\n\nNedoroscik's next event is the finals on Saturday, where he has the chance to add another medal to his collection before heading home.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "courtney_mcginley@newsweek.com", "name":

the bronze.\n\nAfter the win, the men's gymnastics team sat down with NBC's Mike Tirico for an interview.\n\n\"We're gonna watch this together,\" Tirico told Nedoroscik as the gymnast took him through his routine.\n\n\"Going up to pommel horse last guy in the competition I had a good feeling our team was in a great spot,\" Nedoroscik said.\n\n\"I just knew I had to go up there and do my job,\" said Nedoroscik as he watched his routine back.\n\nThe 25-year-old watched back as he stuck the landing at the end of his routine which earned Team USA the bronze medal.\n\n\"Dude goosebumps right now this

gymnasts.\n\nIt consists of a metal frame with a wooden body and a leather cover.\n\nMost pommel horses today have a metal body covered with foam rubber and leather, with plastic handles referred to as pommels.\n\nThe medal victory is the first for Team USA men's gymnastics in 16 years.\n\nAsher Hong, Paul Juda, Brody Malone, Frederick Richard, and Nedoroscik all will return home with

NBC flashed a countdown clock to his performance. Then on the final routine of the final rotation, he stepped up for a 38-second performance that helped the team make history.\n\n\"It was a really long day, and I sat in our room and thought about how I get to be the last person [to compete],\" said Nedoroscik, who will compete in the pommel horse final on Saturday. \"And I framed that in my head as a positive -- that I can be the exclamation point.\"\n\nHe was an emphatic punctuation mark on a night full of highlights for the United States. The team hit 18 for 18 routines, including stuck vaults from Paul Juda and Brody Malone. Asher Hong's complicated double-flipping, single-twisting vault anchored the rotation and briefly pushed the United States into first place. Frederick Richard, the reigning world bronze medalist, avenged a lackluster high bar routine in the qualifying rounds by showing off upgraded difficulty and scoring the highest mark on the event during Sunday's competition.\n\nWith the table set for a perfect ending, Nedoroscik knew that he was going to deliver. He said he's never missed a routine if all of his teammates hit before him.\n\n\"I had no doubt in my mind that he could just go out there and just hit a massive set,\" Hong said.\n\nThe 2021 world pommel horse champion has been specializing in his signature event for eight years. Although he grew up practicing all six events, he noticed around high school that he was only progressing on pommel horse, the trickiest event in men's gymnastics that is often compared to the women's balance beam. As a one-routine wonder, Nedoroscik collected junior Olympic national titles in 2015 and 2016. People told him early on that he would be in the Olympics one day.\n\n\"Back then I was just dorky little kid,\" Nedoroscik said during the U.S. Olympic trials, where he hit both of his routines to punch his ticket to Paris. \"And now look at me. I'm a dorky adult going to the Olympics.\"\n\nOn the second day of the Olympic trials, the two-time NCAA pommel horse champion from Penn State also had to wait until the final rotation to compete. Just as he would do one month later at Bercy Arena, Nedoroscik delivered the routine he needed.\n\nAlthough Nedoroscik earned his position by delivering four strong performances during the U.S. championships and the Olympic trials to swing the formula used to predict the top team-scoring scenarios in his favor, some critics still wondered whether he belonged or whether an event specialist would hurt the team by limiting lineup flexibility.\n\nInstead he helped with the highest U.S. score on any event on Monday.\n\n\"It's like a Cinderella story, fairy tale ending,\" said Sam Mikulak, a three-time Olympian turned coach who trains Nedoroscik. \"I just hope everyone starts believing and gives him the credit that's due -- especially Team USA, for creating the procedures that got him on the team.\"\n\nIn the media mixed zone after the meet, Mikulak hadn't realized that the specialist who once drew side eyes had become the latest American cult hero. It was about time that the shift happened.\n\n\"He deserves to be recognized for his individuality,\" Mikulak said.\n\nNedoroscik's \"nerd credentials,\" as described on X, are nearly unmatched in sports. The night before the team final, he posted on his Instagram story that he solved a Rubik's Cube in 9.695 seconds.

Gabriel Bouys/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\n\nNPR is in Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics. For more of our coverage from the games head to our latest updates.\n\nMove over, Clark Kent. America's newest glasses-wearing (and glasses-shedding) superhero is Pommel Horse Guy.\n\nStephen Nedoroscik was not exactly a household name going into Monday's men's gymnastics all-around finals. As Team USA's resident pommel horse specialist, he was there to compete in just one event, which happened to be scheduled for last.\n\nBut in the hours that the 25-year-old waited on the sidelines, he started to attract attention.\n\nNBC put a countdown clock for \"Nedoroscik Pommel\" in the bottom corner of its video feed. Observers obsessed over the fact that he appeared to be sleeping at times, with his eyes fully closed.\n\nU.S. men's gymnastics, chasing its first Olympic team medal since 2008, decided to switch up its strategy this time around. Although all five members of the team qualified for the Games, not all of them will compete in multiple events (there are six overall).\n\nRather than assign all five spots on the team to \"all-around\" gymnasts who compete on each apparatus, the U.S. decided to allot one slot on the team to a specialist: Nedoroscik. He is competing only on pommel horse, a notoriously difficult apparatus and a weak spot for many teams.\n\nBut not this year, at least not for Team USA.\n\n\"What it comes down to is that [Nedoroscik's] scores on pommel horse are so much higher than everybody else on that one event that he adds a tremendous amount of potential score,\" said Tim Daggett, an NBC Sports gymnastics analyst who himself won gold in the 1984 Olympics.\n\nBy the time Nedoroscik had shed his warm-up suit and glasses, the U.S. was clinging precariously to its third-place spot and counting on him to keep them there.\n\nIt was under the weight of that pressure that Nedoroscik hopped onto the handlebars. After a dizzying 40 seconds of spinning (by him) and screaming (by the crowd), he stuck the dismount with a smile and a fist pump.\n\nHis teammates hugged and hoisted him into the air. They already knew what just happened: USA men's gymnastics had won bronze, its first Olympic team medal in 16 years.\n\nNedoroscik later told reporters that he had done his best to channel nerves into excitement.\n\n\"I've done this a million times at this point, and I just tried my hardest to enjoy every moment of that routine,\" he said.\n\nAnd he answered a question on many peoples' minds: He can see without his glasses, but doesn't think he's using his eyes at all.\n\n\"It's all feeling,\" he added. \"I see with my hands.\"\n\nNedoroscik's journey didn't end on Monday. He's the only member of Team USA who qualified for the final of any individual apparatus (you'll never guess which one). The pommel horse final is slated for Saturday, and he'll be chasing gold.\n\nNedoroscik's path to the pommel horse -- and Paris\n\nNedoroscik is a native of Worcester, Mass., and a 2020 graduate of Penn State, where he studied electrical engineering and competed in gymnastics all four years.\n\nHe got into the sport early, around the age of four, he told member station NHPR earlier this month.\n\n\"I would crawl up the walls, I'd shimmy up the door and it scared the babysitter,\" he recalled. \"And my parents just called me their 'little monkey boy,' and they decided, 'Hey, this kid probably would do a good job if we put him in gymnastics.'\n\nOn his first day at the kids' gym, he said, he somehow climbed the 15-foot rope all the way to the top -- setting two decades' of gymnastics into motion.\n\nAs a teen, Nedoroscik said he didn't realize how good he was at the pommel horse until a visiting coach marveled that he could one day be a national champion. Sure enough, one year later, he won the Junior Olympic national title on pommel horse. By the time he got to college, he made that his focus.\n\n\"When you go from a club gym to a collegiate gym, you see just how talented gymnasts really are in this nation,\" he said. \"And purely just wanting to be the best at pommel horse at Penn State, I decided to specialize. And I've stuck with that ever since.\"\n\nNedoroscik originally had his sights set on the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, sporting his signature goggles. But the team ultimately brought another pommel horse specialist after he fell at the trials, according to the Washington Post.\n\nHe went on to win gold in the world championships later that year and has continued to compete, dominating national and world competitions. His four U.S. pommel horse titles are tied for the most in U.S. history, according to USA Gymnastics.\n\nAfter he was named to the Olympic team in late June, a stunned Nedoroscik told reporters that his longtime dream had come true.\n\n\"When I was very, very young people would tell me, 'One day you're going to be an Olympian!' \" he said. \"Back then I was just a dorky little kid. And now look at me -- I'm a dorky adult, going to the Olympics.\"\n\nHe told NHPR that he's especially proud to have made it to Paris given the ups and downs of the last three years, and the disappointment he felt about not qualifying for Tokyo.\n\n\"This almost feels like my vengeance, right?\" he said. \"Coming back swinging.\"", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title":

And on Monday, his high-flying routine helped his team win a bronze medal.\n\nWhile Japan and China finished first and second, Nedoroscik and his teammates earned third place for the first U.S. men's gymnastics team Olympic medal since 2008.\n\nEver since, fans have been going nuts on social media over the unassuming bespectacled Nedoroscik turning into a superhero.\n\nViewers were fascinated watching Stephen wearing thick glasses, carrying a backpack and waiting three hours to perform in the very last event for Team USA.\n\nThe skinny gymnast appeared to be meditating as he sat on the sidelines -- or was Nedoroscik actually taking a nap?\n\nHe became known as \"pommel horse guy\" on X/Twitter.\n\nUsers were charmed by the \"nerdy kid\" and commented on his thick, square-framed glasses -- which, as it turned out, disguised the heart of a champion.\n\nAs X fan Marie noted, she was \"obsessed with this one guy on the US men's gymnastics team who looks like he's getting his phd in anthropology and his only job is pommel horse.\"\n\nAnother X user, Megan, wrote, \"Obsessed with this guy on the US men's gymnastics team who's only job is pommel horse, so he just sits there until he's activated like a sleeper agent, whips off his glasses like Clark Kent and does a pommel horse routine that helps deliver the team its first medal in 16 years.\"\n\nSome X users even called Nedoroscik their \"#1 favorite Olympic athlete.\"\n\nBut few knew that he has previously talked about being cross-eyed.\n\nSo where did Nedoroscik (whose name strangely comes close to nerd) come from, how did he get to the Olympics, what is his eye condition, and who is he dating?\n\nRead on for Parade.com's guide to everything you need to know about Stephen Nedoroscik!\n\nWhere is Stephen Nedoroscik from?\n\nThe athlete was born in Worcester, Massachusetts.

They even picked him up off the ground, knowing he'd secured their team medal.\n\nWhat is wrong with Stephen Nedoroscik's eyes?\n\nA couple of years ago, the gymnast revealed on TikTok that he has strabismus. \"Basically, I'm cross-eyed,\" he said. While one of Nedoroscik's eyes faces inward, the other eye focuses on something.

It can lead to double vision but the gymnast was not wearing glasses when he scored 14.866 on the pommel horse on Monday.\n\nNedoroscik told the Today programme he is 'representing people that wear glasses well', revealing that though his vision is 'not necessarily clear... the thing about pommel horse is if I keep [my glasses] on, they're gonna fly somewhere.\n\n'When I go up on the pommel horse, it's all about feeling the equipment.

Japan took gold, while China claimed silver.\n\nAfter a near flawless routine of twists, turns and spins, Nedoroscik leapt off the apparatus on his dismount and seemed to know he did his job well, clinching his first and yelling in celebration once he hit the mat as his teammates ran out to meet him and lift him up, while fans in the crowd -- including his parents Cheryl and John -- chanted \"U-S-A!\" throughout Bercy Arena.\n\n\"It was just the greatest moment of my life, I think,\" Nedoroscik told reporters after the event.\n\nWith their arms around one another, the men's gymnastics team waited anxiously for Nedoroscik's score to be announced and for the final competitor, China's Zhang Boheng, to finish his horizontal bar routine.\n\nBoheng's score gave China the points needed to secure second, while Nedoroscik's score gave the United States enough to hold off Great Britain and Ukraine for a medal of their own and start the celebration.\n\nNedoroscik said he knew was going to be stepping into a moment filled with plenty of pressure, but it was something he was happy to embrace. NBC cameras focused on Nedoroscik preparing throughout the event, at one point finding him with his eyes closed as he relaxed on the sidelines - a moment that became a hit on social media.\n\n\"(But) I thought about it before, about how I get to be the last person that goes in the Olympics,\" Nedoroscik said. \"I put that in my head as a positive.

A gymnast can perform in any event as long as all six events get three performances from each team and all scores count. Nedoroscik was only competing in the pommel horse, which was seen as a weakness for the U.S. squad and the reason he was brought on board, as Nedoroscik was the 2021 world champion on that apparatus.\n\n\"Stephen was in the hardest seat of the entire competition, being last up on the last event, knowing that if you hit a routine, you're probably going to medal,\" said Brett McClure, a silver medalist with the U.S. men in 2004 and now the team's high-performance director. \"And he did it.\"\n\nThe experience isn't over for Nedoroscik, as the Penn State graduate who got his start at the Sterling Academy of Gymnastics advanced to the pommel horse final after both he and Ireland's Rhys McClenaghan notched matching scores of 15.200 in qualifications last Saturday. McClenaghan posted the higher execution score, earning a mark of 8.900 to Nedoroscik's 8.800 to earn the top spot.

Yet whatever happens on Saturday or for the rest of his life for that matter, it will be difficult to top Monday night, when the guy with the curly hair and the glasses that made him the kind of social media sensation only the Olympics provides struck a blow for his sport, his teammates and himself.\n\n\"I'm really proud of these guys,\" he said while sitting alongside the group that became U.S. men's gymnastics royalty. \"I love you boys.\"", "source": {"uri": "wapt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WAPT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Mikulak", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sam Mikulak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_Bruins_women's_gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UCLA Bruins women's gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rubik's Cube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Juda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Juda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asher_Hong", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asher Hong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brody_Malone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brody Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accor_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accor Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Worcester, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Worcester, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhys_McClenaghan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rhys McClenaghan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levitation_(paranormal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Levitation (paranormal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 14}], "image": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/ap266a90e564bd9a.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.847xh;0,0&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

For more of our coverage from the games head to our latest updates.\n\nMove over, Clark Kent. America's newest glasses-wearing (and glasses-shedding) superhero is Pommel Horse Guy.\n\nStephen Nedoroscik was not exactly a household name going into Monday's men's gymnastics all-around finals. As Team USA's resident pommel horse specialist, he was there to compete in just one event, which happened to be scheduled for last.\n\nBut in the hours that the 25-year-old waited on the sidelines, he started to attract attention.\n\nNBC put a countdown clock for \"Nedoroscik Pommel\" in the bottom corner of its video feed. Observers obsessed over the fact that he appeared to be sleeping at times, with his eyes fully closed.\n\nU.S. men's gymnastics, chasing its first Olympic team medal since 2008, decided to switch up its strategy this time around. Although all five members of the team qualified for the Games, not all of them will compete in multiple events (there are six overall).\n\nRather than assign all five spots on the team to \"all-around\" gymnasts who compete on each apparatus, the U.S. decided to allot one slot on the team to a specialist: Nedoroscik. He is competing only on pommel horse, a notoriously difficult apparatus and a weak spot for many teams.\n\nBut not this year, at least not for Team USA.\n\n\"What it comes down to is that [Nedoroscik's] scores on pommel horse are so much higher than everybody else on that one event that he adds a tremendous amount of potential score,\" said Tim Daggett, an NBC Sports gymnastics analyst who himself won gold in the 1984 Olympics.\n\nBy the time Nedoroscik had shed his warm-up suit and glasses, the U.S. was clinging precariously to its third-place spot and counting on him to keep them there.\n\nIt was under the weight of that pressure that Nedoroscik hopped onto the handlebars. After a dizzying 40 seconds of spinning (by him) and screaming (by the crowd), he stuck the dismount with a smile and a fist pump.\n\nHis teammates hugged and hoisted him into the air. They already knew what just happened: USA men's gymnastics had won bronze, its first Olympic team medal in 16 years.\n\nNedoroscik later told reporters that he had done his best to channel nerves into excitement.\n\n\"I've done this a million times at this point, and I just tried my hardest to enjoy every moment of that routine,\" he said.\n\nAnd he answered a question on many peoples' minds: He can see without his glasses, but doesn't think he's using his eyes at all.\n\n\"It's all feeling,\" he added. \"I see with my hands.\"\n\nNedoroscik's journey didn't end on Monday. He's the only member of Team USA who qualified for the final of any individual apparatus (you'll never guess which one). The pommel horse final is slated for Saturday, and he'll be chasing gold.\n\nNedoroscik is a native of Worcester, Mass., and a 2020 graduate of Penn State, where he studied electrical engineering and competed in gymnastics all four years.\n\nHe got into the sport early, around the age of four, he told member station NHPR earlier this month.\n\n\"I would crawl up the walls, I'd shimmy up the door and it scared the babysitter,\" he recalled. \"And my parents just called me their 'little monkey boy,' and they decided, 'Hey, this kid probably would do a good job if we put him in gymnastics.'\n\nOn his first day at the kids' gym, he said, he somehow climbed the 15-foot rope all the way to the top -- setting two decades' of gymnastics into motion.\n\nAs a teen, Nedoroscik said he didn't realize how good he was at the pommel horse until a visiting coach marveled that he could one day be a national champion. Sure enough, one year later, he won the Junior Olympic national title on pommel horse. By the time he got to college, he made that his focus.\n\n\"When you go from a club gym to a collegiate gym, you see just how talented gymnasts really are in this nation,\" he said. \"And purely just wanting to be the best at pommel horse at Penn State, I decided to specialize. And I've stuck with that ever since.\"\n\nNedoroscik originally had his sights set on the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, sporting his signature goggles. But the team ultimately brought another pommel horse specialist after he fell at the trials, according to the Washington Post.\n\nHe went on to win gold in the world championships later that year and has continued to compete, dominating national and world competitions. His four U.S. pommel horse titles are tied for the most in U.S. history, according to USA Gymnastics.\n\nAfter he was named to the Olympic team in late June, a stunned Nedoroscik told reporters that his longtime dream had come true.\n\n\"When I was very, very young people would tell me, 'One day you're going to be an Olympian!' \" he said. \"Back then I was just a dorky little kid. And now look at me -- I'm a dorky adult, going to the Olympics.\"\n\nHe told NHPR that he's especially proud to have made it to Paris given the ups and downs of the last three years, and the disappointment he felt about not qualifying for Tokyo.\n\n\"This almost feels like my vengeance, right?\" he said. \"Coming back swinging.\"", "source": {"uri": "ctpublic.org", "dataType": "news",

This whole day has just been surreal. I am just soaking it all in. It is just an unbelievable experience.\"\n\nNedoroscik is an event specialist, as he performs only on the pommel horse. For the team finals, that event came up last in Team USA's rotation, meaning that Nedoroscik had to sit back and watch as his teammates -- Asher Hong, Paul Juda, Brody Malone and Frederick Richard -- competed on rings, vault, parallel bars, horizontal bar and floor exercise.\n\n\"It's pretty much the worst case scenario for me,\" Nedoroscik admitted. \"But in that moment I kind of decided that I wasn't gonna be nervous, I was gonna be excited for it because I get to be the exclamation point at the end of the sentence. I get to be the guy that caps it off.\"\n\n\"I already had this vision of all the guys just setting me up perfectly to go up there and nail my routine, and, I gotta say it, was pretty much exactly what I was hoping it would be,\" he continued. \"It was an amazing experience.\"\n\nIndeed, it all came down to Nedoroscik. Knowing that, if he nailed his routine, Team USA would medal in the competition, Nedoroscik did just that.\n\n\"This is a team sport. We had each other's back. They did their jobs and hit every single routine before me,\" Nedoroscik praised. \"Watching Brody Malone finish that pommel horse set, I was locked into my zone, but I couldn't even help but give a little smile 'cause I was like, 'Dude, he just set me up so well for this.'\"\n\n\"As I was walking up to that pommel horse, I heard the guys, they said, 'Steve you got this. We trust you. We're on your back. You've got this.' That's all I needed to hear,\" he continued. \"When I finally got to land that pommel horse dismount I think I was smiling before my feet even hit the ground, because, as I was doing that routine, I was like, 'If I hit this set we medal.' It was just a surreal moment.\"\n\nNedoroscik's teammates responded to his 14.866-score performance by picking him up in excitement, a moment that \"solidified\" the realization that they'd medaled for him.\n\n\"That was the moment where I was like, 'We actually did it,'\" he said.\n\nUnbeknownst to Nedoroscik, as he and his teammates were celebrating, the internet had found its latest crush. Memes even popped up comparing the glasses-wearing athlete, who shed him eyewear before his event, to Clark Kent.\n\n\"It is awesome,\" he said of the internet love. \"I didn't have my phone for a couple hours after the competition and I was like, 'Ah, it's gonna be so fun to see all my friends that have messaged me.' [When] I looked at it, I was like, 'What is going on?'\"\n\n\"I mean, there's so many memes out there about me being a sleeper agent who wakes up and turns into Clark Kent Superman on the pommel horse,\" Nedoroscik continued. \"They are hilarious. It is such an honor to be in that position. I'm glad the people are enjoying the show that us men put out last night.\"\n\nNo one's internet fandom beat out Nedoroscik's girlfriend, Tess McCracken, though. In fact, she proudly changed her X bio to read \"Ms. Pommel Horse.\"\n\n\"Tess is the absolute best,\" Nedoroscik gushed. \"First of all, [she is] beautiful. She is so smart. We met eight years ago at Penn State when we were both coming in as freshmen on our respective gymnastics teams. The first time I ever met her she was cracking her back. I thought it was kind of funny, so I introduced myself. We sat there and took an ADHD test or some baseline thing... Right away there was chemistry. It didn't take long for us to start dating.\"\n\nNedoroscik added of his girlfriend, \"She's just been my number one cheerleader for the last eight years.

And that time, for context, is quite impressive. \"Good omen,\" he wrote on Instagram.\n\nIt was indeed.\n\nIn arguably the most pressure-packed situation that one could imagine in men's gymnastics - the last routine of the last rotation of the Olympic final - Nedoroscik, who trains at Sarasota's EVO Gymnastics, delivered in a big way Monday night, putting together a smooth, confident showing on pommel horse that wrapped up the bronze medal for the U.S. men's gymnastics team.\n\nEVO Gymnasts at Olympics: Sarasota resident, gymnast Brody Malone overcomes injury to compete in Paris\n\nIt was his only event of the night, on the apparatus he's practiced exclusively since the waning days of high school. And when it was over, his teammates hoisted him into the air, and he raised his hands above his head.\n\n\"It was just the greatest moment of my life, I think,\" Nedoroscik said.\n\nGet Olympics updates in your texts! Join USA TODAY Sports' WhatsApp Channel\n\nIt's difficult to describe, in non-gymnastics terms, the sort of proverbial pressure cooker that Nedoroscik stepped into Monday night. It'd be like an NFL kicker sitting on the bench for the entirety of the Super Bowl, then coming out in overtime and draining a 49-yard field goal to win the game.\n\nYet even that analogy might not work. It's not just that the 25-year-old's only event in the team final was dead last, but also that pommel horse is notoriously known as the trickiest event in the sport. And that Team USA had not won a team medal in men's gymnastics at the Olympics since Nedoroscik was 9 years old.\n\nSo, pressure? Oh yeah, he admitted, he felt some pressure.\n\n\"(But) I thought about it before, about how I get to be the last person that goes in the Olympics,\" Nedoroscik said. \"I put that in my head as a positive. Like, I can be the exclamation point.\"\n\nIt was, in many ways, a validating moment for Nedoroscik, a Massachusetts kid who made a big decision all the way back at the tail end of high school. He knew, even eight years ago, that he probably did not have the talent to make it as an all-around gymnast at the collegiate level, let alone at the Olympic level. But in pommel horse, he realized, he might have a chance. He might be able to make it.\n\nSo Nedoroscik went all-in on one thing. He won two NCAA titles at Penn State, then four national championships and even a 2021 world title - all on pommel horse.\n\n\"Somebody like Stephen is a real anomaly,\" his college coach, Randy Jepson, said in an interview earlier this summer. \"You don't get a lot of those guys that stand up and stick out where they're the best in the world (in a single event).\"\n\nBut amid his successes, a narrative also started to form in some corners of the gymnastics world - that Nedoroscik could not hit a routine under pressure. He fell at the 2021 Olympic trials, which prompted the U.S. to instead bring Alec Yoder to Tokyo. And he missed again in the final at the 2022 world championships, where the Americans finished fifth. What was the point of bringing a specialist, the naysayers started to ask, if he couldn't do his singular job?\n\nThe questions continued even through the leadup to these Games, when Nedoroscik locked in his spot on Team USA based on math rather than a selection committee's preference. USA Gymnastics used scores from the national championships and Olympic trials to calculate the best possible teams for Paris - and, in part because other U.S. gymnasts struggled on pommel horse, Nedoroscik was on all of them. They needed his best, even if it meant risking a fall.\n\n\"I think there were a lot of people critical of Stephen being on the team to begin with - some of his history of not hitting the routine during a team event,\" said Syque Caesar, one of his coaches. \"You only need to hit when you need to hit. And yes, he missed at some other competitions, but nothing comes to the Olympics.\"\n\nAfter years of hyping himself up before competition, Nedoroscik said he later came to learn that it was better to calm himself down. He said his goal isn't to win anything, or make finals, or earn a certain score. These days, he focuses only on doing \"a good Russian flop\" - the second skill in his routine.\n\nOn Monday, Caesar said, Nedoroscik didn't warm up with the rest of the team. Instead, when they passed the halfway point of the competition, he went to practice in a back gym with three-time Olympian Sam Mikulak, another one of his coaches from EVO Gymnastics. \"It's just one Russian flop,\" Nedoroscik told him.\n\nHe then proceeded to step out onto the podium and record a score of 14.866 that, while three-tenths below his score in qualifying, was plenty good enough to put the U.S. on the podium.\n\n\"It's like a Cinderella story, fairy tale ending,\" Mikulak said. \"I just hope everyone starts believing and gives him the credit that's due - especially Team USA, for creating the procedures that got him on the team.\"\n\nMikulak smiled when told by reporters that Nedoroscik had already been picking up fans on social media for his \"nerdy\" appearance -- he wears glasses and used to compete in goggles.\n\n\"He's this awesome personality. He's a great kid,\" Mikulak said. \"And he deserves to be recognized for his individuality and his character.\"\n\nNedoroscik, for his part, said he's mostly been trying to stay away from the internet in the weeks leading up to Paris - though he was well aware of the people who didn't think he deserved a spot on the Olympic team.\n\n\"I knew that there was going to backlash to it,\" Nedoroscik said. \"I do one event compared to these guys that are all-arounders - phenomenal all-arounders. And I am a phenomenal horse guy, but it's hard to fit on a five-guy team.\n\n\"I think I kind of used that as motivation a little bit. In the gym, I was thinking, 'Let's prove these people wrong. Let's show them I am consistent. Let's show them I can do it for Team USA.' I think I did that tonight.\"", "source": {"uri": "eu.heraldtribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sarasota Herald-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "overall_neutral@eu.heraldtribune.com", "name":

That 80% would be good enough, even though Mr. Mikulak knew full well that Mr. Nedoroscik never does anything - from his sport to solving a Rubik's Cube - at 80%.\n\n\"You have to trick yourself,\" said Mr. Mikulak, a three-time Olympian turned coach. \"You've got to make sure you don't let all the noise get into your head.\"\n\nThat usually isn't a problem for the 25-year-old from Worcester, Massachusetts. It takes a certain type of single-mindedness to make the choices Mr. Nedoroscik has made for the past decade, when he essentially decided to dedicate himself to a single pursuit, focusing on an event that has long been a weakness for the U.S. men's national team program.\n\nYes, there is monotony involved. How could there not be?\n\n\"I don't know how I don't lose my mind,\" Mr. Nedoroscik said before the Games. \"But every day I go into the gym and there's still something to do. There's still something to improve.\"\n\nNot anymore.\n\nHe drilled his set during qualifying on July 27 to earn a spot on the event finals later in the Games. But July 29, things were different. Teammates Frederick Richard, Brody Malone, Paul Juda, and Asher Hong had put together 17 straight routines without a miss, putting the Americans in position to reach the medal stand for the first time since 2008 in Beijing.\n\nWhile Mr. Nedoroscik had some wiggle room - the U.S. had a fairly healthy lead after Mr. Juda and Mr. Malone hit their sets before Mr. Nedoroscik saluted the judges - he also didn't want to merely hold on. He wanted to prove a point.\n\nNot just to himself, but to those who wondered if he deserved to be there in the first place.\n\nWhat followed were 45 seconds of sublime brilliance, with Mr. Nedoroscik's hands traveling from one end of the horse to the other, his legs swooping this way, then that.\n\nA few feet away, his four teammates - and the sizable contingent of US fans inside Bercy Arena - roared as a medal that seemed distant for a program that had finished a distant fifth in each of its last three trips under the rings - drew closer.\n\nBy the time Mr. Nedoroscik neared his dismount, he knew his job was complete. The celebration began before his feet even hit the mat.\n\nAll those years, all those reps, both physical and mental, all the difficult times when he wondered whether to keep going, all the quirks he developed along the way - from the non-prescription goggles he sometimes rocks to the chef's kiss to the camera he occasionally makes - led up to that moment.\n\nAnd he did not miss, delivering \"the exclamation point\" with a 14.866 to finish off a performance the U.S. men's program hopes provides serious momentum heading into the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I kind of in that moment was like, 'All right, let's run it back and let's go out there and do our thing,'\" Mr. Nedoroscik said.\n\nThat \"thing\" has long been a sore spot for the U.S. in major international competition. The 2012 Olympic team topped qualifying. Then they led off on pommel horse in the finals and saw their medal hopes vanish one mistake at a time.\n\nMr. Nedoroscik understood the history. It's one of the reasons he gravitated toward pommels. Another is the fact that it requires many things - stamina, strength, and creativity chief among them - that he has in spades, particularly that last one.\n\nHe describes himself as a \"late bloomer\" on the event. Those early struggles only helped him press forward.\n\n\"Running into trouble on the apparatus early on taught me how to fight, how to stay on, how to really go for that routine,\" he said. \"And I think that that has stuck with me throughout.\"\n\nUnlike other events, which are painstakingly laid out and practiced on end for months if not years, pommel horse allows gymnasts to color outside the lines and make things up as they go on. Miss an element here? Well, maybe you can make it up by trying something else later in the routine.\n\nHe says the end result is the feeling of \"flying through the air,\" though it's more akin to levitation.\n\nMr. Nedoroscik will soar into the event finals on Aug. 3 with a chance to put another medal in his carry-on before he heads home.

Certain songs are banned from his playlists; they became unlucky when he performed poorly at competitions around the same time he loved them.\n\nNedoroscik's coach, Syque Caesar, describes the 25-year-old as \"quirky, funny, goofy\" and someone who \"dances to his own tune.\" Nedoroscik also happens to be better than just about everyone on the planet when it comes to swinging his body around a pommel horse.\n\nAnd for the U.S. men's gymnastics team to win a breakthrough bronze medal at the Olympics, the country needed Nedoroscik and his 40-second act of athletic excellence. He's in Paris for one reason -- pommel horse. This is his specialty, and he's so good at it that he earned a spot on the Olympic team ahead of his peers who compete on everything. Critics doubted whether he was the right person to round out this team. But after he sealed the bronze in Monday's team final, they'll never ask that question again.\n\nNedoroscik had nothing to do until he had everything to do. Pommel horse was the U.S. team's final event, and he was the final competitor. He waited in his sweatsuit, cupping his hands to his face as he screamed through his teammates' routines. At one point, Nedoroscik left the arena to practice his pommel horse set in the warm-up gym that's hidden from public view. Through it all, as the other U.S. gymnasts delivered one fantastic performance after another, he estimates he visualized his routine about 100 times.\n\n\"I do it all the time,\" Nedoroscik said of visualization. \"Sometimes I think I do it too much, but what else am I to do with those empty spaces?\"\n\nThe NBC broadcast featured a countdown to Nedoroscik's pommel horse performance, and as his time approached, the camera captured him with his eyes closed under his glasses and his head tilted back. And for the audience, he became something of a cult hero.\n\nThat's the power of the Olympics: Viewers who cannot name the six apparatuses in men's gymnastics fall in love with a glasses-wearing pommel horse star who clinched a bronze medal.\n\nBefore the competition, Nedoroscik posted a photo of a Rubik's Cube solve time on social media: 9.321 seconds. \"Good omen,\" he wrote.\n\nWhen Nedoroscik's turn finally arrived, the Americans had performed so well that he essentially just needed to avoid disaster. But pommel horse is the apparatus on which disaster often strikes. Athletes are constantly in motion, maintaining their rhythm as their legs swing around the apparatus and their hands support their elevated bodies.\n\nNedoroscik has a difficult routine with a high scoring ceiling, but he has at times struggled in pressure-filled moments. He didn't know the precise math, but he figured if he hit his routine, his team would win a medal. Because of the long wait and the stakes, Nedoroscik \"probably had the most pressure than any other athlete tonight on the competition floor,\" U.S. high performance director Brett McClure said.\n\nAs soon as he made it through beautifully, delivering a score more than enough for a comfortable third-place finish, the joy was instantaneous. Nedoroscik punched his clenched fist toward the sky and retrieved his glasses from the chalk bucket. He hugged one of his coaches as they both jumped up and down. Before he had even placed his glasses back on his face, his teammates swarmed and lifted him in the air.\n\n\"I don't know what's happening,\" he said to his teammates. \"Did we do it?\"\n\nThey happily answered.\n\nNedoroscik is in Paris to do this 40-second routine three times. He was spectacular in the qualifying round, tying for the top score in the field, and then he delivered again for the team. He'll have a chance to win an individual gold medal in Saturday's apparatus final. Yet his spot on the team was critiqued, and he knew it.\n\n\"I was completely aware of it,\" Nedoroscik said. \"I really wanted to make the Olympic team, and I knew that there was going to be backlash to it. I do one event compared to these guys that are phenomenal all-arounders. And I am a phenomenal horse guy. But it's hard to fit on a five-guy team.\"\n\nThe Paris team was built with a medal as the goal. The U.S. selection committee analyzed results from nationals and the Olympic Trials, and this group of five men maximized the potential score in the team competition, which requires three athletes to compete per apparatus. The approach favored a high-upside specialist such as Nedoroscik over a steady all-arounder.\n\nThe selection procedures included a scenario in which the five-member team was automatically locked into place without any further discussion. If the five gymnasts who maximized the team score were the same when using two different analysis approaches, that would be the team. And that's what happened. A committee didn't choose Nedoroscik. Simple math handed him a spot.\n\nAt national championships and the Olympic Trials, Nedoroscik had one standout routine but the other three were not quite up to his potential. He didn't perform his full repertoire of difficult elements -- sometimes intentionally and other times because he had to improvise mid-routine.\n\nIncluding a specialist on the team can be risky. Nedoroscik's value hinged on his ability to hit one routine. He channeled the criticism into motivation.\n\n\"People were worried he was going to hurt the team,\" said Sam Mikulak, a three-time Olympian who helps coach Nedoroscik. \"And he was the one to [clinch] it in the end. It's like a Cinderella story, fairy-tale ending.\"\n\nWhen told that strangers on social media embraced Nedoroscik during the team final, Mikulak was shocked but thrilled.\n\nNedoroscik, hardly recruited while in high school before heading to Penn State, has been a prominent elite gymnast since the previous Olympic cycle, initially known as the \"goggles guy\" because he wore sport glasses when he competed. He has since ditched the glasses and explained: \"I don't think I actually use my eyes on pommel horse. It's all feeling. I see with my hands.\"\n\nHe had a chance to earn a spot to compete at the Tokyo Olympics, particularly because an atypical format allowed the U.S. team to bring a four-member team plus an individual whose scores didn't factor into the team total. A single-event specialist was perfect for that individual role. But Nedoroscik fell at trials, and the United States brought a different pommel horse specialist to Tokyo instead.\n\nLater that year, Nedoroscik went to the world championships and won the gold medal on pommel horse. Worlds held immediately after an Olympics features just individual competition, and when Nedoroscik earned a spot on the U.S. squad in 2022, he failed to deliver in the team final.\n\nThose past mistakes lingered over Nedoroscik's otherwise remarkable ability. But earlier this year, he shifted his mindset. He stopped focusing on winning and started thinking about a single skill. He had a breakthrough performance at an international competition in March, and Mikulak asked how he did it. Nedoroscik explained that he just focused on one element called a Russian flop.\n\nSo as Nedoroscik talked with Mikulak here moments before routine, he told his coach: \"It's just one Russian flop.\"\n\nThen he worked through the most important performance of his career and became the nation's pommel horse hero.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Despite the Clark Kent comparison, Nedoroscik was called \"spider monkey\" during his younger years.\n\nNedoroscik gained widespread acclaim after the event for his impressive performance, with fans praising him as a hero for his crucial routine on the pommel horse and his focused demeanor leading up to it. In Paris, his girlfriend Tess enjoyed celebrating his victory with friends and family. She also shared a spot-on tweet about his glasses following his bronze medal win.\n\nNedoroscik who is a mechanical engineer was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, on October 28, 1998, to Cheryl and John Nedoroscik. His surname is Slovak, reflecting his great-grandparents' emigration from present-day Haligovce and Ve\u013ek\u00e1 Lesn\u00e1 in Slovakia. He started gymnastics in 2003 and initially competed in all apparatuses. However, by high school, he realized his strongest event was the pommel horse and chose to specialize in it.\n\nAt the Olympic Games, Nedoroscik qualified for the pommel horse final in second place, tied with Rhys McClenaghan at a score of 15.200. McClenaghan advanced as the top-ranked gymnast due to a higher execution score. Nedoroscik also contributed to the USA team qualifying for the team final in fifth place.\n\nIn the team final, the USA started on still rings and finished on the pommel horse, meaning Nedoroscik had to wait about two and a half hours before performing his routine. He executed a less difficult set than in qualification but still scored 14.866, helping the USA win the bronze medal for the first time since 2008.

Meet Worcester gymnast Stephen Nedoroscik.", "body": "The gymnast from Worcester helped Team USA men's gymnastics win its first team medal since 2008 with a stellar routine on pommel horse -- his only of the competition.\n\nAnd now, he's going viral. They're calling him \"pommel horse guy.\" Here's what to know about Nedoroscik, who is from Massachusetts.\n\nA 2016 graduate of Worcester Tech, Nedoroscik trains at Sterling Academy of Gymnastics in Worcester. Nedoroscik, 25, he began his gymnastics journey in 2003. Gymnastics was the only sport he played in high school and decided to focus solely on pommel horse after winning the Junior Olympic Nationals in 2015 and 2016, his only times competing in the event.\n\nUnlike some other gymnasts who learn all six disciplines (floor, vault, parallel bars, horizontal bar, pommel horse, and still rings), Nedoroscik stars on just one: pommel horse.\n\nHe is appearing in his first Olympics after narrowly missing out on being a part of the 2021 Tokyo roster. At the team qualification on Saturday, Nedoroscik scored a 15.2, the highest score for any American gymnast through the qualification.\n\n\"I really wanted to make the Olympic team,\" Nedoroscik said after the win on Monday. \"I knew that there was going to be backlash to it. I do one event compared to these guys that are all-arounders, phenomenal all-arounders. I'm a phenomenal horse guy, but it's hard to fit on a five-guy team.\n\n\"I think I kind of used that as motivation a little bit. In the gym, I was like, 'Let's prove these people wrong. Let's show them I am consistent. Let's show them I can do it for Team USA.' I think I did that tonight.\"\n\nWatch his routine here:\n\nNedoroscik didn't go on any recruiting trips out of high school, but landed in Happy Valley.\n\nJoining the Nittany Lions in college, Nedoroscik instantly made an impact, securing the 2017 and 2018 pommel horse titles at the national championships.\n\nNedoroscik won the Nissen Emery Award in 2020, given to the nation's most outstanding senior college gymnast. He continued his success after graduating with a degree in electrical engineering, winning United State pommel horse championships in four consecutive years, from 2021-24. His four US pommel horse titles are the tied for the most in American history.\n\nHave you seen his goggles? They are not prescribed, yet play an integral role in his look and his confidence. A secret Santa gift in 2017 while at Penn State from teammate Ben Cooperman, Nedoroscik began to wear them as a joke. When he continued to excel, he decided to keep them and has not broken the superstition since. Now, the goggles have become indelibly linked with the pommel horse specialist.\n\nOh, and he's smart: Nedoroscik boasts in his Tik Tok bio that his personal best at solving a Rubik's Cube is 8.664 seconds.\n\nNedoroscik isn't the only gymnast on Team USA from Massachusetts.\n\nFrederick Richard, who grew up in Stoughton and trains in Millis, competed in rings, parallel bars, the horizontal bar, and floor in the team final. He has bigger dreams than a bronze medal, though. He wants the world to know his name. Read more.\n\nThe internet loves Nedoroscik.\n\nHe was featured heavily on the NBC broadcast in the lead-up to his routine in large part because he waited more than two hours to compete. And when he won, admirers came out of the woodwork.\n\nHere are some of the best reactions to his success:\n\nAnd US senator Ed Markey even weighed in.\n\nNedoroscik is the only US male gymnast to qualify for an apparatus final. He'll compete for a pommel horse medal on Saturday, Aug. 3.", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "boston_globe@boston.com", "name": "Boston

This Nerdy Olympian Has Charmed The Internet", "body": "While his teammates were out swinging on the high bar and flipping through the air for their complex floor routines, Stephen Nedoroscik was busy taking a nap on the bench. As a gymnast for Team USA, he went to Paris to do one thing: absolutely crush it on the pommel horse. And crush it he did. Since the event took place on July 29 he's been a social media sensation, and is now lovingly known as \"pommel horse guy.\"\n\nThe men's gymnastics team was under a lot of pressure going into the 2024 Paris Games, especially since they hadn't medaled since 2008. After finding themselves in fifth place in the qualifying round, their hopes of making it to the podium all boiled down to the pommel horse -- arguably the most difficult apparatus in gymnastics -- and 25-year-old Nedoroscik's skills.\n\nViewers marveled as Nedoroscik -- who had been wearing thick black glasses the entire evening -- rose, removed his spectacles, chalked his hands, and instantly transformed from the unsuspecting guy in the background to the hero of the evening. The athlete jumped up onto the pommel horse, swiveled around with the greatest of ease, and dismounted perfectly for a score of 14.866.\n\nNedoroscik was immediately lifted up by his teammates, like a high school football star. His routine won them a bronze medal, and the love of the internet. On TikTok, @nataliebodesports said, \"Bro came to the Olympics for one event and absolutely cooked,\" while @niyaesperanza said, \"Long live pommel horse guy.\"\n\nHailing from Worcester, Massachusetts, Nedoroscik is an American artistic gymnast who focuses solely on the pommel horse -- an event that typically only takes about 40 seconds to complete. He's one of the best there is, which is why he was selected to join Team USA. Nedoroscik is such a pro they knew his inevitable high score could be the deciding factor in whether or not they medaled.\n\nBesides being a professional gymnast and member of the United States men's national gymnastics team, Nedoroscik is also an electric engineering graduate from Penn State. And according to a video from @itsdanielmac on TikTok, he's a fan of gaming -- his fave is Rocket League -- and solving Rubik's cubes, which he credited for helping him stay \"in the zone\" ahead of his event.\n\nArguably the funniest part of the \"pommel horse guy\" phenomenon is that Nedoroscik flew all the way to Paris for just that one event. There was even a countdown timer for Nedoroscik's performance in the corner of the screen. The athlete had to wait about three hours, according to NBC. Now that he's done winning bronze for Team USA, he gets to kick back and relax for the rest of the Games.\n\nLike the Clark Kent of gymnastics, Nedoroscik removed his black-frame glasses right before hopping up on the pommel horse, and just like that instantly morphed from a sleepy guy on the sidelines to a world-class athlete -- as well as an overnight meme.\n\nFans on social media commented on the fact that Nedoroscik apparently can't see a thing without his glasses, thus making his near-perfect performance all the more impressive.\n\nOn X, people were joking that romance writers were likely inspired by his transformation from bookish boy to medal-winning athlete, though his girlfriend, Tess McCracken, seems to be taking it all in stride.", "source": {"uri": "bustle.com",

The glasses themselves became a talking point -- and Nedoroscik has revealed in the past that being born cross-eyed has impacted his vision to the point that when he takes them off to compete, he often can't see what he is doing.\n\n\"The thing about pommel horse is, if I keep them on, they're gonna fly somewhere. When I go up on the pommel horse, it's all about feeling the equipment,\" he said during a 2024 appearance on \"The Today Show.\" \"I don't even really see when I'm doing gymnastics. It's all in the hands. I can feel everything.\"\n\nBut those glasses -- and his ability to whip them off and perform at a world-class level -- were what earned him a series of references to Superman's unassuming alter-ego, Clark Kent.\n\n\"Obsessed with this guy on the US men's gymnastics team who's (sic) only job is pommel horse, so he just sits there until he's activated like a sleeper agent, whips off his glasses like Clark Kent and does a pommel horse routine that helps deliver the team its first medal in 16 years,\" one posted.\n\n\"American icon,\" The Athletic's Nicole Auerbach added.\n\nNBC got in on the gag, officially dubbing Nedoroscik \"the Clark Kent of pommel horse.\"\n\nJohn Green added another level to the conversation: \"To truly understand Stephen Nedoroscik's nerd credentials, you need to know that he is in Paris for the Olympics and posting to his insta story about solving a rubik's cube in under 10 seconds.\"\n\n\"It went really well today, I handled the nerves very well. I worked my whole life up to those 45 seconds,\" Nedoroscik said of his brief time in the spotlight. \"This is just another day of doing the gymnastics. Sure it's the biggest stage in the world. It only happens once every four years, but at the same time I'm putting chalk on my hands and doing the horse for the team, it's nothing different.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(American_TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Today (American TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Kent_(Smallville)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clark Kent (Smallville)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whip", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerd", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nerd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chalk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter_ego", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alter ego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Dressage", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Dressage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://dw-wp-production.imgix.net/2024/07/GettyImages-2163946705.jpg?w=1200&h=800&ixlib=react-9.3.0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Unfortunately, that last rotation is in a notoriously tricky event: Pommel horse.\n\nThe U.S. has a 1.8-point lead over Ukraine, which is in fourth place, after a solid showing on floor exercise. Asher Hong, Paul Juda and Frederick Richard all notched scores about 14.100 on floor, with Richard's routine the highlight.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nNow, it just needs to hang on. The U.S. will put up Juda, Brody Malone and Stephen Nedoroscik on pommel horse. Nedoroscik is a one-event specialist whose only routine of the night will be Team USA's last -- with a medal on the line.\n\nU.S. men's gymnastics has monster high bar set\n\nWhat a difference a couple of days make. The U.S. men are in third place with two events to go thanks to a monster performance on high bar.\n\nFrederick Richard and Brody Malone improved their scores from qualifying by nearly three points, including a hit by Malone. The 2022 world champ on high bar has been struggling on his signature event all summe, but he came through when it counted most. And Richard was simply magnificent, his release series setting off chants of \"USA! USA!\" China still has a commanding lead, and Ukraine leapfrogged the Americans. But the Americans are hanging in there.\n\nBrody Malone put up an impressive high bar routine and scored a 14.166.\n\nFrederick Richard on high bar\n\nMonster high bar routine from Frederick Richard. He stuck the landing and scored a 14.833 -- roughly seven-tenths better than his routine in qualifying.\n\nU.S. men's gymnastics in second halfway through Olympic team final\n\nThe U.S. men are still in medal contention halfway through the team final.\n\nThe Americans are 1.201 points behind China after three events, with a score of 130.163. They got a big boost on parallel bars, where Asher Hong improved his score from qualifying by more than a half-point. Frederick Richard also picked up about 1.2 points, offsetting a slightly lower score from Brody Malone.\n\nIt's not just that the Americans are doing their jobs, they're getting help from the other contenders. Japan is probably out of the running for gold after Daiki Hashimoto fell off pommel horse in the second rotation. They're more than three points behind China and are almost two points behind the Americans. Britain had to count a 13.033 on vault and are 1.7 points back from the U.S. But the Americans must now go on high bar, a high-risk, high-reward event.\n\nParallel bars: Brody Malone (14.433), Frederick Richard (14.566), Asher Hong (14.400)\n\nAsher Hong amped after big vault\n\nOne of the keys for Team USA, and every team in this final, is to have its stars on each apparatus put up big scores. And Asher Hong certainly did that on vault, which is one of his best events.\n\nHong took a slight hop on his Ri Se-gwang vault -- a full twisting, double back somersault -- but nevertheless notched a strong score of 14.833, pumping his fist and yelling in celebration as he walked off the podium. Between that vault, Paul Juda's stuck landing, and dramatic improvement on this apparatus by Brody Malone, the U.S. put up another strong showing and moved into first place in the overall team standings -- at least for a brief moment.\n\nIf you're simply comparing Team USA's performance to its performance in the qualifying round, then things are looking good. The Americans improved by four-tenths on still rings and roughly 0.9 points on vault.\n\nThe gold will go to either China or Japan, and Daiki Hashimoto's mistake on pommel horse might loom large.\n\nThe reigning Olympic and world champion wound up on his back on top of the horse midway through his routine and dropped off. The crowd gasped, and Hashimoto put his head in his hands after he finished, knowing what a costly error it was. His score of 13.1 was almost 1.4 points below his score in qualifying. Unlike in qualifying, when teams can drop their lowest score, every score counts tonight.\n\nThe only positive is that the mistake occurred early enough in the competition that Japan has time to make up ground. Still, the reigning world champs are a half-point behind China.\n\nU.S. men's gymnastics on still rings\n\nThere's a lot of gymnastics left to go, but the U.S. got to off to a solid start on still rings. Frederick Richard led off with a 14.033 -- which was a half-point improvement on his rings score in qualifying -- while Brody Malone and Asher Hong finished right around their scores Saturday. The result was a net positive of four-tenths for Team USA over qualifying, where they finished more than three full points behind third-place Great Britain.\n\nIn Monday's eight-team final, the Americans will be rotating from one apparatus to another with Italy and start off on still rings. And they'll end with arguably the trickiest event in men's gymnastics: Pommel horse, which is often compared to balance beam on the women's side.\n\nAfter a rough showing in the qualifying round, reigning U.S. champion Brody Malone will have the busiest night in the final, competing in every event except floor. Asher Hong, Paul Juda and Frederick Richard will have four routines apiece, and Stephen Nedoroscik will wrap up the night with his only event: Pommel horse.\n\nHere's the complete lineup for Team USA in Monday's final, and their order of events:\n\nNBC is airing the men's team final, Peacock is live streaming it.\n\nWhat time is men's gymnastics on today ?\n\nThe men's team final is happening now, after starting at 11:30 a.m. ET. The U.S. men's gymnastics team is vying to win its first medal since 2008. The Simone Biles and the U.S. women's gymnastics team competes in the team final on Tuesday at 12:15 p.m. ET.\n\nStephen Nedoroscik to step into pommel horse pressure-cooker\n\nThere was a bit of controversy over Stephen Nedoroscik's inclusion on Team USA. He only competes in one event -- pommel horse -- but he is one of the best in the world on that apparatus when he hits.\n\nThat means there's a ton of pressure for the Penn State product to nail his routine in the team final Monday.\n\nThe timing, or rather order of events, only further adds to that pressure. The Americans will go last on pommel horse, and Nedoroscik will be the third and final member of the team to compete. Meanwhile, Great Britain and Ukraine, who are expected to be Team USA's biggest rivals for the bronze medal, will be on floor exercise -- where Great Britain recorded the highest score in qualifying.\n\nThe rub: When Nedoroscik steps up to the pommel horse, there could very well be a medal on the line.\n\nA gymnastics routine gets two scores: One for difficulty, also known as the D score or start value, and one for execution. Every gymnastics skill has a numerical value, and the D score is the sum total of the skills in a routine. The execution score, or E score, reflects how well the skills were done. A gymnast starts with a 10.0, and deductions for flaws and form errors are taken from there. Add the D and E scores together, and that's your total for an apparatus. (Vault scores will always be higher because it's a single skill.)\n\nWhy US men's gymnastics team has best shot at an Olympic medal since 2008\n\nWinning an Olympic team medal is difficult. Difficulty doesn't have to be what keeps the U.S. men's gymnastics team from winning one, however. Since the Tokyo Olympics, where they finished fifth for a third straight Games, the Americans have prioritized making their routines harder in hopes of breaking what is now a 16-year medal drought. You can do the most beautiful gymnastics in the world and it won't matter if your skills aren't as difficult as what the top teams are doing.\n\n\"I hate to say that about Tokyo but yeah, that was kind of what that was,\" said Brody Malone, referring to the 7-point gap between the U.S. men and China, the bronze medalists.\n\nIn the gymnastics scoring system, there is one score for the difficulty value of a routine and another for how well it's executed. The Americans still lag well behind Japan and China, perennial favorites in men's gymnastics. But with no Russia, which won the team title both in Tokyo and at the world championships before it, the bronze medal is there for the taking.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news",

Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports\n\nFor the first time in 16 years, Team USA has medaled in team men's gymnastics, earning a bronze at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris on Monday.\n\nThe stars aligned for the five-man team of Asher Hong, Paul Jada, 2024 national champion Brody Malone, Stephen Nedoroscik, and Frederik Richard, who finished fifth during qualifying on Saturday night.\n\nThe Americans have been no stranger to fifth place, either. That is the exact place they finished in each of the three previous Summer Games in which they did not medal.\n\nThis time around, though, Malone paved the way with a brilliant performance to wipe away what had been a disappointing showing during qualifying in which he fell on the pommel horse, during the floor routine, and on the high bar.\n\nCompeting in five of the six events, the 24-year-old's redeeming moment came on the high bar in which he scored almost two points higher than he did during qualifying with a 14.166.\n\nIt was Nedoroscik, however, who clinched the medal for the United States with a brilliant pommel horse routine that earned a score of 14.866. Only Max Whitlock of Great Britain (15.266) earned a higher score on the apparatus out of the 24 gymnasts participating in that event.\n\nOn the vault, only three gymnasts including Daiki Hashimoto from Japan (14.900) had a higher score than Hong, who scored 14.833\n\nGreat Britain took fourth place, finishing just over four points behind Team USA.

The Japanese settled for silver at home in Tokyo in 2021, losing to the Russians by just over a tenth of a point in a close final while China took bronze a little further back.\n\nThe United States, Great Britain and Ukraine are expected to content for a final spot on the podium and the bronze medal.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asher_Hong", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asher Hong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brody_Malone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brody Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Juda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Juda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_Bruins_women's_gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UCLA Bruins women's gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horizontal bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_McClure", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brett McClure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rope_Skipping/Clubs_and_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rope Skipping/Clubs and Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/07/GettyImages-2163296011.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The US pommel horse specialist nailed it", "body": "Stephen Nedoroscik, of United States, with Brody Malone and Asher Hong pommel during the men's artistic gymnastics team finals round at Bercy Arena at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Monday, July 29, 2024, in Paris, France.\n\nPARIS (AP) -- Sam Mikulak pulled Stephen Nedoroscik close and tasked the American pommel horse specialist with the impossible.\n\nThe U.S. men's gymnastics team's first Olympic medal in 16 years a solitary routine away, Mikulak told the pommel horse specialist that he didn't need to go all out. That 80% would be good enough, even though Mikulak knew full well that Nedoroscik never does anything -- from his sport to solving a Rubik's Cube -- at 80%.\n\n\"You have to trick yourself,\" said Mikulak, a three-time Olympian turned coach. \"You've got to make sure you don't let all the noise get into your head.\"\n\nThat usually isn't a problem for the 25-year-old from Worcester, Massachusetts. It takes a certain type of single-mindedness to make the choices Nedoroscik has made for the last decade, when he essentially decided to dedicate himself to a single pursuit, focusing on an event that has long been a weakness for the U.S. men's national team program.\n\nYes, there is monotony involved. How could there not be?\n\n\"I don't know how I don't lose my mind,\" Nedoroscik said before the Games. \"But every day I go into the gym and there's still something to do. There's still something to improve.\"\n\nNot anymore.\n\nProving a point\n\nHe drilled his set during qualifying on Saturday to earn a spot on the event finals later in the Games. But Monday night, things were different. Teammates Frederick Richard, Brody Malone, Paul Juda and Asher Hong had put together 17 straight routines without a miss, putting the Americans in position to reach the medal stand for the first time since 2008 in Beijing.\n\nWhile Nedoroscik had some wiggle room -- the U.S. had a fairly healthy lead after Juda and Malone hit their sets before Nedoroscik saluted the judges -- he also didn't want to merely hold on. He wanted to prove a point.\n\nNot just to himself, but to those who wondered if he deserved to be there in the first place.\n\nWhat followed were 45 seconds of sublime brilliance, with Nedoroscik's hands traveling from one end of the horse to the other, his legs swooping this way, then that.\n\nA few feet away, his four teammates -- and the sizable contingent of US fans inside Bercy Arena -- roared as a medal that seemed distant for a program that had finished a distant fifth in each of its last three trips under the rings -- drew closer.\n\nBy the time Nedoroscik neared his dismount, he knew his job was complete. The celebration began before his feet even hit the mat.\n\nAll those years, all those reps, both physical and mental, all the difficult times when he wondered whether to keep going, all the quirks he's developed along the way -- from the non-prescription goggles he sometimes rocks to the chef's kiss to the camera he occasionally makes -- led up to that moment.\n\nAnd he did not miss, delivering \"the exclamation point\" with a 14.866 to finish off a performance the U.S. men's program hopes provides serious momentum heading into the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I kind of in that moment was like, 'All right, let's run it back and let's go out there and do our thing,'\" Nedoroscik said.\n\nFilling a critical gap\n\nA \"thing\" that has long been a sore spot for the U.S. in major international competition. The 2012 Olympic team topped qualifying. Then they led off on pommel horse in the finals and saw their medal hopes vanish one mistake at a time.\n\nNedoroscik understood the history. It's one of the reasons he gravitated toward pommels. Another is the fact that it requires many things -- stamina, strength and creativity chief among them -- that he has in spades, particularly that last one.\n\nHe describes himself as a \"late bloomer\" on the event. Those early struggles only helped him press forward.\n\n\"Running into trouble on the apparatus early on taught me how to fight, how to stay on, how to really go for that routine,\" he said. \"And I think that that has stuck with me throughout.\"\n\nUnlike other events, which are painstakingly laid out and practiced on end for months if not years, pommel horse allows gymnasts to color outside the lines and make things up as they go on. Miss an element here? Well, maybe you can make it up trying something else later in the routine.\n\nHe says the end result is the feeling of \"flying through the air,\" though it's more akin to levitation.\n\nMore work to be done\n\nNedoroscik will soar into the event finals Saturday with a chance to put another medal in his carry-on before he heads home. His 15.200 qualifying score tied Ireland's Rhys McClenaghan for the tops among the eight finalists.\n\nHe is ready to ride the wave as far as it will take him. Yet whatever happens on Saturday or for the rest of his life for that matter, it will be difficult to top Monday night, when the guy with the curly hair and the glasses that made him the kind of social media sensation only the Olympics provides struck a blow for his sport, his teammates and himself.\n\n\"I'm really proud of these guys,\" he said while sitting alongside the group that became U.S. men's gymnastics royalty. \"I love you boys.\"\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "will_graves@eagletribune.com", "name": "Will Graves", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Mikulak", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sam Mikulak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asher_Hong", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asher Hong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brody_Malone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brody Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accor_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Accor Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_Bruins_women's_gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UCLA Bruins women's gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rubik's Cube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artistic gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Worcester, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Worcester, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Juda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Juda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhys_McClenaghan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhys McClenaghan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eagletribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/be/8be8dec4-2d6f-5e58-bbb9-b337a1ae1252/66a8cb2510092.image.jpg?crop=1762%2C925%2C0%2C125&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

For more of our coverage from the games head to our latest updates.\n\nPARIS -- The moment that Stephen Nedoroscik's feet touched the floor -- one last perfect landing in the final routine of the night -- the U.S. men's gymnastics team exploded in joy.\n\nIt didn't matter that the medal was bronze, not gold. The achievement was monumental all the same: the first team medal for U.S. men's gymnastics in the Olympics since 2008. Accordingly, there were plenty of hugs to go around.\n\nThe U.S. men were nearly flawless in the team final, held Monday before a crowd of nearly 15,000 people in Paris's Bercy Arena.\n\nThe performance was a triumph after a disappointing fifth-place finish Saturday in the qualifying rounds. The team members, by their own admission, had failed to live up to expectations.\n\nIt was the team's only returning Olympian, Brody Malone, who'd had the worst performance on Saturday. He fell once on the pommel horse, then twice on the horizontal bar. The painful errors ultimately cost him a chance to compete for an individual all-around medal.\n\n\"It wasn't the best day,\" Malone said Saturday after the competition. \"We left a lot on the table -- well, I left a lot on the table.\"\n\nOn Monday, Malone was the hero. He, like the rest of the team, finished the night without a major error. His improvement alone was worth about 2.5 extra points for the United States.\n\nAlongside Nedoroscik and Malone were Asher Hong, Paul Juda and Frederick Richard, the 20-year-old TikTok star who claimed the bronze. Japan took gold and China won silver.\n\nIt has been a long journey back to the podium for the U.S. men's gymnastics. To compete on the international stage required a sea change in the way the men's team approached their routines, which are scored for both the difficulty of what was attempted and the gymnast's execution.\n\n\"We were so far behind in difficulty,\" Brett McClure, the men's high performance director said last week. \"I believe that this team's legacy is being able to close the gap in such a short amount of time.\"\n\nThe program's long-term strategy has its eyes set even further ahead, to the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.\n\nMcClure was part of the 2004 Olympic team in Athens, where the U.S. men won a silver medal. At the next Olympics, in Beijing in 2008, the men won a bronze -- their last team medal for 16 years.\n\nTwo U.S. gymnasts, Richard and Juda, will participate in the men's individual all-around final, which will take place Wednesday at 11:30 a.m. Eastern time.\n\nThe only member of the team to qualify for an event final was Nedoroscik, whose score of 15.2 during qualifying rounds tied for the highest of that apparatus, will compete in the pommel horse final on Saturday.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "becky_sullivan@npr.org", "name":

For more of our coverage from the games head to our latest updates.\n\nPARIS -- The moment that Stephen Nedoroscik's feet touched the floor -- one last perfect landing in the final routine of the night -- the U.S. men's gymnastics team exploded in joy.\n\nIt didn't matter that the medal was bronze, not gold. The achievement was monumental all the same: the first team medal for U.S. men's gymnastics in the Olympics since 2008. Accordingly, there were plenty of hugs to go around.\n\nThe U.S. men were nearly flawless in the team final, held Monday before a crowd of nearly 15,000 people in Paris's Bercy Arena.\n\nThe performance was a triumph after a disappointing fifth-place finish Saturday in the qualifying rounds. The team members, by their own admission, had failed to live up to expectations.\n\nIt was the team's only returning Olympian, Brody Malone, who'd had the worst performance on Saturday. He fell once on the pommel horse, then twice on the horizontal bar. The painful errors ultimately cost him a chance to compete for an individual all-around medal.\n\n\"It wasn't the best day,\" Malone said Saturday after the competition. \"We left a lot on the table -- well, I left a lot on the table.\"\n\nOn Monday, Malone was the hero. He, like the rest of the team, finished the night without a major error. His improvement alone was worth about 2.5 extra points for the United States.\n\nAlongside Nedoroscik and Malone were Asher Hong, Paul Juda and Frederick Richard, the 20-year-old TikTok star who claimed the bronze. Japan took gold and China won silver.\n\nIt has been a long journey back to the podium for the U.S. men's gymnastics. To compete on the international stage required a sea change in the way the men's team approached their routines, which are scored for both the difficulty of what was attempted and the gymnast's execution.\n\n\"We were so far behind in difficulty,\" Brett McClure, the men's high performance director said last week. \"I believe that this team's legacy is being able to close the gap in such a short amount of time.\"\n\nThe program's long-term strategy has its eyes set even further ahead, to the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles.\n\nMcClure was part of the 2004 Olympic team in Athens, where the U.S. men won a silver medal. At the next Olympics, in Beijing in 2008, the men won a bronze -- their last team medal for 16 years.\n\nTwo U.S. gymnasts, Richard and Juda, will participate in the men's individual all-around final, which will take place Wednesday at 11:30 a.m. Eastern time.\n\nThe only member of the team to qualify for an event final was Nedoroscik, whose score of 15.2 during qualifying rounds tied for the highest of that apparatus, will compete in the pommel horse final on Saturday.", "source": {"uri": "wfae.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFAE 90.7 -

We joked that they must have some magic in them, so I kept wearing them.\"\n\nNedoroscik -- who was seen squinting at the pommel horse when he approached it after taking his glasses off -- suffers from strabismus (a.k.a. crossed eyes) as well as coloboma, a condition involving a hole in the eye stemming from missing tissue that can have an impact on your vision.\n\nAs a result, you might wonder why he hopped on the pommel horse without the glasses he relies on in day-to-day life, but he shed some light on the decision while speaking with The Washington Post, noting, \"I don't think I actually use my eyes on pommel horse. It's all feeling. I see with my hands.\"\n\nIt's safe to say the approach worked out for him at the Olympics.", "source": {"uri": "brobible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BroBible"}, "authors": [{"uri": "connor_toole@brobible.com", "name": "Connor Toole", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Glasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brody_Malone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brody Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_Bruins_women's_gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UCLA Bruins women's gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_State_Nittany_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penn State Nittany Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarasota,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sarasota, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sarasota, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coloboma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coloboma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Santa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secret Santa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strabismus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Globe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Boston Globe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Rhythmic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Rhythmic", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Organizations", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Stephen-Nedoroscik.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

American team's first since 2008 in Beijing.\n\nThe 25-year-old Nedoroscik teamed with Asher Hong, Paul Juda, Brody Malone and Fred Richard to pull off the feat.\n\nMaybe most impressively, the

silver medalist in the 2024 Winter Cup.\n\nBefore that, the Sarasota, Fl. resident attended Penn State, where he won two national titles in pommel horse competition and was a four-time

vie for gold on Aug. 3 during the final.\n\nNedoroscik will look to upstage Great Britain's Max Whitlock, who has won two straight gold medals in the event.\n\nOn the other side of the bar, Team USA's star-studded women's squad looks to maintain the podium placement in the all-around competition, which takes place on Tuesday.\n\nNedoroscik's grand finale proved one of several highlights for the Americans to start the week in Paris.\n\nOther headliners included ex-NBA player-turned beach volleyball standout Chase Budinger claiming his first win, plus Jagger Eaton winning silver in men's

The American men's team, which had not achieved a podium finish at a Summer Games in 16 years, returned to glory by capturing the bronze medal in team competition at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nThe quintet of 20-something gymnasts -- Asher Hong, Paul Juda, Brody Malone, Stephen Nedoroscik and Fred Richard -- huddled for an enthusiastic (and camera-friendly) \"team\" shout after each of the first five rotations but saved its most zealous display for last. Reigning world champion Stephen Nedoroscik's drama-free exit from the pommel horse locked in a 14.866 score to close the competition, clinching the third-place finish for his teammates.\n\nNedoroscik -- a glasses-wearing 25-year-old who kept his head down, stayed to himself throughout the competition and only competed in the final event of the all-around -- was quickly enveloped in a giddy blur of red, white and blue testosterone bliss.\n\nJapan took its eighth all-time team gold medal with 259.594 points. China followed in the standings with 259.062 as the U.S. was third with 257.793, more than two full points ahead of Ukraine in fourth.\n\nOf the 18 individual performances the Americans put down Monday -- three athletes in each of six events -- 15 of their Monday scores exceeded what they achieved during Saturday's qualifying round. As each rotation concluded ahead of pace, spectators could feel the United States getting closer and closer to a medal.\n\nThe Americans were in position for bronze after four rotations, holding their position while belling their relative inexperience with steely-eyed floor exercises from Juda, Hong and Richard, followed by Juda, Malone and Nedoroscik on pommel horse.\n\nOnly Malone had arrived in Paris with prior Olympic experience from the 2020 Tokyo Games, though he struggled on pommel horse in Saturday qualifiers and hadn't performed in a significant international event since a devastating leg injury that warranted three subsequent surgeries following a fall from the bar just 16 months ago in Germany.\n\nBoth Richard's 14.466 on the floor and Nedoroscik's 14.866 on pommel horse were the best among six athletes in their stretch-run rotations on those events. It became apparent that a medal was ahead for the United States as Nedoroscik planted his right hand and smiled broadly mid-dismount, ending a run of three straight fifth-place Olympic finishes.\n\nThe U.S. won gold at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. Since then, silver at the 2004 Athens Olympics and bronze in the 2008 Beijing Olympics have been the only medals captured by men's gymnastics in team competition over the last 40 years.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lyle_fitzsimmons@cbssports.com", "name": "Lyle Fitzsimmons", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Juda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Juda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Richard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Richard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asher_Hong", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asher Hong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brody_Malone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brody Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2022_Commonwealth_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2022 Commonwealth Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_pentathlon_at_the_1984_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Modern pentathlon at the 1984 Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karate at the 2020 Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Organizations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://sportsfly.cbsistatic.com/fly-0752/bundles/sportsmediacss/images/fantasy/default-article-image-large.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

That 80% would be good enough, even though Mikulak knew full well that Nedoroscik never does anything -- from his sport to solving a Rubik's Cube -- at 80%.\n\n\"You have to trick yourself,\" said Mikulak, a three-time Olympian turned coach. \"You've got to make sure you don't let all the noise get into your head.\"\n\nThat usually isn't a problem for the 25-year-old from Worcester, Massachusetts. It takes a certain type of single-mindedness to make the choices Nedoroscik has made for the last decade, when he essentially decided to dedicate himself to a single pursuit, focusing on an event that has long been a weakness for the U.S. men's national team program.\n\nYes, there is monotony involved. How could there not be?\n\n\"I don't know how I don't lose my mind,\" Nedoroscik said before the Games. \"But every day I go into the gym and there's still something to do. There's still something to improve.\"\n\nNot anymore.\n\nProving a point\n\nHe drilled his set during qualifying on Saturday to earn a spot on the event finals later in the Games. But Monday night, things were different. Teammates Frederick Richard, Brody Malone, Paul Juda and Asher Hong had put together 17 straight routines without a miss, putting the Americans in position to reach the medal stand for the first time since 2008 in Beijing.\n\nWhile Nedoroscik had some wiggle room -- the U.S. had a fairly healthy lead after Juda and Malone hit their sets before Nedoroscik saluted the judges -- he also didn't want to merely hold on. He wanted to prove a point.\n\nNot just to himself, but to those who wondered if he deserved to be there in the first place.\n\nWhat followed were 45 seconds of sublime brilliance, with Nedoroscik's hands traveling from one end of the horse to the other, his legs swooping this way, then that.\n\nA few feet away, his four teammates -- and the sizable contingent of US fans inside Bercy Arena -- roared as a medal that seemed distant for a program that had finished a distant fifth in each of its last three trips under the rings -- drew closer.\n\nBy the time Nedoroscik neared his dismount, he knew his job was complete. The celebration began before his feet even hit the mat.\n\nAll those years, all those reps, both physical and mental, all the difficult times when he wondered whether to keep going, all the quirks he's developed along the way -- from the non-prescription goggles he sometimes rocks to the chef's kiss to the camera he occasionally makes -- led up to that moment.\n\nAnd he did not miss, delivering \"the exclamation point\" with a 14.866 to finish off a performance the U.S. men's program hopes provides serious momentum heading into the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I kind of in that moment was like, 'All right, let's run it back and let's go out there and do our thing,'\" Nedoroscik said.\n\nFilling a critical gap\n\nA \"thing\" that has long been a sore spot for the U.S. in major international competition. The 2012 Olympic team topped qualifying. Then they led off on pommel horse in the finals and saw their medal hopes vanish one mistake at a time.\n\nNedoroscik understood the history. It's one of the reasons he gravitated toward pommels. Another is the fact that it requires many things -- stamina, strength and creativity chief among them -- that he has in spades, particularly that last one.\n\nHe describes himself as a \"late bloomer\" on the event. Those early struggles only helped him press forward.\n\n\"Running into trouble on the apparatus early on taught me how to fight, how to stay on, how to really go for that routine,\" he said. \"And I think that that has stuck with me throughout.\"\n\nUnlike other events, which are painstakingly laid out and practiced on end for months if not years, pommel horse allows gymnasts to color outside the lines and make things up as they go on. Miss an element here? Well, maybe you can make it up trying something else later in the routine.\n\nHe says the end result is the feeling of \"flying through the air,\" though it's more akin to levitation.\n\nMore work to be done\n\nNedoroscik will soar into the event finals Saturday with a chance to put another medal in his carry-on before he heads home. His 15.200 qualifying score tied Ireland's Rhys McClenaghan for the tops among the eight finalists.\n\nHe is ready to ride the wave as far as it will take him. Yet whatever happens on Saturday or for the rest of his life for that matter, it will be difficult to top Monday night, when the guy with the curly hair and the glasses that made him the kind of social media sensation only the Olympics provides struck a blow for his sport, his teammates and himself.\n\n\"I'm really proud of these guys,\" he said while sitting alongside the group that became U.S. men's gymnastics royalty. \"I love you boys.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Instead, fans couldn't help but notice that he spent hours that day supporting his teammates by fetching them water and cheering them on. The reason he didn't compete in the earlier events is because Nedoroscik is a member of the team solely because of his prowess at just one event, the pommel horse, and nothing else. He's kind of the \"pro from Dover,\" a weapon that's only deployed when the time is right.\n\nThat time came at the very end of the meet, when it was up to Nedoroscik to beat Great Britain to secure Team U.S.A.'s first medal in 16 years. Right before the event, NBC shared this photo of the athlete seemingly cool, calm, collected, and firmly \"in the zone.\"\n\nLater, Nedoroscik told Today's Savannah Guthrie, \"I'm doing my breathing exercises. We always try to keep our heart rate down and through that five minutes I'm sitting there, I'm just visualizing my routine over and over ... that's all I'm doing in my head.\"\n\nDespite his calm demeanor, when it was his time to shine, he did. And HOW!\n\nNedoroscik crushed it at his one and only event, earning a massive score of 14.866 to bring his team to an overall score of 257.793. His performance in the ninth inning broke the 16-year dry spell while also launching the first official meme rush of the Paris Olympics. People flocked to social media to share images of the bespeckled athlete, whom many dubbed the \"Clark Kent\" of the Games. Here's a sampling of the best Stephen Nedoroscik memes so far.\n\nAs an aside, Nedoroscik also told Today that he always removes his glasses before performing on the pommel horse, stating that his vision is \"not necessarily clear,\" but that they will \"fly somewhere\" if he tries to keep them on. \"When I go up on the pommel horse, it's all about feeling the equipment,\" he said. \"I don't even really see when I'm doing my gymnastics. It's all in the hands -- I can feel everything.\"\n\nAs for Nedoroscik, the athlete seems to be taking the new meme attention in his stride. \"I think they're awesome,\" he told Hoda Kotb. \"I'm representing people that wear glasses well.\"\n\nHe sure is! Congratulations to Stephen Nedoroscik and the entire men's Team U.S.A. gymnastics team on their bronze medal.

Since the waning days of his high-school career, he has competed only on pommel horse - emerging as one of the best athletes in the world on this one apparatus, even at the apparent expense of the other five.\n\nIn arguably the most pressure-packed situation that one could imagine in men's gymnastics - the last routine of the last rotation of the Olympic final - Nedoroscik delivered in a big way Monday night, putting together a smooth, confident showing on pommel horse that wrapped up the bronze medal for the U.S. men's gymnastics team.\n\nIt was his only event of the night, on the apparatus he's practiced exclusively for years. And when it was over, his teammates hoisted him into the air, and he raised his hands above his head.\n\n\"It was just the greatest moment of my life, I think,\" Nedoroscik said.\n\nYou can watch his full routine, which earned him a score of 14.866, below.\n\nSocial media reaction to Stephen Nedoroscik\n\nBefore his routine, Nedoroscik was shown with his head resting on a wall and his eyes closed, appearing to take a moment to focus. The image became the source of many jokes on social media.\n\nHis pommel horse routine, and the clinching of the bronze medal for USA Gymnastics, also earned Nedoroscik the admiration of many social media users.\n\nContributing: Craig Meyer, USA TODAY Network", "source": {"uri": "eu.elpasotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "El Paso Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Grimes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Katie Grimes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_Bruins_women's_gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UCLA Bruins women's gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caeleb_Dressel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caeleb Dressel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Gymnastics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Rhythmic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Rhythmic", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Organizations", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/30/USAT/74599216007-usatsi-23856687.jpg?auto=webp&crop=3125,1759,x0,y232&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

The US pommel horse specialist nailed it", "body": "PARIS, France -- Sam Mikulak pulled Stephen Nedoroscik close and tasked the American pommel horse specialist with the impossible.\n\nThe U.S. men's gymnastics team's first Olympic medal in 16 years a solitary routine away, Mikulak told the pommel horse specialist that he didn't need to go all out. That 80% would be good enough, even though Mikulak knew full well that Nedoroscik never does anything -- from his sport to solving a Rubik's Cube -- at 80%.\n\n\"You have to trick yourself,\" said Mikulak, a three-time Olympian turned coach. \"You've got to make sure you don't let all the noise get into your head.\"\n\nThat usually isn't a problem for the 25-year-old from Worcester, Massachusetts. It takes a certain type of single-mindedness to make the choices Nedoroscik has made for the last decade, when he essentially decided to dedicate himself to a single pursuit, focusing on an event that has long been a weakness for the U.S. men's national team program.\n\nYes, there is monotony involved. How could there not be?\n\n\"I don't know how I don't lose my mind,\" Nedoroscik said before the Games. \"But every day I go into the gym and there's still something to do. There's still something to improve.\"\n\nNot anymore.\n\nHe drilled his set during qualifying on Saturday to earn a spot on the event finals later in the Games. But Monday night, things were different. Teammates Frederick Richard, Brody Malone, Paul Juda and Asher Hong had put together 17 straight routines without a miss, putting the Americans in position to reach the medal stand for the first time since 2008 in Beijing.\n\nWhile Nedoroscik had some wiggle room -- the U.S. had a fairly healthy lead after Juda and Malone hit their sets before Nedoroscik saluted the judges -- he also didn't want to merely hold on. He wanted to prove a point.\n\nNot just to himself, but to those who wondered if he deserved to be there in the first place.\n\nWhat followed were 45 seconds of sublime brilliance, with Nedoroscik's hands traveling from one end of the horse to the other, his legs swooping this way, then that.\n\nA few feet away, his four teammates -- and the sizable contingent of US fans inside Bercy Arena -- roared as a medal that seemed distant for a program that had finished a distant fifth in each of its last three trips under the rings -- drew closer.\n\nBy the time Nedoroscik neared his dismount, he knew his job was complete. The celebration began before his feet even hit the mat.\n\nAll those years, all those reps, both physical and mental, all the difficult times when he wondered whether to keep going, all the quirks he's developed along the way -- from the non-prescription goggles he sometimes rocks to the chef's kiss to the camera he occasionally makes -- led up to that moment.\n\nAnd he did not miss, delivering \"the exclamation point\" with a 14.866 to finish off a performance the U.S. men's program hopes provides serious momentum heading into the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I kind of in that moment was like, 'All right, let's run it back and let's go out there and do our thing,'\" Nedoroscik said.\n\nA \"thing\" that has long been a sore spot for the U.S. in major international competition. The 2012 Olympic team topped qualifying. Then they led off on pommel horse in the finals and saw their medal hopes vanish one mistake at a time.\n\nNedoroscik understood the history. It's one of the reasons he gravitated toward pommels. Another is the fact that it requires many things -- stamina, strength and creativity chief among them -- that he has in spades, particularly that last one.\n\nHe describes himself as a \"late bloomer\" on the event. Those early struggles only helped him press forward.\n\n\"Running into trouble on the apparatus early on taught me how to fight, how to stay on, how to really go for that routine,\" he said. \"And I think that that has stuck with me throughout.\"\n\nUnlike other events, which are painstakingly laid out and practiced on end for months if not years, pommel horse allows gymnasts to color outside the lines and make things up as they go on. Miss an element here? Well, maybe you can make it up trying something else later in the routine.\n\nHe says the end result is the feeling of \"flying through the air,\" though it's more akin to levitation.\n\nNedoroscik will soar into the event finals Saturday with a chance to put another medal in his carry-on before he heads home.

But while his performance earned plenty of praise online, fans were equally vocal about the glasses-wearing Massachusetts native's resemblance to Clark Kent, Superman's alter ego.\n\nWrote one fan on X: \"Stephen Nedoroscik is like Clark Kent, but when he takes off his glasses, he's Superman on the pommel horse.\"\n\n\"All I'm saying is we've never seen Stephen Nedoroscik and Clark Kent in the same room...\" said another.\n\nEven NBC's official Olympics account got in on the action, calling Nedoroscik \"the Clark Kent of pommel horse\" on X and sharing a side-by-side photo of him and of the late Christopher Reeve playing Kent in one of the Superman films.\n\nAsked about the memes during an interview on the Today show on Tuesday, July 30, Nedoroscik embraced them, saying he's seen them and finds them humorous.\n\n\"I think they're awesome,\" said Nedoroscik. \"You know, representing the people that wear glasses well.\"\n\nHosts Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie then asked whether he has been stopped yet as he \"walks down the streets\" because of the memes.\n\n\"Oh, not quite yet,\" he said -- though Kotb and Guthrie teased it'd be happening soon enough.\n\nNedoroscik wears glasses because he has strabismus, a condition where one eye is turned in a direction that's different from the other. More commonly known as crossed eyes, it can lead to double vision -- though, as Nedoroscik demonstrated in an August 2022 TikTok, he can alternate which eye is the dominant eye.\n\nAsked on Today by Kotb, 59, and Guthrie, 52, about how he was able to carry out his pommel horse routine without the use of his glasses, Nedoroscik admitted he doesn't see.\n\n\"It's not necessarily clear,\" the gymnast said. \"But the thing about pommel horse is if I keep [the glasses] on, they're going to fly somewhere.\"\n\nInstead, Nedoroscik relies on his intuition. \"When I go up on the pommel horse, it's all about feeling the equipment,\" he explained. \"I don't even really see when I'm doing my gymnastics. It's all in the hands. I can feel everything.\"\n\nRelated: Gymnast Stephen Nedoroscik Says Nailing Pommel Horse Routine Ahead of U.S. Bronze Medal Was 'the Greatest Moment of My Life'\n\nRelated: U.S. Men's Gymnastics Team Take Home Bronze, Their First Olympic Medal in 16 Years\n\nFollowing Nedoroscik's display on the pommel horse, which helped the U.S. men's gymnastic team win their first Olympic medal in 16 years, the athelete spoke with reporters about what it felt like to have succeeded in garnering a high score on the apparatus.\n\n\"It was just the greatest moment of my life, I think,\" the athlete told reporters, including PEOPLE, in Paris of acing his routine with a 14.866. \"[I'm] so happy to have been there.\"\n\nThe sportsman said it'd been a \"really long day\" leading up to his moment in the spotlight, but that he completed his breathing exercises to stay calm. He said he heard big cheers for Brody Malone and Paul Juda, who were set to go up before him, and knew that they were setting him up for success.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n\"I kind of, in that moment, was like, 'Alright, let's run it back, then.

He knows exactly what to say to me.\"\n\n\"So when we got that chalk bucket, he kind of just settled me down and said, 'You're ready for this.' I went up there, did my routine and during that dismount, I was just like, already smiling,\" he added.\n\nTo learn more about all the Olympic and Paralympic hopefuls, come to people.com to check out ongoing coverage before, during and after the games.

The pommel horse specialist took his turn with USA sitting in bronze-medal position in the team's final rotation of the competition. He delivered a nearly flawless routine that secured USA's highest score on the apparatus and ensured that the bronze was theirs.\n\nNedoroscik recounted the moment while rewatching his routine with NBC's Mike Tirico alongside his teammates Brody Malone, Asher Hong, Paul Juda and Frederick Richard.\n\nBetween that routine and that interview, Nedoroscik made his imprint as a U.S. hero of the Paris Olympics.\n\nPommel Horse is Stephen Nedoroscik's thing\n\nNedoroscik didn't make Team USA because of his abilities on the vault, the rings, the parallel bar, the high bar or in the floor routine. He was selected because he's one of the best in the world at doing one thing -- perform on the pommel horse.\n\nNedoroscik won two NCAA championships and a silver medal on pommel horse while competing for Penn State. He won a gold medal for Team USA in the event at the 2021 World Championships. His 14.866 score on Tuesday was tied for the second best of the day in the team finals behind Great Britain's Max Whitlock.\n\nIt was the only event in which he competed. He waited through the entire competition for his turn in USA's final rotation. There, he delivered. He'll have a chance to do so again in the pommel horse event final after finishing second in qualifying with a 15.200.\n\nNedoroscik relaxes by solving Rubik's Cubes. Like any Rubik's Cube savant, it's not a matter for Nedoroscik of if he solves it, but how long it takes him to do so. He's very fast.\n\nPrior to Monday's gymnastics final, Nedoroscik posted an image of a Rubik's Cube on Instagram next to a tablet with a time displayed: 9.321 seconds.\n\nAccording to his TikTok bio, Nedoroscik's personal best time at Rubik's Cube is 8.664 seconds. Just in case you were wondering.\n\nNedoroscik has strabismus\n\nNedoroscik became quickly known on Monday not just because of his gymnastics routine -- but because of his distinct look featuring fashionable glasses.\n\nHe revealed a potential reason for those glasses on Tiktok. He has strabismus, which is basically medical terminology for having crossed eyes. He sent a call out for doctors on Tiktok asking for information on the diagnosis and demonstrated his experience of the condition for his followers.\n\nIt's not clear if he received any satisfying responses.\n\nThe strabismus doesn't appear to bother him too much. It certainly didn't hinder him on Monday when he competed without the use of goggles or glasses. But he proudly rocked his glasses on the podium and while celebrating with his teammates.\n\nNedoroscik's selection to Team USA came with criticism\n\nTo a lot of gymnastics observers, Nedoroscik didn't belong on USA's Olympics team.\n\nTo be fair, a one-event specialist in a six-event competition with five-man teams doesn't sound at a glance like the best fit. Nedoroscik has heard the criticism of the decision.\n\n\"I was completely aware of it,\" Nedoroscik told the Washington Post of the criticism. \"I really wanted to make the Olympic team, and I knew that there was going to be backlash to it. I do one event compared to these guys that are phenomenal all-arounders. And I am a phenomenal horse guy. But it's hard to fit on a five-guy team.\"\n\nBut Nedoroscik's strength is a relative weakness of the rest of Team USA. In a competition where Nedoroscik wasn't required to compete on any of his weaker events, the math added up. Nedoroscik's pommel horse score had the potential to raise the U.S. men onto the podium. It was a situation that required his teammates to consistently do their jobs on the other events.\n\nThey all met the moment and have the hardware now to show for it. And on Saturday, Nedoroscik's a favorite to pick up additional hardware in the pommel horse final.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_owens@aol.com", "name": "Jason Owens", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rubik's Cube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Juda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Juda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asher_Hong", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asher Hong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brody_Malone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brody Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_artistic_team_all-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's artistic team all-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strabismus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tirico", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tirico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horizontal bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Artistic_Gymnastics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Artistic Gymnastics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Whitlock", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Whitlock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_at_the_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States at the Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rope_Skipping/Clubs_and_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rope Skipping/Clubs and Teams", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Puzzles/Mechanical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Puzzles/Mechanical", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Rb7Y5VA_YbIUJ3oFKrxGMw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_yahoo_sports_800/e7f1ec49aeb7568c86a54ae0074d4497", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

The US...", "body": "PARIS (AP) - Sam Mikulak pulled Stephen Nedoroscik close and tasked the American pommel horse specialist with the impossible.\n\nThe U.S. men's gymnastics team's first Olympic medal in 16 years a solitary routine away, Mikulak told the pommel horse specialist that he didn't need to go all out. That 80% would be good enough, even though Mikulak knew full well that Nedoroscik never does anything - from his sport to solving a Rubik's Cube - at 80%.\n\n\"You have to trick yourself,\" said Mikulak, a three-time Olympian turned coach. \"You've got to make sure you don't let all the noise get into your head.\"\n\nThat usually isn't a problem for the 25-year-old from Worcester, Massachusetts. It takes a certain type of single-mindedness to make the choices Nedoroscik has made for the last decade, when he essentially decided to dedicate himself to a single pursuit, focusing on an event that has long been a weakness for the U.S. men's national team program.\n\nYes, there is monotony involved. How could there not be?\n\n\"I don\u00b4t know how I don\u00b4t lose my mind,\" Nedoroscik said before the Games. \"But every day I go into the gym and there\u00b4s still something to do. There\u00b4s still something to improve.\"\n\nStephen Nedoroscik, of United States, gets a hug from Paul Juda after last rotation during the men's artistic gymnastics team finals round at Bercy Arena at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Monday, July 29, 2024, in Paris, France. (AP Photo/Abbie Parr)\n\nNot anymore.\n\nHe drilled his set during qualifying on Saturday to earn a spot on the event finals later in the Games. But Monday night, things were different. Teammates Frederick Richard, Brody Malone, Paul Juda and Asher Hong had put together 17 straight routines without a miss, putting the Americans in position to reach the medal stand for the first time since 2008 in Beijing.\n\nWhile Nedoroscik had some wiggle room - the U.S. had a fairly healthy lead after Juda and Malone hit their sets before Nedoroscik saluted the judges - he also didn't want to merely hold on. He wanted to prove a point.\n\nNot just to himself, but to those who wondered if he deserved to be there in the first place.\n\nWhat followed were 45 seconds of sublime brilliance, with Nedoroscik's hands traveling from one end of the horse to the other, his legs swooping this way, then that.\n\nA few feet away, his four teammates - and the sizable contingent of US fans inside Bercy Arena - roared as a medal that seemed distant for a program that had finished a distant fifth in each of its last three trips under the rings - drew closer.\n\nBy the time Nedoroscik neared his dismount, he knew his job was complete. The celebration began before his feet even hit the mat.\n\nAll those years, all those reps, both physical and mental, all the difficult times when he wondered whether to keep going, all the quirks he's developed along the way - from the non-prescription goggles he sometimes rocks to the chef's kiss to the camera he occasionally makes - led up to that moment.\n\nAnd he did not miss, delivering \"the exclamation point\" with a 14.866 to finish off a performance the U.S. men's program hopes provides serious momentum heading into the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I kind of in that moment was like, 'All right, let\u00b4s run it back and let\u00b4s go out there and do our thing,\u00b4\" Nedoroscik said.\n\nA \"thing\" that has long been a sore spot for the U.S. in major international competition. The 2012 Olympic team topped qualifying. Then they led off on pommel horse in the finals and saw their medal hopes vanish one mistake at a time.\n\nNedoroscik understood the history. It's one of the reasons he gravitated toward pommels. Another is the fact that it requires many things - stamina, strength and creativity chief among them - that he has in spades, particularly that last one.\n\nHe describes himself as a \"late bloomer\" on the event. Those early struggles only helped him press forward.\n\n\"Running into trouble on the apparatus early on taught me how to fight, how to stay on, how to really go for that routine,\" he said. \"And I think that that has stuck with me throughout.\"\n\nUnlike other events, which are painstakingly laid out and practiced on end for months if not years, pommel horse allows gymnasts to color outside the lines and make things up as they go on. Miss an element here? Well, maybe you can make it up trying something else later in the routine.\n\nHe says the end result is the feeling of \"flying through the air,\" though it's more akin to levitation.\n\nNedoroscik will soar into the event finals Saturday with a chance to put another medal in his carry-on before he heads home. His 15.200 qualifying score tied Ireland's Rhys McClenaghan for the tops among the eight finalists.\n\nHe is ready to ride the wave as far as it will take him. Yet whatever happens on Saturday or for the rest of his life for that matter, it will be difficult to top Monday night, when the guy with the curly hair and the glasses that made him the kind of social media sensation only the Olympics provides struck a blow for his sport, his teammates and himself.\n\n\"I'm really proud of these guys,\" he said while sitting alongside the group that became U.S. men's gymnastics royalty. \"I love you boys.\"\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nStephen Nedoroscik, of United States, reacts after the pommel horse during the men's artistic gymnastics team finals round at Bercy Arena at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Monday, July 29, 2024, in Paris, France.

U-S-A!\" from flag-waving Americans rang out in Bercy Arena throughout the competition as the men's team hit routine after routine to win the bronze.\n\nHigh scores included a 14.866 for Nedoroscik on the pommel horse and 14.833 for Hong on the vault, and a monster routine for Richard on the high bar.\n\n\"It's so powerful,\" Angie Tyler from Louisville, Kentucky, told CBS News after Richard's performance. \"His release moves are super exciting. He has a lot of combinations that he puts together, as well.\"\n\nThe team ranked fifth after a much rougher qualifying round on Saturday, beating out Ukraine and Great Britian in the finals.\n\n\"We were cheering 'U-S-A,' we were getting a little hoarse in our voice,\" said Philadelphia resident Wally Orlov. \"It's nice to see the boys catching up with the girls again.\"\n\nRichard and Paul will next compete in the all-around final while Nedoroscik -- who has been dubbed \"Clark Kent\" for the thick glasses he wears -- will vie for a medal in the pommel horse final.\n\nGreat Britain came in fourth place and Ukraine took fifth place. Russia, which won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics, is not competing in Paris because of its role in the war against Ukraine.\n\nHarris ramps up campaign as Trump remarks to Christian voters

That 80% would be good enough, even though Mikulak knew full well that Nedoroscik never does anything - from his sport to solving a Rubik's Cube - at 80%.\n\n\"You have to trick yourself,\" said Mikulak, a three-time Olympian turned coach. \"You've got to make sure you don't let all the noise get into your head.\"\n\nThat usually isn't a problem for the 25-year-old from Worcester, Massachusetts. It takes a certain type of single-mindedness to make the choices Nedoroscik has made for the last decade, when he essentially decided to dedicate himself to a single pursuit, focusing on an event that has long been a weakness for the U.S. men's national team program.\n\nYes, there is monotony involved. How could there not be?\n\n\"I don't know how I don't lose my mind,\" Nedoroscik said before the Games. \"But every day I go into the gym and there's still something to do. There's still something to improve.\"\n\nNot anymore.\n\nHe drilled his set during qualifying on Saturday to earn a spot on the event finals later in the Games. But Monday night, things were different. Teammates Frederick Richard, Brody Malone, Paul Juda and Asher Hong had put together 17 straight routines without a miss, putting the Americans in position to reach the medal stand for the first time since 2008 in Beijing.\n\nWhile Nedoroscik had some wiggle room - the U.S. had a fairly healthy lead after Juda and Malone hit their sets before Nedoroscik saluted the judges - he also didn't want to merely hold on. He wanted to prove a point.\n\nNot just to himself, but to those who wondered if he deserved to be there in the first place.\n\nWhat followed were 45 seconds of sublime brilliance, with Nedoroscik's hands traveling from one end of the horse to the other, his legs swooping this way, then that.\n\nA few feet away, his four teammates - and the sizable contingent of US fans inside Bercy Arena - roared as a medal that seemed distant for a program that had finished a distant fifth in each of its last three trips under the rings - drew closer.\n\nBy the time Nedoroscik neared his dismount, he knew his job was complete. The celebration began before his feet even hit the mat.\n\nAll those years, all those reps, both physical and mental, all the difficult times when he wondered whether to keep going, all the quirks he's developed along the way - from the non-prescription goggles he sometimes rocks to the chef's kiss to the camera he occasionally makes - led up to that moment.\n\nAnd he did not miss, delivering \"the exclamation point\" with a 14.866 to finish off a performance the U.S. men's program hopes provides serious momentum heading into the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I kind of in that moment was like, 'All right, let's run it back and let's go out there and do our thing,'\" Nedoroscik said.\n\nA \"thing\" that has long been a sore spot for the U.S. in major international competition. The 2012 Olympic team topped qualifying.\n\nThen they led off on pommel horse in the finals and saw their medal hopes vanish one mistake at a time.\n\nNedoroscik understood the history. It's one of the reasons he gravitated toward pommels. Another is the fact that it requires many things - stamina, strength and creativity chief among them - that he has in spades, particularly that last one.\n\nHe describes himself as a \"late bloomer\" on the event. Those early struggles only helped him press forward.\n\n\"Running into trouble on the apparatus early on taught me how to fight, how to stay on, how to really go for that routine,\" he said. \"And I think that that has stuck with me throughout.\"\n\nUnlike other events, which are painstakingly laid out and practiced on end for months if not years, pommel horse allows gymnasts to color outside the lines and make things up as they go on. Miss an element here? Well, maybe you can make it up trying something else later in the routine.\n\nHe says the end result is the feeling of \"flying through the air,\" though it's more akin to levitation.\n\nNedoroscik will soar into the event finals Saturday with a chance to put another medal in his carry-on before he heads home. His 15.200 qualifying score tied Ireland's Rhys McClenaghan for the tops among the eight finalists.\n\nHe is ready to ride the wave as far as it will take him. Yet whatever happens on Saturday or for the rest of his life for that matter, it will be difficult to top Monday night, when the guy with the curly hair and the glasses that made him the kind of social media sensation only the Olympics provides struck a blow for his sport, his teammates and himself.\n\n\"I'm really proud of these guys,\" he said while sitting alongside the group that became U.S. men's gymnastics royalty. \"I love you boys.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Mikulak", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sam Mikulak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_Bruins_women's_gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UCLA Bruins women's gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rubik's Cube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Worcester, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Worcester, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Juda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Juda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asher_Hong", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asher Hong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brody_Malone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brody Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accor_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accor Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhys_McClenaghan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhys McClenaghan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/30/73d7c96c-6bca-4b93-92f8-85d08fec857c/thumbnail/1200x630/3f5be8ac4d807f06a16c17062e720f92/stephen-nedoroscik.jpg?v=5501038cbc281520ff9fdc308faab7dc", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

NBC flashed a countdown clock to his performance. Then on the final routine of the final rotation, he stepped up for a 38-second performance that helped the team make history.\n\n\"It was a really long day, and I sat in our room and thought about how I get to be the last person [to compete],\" said Nedoroscik, who will compete in the pommel horse final on Saturday. \"And I framed that in my head as a positive -- that I can be the exclamation point.\"\n\nHe was an emphatic punctuation mark on a night full of highlights for the United States. The team hit 18 for 18 routines, including stuck vaults from Paul Juda and Brody Malone. Asher Hong's complicated double-flipping, single-twisting vault anchored the rotation and briefly pushed the United States into first place. Frederick Richard, the reigning world bronze medalist, avenged a lackluster high bar routine in the qualifying rounds by showing off upgraded difficulty and scoring the highest mark on the event during Sunday's competition.\n\nWith the table set for a perfect ending, Nedoroscik knew that he was going to deliver. He said he's never missed a routine if all of his teammates hit before him.\n\n\"I had no doubt in my mind that we could just go out there and just hit a massive set,\" Hong said.\n\nThe 2021 world pommel horse champion has been specializing in his signature event for eight years. Although he grew up practicing all six events, he noticed around high school that he was only progressing on pommel horse, the trickiest event in men's gymnastics that is often compared to the women's balance beam. As a one-routine wonder, Nedoroscik collected junior Olympic national titles in 2015 and 2016. People told him early on that he would be in the Olympics one day.\n\n\"Back then I was just dorky little kid,\" Nedoroscik said during the U.S. Olympic trials, where he hit both of his routines to punch his ticket to Paris. \"And now look at me. I'm a dorky adult going to the Olympics.\"\n\nOn the second day of Olympic trials, the two-time NCAA pommel horse champion from Penn State also had to wait until the final rotation to compete. Just like he would do one month later at Bercy Arena, Nedoroscik delivered the routine he needed.\n\nAlthough Nedoroscik earned his position by delivering four strong performances during the U.S. championships and the Olympic trials to swing the formula used to predict the top team scoring scenarios in his favor, some critics still wondered whether he belonged or whether an event specialist would hurt the team by limiting lineup flexibility.\n\nInstead he helped with the highest U.S. score on any event on Monday.\n\n\"It's like a Cinderella story, fairy tale ending,\" said Sam Mikulak, a three-time Olympian turned coach who trains Nedoroscik. \"I just hope everyone starts believing and gives him the credit that's due -- especially Team USA, for creating the procedures that got him on the team.\"\n\nIn the media mixed zone after the meet, Mikulak hadn't realized that the specialist who once drew side eyes had become the latest American cult hero. It was about time that the shift happened.\n\n\"He deserves to be recognized for his individuality,\" Mikulak said.\n\nNedoroscik's \"nerd credentials,\" as described on X, are nearly unmatched in sports. The night before the team final, he posted on his Instagram story that he solved a Rubik's cube in 9.695 seconds. He said the anxiety he feels when solving a cube is similar to the feeling he gets when working through a pommel horse set.\n\n\"When you're on a really good pace, really good solve, you feel the anxiety, your fingers start slipping,\" Nedoroscik said last month, \"and in a weird way, it kind of helps you stay in the zone as you're doing it.\"\n\nAnd then there's the glasses.\n\nHe broke through with the national team while wearing goggles he received as a joke from a Penn State teammate, and now takes his black rimmed glasses off for competition. He reaches for them immediately after his routine, but he said can see the equipment without them.\n\n\"It's all feeling,\" Nedoroscik said with a chuckle. \"I see with my hands.\"", "source": {"uri":

They edged out Great Britain for the third podium spot, while Japan and China won the gold and silver medals, respectively.\n\nThe U.S. team's celebrations rivaled the rowdiest of college gymnastics meets, with the athletes cheering each other on through every twist and flip.\n\nWhen they earned the bronze, many on the team broke down in tears. While the American women are accustomed to podium finishes, it is only the third team medal in the last 20 years for the U.S. men.\n\nThe bronze was in their grasp after a consummate performance in the first five rotations, but they had to get through the pommel horse first, which is never an easy task. It is comparable to the balance beam on the women's side, which can vanquish even the best in the world.\n\nNedoroscik made the Olympic team based solely on the strength of his routine on the event. He faced an agonizing two-and-a-half hour wait on the sidelines during the final, going up last for the U.S. in the final rotation. His effort clinched the bronze medal.\n\nThey built early momentum with stellar rotations on still rings and vault, making significant improvements to their scores from the qualifying round, where they finished fifth.\n\n\"I was completely blacked out while I was running down the runway,\" Juda said of his flawless vault. \"I hit the table, and I just said, 'Alright, just hold it, just don't fall. Just please don't fall.'\"\n\n\"Next thing I know, the ground's at my feet, and I stuck it at the Olympic Games,\" he said.\n\nAfter competing in two of the six events, the U.S. occupied the top spot on the leaderboard.\n\nChants of \"USA\" erupted in Paris' Bercy Arena after Hong became the third American to sail through parallel bars. He earned a 14.400, putting the U.S. in the second spot as they headed to high bar.\n\nRichard was a star throughout the final for Team USA. He performed a monstrously difficult routine on high bar, sticking his dismount and posting a score that would have won a silver medal last year's world championships.\n\nAs the U.S. anchor on floor, Richard delivered a clutch routine to wrap up the penultimate rotation. One of his skills on floor stems from breakdancing, a sport that is making its Olympic debut in Paris.\n\nHe will compete alongside Juda in the all-around final on Wednesday.

With a medal on the line Monday in Paris, the American gymnast removed his glasses, jumped up on the pommel horse, and secured a bronze medal for Team USA. He put his glasses back on before celebrating.\n\nThat was his only event in the team competition. Nedoroscik did his job. You can call him the Clark Kent of pommel horse.\n\nThe memes started almost instantly with social media users making the super hero comparisons.\n\n\"Obsessed with this guy on the US men's gymnastics team who's only job is pommel horse, so he just sits there until he's activated like a sleeper agent, whips off his glasses like Clark Kent and does a pommel horse routine that helps deliver the team its first medal in 16 years,\" @MegWritesBooks posted to X.\n\n\"While the pressure kept building in the gym, he meditated. A slight smile crept onto his face when he heard the cheers for his teammate's score,\" Whitney Fleming wrote in a viral post on Facebook. \"And then, like Clark Kent turning into Superman, he took off his jacket, removed his glasses, and puffed out his chest-and HE KILLED IT!\"\n\nNedoroscik is a 25-year-old pommel horse specialist from Worcester, Massachusetts. It takes a certain type of single-mindedness to make the choices Nedoroscik has made for the last decade, when he essentially decided to dedicate himself to a single pursuit, focusing on an event that has long been a weakness for the U.S. men's national team program.\n\nThe 2012 Olympic team topped qualifying. Then they led off on pommel horse in the finals and saw their medal hopes vanish one mistake at a time.\n\nNedoroscik understood the history. It's one of the reasons he gravitated toward pommels. Another is the fact that it requires many things -- stamina, strength and creativity chief among them -- that he has in spades, particularly that last one.\n\nHe describes himself as a \"late bloomer\" on the event. Those early struggles only helped him press forward.\n\n\"Running into trouble on the apparatus early on taught me how to fight, how to stay on, how to really go for that routine,\" Nedoroscik said. \"And I think that that has stuck with me throughout.\"\n\nUnlike other events, which are painstakingly laid out and practiced on end for months if not years, pommel horse allows gymnasts to color outside the lines and make things up as they go on. Miss an element here? Well, maybe you can make it up trying something else later in the routine.\n\nHe says the end result is the feeling of \"flying through the air,\" though it's more akin to levitation.\n\nNedoroscik will soar into the event finals Saturday with a chance to put another medal in his carry-on before he heads home. His 15.200 qualifying score tied Ireland's Rhys McClenaghan for the tops among the eight finalists.", "source": {"uri": "wgntv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WGN-TV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Kent_(Smallville)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clark Kent (Smallville)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_artistic_team_all-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's artistic team all-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_Bruins_women's_gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UCLA Bruins women's gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Worcester, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Worcester, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhys_McClenaghan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhys McClenaghan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hilt"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Fairs_and_Expos", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Fairs and Expos", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "wgt": 22}], "image": "https://wgntv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/AP24211717164873.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Nedoroscik was only competing in the pommel horse, which was seen as a weakness for the U.S. squad and the reason he was brought on board, as Nedoroscik was the 2021 world champion on that apparatus.\n\nThe experience isn't over for Nedoroscik, as the Penn State graduate who got his start at the Sterling Academy of Gymnastics advanced to the pommel horse final after both he and Ireland's Rhys McClenaghan notched matching scores of 15.200 in qualifications last Saturday. McClenaghan posted the higher execution score, earning a mark of 8.900 to Nedoroscik's 8.800 to earn the top spot.

The pommel horse specialist nailed it", "body": "Sam Mikulak pulled Stephen Nedoroscik close and tasked the American pommel horse specialist with the impossible.\n\nThe U.S. men's gymnastics team's first Olympic medal in 16 years a solitary routine away, Mikulak told the pommel horse specialist that he didn't need to go all out. That 80% would be good enough, even though Mikulak knew full well that Nedoroscik never does anything -- from his sport to solving a Rubik's Cube -- at 80%.\n\n\"You have to trick yourself,\" said Mikulak, a three-time Olympian turned coach. \"You've got to make sure you don't let all the noise get into your head.\"\n\nThat usually isn't a problem for the 25-year-old from Worcester, Massachusetts. It takes a certain type of single-mindedness to make the choices Nedoroscik has made for the last decade, when he essentially decided to dedicate himself to a single pursuit, focusing on an event that has long been a weakness for the U.S. men's national team program.\n\nYes, there is monotony involved. How could there not be?\n\n\"I don't know how I don't lose my mind,\" Nedoroscik said before the Games. \"But every day I go into the gym and there's still something to do. There's still something to improve.\"\n\nNot anymore.\n\nHe drilled his set during qualifying on Saturday to earn a spot on the event finals later in the Games. But Monday night, things were different. Teammates Frederick Richard, Brody Malone, Paul Juda and Asher Hong had put together 17 straight routines without a miss, putting the Americans in position to reach the medal stand for the first time since 2008 in Beijing.\n\nWhile Nedoroscik had some wiggle room -- the U.S. had a fairly healthy lead after Juda and Malone hit their sets before Nedoroscik saluted the judges -- he also didn't want to merely hold on. He wanted to prove a point.\n\nNot just to himself, but to those who wondered if he deserved to be there in the first place.\n\nWhat followed were 45 seconds of sublime brilliance, with Nedoroscik's hands traveling from one end of the horse to the other, his legs swooping this way, then that.\n\nA few feet away, his four teammates -- and the sizable contingent of U.S. fans inside Bercy Arena -- roared as a medal that seemed distant for a program that had finished a distant fifth in each of its last three trips under the rings -- drew closer.\n\nBy the time Nedoroscik neared his dismount, he knew his job was complete. The celebration began before his feet even hit the mat.\n\nAll those years, all those reps, both physical and mental, all the difficult times when he wondered whether to keep going, all the quirks he's developed along the way -- from the non-prescription goggles he sometimes rocks to the chef's kiss to the camera he occasionally makes -- led up to that moment.\n\nAnd he did not miss, delivering \"the exclamation point\" with a 14.866 to finish off a performance the U.S. men's program hopes provides serious momentum heading into the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I kind of in that moment was like, 'All right, let's run it back and let's go out there and do our thing,'\" Nedoroscik said.\n\nA \"thing\" that has long been a sore spot for the U.S. in major international competition. The 2012 Olympic team topped qualifying. Then they led off on pommel horse in the finals and saw their medal hopes vanish one mistake at a time.\n\nNedoroscik understood the history. It's one of the reasons he gravitated toward pommels. Another is the fact that it requires many things -- stamina, strength and creativity chief among them -- that he has in spades, particularly that last one.\n\nHe describes himself as a \"late bloomer\" on the event. Those early struggles only helped him press forward.\n\n\"Running into trouble on the apparatus early on taught me how to fight, how to stay on, how to really go for that routine,\" he said. \"And I think that that has stuck with me throughout.\"\n\nUnlike other events, which are painstakingly laid out and practiced on end for months if not years, pommel horse allows gymnasts to color outside the lines and make things up as they go on. Miss an element here? Well, maybe you can make it up trying something else later in the routine.\n\nHe says the end result is the feeling of \"flying through the air,\" though it's more akin to levitation.\n\nNedoroscik will soar into the event finals Saturday with a chance to put another medal in his carry-on before he heads home. His 15.200 qualifying score tied Ireland's Rhys McClenaghan for the tops among the eight finalists.\n\nHe is ready to ride the wave as far as it will take him. Yet whatever happens on Saturday or for the rest of his life for that matter, it will be difficult to top Monday night, when the guy with the curly hair and the glasses that made him the kind of social media sensation only the Olympics provides struck a blow for his sport, his teammates and himself. (Scroll down for more social media reactions to Nedoroscik's performance.)\n\n\"I'm really proud of these guys,\" he said while sitting alongside the group that became U.S. men's gymnastics royalty. \"I love you boys.\"\n\nNedoroscik's Olympic prep and performance created instant social media fervor.

Sample tweet: \"Obsessed with this guy on the US men's gymnastics team who's only job is pommel horse, so he just sits there until he's activated like a sleeper agent, whips off his glasses like Clark Kent and does a pommel horse routine that helps deliver the team its first medal in 16 years.\"\n\nSome people wondered if Nedoroscik was napping.\n\n\"I'm doing my breathing exercises,\" Nedoroscik told Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie on July 30. \"We always try to keep our heart rate down and through that five minutes I'm sitting there, I'm just visualizing my routine over and over ... that's all I'm doing in my head.\"\n\nNedoroscik has a good sense of humor about the memes.\n\n\"I think they're awesome,\" he said on TODAY. \"I'm representing people that wear glasses well.\"", "source": {"uri": "today.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TODAY.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Worcester, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Worcester, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeper_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sleeper agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah_Guthrie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Savannah Guthrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_bars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parallel bars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoda_Kotb", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hoda Kotb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kent"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kent"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Dressage", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Dressage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Fairs_and_Expos", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Fairs and Expos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1024x512_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/stephen-nedoroscik-mc-240730-v2-b8adcf.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 1069, "textEnd": 1076, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 2177, "textEnd": 2184}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

They edged out Great Britain for the third podium spot, while Japan and China won the gold and silver medals, respectively.\n\nThe U.S. team's celebrations rivaled the rowdiest of college gymnastics meets, with the athletes cheering each other on through every twist and flip.\n\nWhen they earned the bronze, many on the team broke down in tears. While the American women are accustomed to podium finishes, it is only the third team medal in the last 20 years for the U.S. men.\n\nThe bronze was in their grasp after a consummate performance in the first five rotations, but they had to get through the pommel horse first, which is never an easy task. It is comparable to the balance beam on the women's side, which can vanquish even the best in the world.\n\nNedoroscik made the Olympic team based solely on the strength of his routine on the event. He faced an agonizing two-and-a-half hour wait on the sidelines during the final, going up last for the U.S. in the final rotation. His effort clinched the bronze medal.\n\nThey built early momentum with stellar rotations on still rings and vault, making significant improvements to their scores from the qualifying round, where they finished fifth.\n\n\"I was completely blacked out while I was running down the runway,\" Juda said of his flawless vault. \"I hit the table, and I just said, 'Alright, just hold it, just don't fall. Just please don't fall.'\"\n\n\"Next thing I know, the ground's at my feet, and I stuck it at the Olympic Games,\" he said.\n\nAfter competing in two of the six events, the U.S. occupied the top spot on the leaderboard.\n\nChants of \"USA\" erupted in Paris' Bercy Arena after Hong became the third American to sail through parallel bars. He earned a 14.400, putting the U.S. in the second spot as they headed to high bar.\n\nRichard was a star throughout the final for Team USA. He performed a monstrously difficult routine on high bar, sticking his dismount and posting a score that would have won a silver medal last year's world championships.\n\n\"I knew I had the whole U.S. behind me,\" Richard said. \"I knew I had these five guys cheering me on and I knew I wanted to do the best routine possible for them.

And he nailed it, helping the Americans capture the bronze.\n\nEveryone knows about the excellence of Simone Biles and the U.S. women's gymnastics team. But on Monday, the men's team medaled in the team event for the first time since 2008.\n\nThroughout the first five events of the six-event team final, one of the five gymnasts sat on the sidelines, even at one point putting on his backpack and heading to the gym to re-warm up. That gymnast was Penn State's Stephen Nedoroscik, the Team USA's pommel horse specialist.\n\nPommel horse was the final event for Team USA's rotation, and Nedoroscik would be the final member of Team USA to attempt his only routine. The NBC broadcast even included a timer for the lead-up to Nedoroscik's event.\n\nThe announcers struggled to put into words the pressure Nedoroscik was under as Team USA closed in on its first team medal since 2008. They compared him to Adam Viniatieri heading in to make a 65-yard field goal. Others drew their own comparisons.\n\nNedoroscik hit his routine, to the delight of fans and Team USA, who won the bronze medal.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about Team USA's closer ...\n\nNedoroscik is from Worcester, Mass. The 25-year-old competed at Penn State from 2017-2019, winning two NCAA titles on pommel horse in 2017 and 2018 and finishing as the runner-up in 2019. He went on to win the gold medal on pommel horse at the 2021 World Championships. The 2024 Olympics was his first time making Team USA at the Olympic Games.\n\nOn the sidelines with Team USA, Nedoroscik wore glasses the entire meet. He only took them off when it was his turn to take the pommel horse -- which some fans called a Clark Kent moment.\n\nAt Penn State, Nedoroscik competed in a pair of goggles he received from a friend in a Secret Santa gift swap, but since graduating, he's elected to go without glasses or contacts during competition.\n\nPeople of the internet were quick to fall in love with Nedoroscik's calm demeanor during the earlier events.\n\nNedoroscik was the only men's American gymnast to qualify for an individual event final. He will compete again in the pommel horse on Aug. 3.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gabriela_carroll@inquirer.com", "name": "Gabriela Carroll", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_ICF_Canoe_Slalom_World_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2021 ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Santa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secret Santa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Kent_(Smallville)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clark Kent (Smallville)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Worcester, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Worcester, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Scenario", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Scenario", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/College_and_University", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/College and University", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rope_Skipping/Clubs_and_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rope Skipping/Clubs and Teams", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/L7Td3GGqjMupA0N27UqurUCx00Y=/760x507/smart/filters:format(webp)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/pmn/VF3VUMBP363TZXKHLZI3T4TLRY.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 2190, "textEnd": 2196}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Unfortunately for us Swifties, there was no new news -- just a re-airing of an Olympic promo video that was already posted on Twitter. But what my roommate and I discovered was arguably better than any new Swift announcement.\n\nThe men's artistic gymnastics qualifications were on, and we were locked in: Oohing and ahhing at these gymnasts' otherworldly athletic ability and their enormous muscles, and of course, rooting for the American team which comprises gymnasts Paul Juda, Frederick Richard, Brody Malone, Asher Hong and Stephen Nedoroscik.\n\nAgain, I know virtually nothing about how the scoring of gymnastics works. Everything seems pretty damn impressive to me until the announcer describes a performance as \"disastrous\" and I realize an athlete has made an ill-fated maneuver. I also, again, was oblivious to the skillset of each gymnast. So when Nedoroscik stepped up to the pommel horse, both my roommate and I were incredulous with laughter.\n\nThe camera panned to a nerdy-looking 5'7'' white boy with glasses and enormous arms. To be frank, the entire U.S. men's gymnastics team is a bit disconcerting to look at: They're like a gaggle of juiced-up mathletes. But Nedoroscik is especially dorky.\n\nIt's rare to see any athlete, but especially an Olympic athlete, sport a pair of prescription glasses at a competition, and my roommate and I questioned to each other whether he was about to pommel horse with them on. Our query was answered immediately: Nedoroscik whipped off his frames and ... squinted.\n\n\"He can't even see the pommel horse?!\" I screamed.\n\nTurns out, the 25-year-old from Massachusetts is a pommel horse specialist -- and it's his only duty on the U.S. men's national team. In true Clark Kent fashion, he took off his glasses and turned into a superhuman on that apparatus during Saturday's qualifiers, which earned him a spot in the finals on Monday.\n\nAfter that performance, my roommate and I were smitten. Nothing hotter than an unsuspecting nerdy guy who confidently excels at his craft.\n\nOn Monday, Nedoroscik continued to impress -- as did his teammates, who had put together near-perfect routines, putting the Americans in position to medal for the first time in 14 years. All that was left was Nedoroscik's event: pommel horse.\n\nCameras panned to Nedoroscik who was gearing up for his performance with a quick nap. The image of the guy partly responsible for delivering a medal to the U.S. men's national team since 2008 ostensibly sleeping before a vital routine was ripe for meme potential. Almost instantaneously my Twitter timeline was filled with the snapshot, along with newfound praise for and excitement over Nedoroscik, who demolished on pommel horse and secured a bronze medal for the U.S. team.\n\nThe reaction from Nedoroscik's teammates can only be described as wholesome. It's also probably the most excited a group of Olympians has been over landing third place.\n\nTurns out, I'm not the only one obsessed with this pommel horse champion. After his brilliant performance, the internet has become fixated on Nedoroscik, propelling him into virality with memes and tweets that juxtapose his endearing nerdiness and dominant athletic ability.\n\n\"To truly understand Stephen Nedoroscik's nerd credentials, you need to know that he is in Paris for the Olympics and posting to his insta story about solving a rubik's cube in under 10 seconds,\" author John Green posted along with a screenshot of Nedoroscik's Instagram story.\n\n\"i hope stephen nedoroscik knows that i would die for him,\" another user tweeted with a TikTok video of an enthusiastic Nedoroscik playing with a gymnastic toy.\n\nUnfortunately for me and the other Nedoroscik lover girls, it seems he has a partner, who on X goes by the handle @stephens_gf. Her bio reads \"Ms. Pommel Horse.\"\n\nUsually, I would scoff at a woman who makes her entire identity her boyfriend, but in this case, I understand, girl. I, too, would identify as Ms. Pommel Horse.", "source": {"uri": "insidehook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InsideHook"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_Bruins_women's_gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UCLA Bruins women's gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Juda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Juda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asher_Hong", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asher Hong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brody_Malone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brody Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artistic gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerd", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nerd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Dressage", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Dressage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Fairs_and_Expos", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Fairs and Expos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Stephen-collage3.jpg?resize=1200,800", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

It was a task described as \"impossible\" by Olympic reporter Will Graves.\n\nThe critical moment came during a routine that brought the crowd to its feet in Bercy Arena. Sam Mikulak, former Olympic gymnast turned mentor, had a key moment with Nedoroscik before his routine. He told Nedoroscik that a controlled effort at 80% would suffice, knowing full well that Nedoroscik has a 100% commitment to his sport and problem-solving -- including his Rubik's Cube playing hobby.\n\n\"You have to trick yourself,\" Mikulak, a three-time Olympian turned coach, told AP News. \"You've got to make sure you don't let all the noise get into your head.\"\n\nMikulak's mental coaching kept Nedoroscik composed amidst the monumental pressure of the Olympic stage.\n\nThe U.S. gymnastics team was just a routine away from clinching a medal, following an impressive series of performances from team members Frederick Richard, Brody Malone, Paul Juda, and Asher Hong.\n\nNedoroscik's routine was hailed a masterclass in pommel horse excellence, earning resounding approval from his teammates and the throngs of American supporters present. His final score of 14.866 served as a decisive \"exclamation point\" on the U.S. team's efforts.\n\nMuch anticipation surrounds Nedoroscik as he enters the event finals on Wednesday, carrying the top qualifying score -- a testament to his hard work and innovation in the sport. Whatever the outcome, Monday's performance cements his legacy and inspires both his teammates and fans worldwide with his big heart.\n\n\"I'm really proud of these guys,\" he said while sitting with his gold medal teammates. \"I love you boys.\"", "source": {"uri": "entrepreneur.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entrepreneur"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_james@entrepreneur.com", "name": "David James", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_Bruins_women's_gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UCLA Bruins women's gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Mikulak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Mikulak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rubik's Cube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Juda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Juda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asher_Hong", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asher Hong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brody_Malone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brody Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/1722349537-olympics-GettyImages-2163906960.jpg?format=pjeg&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

When it was his time to perform, he discarded the frames and mounted the pommel horse. Fans were quick to liken the moment to a superhero transformation.\n\n\"I mean, that's an awesome comparison,\" Nedoroscik said in a Today Show Instagram post. \"In a way it is kind of like that.

Snapshots of the gymnast on the sidelines with his eyes closed, head back, and seemingly in a meditative state also went viral.\n\n\"In that moment, I'm doing my breathing exercises,\" he told USA Today. \"We always try to keep our heart rate down and through that five minutes I'm sitting there, I'm just visualizing my routine over and over ... that's all I'm doing in my head.\"\n\nFans have joked about the images, calling him a \"sleeper agent\" and a \"Ken\" whose one \"job is pommel horse.\"\n\nWhile patiently waiting for his turn in the finals, Nedoroscik solved a Rubik's Cube in under 10 seconds, which he proudly displayed on his Instagram story. Olympic watchers, including author John Green, expressed admiration for his \"nerd credentials.\"\n\n\"It's a stress relief, sometimes I make the excuse that it's good for wrist rehab too,\" Nedoroscik told USA Today about his enjoyment of Rubik's Cubes. \"I love to solve it -- it's just fun.\"\n\nA viral tweet with 1.8 million views and 81,000 likes said, \"Absolutely sick that America brought Stephen Nedoroscik, some nerd from Massachusetts, to Paris who's sole purpose in life is to ball out on the pommel horse ...

While Simone Biles is frequently the subject of discussion (and well-earned praise), an athlete from the United States men's team is getting some name recognition of his own after going viral. Stephen Nedoroscik has been dubbed the \"pommel horse hero\" for helping the team win the bronze medal, which was the first medal of U.S. men in gymnastics in sixteen years.\n\nAnd while I'm not nearly enough of a gymnastics expert that I wasn't intrigued by the Law & Order Thursday promotion during NBC's Olympics commercial breaks, I did get a thrill out of watching the pommel horse performance and a kick out of the commentators dropping a Hamilton reference after the men medaled. Count me in for a reaction from prolific songwriter Lin-Manuel Miranda!\n\nThere are always some athletes who go viral during an Olympics cycle for reasons that can extend beyond just their skill in their sport. Whether it was Canadian ice dancers Scott Moir and Tessa Virtue catching Leslie Jones' attention in 2018 or the drug test scandal surrounding Kamila Valieva in 2022, you never know what exactly is going to catch the interest of viewers. After the men's gymnastics finals of 2024, however, people on social media are talking less about the wild opening ceremony and more about Stephen Nedoroscik, the 25-year-old bespectacled member of the team whose only event was pommel horse.\n\nAnd thanks to the event happening well before primetime in the U.S., plenty of people had already seen or streamed Nedoroscik's awe-inspiring pommel horse performance before the NBC broadcast on July 29. There was chatter all over X (formerly known as Twitter) before, during, and after it aired on NBC, and I for one can't get enough of the hype for the \"pommel horse hero\"' of Team USA. Here's just a sampling:\n\nThe event really did play out in a way that was nearly cinematic. Stephen Nedoroscik was the last man to perform on pommel horse for the team event, and all eyes were on him as he took off his glasses and took his place for his one and only Olympics event. And dang it, he nailed it! Take a look, if you missed it:\n\nThe laws of gravity rarely seem to apply during Olympics gymnastics events, and that was certainly the case with the pommel horse and Nedoroscik in Paris this year. But what about the men's team earning a medal resulted in a Hamilton comparison?\n\nIt was clear that Team USA would win the bronze medal almost as soon as Stephen Nedoroscik stuck his landing off the pommel horse, leading to immediate celebration with the teammates as the gymnast put his glasses back on, Clark Kent-style. As soon as it was official that the medal drought was over for the U.S. men's gymnastics team, the commentators were full of praise for all of the men who competed. John Roethlisberger, a former Olympic gymnast himself, said:\n\nI'm going to go ahead and guess that Lin-Manuel Miranda didn't have gymnastics on the brain when he wrote \"My Shot\" - the song that Roethlisberger was quoting - for Hamilton, but I would love to get a reaction from him about the comparison. We don't have to wait to see a reaction from Stephen Nedoroscik, though, as he posted on X:\n\nIt is indeed real life, but I would say that the U.S. men's gymnastics teams had a Cinderella kind of story to earn their bronze medal in Paris this year. Also on the podium were Team Japan in first place for the gold and Team China in second place for the silver. Stephen Nedoroscik deserves a credit for becoming who I'd consider the first athlete to truly go viral courtesy of the 2024 Olympics.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news",

He delivers a bronze.", "body": "PARIS - There's pressure all over this city. It will live here for two weeks during these Olympics, at every venue and inside the thumping hearts of athletes in every medal-deciding moment. It's inescapable, and after more than two hours on the sideline during the men's gymnastics team final, American Stephen Nedoroscik finally had his turn under a career-defining spotlight.\n\nHe's a specialist, here because he excels on a single event: pommel horse, an apparatus so fickle that one misstep can derail an athlete's rhythm and send the routine into disarray. And in the waning moments of Monday's final, Nedoroscik had to deliver for the United States to clinch its first Olympic team medal since 2008. He leaped onto the apparatus and began swinging, floating through each element and maneuvering his hands with precision. The other gymnasts watched with their arms around each other, and as soon as he dismounted, the celebration began.\n\nNedoroscik's teammates lifted him off the ground, and he said, \"Man, that's a memory that's going to live in my head forever.\"\n\nNedoroscik had done more than enough to clinch the bronze medal, with the Americans' score of 257.793 landing them firmly in bronze medal position behind powerhouses Japan and China. In a testament to how much the Americans have progressed since their distant fifth-place finish at the Tokyo Games three years ago, the U.S. men finished less than two points behind Japan, the gold medalist with a 259.594.\n\nThe other top teams had errors; the Americans were the exception. China, the silver medalist, entered the final rotation with a significant lead, but Su Weide fell twice during his high bar routine, sending his team tumbling to second. Meanwhile, the U.S. men hit all 18 routines of the evening, Nedoroscik's key 40-second performance an exclamation point on what his teammates had done throughout the meet. They had struggled through the qualifying round, but when it counted, the U.S. men were at their best.\n\n\"We knew what we were capable of and believed - believed in each other, believed in ourselves and believed that we could have a great day today,\" U.S. high performance director Brett McClure said.\n\nEntering the last rotation, the United States sat in third with nearly a two-point buffer ahead of Ukraine in fourth. The cushion provided some reassurance, but the final three pommel horse sets would dictate whether the United States would leave with a long-awaited Olympic team medal.\n\nPaul Juda, who has been the steadiest member of the team at these Games, began the rotation with a solid set. Brody Malone, the lone returning Olympian on the squad, had a disastrous outing in the qualifying round, falling on pommel horse and struggling on other events. But his rebound performance continued to the final event, and his routine set up Nedoroscik to finish the job.\n\nThroughout the evening, Nedoroscik said, he visualized his routine about 100 times. Late in the competition, he left the arena and practiced briefly in the warmup gym. Then, finally, he saluted the judges and performed. After Nedoroscik landed and placed his glasses back onto his face, he was swarmed by his teammates and coaches. The hugs seemed never-ending. For the Americans, a breakthrough bronze felt as meaningful as a gold.\n\nThe U.S. men won the bronze at last fall's world championships, their first medal in nearly a decade, which sparked optimism that this year they could end the Olympic drought. The absence of Russia, which isn't allowed to have teams compete here because of its invasion of Ukraine, created an opening on the podium.\n\nBut when the United States landed in fifth after the qualifying round - behind Britain and Ukraine in addition to China and Japan - the team's medal hopes seemed bleak. The Americans were more than three points behind third-place Britain, in large part because of Malone's mistakes.\n\nThe United States couldn't lean on simple routines with the hope that clean execution would clinch a medal. The Americans needed to maximize difficulty scores and perform well. One routine after another in the final, they did just that.\n\nThe U.S. men delivered a stellar vault rotation, starting with Juda's perfectly stuck 2\u00bd-twisting vault that led to so much excitement he chass\u00e9d down the podium afterward. When Malone followed with another stuck vault, \"U-S-A\" chants filled the arena. And then Asher Hong capped the lineup with a strong vault, the most difficult one on the team. As they rotated to their third event, the chants began again - louder and for longer this time - and the U.S. gymnasts fist-pumped along in acknowledgment.\n\n\"I think vault 100 percent set the mood,\" said Sam Mikulak, a three-time Olympian who coaches Nedoroscik and Malone. \"From there, it was like, 'Oh, my gosh, this is fun.'\"\n\nNearly every routine was similar to or better than in the team's previous outing, and Malone led that turnaround. After coming off the high bar twice Saturday, he worked through his difficult set this time without any trouble. Just before Malone, Frederick Richard soared through a highflying routine as his teammates leaped in response to each successful release element and again after his excellent stuck dismount. On that apparatus alone, the Americans improved their score by more than two points. And eventually, they headed to pommel horse with a medal on the line.\n\nNedoroscik wasn't new to this type of moment. He earned a spot on the 2022 world championships team, but in the team final, he failed to perform to his potential. When Syque Caesar began coaching Nedoroscik soon after, he wanted to approach Nedoroscik's past mistakes head-on.\n\n\"We had to peel the layers,\" Caesar said, explaining how he worked to pinpoint what exactly went wrong for Nedoroscik in some big moments.\n\nNedoroscik won the gold medal at the world championships in 2021, but there was work to do in developing consistency. Caesar said it took more than a year to figure out what worked best for Nedoroscik, adding mental cues that helped him deal with varying competitive circumstances. Caesar added \"curveballs\" to practice. One example, Caesar explained a few weeks ago, was having Nedoroscik sit for two hours and then hit a routine - a similar scenario to what the 25-year-old faced Monday.\n\n\"He's embraced the pressure and embraced the curveballs,\" Caesar said.\n\nIn the past, if Caesar upped the pressure in practice, Nedoroscik's response would be: \"You don't need to put more pressure on me. I already put pressure on myself.\" But now he doesn't try to minimize the weight of the moment. Did he feel the pressure in the team final? \"Oh, yeah,\" he said. But he knows he can handle it. And here, in the biggest moment of his career, he proved it.", "source": {"uri": "spokesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Spokesman Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He did what he had come to Paris to do.\n\nThe internet also took notice of the gymnast from the state of Massachusetts.\n\nSoon, he was being referred to as Mr Pommel Horse. His girlfriend changed her profile on X, formerly Twitter, to \"Ms Pommel Horse\".\n\nFans also discovered one of his hobbies: solving Rubik's cubes. He finished one in less than 10 seconds the day of the competition.\n\nIn a interview on Tuesday, Mr Nedoroscik told NBC's The Today Show that solving the puzzle is \"stress relief\".\n\n\"I love to solve it - it's just fun,\" he said.\n\nSocial media users compared him to Clark Kent, Superman's alter-ego who wears glasses.\n\nMr Nedoroscik, waiting for his routine, sat on the sidelines in glasses, before taking them off to compete.\n\n\"Obsessed with this guy on the US men's gymnastics team,\" one user wrote in a viral post.\n\n\"He just sits there until he's activated like a sleeper agent, whips off his glasses like Clark Kent and does a pommel horse routine that helps deliver the team its first medal in 16 years.\"\n\nNBC's Olympics X account called him \"the Clark Kent of pommel horse\".\n\nMr Nedoroscik has strabismus, or crossed eyes, which can cause double vision.\n\nIn a 2022 post on TikTok, he showed his followers how his condition allows him to alternate which eye is the dominant eye.\n\nHe told The Today Show he thought the memes about him are \"awesome\" and represent \"the people that wear glasses well\".\n\nHe was asked how he was able to carry out Monday's routine without his glasses, though he has competed in prescription goggles in the past.\n\n\"It's not necessarily clear,\" he said of his vision.\n\n\"But the thing about pommel horse is if I keep [the glasses] on, they're going to fly somewhere.\".\n\nIn the end, he said, it's \"all about feeling the equipment\".\n\n\"I don't even really see when I'm doing my gymnastics. It's all in the hands. I can feel everything.\"\n\nMr Nedoroscik will compete again in the individual event, the men's pommel horse final, on 3 August.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rubik's Cube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Kent_(Smallville)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clark Kent (Smallville)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artistic gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(American_TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Today (American TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strabismus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter_ego", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alter ego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Puzzle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Olympic_broadcasts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC Olympic broadcasts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goggles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goggles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplopia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplopia"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Dressage", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Dressage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Fairs_and_Expos", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Fairs and Expos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/8011772a8ee2050bec9ca76b4479acc5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 2821, "textEnd": 2829}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

It takes a certain type of single-mindedness to make the choices Nedoroscik has made for the last decade, when he essentially decided to dedicate himself to a single pursuit, focusing on an event that has long been a weakness for the U.S. men's national team program.\n\nYes, there is monotony involved. How could there not be?\n\n\"I don't know how I don't lose my mind,\" Nedoroscik said before the Games. \"But every day I go into the gym and there's still something to do. There's still something to improve.\"\n\nNot anymore.\n\nProving a point\n\nHe drilled his set during qualifying on Saturday to earn a spot on the event finals later in the Games. But Monday night, things were different. Teammates Frederick Richard, Brody Malone, Paul Juda and Asher Hong had put together 17 straight routines without a miss, putting the Americans in position to reach the medal stand for the first time since 2008 in Beijing.\n\nWhile Nedoroscik had some wiggle room -- the U.S. had a fairly healthy lead after Juda and Malone hit their sets before Nedoroscik saluted the judges -- he also didn't want to merely hold on. He wanted to prove a point.\n\nNot just to himself, but to those who wondered if he deserved to be there in the first place.\n\nWhat followed were 45 seconds of sublime brilliance, with Nedoroscik's hands traveling from one end of the horse to the other, his legs swooping this way, then that.\n\nA few feet away, his four teammates -- and the sizable contingent of US fans inside Bercy Arena -- roared as a medal that seemed distant for a program that had finished a distant fifth in each of its last three trips under the rings -- drew closer.\n\nBy the time Nedoroscik neared his dismount, he knew his job was complete. The celebration began before his feet even hit the mat.\n\nAll those years, all those reps, both physical and mental, all the difficult times when he wondered whether to keep going, all the quirks he's developed along the way -- from the non-prescription goggles he sometimes rocks to the chef's kiss to the camera he occasionally makes -- led up to that moment.\n\nAnd he did not miss, delivering \"the exclamation point\" with a 14.866 to finish off a performance the U.S. men's program hopes provides serious momentum heading into the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I kind of in that moment was like, 'All right, let's run it back and let's go out there and do our thing,'\" Nedoroscik said.\n\nFilling a critical gap\n\nA \"thing\" that has long been a sore spot for the U.S. in major international competition. The 2012 Olympic team topped qualifying. Then they led off on pommel horse in the finals and saw their medal hopes vanish one mistake at a time.\n\nNedoroscik understood the history. It's one of the reasons he gravitated toward pommels. Another is the fact that it requires many things -- stamina, strength and creativity chief among them -- that he has in spades, particularly that last one.\n\nHe describes himself as a \"late bloomer\" on the event. Those early struggles only helped him press forward.\n\n\"Running into trouble on the apparatus early on taught me how to fight, how to stay on, how to really go for that routine,\" he said. \"And I think that that has stuck with me throughout.\"\n\nUnlike other events, which are painstakingly laid out and practiced on end for months if not years, pommel horse allows gymnasts to color outside the lines and make things up as they go on. Miss an element here? Well, maybe you can make it up trying something else later in the routine.\n\nHe says the end result is the feeling of \"flying through the air,\" though it's more akin to levitation.\n\nMore work to be done\n\nNedoroscik will soar into the event finals Saturday with a chance to put another medal in his carry-on before he heads home. His 15.200 qualifying score tied Ireland's Rhys McClenaghan for the tops among the eight finalists.\n\nHe is ready to ride the wave as far as it will take him. Yet whatever happens on Saturday or for the rest of his life for that matter, it will be difficult to top Monday night, when the guy with the curly hair and the glasses that made him the kind of social media sensation only the Olympics provides struck a blow for his sport, his teammates and himself.\n\n\"I'm really proud of these guys,\" he said while sitting alongside the group that became U.S. men's gymnastics royalty. \"I love you boys.\"\n\nOlympic Games Paris 2024: Scenes from the opening ceremony\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

It's a hobby of his. And that time, for context, is quite impressive. \"Good omen,\" he wrote on Instagram.\n\nIt was indeed.\n\nIn arguably the most pressure-packed situation that one could imagine in men's gymnastics - the last routine of the last rotation of the Olympic final - Nedoroscik delivered in a big way Monday night, putting together a smooth, confident showing on pommel horse that wrapped up the bronze medal for the U.S. men's gymnastics team.\n\nIt was his only event of the night, on the apparatus he's practiced exclusively since the waning days of high school. And when it was over, his teammates hoisted him into the air, and he raised his hands above his head.\n\n\"It was just the greatest moment of my life, I think,\" Nedoroscik said.\n\nGet Olympics updates in your texts! Join USA TODAY Sports' WhatsApp Channel\n\nIt's difficult to describe, in non-gymnastics terms, the sort of proverbial pressure cooker that Nedoroscik stepped into Monday night. It'd be like an NFL kicker sitting on the bench for the entirety of the Super Bowl, then coming out in overtime and draining a 49-yard field goal to win the game.\n\nYet even that analogy might not work. It's not just that the 25-year-old's only event in the team final was dead last, but also that pommel horse is notoriously known as the trickiest event in the sport. And that Team USA had not won a team medal in men's gymnastics at the Olympics since Nedoroscik was 9 years old.\n\nSo, pressure? Oh yeah, he admitted, he felt some pressure.\n\n\"(But) I thought about it before, about how I get to be the last person that goes in the Olympics,\" Nedoroscik said. \"I put that in my head as a positive. Like, I can be the exclamation point.\"\n\nIt was, in many ways, a validating moment for Nedoroscik, a Massachusetts kid who made a big decision all the way back at the tail end of high school. He knew, even eight years ago, that he probably did not have the talent to make it as an all-around gymnast at the collegiate level, let alone at the Olympic level. But in pommel horse, he realized, he might have a chance. He might be able to make it.\n\nThe USA TODAY app brings you every Team USA medal -- right when it happens. Download for full Olympics coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and much more.\n\nSo Nedoroscik went all-in on one thing. He won two NCAA titles at Penn State, then four national championships and even a 2021 world title - all on pommel horse.\n\n\"Somebody like Stephen is a real anomaly,\" his college coach, Randy Jepson, said in an interview earlier this summer. \"You don't get a lot of those guys that stand up and stick out where they're the best in the world (in a single event).\"\n\nBut amid his successes, a narrative also started to form in some corners of the gymnastics world - that Nedoroscik could not hit a routine under pressure. He fell at the 2021 Olympic trials, which prompted the U.S. to instead bring Alec Yoder to Tokyo. And he missed again in the final at the 2022 world championships, where the Americans finished fifth. What was the point of bringing a specialist, the naysayers started to ask, if he couldn't do his singular job?\n\nThe questions continued even through the leadup to these Games, when Nedoroscik locked in his spot on Team USA based on math rather than a selection committee's preference. USA Gymnastics used scores from the national championships and Olympic trials to calculate the best possible teams for Paris - and, in part because other U.S. gymnasts struggled on pommel horse, Nedoroscik was on all of them. They needed his best, even if it meant risking a fall.\n\n\"I think there were a lot of people critical of Stephen being on the team to begin with - some of his history of not hitting the routine during a team event,\" said Syque Caesar, one of his coaches. \"You only need to hit when you need to hit. And yes, he missed at some other competitions, but nothing comes to the Olympics.\"\n\nAfter years of hyping himself up before competition, Nedoroscik said he later came to learn that it was better to calm himself down. He said his goal isn't to win anything, or make finals, or earn a certain score. These days, he focuses only on doing \"a good Russian flop\" - the second skill in his routine.\n\nOn Monday, Caesar said, Nedoroscik didn't warm up with the rest of the team. Instead, when they passed the halfway point of the competition, he went to practice in a back gym with three-time Olympian Sam Mikulak, another one of his coaches. \"It's just one Russian flop,\" Nedoroscik told him.\n\nHe then proceeded to step out onto the podium and record a score of 14.866 that, while three-tenths below his score in qualifying, was plenty good enough to put the U.S. on the podium.\n\n\"It's like a Cinderella story, fairy tale ending,\" Mikulak said. \"I just hope everyone starts believing and gives him the credit that's due - especially Team USA, for creating the procedures that got him on the team.\"\n\nMikulak smiled when told by reporters that Nedoroscik had already been picking up fans on social media for his \"nerdy\" appearance -- he wears glasses and used to compete in goggles.\n\n\"He's this awesome personality. He's a great kid,\" Mikulak said. \"And he deserves to be recognized for his individuality and his character.\"\n\nNedoroscik, for his part, said he's mostly been trying to stay away from the internet in the weeks leading up to Paris - though he was well aware of the people who didn't think he deserved a spot on the Olympic team.\n\n\"I knew that there was going to backlash to it,\" Nedoroscik said. \"I do one event compared to these guys that are all-arounders - phenomenal all-arounders. And I am a phenomenal horse guy, but it's hard to fit on a five-guy team.\n\n\"I think I kind of used that as motivation a little bit. In the gym, I was thinking, 'Let's prove these people wrong. Let's show them I am consistent. Let's show them I can do it for Team USA.' I think I did that tonight.\"", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik",

IS THIS REAL LIFE,\" he wrote with three American flag emojis. The July 29 post has 1.7 million views.\n\nA photo shared by NBC Sports of Nedoroscik leaning back with his eyes closed became a meme online, according to \"The Today Show.\" He spoke to \"Today\" about that on July 30, saying of the memes, \"I think they're awesome. I'm representing people that wear glasses well.\"\n\nHe explained what he was thinking at that moment. \"I'm doing my breathing exercises,\" he told Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie. \"We always try to keep our heart rate down and through that five minutes I'm sitting there, I'm just visualizing my routine over and over . . . that's all I'm doing in my head.\"\n\nNedoroscik also spoke to \"Today\" about his love of Rubik's cubes, saying, \"It's a stress relief, sometimes I make the excuse that it's good for wrist rehab too.

The last time the Americans took home a medal in the event was in Beijing, where they also earned the bronze.\"\n\nNedoroscik was described by USA Gymnastics as \"the pommel horse specialist,\" who was left \"to wrap things up for the U.S.\"\n\nHe \"spent the the high bar and floor rotations off the competition floor in the warm-up gym,\" the site reports. \"As Nedoroscik stepped up to compete, he said he was oblivious to the fact that his routine would decide if his country earned a team medal. He was only aware of the energy exuding from the teammates that went before him.\"\n\n\"I could hear all of them cheerin . . . it sounded like things were going really well,\" said Nedoroscik to USA Gymnastics. \"At that moment, I knew that every guy had hit every single routine.

But he wanted to turn anxiety into excitement.\n\n\"I framed that in my head as a positive . . . I can be the exclamation point,\" Nedoroscik said.\n\nIt turns out he was right.\n\nNedoroscik's pommel horse routine clinched the bronze medal for Team USA on Monday evening at Bercy Arena. His score of 14.866, 6.200 in difficulty and 8.666 in execution, was the highest individual mark by an American gymnast throughout the competition.\n\n\"In the moment I was like, 'Throw this dismount up, your team gets a medal,' \" Nedoroscik said. \"I stuck it and immediately I just couldn't even hold back the smile, like, 'Yes!'\"\n\nUpon landing, the rest of Team USA -- Stoughton native Frederick Richard, Asher Hong, Paul Juda, and Brody Malone -- immediately swarmed Nedoroscik. Before he could put his glasses back on his teammates lifted him into the air.\n\n\"It was a surreal moment,\" Nedoroscik said. \"We were probably going to medal if I nailed my set. My teammates were jumping up and down. I was like, 'I think we did it!' They picked me up and, man, that's a memory that's going to live in my head forever.\"\n\nFor Nedoroscik, the performance capped what he called an \"incredibly long\" day.\n\nWhen Richard, Hong, Juda, and Malone started warming up Monday afternoon, Nedoroscik sat tight. It wasn't until the end of the third rotation that he and coach Sam Mikulak went into the tunnels of Bercy Arena to start getting ready. And it wasn't until two and a half hours after the competition started that he took the stage.\n\nBy that point, Nedoroscik had visualized his routine a hundred times. He admitted that intrusive thoughts occasionally took over, but each time he worried about possible mistakes, he redirected his thoughts: \"No. I'm going to hit this routine.\"\n\nThe men's team had made a collective promise not to check the scores throughout the evening. All of the athletes maintained they hadn't done the math, so they didn't know the exact score Nedoroscik needed to clinch the bronze. Nedoroscik went as far to say that he and Richard would cover their ears and shout, \"La, la, la, la, la,\" each time the public address announcer read out scores.\n\n\"Seriously, it's what we did,\" Nedoroscik said. \"We wanted to stay in our bubble and we wanted to just do our gymnastics. It's no different than any other day.\"\n\nEven if the athletes say they didn't have the exact numbers, there's no denying they had an inclination of what was going on -- and what else could happen. Team USA had yet to commit a major blunder headed into the final rotation, with stuck landings and strong showings across the board.\n\n\"It wasn't a matter of knowing,\" Juda said. \"It was a matter of feeling.\"\n\nWhen it was finally time to compete, Nedoroscik focused on lowering his heart rate. He engaged in breathing exercises and visualized his routine -- with a positive outcome -- once more.\n\n\"There's a huge buildup to that moment,\" Nedoroscik said. \"Walking up to that horse, I heard my teammates say, 'We trust you. We got your back.' I think that's what I needed to hear as I'm stepping up there. It took me to a place from where I was nervous and kind of just brought me back down.\"\n\nFor Nedoroscik, who went on zero recruiting trips coming out of Worcester Technical High School, the magnitude of his performance is not lost on him.\n\nWhen Team USA announced its men's gymnastics roster, some argued Nedoroscik wasn't deserving of a spot because he is limited to one event. Because Nedoroscik can only compete in the pommel horse, the demand on the other four gymnasts increases.\n\n\"I really wanted to make the Olympic team,\" Nedoroscik said. \"I knew that there was going to be backlash to it. I do one event compared to these guys that are all-arounders, phenomenal all-arounders. I'm a phenomenal horse guy, but it's hard to fit on a five-guy team.\n\n\"I think I kind of used that as motivation a little bit. In the gym, I was like, 'Let's prove these people wrong. Let's show them I am consistent. Let's show them I can do it for Team USA.' I think I did that tonight.\"\n\nNedoroscik has emerged as a cult hero, embraced for his specialist background and nerdy appearance. He's tried to stay relatively offline during the Olympics -- and still has to compete in the pommel horse final on Aug. 3 -- so Nedoroscik said he isn't yet aware of his status as an internet sensation.\n\nNedoroscik doesn't expect the significance of Team USA's accomplishment to hit him until later Monday evening, after he's had dinner with his family and girlfriend. But in the moments after Team USA's performance, he couldn't wipe the smile off his face. Neither could his teammates and coaches.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accor_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Accor Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Juda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Juda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asher_Hong", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asher Hong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brody_Malone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brody Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrealism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoughton,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stoughton, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stoughton, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karl Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_address_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public address system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Mikulak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Mikulak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester_Technical_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Worcester Technical High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerd", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nerd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richter magnitude scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cult"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heart rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/0WxjIlRCmr6OGZlTnysQ6NCyYVY=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/3J2B7BZQSOS5WVRPSZIANYP7HA.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 4351, "textEnd": 4357}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

And that's exactly what he did on Monday, propelling the U.S. men's gymnastics team to its first medal in 16 years.\n\nThe bespectacled gymnast became an overnight viral hero after he nailed his part in the team event, securing a breakthrough bronze medal for Team USA.\n\nA self-described \"nerdy pommel horse specialist,\" the Penn State alum was brought on to the team exclusively for his skills in that apparatus. Competing only in the one discipline, however, meant he sat on the sidelines for nearly three hours before his time to shine.\n\nAs he waited, he shut his eyes and appeared to take a nap, as delighted viewers watched on the NBC broadcast. (The reporters over at NBC suspected he was meditating, but the people of the internet much preferred the nap narrative.)\n\nA Rubik's Cube enthusiast, Nedoroscik also posted on Instagram before the competition that he'd finished one in 9.321 seconds, which he said was a \"good omen.\"\n\nWhen it was finally time to hit the equipment, nap time was well and truly over.

He watched as his teammates hit routine after routine, and he warmed up and tried not to think about what he'd understood since he saw the start list: He would decide whether the U.S. earned its first Olympic medal in the men's gymnastics team event in 16 years.\n\nThirty-eight seconds later, as he flung himself off the pommel horse, he let himself think it: Bro, if you hit this dismount, your team wins a medal.\n\n\"And I stuck it!\" he said afterward, the bronze dangling around his neck, a grin stretched across his face.\n\n\"There's gonna be no pressure that matches that,\" said U.S. teammate Asher Hong.\n\nThe gymnasts insisted later that they had abided by the rule they set for themselves not to watch the scoreboard. \"We make jokes about it, when [the PA announces] the place we're in, we're like, 'We don't want to know that information! Stop telling us!'\" said Paul Juda. But they could tell.\n\n\"It wasn't a matter of knowing,\" he said. \"It was a matter of feeling.\"\n\nThey felt good all day, which was a welcome change from a qualifying round that went so poorly that de facto team captain Brody Malone apologized to his teammates afterward. The Americans finished Saturday's qualifiers ranked fifth and seemed to be a world away from top contenders Japan, who would win gold, and China who would take silver. They made only three individual finals: Frederick Richard and Juda in the all-around, and Nedoroscik in the pommel horse. But they reminded themselves that Monday's final \"was the day that mattered,\" Hong said. \"We got 18 routines to hit, and that's our goal.\"\n\nThe same four gymnasts -- Hong, Juda, Malone and Richard -- hit the first 17. Then came Nedoroscik.\n\nBy literal luck of the draw, the Americans would begin on the still rings, which meant they would end on the pommel horse, historically their most challenging event. Its mix of balance and movement has bedeviled generations of gymnasts. But not Nedoroscik, who loves it so much he decided in high school to specialize in it. And he has been so successful -- in 2021 he became the first American to win gold in the event at the world championships -- that the U.S. coaches decided their team should be four all-arounders and one man who can do only one thing.\n\nIt was a risky decision. But this U.S. team does not just tolerate risk. It embraces it. After a decade of frustrating results, the coaches decided heading into Paris to reshape the program, implementing a program that incentivizes athletes to attempt more difficult skills.\n\n\"We took a lot of hits on that, because not a lot of people believed in it,\" said Syque Caesar, the coach who devised the system. \"I even was critical of it, and I helped put it together. But I think tonight proved that it can work.\"\n\nGymnastics scores comprise two elements: an execution score, which starts at 10 and decreases with mistakes, and a difficulty-score, which is open-ended. The Americans had been prioritizing consistency, which led athletes to choose easier routines that they were sure they could stick. This made for clean meets but meant that realistically they never had a shot at the podium, not when their opponents began with such higher potential values. So in 2022, the coaching staff instituted a bonus system that awarded gymnasts extra tenths of a point -- sometimes even more than a point -- in domestic competitions for attempting difficult skills.\n\nIt was a controversial change. Many athletes balked at first. Even high performance director Brett McClure -- the official responsible for implementing the system -- needed the hard sell. \"Very hard,\" he said. \"But if it's what the coaches and athletes want, to have that buffer to make mistakes and still make national teams, still get funding, do all of these things, then I support it, 100%.\"\n\nIt's just math, said Caesar. He likens it to another sport, baseball, that underwent a shift toward analytics two decades ago: \"We Moneyballed the sport,\" he said.\n\nOn Friday, they looked more like the Oakland A's of 2024 than of 2002. But on Monday, they showed up ready to go, charging through the practice area while the other athletes looked on, bemused. Leading off the event, Richard stuck the landing on his rings routine and set off a U-S-A chant in the stands.\n\nThat became a trend as they hit routine after routine. The gymnasts began to feel as if the whole arena was behind them.\n\n\"Instead of trying to prove people wrong,\" Richard says, \"You're proving them right.\"\n\nThe Americans slowly built their advantage, improving their scores from qualifying on each apparatus.\n\n\"Every routine is an opportunity to build momentum,\" Richard had told his teammates.\n\nAs they continued to perform flawlessly, their joy became almost desperate. Hong and Juda may have expended more energy cheering than they did competing. But after Malone -- the 2022 high bar world champion who fell twice on the apparatus in qualifying and missed the event final -- nailed his high bar routine, they huddled and reminded one another not to get too far ahead of themselves.\n\nMeanwhile, Caesar was doing no such thing. He knew exactly where the team stood and exactly what it had to do. The margin over Great Britain and Ukraine was large enough that the U.S. needed only to avoid mistakes.\n\n\"We started crunching the numbers, and we're like, 'Just stay on the horse,'\" Caesar said.\n\nNedoroscik did one better. He all but floated through his routine, reminding himself only to think about the next skill. And then, suddenly, there was no next skill. His teammates grabbed him and tossed him into the air. They draped themselves in the American flag and laughed and cried. Nedoroscik came to Paris for 38 seconds. The celebration will last much longer.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asher_Hong", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asher Hong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brody_Malone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brody Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Juda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Juda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_artistic_team_all-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's artistic team all-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syque_Caesar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Syque Caesar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rings (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_McClure", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brett McClure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horizontal bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3309,h_1861,x_0,y_285/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j40g01dfebaq7qtwcz.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

After the men's gymnastics team's final, Nedoroscik gave them to everyone else.\n\nBrought to Paris to nail one routine and one routine only, the pommel horse specialist delivered in the most dramatic of Olympic fashions. The last man up for the U.S., Nedoroscik had to wait the entirety of the meet -- more than two hours -- before walking up to the pommel horse. As China, the leader after five rotations, fell repeatedly on the horizontal bar, Nedoroscik stepped up to give the U.S. not only a shot at a medal, but perhaps waltz into a silver.\n\nAs he finished his routine with only the slightest of form breaks, Nedoroscik pumped his arms as the crowd erupted in chants of USA, flashing flags around Bercy Arena. As he walked off, his teammates lifted him up as if he'd just won well... a team medal.\n\nTheir arms slung around each other's shoulders, Team USA watched the scoreboard first for Nedoroscik's score -- a 14.866 -- and then waited for the last competitor, China's Zhang Boheng to finish his routine on horizontal bar.\n\nThough Boheng did enough to move China back to silver behind Japan, the U.S. still got what it came for -- its first team medal in 16 years. Their celebration was every bit as jubilant as the gold medalists, and deservedly so.\n\nMake no mistake. Nedoroscik hardly did this on his own. He was merely the exclamation point to finish a story the U.S. has been building for four years. Dismayed after a fifth-place finish in Tokyo, the USA Gymnastics coaches set about intentionally changing their approach. Realizing their routines lacked the difficulty they needed -- they came into Tokyo a solid six points behind from the highest level of the competition -- they made a concerted effort to demand more of their gymnasts.\n\nIt is, of course, one thing to create harder routines; it is another to execute. At the most important meet, Team USA executed. Save a few minor hops and form breaks, the men essentially hit all 18 of their routines. Only one set -- Paul Juda's high bar -- scored below 14 points.\n\nThe U.S. was a model of consistency, building steadily throughout the meet, relying on different gymnasts at every turn. Asher Hong took one hop on his highly difficult vault, helping launch the U.S. from fifth to first in the standings after two rotations; Frederick Richards planted his feet like glue on the last tumbling pass of his floor exercise, to keep them in contention. Juda followed up what he termed the meet of his life in qualifying with an even more solid night here, and Nedoroscik doing what he was here to do.\n\nMaybe no one, however, earned the medal draped around his neck more than Brody Malone. A little more than a year ago, he suffered a catastrophic leg injury. Doctors worried he might not walk, let alone compete and up until the start of the Olympic Trials, he still wore a clunky brace for vault and floor exercise. The lone returning Olympian on this roster, Malone struggled during qualifications, failing to advance to the all-around final or any individual event finals.\n\nWhen it counted, Malone came through. The stoic on a team of fist-bumping, high-fiving hype men, he stepped up for what could be the last routine of his life, on the same pommel horse he started out dismally on Saturday. He calmly and methodically executed his routine, dismounting and showing what is for him, a torrent of emotion. Malone allowed himself a hulk flex before heading to his teammates for bear hugs.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dana_o_neil@nytimes.com", "name": "Dana O'Neil", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Juda", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paul Juda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horizontal bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_artistic_team_all-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's artistic team all-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accor_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accor Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waltz", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Waltz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Boheng", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zhang Boheng"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_U.S._Olympic_trials_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 U.S. Olympic trials (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asher_Hong", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asher Hong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brody_Malone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brody Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_artistic_individual_all-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's artistic individual all-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karl Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rope_Skipping/Clubs_and_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rope Skipping/Clubs and Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/07/29141959/GettyImages-2163887413.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

He began taking the world by storm last year at\n\nthe 2023 World Championships, where he became the youngest American male gymnast to win\n\nan individual medal in an international competition in 13 years.\n\nThe team, consisting of Brody Malone, Asher Hong, Paul Juda, Stephen Nedoroscik, and\n\nRichard, qualified for the finals on Saturday, July 27, 2024 with a few rocky moments that\n\nplaced them in 5th position going into the finals. Then and on Monday, they competed in six\n\ncourses - rings, vault, parallel bars, high bar, floor, and lastly, pommel horse where\n\nNedoroscik's routine solidified their place in Olympic history. Richards received his best score\n\non the high bar with a 14.833. Team USA took to the podium beside Japan (gold) and China\n\n(silver).\n\nRichards goal is to make men's gymnastics more common amongst African Americans. He is\n\nsurely on his way to making the sport popular with his growing Tik Tok account,\n\n@FrederickFlips, which has over 700,000 followers and counting. He and his teammate Juda\n\nwill move on to the 24-athlete all-around (individual) final in 10th and 13th place, respectively.\n\nNedoroscik will move on to the pommel horse final.", "source": {"uri": "jacksonadvocateonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "jacksonadvocateonline.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artistic gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Juda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Juda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asher_Hong", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asher Hong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brody_Malone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brody Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Artistic_Gymnastics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Artistic Gymnastics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horizontal bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoughton,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stoughton, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stoughton, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_bars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parallel bars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://jacksonadvocateonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/l.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 50, "textEnd": 57}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

It's a hobby of his. And that time, for context, is quite impressive. \"Good omen,\" he wrote on Instagram.\n\nIt was indeed.\n\nIn arguably the most pressure-packed situation that one could imagine in men's gymnastics - the last routine of the last rotation of the Olympic final - Nedoroscik delivered in a big way Monday night, putting together a smooth, confident showing on pommel horse that wrapped up the bronze medal for the U.S. men's gymnastics team.\n\nIt was his only event of the night, on the apparatus he's practiced exclusively since the waning days of high school. And when it was over, his teammates hoisted him into the air, and he raised his hands above his head.\n\n\"It was just the greatest moment of my life, I think,\" Nedoroscik said.\n\nGet Olympics updates in your texts! Join USA TODAY Sports' WhatsApp Channel\n\nIt's difficult to describe, in non-gymnastics terms, the sort of proverbial pressure cooker that Nedoroscik stepped into Monday night. It'd be like an NFL kicker sitting on the bench for the entirety of the Super Bowl, then coming out in overtime and draining a 49-yard field goal to win the game.\n\nYet even that analogy might not work. It's not just that the 25-year-old's only event in the team final was dead last, but also that pommel horse is notoriously known as the trickiest event in the sport. And that Team USA had not won a team medal in men's gymnsatics at the Olympics since Nedoroscik was 9 years old.\n\nSo, pressure? Oh yeah, he admitted, he felt some pressure.\n\n\"(But) I thought about it before, about how I get to be the last person that goes in the Olympics,\" Nedoroscik said. \"I put that in my head as a positive. Like, I can be the exclamation point.\"\n\nIt was, in many ways, a validating moment for Nedoroscik, a Massachusetts kid who made a big decision all the way back at the tail end of high school. He knew, even eight years ago, that he probably did not have the talent to make it as an all-around gymnast at the collegiate level, let alone at the Olympic level. But in pommel horse, he realized, he might have a chance. He might be able to make it.\n\nThe USA TODAY app brings you every Team USA medal -- right when it happens. Download for full Olympics coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and much more.\n\nSo Nedoroscik went all-in on one thing. He won two NCAA titles at Penn State, then four national championships and even a 2021 world title - all on pommel horse.\n\n\"Somebody like Stephen is a real anomaly,\" his college coach, Randy Jepson, said in an interview earlier this summer. \"You don't get a lot of those guys that stand up and stick out where they're the best in the world (in a single event).\"\n\nBut amid his successes, a narrative also started to form in some corners of the gymnastics world - that Nedoroscik could not hit a routine under pressure. He fell at the 2021 Olympic trials, which prompted the U.S. to instead bring Alec Yoder to Tokyo. And he missed again in the final at the 2022 world championships, where the Americans finished fifth. What was the point of bringing a specialist, the naysayers started to ask, if he couldn't do his singular job?\n\nThe questions continued even through the leadup to these Games, when Nedoroscik locked in his spot on Team USA simply by his math. USA Gymnastics used scores from the national championships and Olympic trials to calculate the best teams - and, in part because other U.S. gymnasts struggled on pommel horse, Nedoroscik was on all of them. They needed his best, even if it meant risking a fall.\n\n\"I think there were a lot of people critical of Stephen being on the team to begin with - some of his history of not hitting the routine during a team event,\" said Syque Caesar, one of his coaches. \"You only need to hit when you need to hit. And yes, he missed at some other competitions, but nothing comes to the Olympics.\"\n\nAfter years of hyping himself up before competition, Nedoroscik said he later came to learn that it was better to calm himself down. He said his goal isn't to win anything, or make finals, or earn a certain score. These days, he focuses only on doing \"a good Russian flop\" - the second skill in his routine.\n\nOn Monday, Caesar said, Nedoroscik didn't warm up with the rest of the team. Instead, when they passed the halfway point of the competition, he went to practice in a back gym with three-time Olympian Sam Mikulak, another one of his coaches. \"It's just one Russian flop,\" Nedoroscik told him.\n\nHe then proceeded to step out onto the podium and record a score of 14.866 that, while three-tenths below his score in qualifying, was plenty good enough to put the U.S. on the podium.\n\n\"It's like a Cinderella story, fairy tale ending,\" Mikulak said. \"I just hope everyone starts believing and gives him the credit that's due - especially Team USA, for creating the procedures that got him on the team.\"\n\nMikulak smiled when told by reporters that Nedoroscik had already been picking up fans on social media for his \"nerdy\" appearance -- he wears glasses and used to compete in goggles.\n\n\"He's this awesome personality. He's a great kid,\" Mikulak said. \"And he deserves to be recognized for his individuality and his character.\"\n\nNedoroscik, for his part, said he's mostly been trying to stay away from the internet in the weeks leading up to Paris - though he was well aware of the people who didn't think he deserved a spot on the Olympic team.\n\n\"I knew that there was going to backlash to it,\" Nedoroscik said. \"I do one event compared to these guys that are all-arounders - phenomenal all-arounders. And I am a phenomenal horse guy, but it's hard to fit on a five-guy team.\n\n\"I think I kind of used that as motivation a little bit. In the gym, I was thinking, 'Let's prove these people wrong. Let's show them I am consistent. Let's show them I can do it for Team USA.' I think I did that tonight.\"\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on social media @Tom_Schad.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"},

U.S. Gymnast Goes Viral for Pommel Horse", "body": "Kris Jenner Says BF Corey Gamble Taught Her 'Age Is Just a Number'\n\nStephen Nedoroscik became a viral sensation after his incredible performance on pommel horse during the 2024 Olympics. Now, fans want to know more about the United States gymnast.\n\nWhy Was Stephen Nedoroscik a Meme at the 2024 Olympics?\n\nStephen made his Olympics debut during the men's gymnastics team event on July 29, 2024. He competed for the U.S. alongside Asher Hong, Paul Juda, Brody Malone and Frederick Richard. Stephen's placement on the team was a bit controversial, as he only competed in one event - the pommel horse - while his teammates all stepped up on multiple apparatuses.\n\nThe pommel horse was the last event of the day, so Stephen spent several hours waiting around for his teammates to compete. A viral image surfaced of him \"getting in the zone\" while wearing his glasses on the sidelines. Stephen looked completely relaxed with his eyes closed, despite the Olympic competition going on around him.\n\nWhen it was finally Stephen's turn to shine, he took off his glasses and delivered a killer pommel horse routine, which helped secure the United States' place on the podium. He earned a score of 14.866, giving team U.S. a total score of 257.793 and earning them the bronze medal behind Japan, with a score of 259.594, and China, with a score of 259.062.\n\nThe images of Stephen wearing his glasses before taking the floor had social media users comparing him to Clark Kent. On July 30, 2024, he reacted to all of the memes, telling Hoda Kotb, \"I think they're awesome. I'm representing people that wear glasses well.\"\n\nIs Stephen Nedoroscik Cross-Eyed?\n\nStephen previously revealed that he has strabismus, which means he's cross-eyed. In August 2022, he opened up about his condition on TikTok and explained that he's able to control which of his eyes will focus on something, while the other faces inward. At the time, he was asking for assistance in finding a doctor who could help with his condition.\n\nHe used the hashtag \"coloboma\" in his TikTok post. Coloboma is a condition where \"part of the tissue that makes up the eye is missing,\" according to the National Eye Institute.\n\nThe Olympian has to take his glasses off to complete his pommel horse routines and admitted that his eyesight is \"not necessarily clear\" when he's performing. \"The thing about pommel horse is, if I keep them on, they're gonna fly somewhere,\" he said on the Today show in July 2024. \"When I go up on the pommel horse, it's all about feeling the equipment. I don't even really see when I'm doing gymnastics. It's all in the hands. I can feel everything.\"\n\nHow Tall Is Stephen Nedoroscik?\n\nStephen Nedoroscik is 5'4\" tall, according to his profile on the official NBC Olympics page. However, his college profile for Penn State University listed him as 5'5\".\n\nStephen Nedoroscik's Gymnastics Career\n\nStephen was born in 1998 and began his gymnastics career in 2003. When he was younger, he competed on all of the men's gymnastics apparatuses, but when he eventually realized he was only progressing on pommel horse, he decided to specialize in that one event.\n\nThe Massachusetts native attended Penn State University and began competing on their gymnastics team in 2017. He won an NCAA national championship in pommel horse his freshman year and defended his title in 2018. In his junior year, he came in second place at the NCAA championships, and his senior year season was cut short due to COVID. Meanwhile, he had also begun competing at the U.S. National Championships, finishing in seventh place in 2017, ninth place in 2018, second place in 2019 and first place in 2021 and 2022.\n\nIn 2024, Stephen once again won the U.S. National Championship in pommel horse and qualified for the Olympic trials, eventually earning one of the five spots on the team.\n\nCheryl and John were the ones who decided to take Stephen to gymnastics class for the first time after dubbing him \"spider monkey\" due to his energetic climbing of walls and furniture around their home. \"On the first day [at the gym], I climbed a rope all the way to the top,\" the athlete revealed. \"After that, they invited me to join the gymnastics team. We accepted and that was it.\"", "source": {"uri": "lifeandstylemag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Life & Style"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alyssa_norwin@lifeandstylemag.com", "name": "Alyssa Norwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kris Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Juda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Juda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asher_Hong", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asher Hong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brody_Malone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brody Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coloboma", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coloboma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_Bruins_women's_gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UCLA Bruins women's gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strabismus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoda_Kotb", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hoda Kotb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hashtag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(American_TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Today (American TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Gymnastics_National_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Gymnastics National Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Rhythmic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Rhythmic", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Organizations", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Who-Is-Stephen-Nedoroscik-gymnast-goes-viral-for-pommel-horse-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C184px%2C3300px%2C1733px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The 25-year-old's impressive display on the apparatus helped push him and his Team USA teammates Paul Juda, Fred Richard, Brody Malone and Asher Hong to a bronze model, the U.S. men's gymnastic team's first Olympic medal in 16 years.\n\n\"It was just the greatest moment of my life, I think,\" the athlete told reporters in Paris, including PEOPLE, of acing his routine with a 14.866. \"[I'm] so happy to have been there.\"\n\nNedoroscik said it'd been a \"really long day\" leading up to his moment in the spotlight, but that he was excited by the fact that pommel horse was the final apparatus.\n\n\"I framed that in my head as a positive, like I can be the exclamation point,\" he said.\n\nPrior to his event, the Massachusetts native -- who quickly became a fan favorite on social media thanks to his glasses, which some likened to Clark Kent -- said that as he completed his breathing exercises, he was able to hear big cheers for Malone and Juda, and knew that they were setting him for success.\n\n\"I kind of, in that moment, was like, 'Alright, let's run it back, then. Let's go out there and do our thing,' \" he said. \"I have [coach] Sam Mikulak as just like, the greatest coach of all time. He's up there, helping me keep the nerves in check.

I went up there, did my routine and during that dismount, I was just like, already smiling.\"\n\nTeam USA ultimately took home a bronze medal, coming in just 1.801 points behind the gold medal-winning Japan (China placed second for silver).\n\nJordan Gaarenstroom, Juda and Richard's coach at the University of Michigan, told reporters that when it was clear Nedoroscik was nailing the pommel horse, the team realized they had a medal in their future.\n\n\"Once we got to the pommel horse and we started crunching the numbers, we like, stay on the horse and we can do this,\" he said. \"Not only did

But to the internet, he'll always be lovingly remembered as \"Pommel horse guy.\"\n\nNedoroscik, who qualified for the Olympic team solely on the strength of his pommel horse routine, became an internet favorite this week after sitting on the sidelines for nearly three hours during the first five rotations before he anchored the U.S. on his specialty event.\n\nViewers online couldn't get enough of Nedoroscik, posting images of him on the sidelines and then again after he crushed his routine.\n\nSome labeled him \"pommel horse guy.\" Others joked that his job is \"pommel horse\" -- a nod to the \"Barbie\" movie, in which Ken's job is described as \"beach.\" A few described him as Team USA's \"babygirl,\" a term used by fans online to label their favorite men (fictional or real).\n\nMany also compared him to \"Clark Kent,\" the alter ego of Superman, because of his glasses. The official account on X for NBC's Olympic & Paralympic coverage even deemed Nedoroscik, \"the Clark Kent of pommel horse!\"\n\nNedoroscik, a Penn State alum with a degree in electrical engineering, told the \"TODAY\" show that he considers the Clark Kent comments \"an awesome comparison.\"\n\n\"I will definitely take that,\" Nedoroscik said with a laugh. \"In a way it is kind of like that. You know, I'm a goofy guy with the glasses on, but as soon as I take them off I'm locked in. I'm ready to go.\"\n\nIn a video posted to his TikTok account in August 2022, Nedoroscik mentioned that he is cross-eyed and that he can inexplicably switch his dominant eye.\n\nBefore his routine, Nedoroscik removed his glasses. He told \"TODAY\" that if he kept his glasses on, they would fly off mid-routine.\n\n\"I don't even really see when I'm doing my gymnastics,\" he said. \"It's all in the hands. I can feel everything.\"\n\nAuthor and social media personality Hank Green was among the viewers who were captivated by Nedoroscik. He celebrated Nedoroscik's performance on the pommel horse as a win for nerds.\n\n\"People who aren't nerds don't understand how long we've been waiting for an electrical engineer from Pennsylvania POMMEL THE HELL OUT OF A HORSE,\" Green posted to X.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Kent_(Smallville)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clark Kent (Smallville)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter_ego", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alter ego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barbie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Green", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hank Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerd", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nerd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electrical engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/240730-Stephen-Nedoroscik-vl-1133a-8f76b3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The US pommel horse specialist nailed it", "body": "Our mission is to deliver unbiased, fact-based reporting that holds power to account and exposes the truth.\n\nWhether $5 or $50, every contribution counts.\n\nSupport us to deliver journalism without an agenda.\n\nSam Mikulak pulled Stephen Nedoroscik close and tasked the American pommel horse specialist with the impossible.\n\nThe U.S. men's gymnastics team's first Olympic medal in 16 years a solitary routine away, Mikulak told the pommel horse specialist that he didn't need to go all out. That 80% would be good enough, even though Mikulak knew full well that Nedoroscik never does anything -- from his sport to solving a Rubik's Cube -- at 80%.\n\n\"You have to trick yourself,\" said Mikulak, a three-time Olympian turned coach. \"You've got to make sure you don't let all the noise get into your head.\"\n\nThat usually isn't a problem for the 25-year-old from Worcester, Massachusetts. It takes a certain type of single-mindedness to make the choices Nedoroscik has made for the last decade, when he essentially decided to dedicate himself to a single pursuit, focusing on an event that has long been a weakness for the U.S. men's national team program.\n\nYes, there is monotony involved. How could there not be?\n\n\"I don't know how I don't lose my mind,\" Nedoroscik said before the Games. \"But every day I go into the gym and there's still something to do. There's still something to improve.\"\n\nHe drilled his set during qualifying on Saturday to earn a spot on the event finals later in the Games. But Monday night, things were different. Teammates Frederick Richard, Brody Malone, Paul Juda and Asher Hong had put together 17 straight routines without a miss, putting the Americans in position to reach the medal stand for the first time since 2008 in Beijing.\n\nWhile Nedoroscik had some wiggle room -- the U.S. had a fairly healthy lead after Juda and Malone hit their sets before Nedoroscik saluted the judges -- he also didn't want to merely hold on. He wanted to prove a point.\n\nNot just to himself, but to those who wondered if he deserved to be there in the first place.\n\nWhat followed were 45 seconds of sublime brilliance, with Nedoroscik's hands traveling from one end of the horse to the other, his legs swooping this way, then that.\n\nA few feet away, his four teammates -- and the sizable contingent of US fans inside Bercy Arena -- roared as a medal that seemed distant for a program that had finished a distant fifth in each of its last three trips under the rings -- drew closer.\n\nBy the time Nedoroscik neared his dismount, he knew his job was complete. The celebration began before his feet even hit the mat.\n\nAll those years, all those reps, both physical and mental, all the difficult times when he wondered whether to keep going, all the quirks he's developed along the way -- from the non-prescription goggles he sometimes rocks to the chef's kiss to the camera he occasionally makes -- led up to that moment.\n\nAnd he did not miss, delivering \"the exclamation point\" with a 14.866 to finish off a performance the U.S. men's program hopes provides serious momentum heading into the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I kind of in that moment was like, 'All right, let's run it back and let's go out there and do our thing,'\" Nedoroscik said.\n\nFilling a critical gap\n\nA \"thing\" that has long been a sore spot for the U.S. in major international competition. The 2012 Olympic team topped qualifying. Then they led off on pommel horse in the finals and saw their medal hopes vanish one mistake at a time.\n\nNedoroscik understood the history. It's one of the reasons he gravitated toward pommels. Another is the fact that it requires many things -- stamina, strength and creativity chief among them -- that he has in spades, particularly that last one.\n\nHe describes himself as a \"late bloomer\" on the event. Those early struggles only helped him press forward.\n\n\"Running into trouble on the apparatus early on taught me how to fight, how to stay on, how to really go for that routine,\" he said. \"And I think that that has stuck with me throughout.\"\n\nUnlike other events, which are painstakingly laid out and practiced on end for months if not years, pommel horse allows gymnasts to color outside the lines and make things up as they go on.

historic team win, several of America's men's gymnasts will face off in individual events over the coming week.\n\nRichard and Juda are set to compete in the all-around final on Wednesday while Nedoroscik will try and tame the pommel horse on Saturday.", "source": {"uri": "huffpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HuffPost"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kelby_vera@huffpost.com", "name": "Kelby

The U.S. men's squad hadn't medaled in the event since 2008, making Sunday's performance particularly significant.\n\nDuring the interview, hosts Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie addressed the viral moment that has turned Nedoroscik into an online sensation. A photo of the gymnast wearing his glasses moments before competition sparked numerous memes and comparisons to Superman's alter ego, Clark Kent.\n\n\"I think they're awesome,\" Nedoroscik said of the memes, adding with a laugh, \"I'm representing people that wear glasses well.\"\n\nThe 25-year-old Pennsylvania native explained the mental preparation behind his now-famous pose. \"I'm doing my breathing exercises,\" he said. \"We always try to keep our heart rate down and through that five minutes I'm sitting there, I'm just visualizing my routine over and over... that's all I'm doing in my head.\"\n\nNedoroscik, who borrowed Kotb's sunglasses for the interview due to light sensitivity, also shed light on competing without his signature eyewear. \"It's not necessarily clear, but the thing about pommel horse is if I keep them on, they're gonna fly somewhere,\" he explained. \"When I go up on the pommel horse, it's all about feeling the equipment. I don't even really see when I'm doing my gymnastics. It's all in the hands -- I can feel everything.\"\n\nThe gymnast's calm demeanor and distinctive look have resonated with fans online.

Since the waning days of his high-school career, he has competed only on pommel horse - emerging as one of the best athletes in the world on this one apparatus, even at the apparent expense of the other five.\n\nIn arguably the most pressure-packed situation that one could imagine in men's gymnastics - the last routine of the last rotation of the Olympic final - Nedoroscik delivered in a big way Monday night, putting together a smooth, confident showing on pommel horse that wrapped up the bronze medal for the U.S. men's gymnastics team.\n\nIt was his only event of the night, on the apparatus he's practiced exclusively for years. And when it was over, his teammates hoisted him into the air, and he raised his hands above his head.\n\n\"It was just the greatest moment of my life, I think,\" Nedoroscik said.\n\nYou can watch his full routine, which earned him a score of 14.866, below.\n\nBefore his routine, Nedoroscik was shown with his head resting on a wall and his eyes closed, appearing to take a moment to focus. The image became the source of many jokes on social media.\n\nHis pommel horse routine, and the clinching of the bronze medal for USA Gymnastics, also earned Nedoroscik the admiration of many social media users.\n\nContributing: Craig Meyer, USA TODAY Network\n\nGabe Hauari is a national trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

His score put Team USA ahead of Team Great Britain, which came in fourth place, by two points.\n\nThe internet responded, as it usually does, with a string of memes.\n\n\"Obsessed with this guy on the US men's gymnastics team who's only job is pommel horse, so he just sits there until he's activated like a sleeper agent,\" one USA Team fan posted on X.\n\nAnother X user posted the whole routine. \"He's the Clark Kent/Superman of the Olympics, He took off those glasses and brought it home,\" a comment read.\n\nIn gymnastics, the pommel horse is known as one of the toughest apparatuses to master. \"It's really challenging because you're dealing with so many different balance issues, and constant motion,\" Randy Jepson, who coached Nedoroscik at Penn State, told USA Today.\n\nBut Nedoroscik seemed to have a flair for it. In 2014, a coach who had trained the national pommel horse champion the previous year approached him and told him he could be the national champion one day, he told Time magazine.\n\nNedoroscik went a step further. In 2021, he became the first American to win a gold medal on the pommel horse at the World Championships, according to USA gymnastics.\n\nAs the only pommel horse specialist on the US team, it was on him to complete the team finals and secure the bronze medal.\n\n\"Going up to pommel horse, the last guy up in the whole competition, I had a good feeling that our team was in a great spot. I just knew I had to go up there and do my job,\" he told NBC in an interview after the event.\n\nAnd landing the dismount, he said, was the \"best moment of my life.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erin_liam@businessinsider.com", "name": "Erin Liam", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(1978_film_series_character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superman (1978 film series character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeper_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sleeper agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Artistic_Gymnastics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Artistic Gymnastics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Dressage", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Dressage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/66a873f2aab37011780b88e5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

But the way he prepared and then executed threw off some Clark Kent vibes.\n\nThe 25-year-old from Worcester, Mass., is a pommel horse specialist. Nedoroscik does only that routine, and it was the last one -- and many say the trickiest -- of the competition. So he sat on the sidelines for two hours before his moment.\n\nHere's the Superman part: Nedoroscik was first shown during his pre-performance ritual of waiting in the wings with his head back, eyes closed and glasses on. When it was time for him to pommel -- and pommel he did! -- he removed his black-rimmed glasses and swooped in to execute a truly incredible 38-second routine, scoring 14.866. While he celebrated with his teammates, he was handed his glasses and put them back on.\n\nIt was like Clark Kent standing up from his desk at the Daily Planet, removing his glasses to initiate his transformation into a superhero, saving the whole world and then casually sitting back down in his chair.\n\nNBC, which is broadcasting the Olympics, dubbed Nedoroscik \"the Clark Kent of pommel horse!\" on social media. The internet was on fire over Nedoroscik's covert excellence, making him one of the most memed athletes in the Olympics so far.\n\nNedoroscik -- the 2021 world pommel horse champion, who has been specializing in that apparatus for eight years -- responded to the masses in an X post with 1.8M views and counting.\n\nHere's what we know about Nedoroscik's vision: He has a disease that leaves his eyes permanently dilated, according to the Athletic. In the past, he competed while wearing goggles -- given to him as a joke from his teammate at Penn State, where he attended college -- but he retired the look.\n\nAccording to the Olympics website, he said in June there was \"no reason\" behind the change, \"I just haven't really felt like it. He's been going without glasses altogether for \"a while,\" noting: \"Nothing's really intentional.\" Besides, he can see the horse without eyewear.\n\n\"It's not necessarily clear, but the thing about pommel horse is if I keep them on, they're gonna fly somewhere,\" he said during an appearance on the Today show on July 30. \"When I go up on the pommel horse, it's all about feeling the equipment. I don't even really see when I'm doing my gymnastics. It's all in the hands -- I can feel everything.\"\n\nDuring that same interview, alongside teammates Brody Malone and Asher Hong, he swapped eyewear with Hoda Kotb, donning her sunglasses while she wore his Clark Kent-style frames.\n\nHe also spoke about his pre-performance ritual, explaining that he was doing \"breathing exercises.\" It's important to keep his heart rate down, he explained, and in the five minutes before he performed, \"I'm sitting there, I'm just visualizing my routine over and over. ... That's all I'm doing in my head.\"\n\nHe noted that he's delighted by the memes, calling them \"awesome.

But while his performance earned plenty of praise online, fans were equally vocal about the glasses-wearing Massachusetts native's resemblance to Clark Kent, Superman's alter ego.\n\nWrote one fan on X: \"Stephen Nedoroscik is like Clark Kent, but when he takes off his glasses, he's Superman on the pommel horse.\"\n\n\"All I'm saying is we've never seen Stephen Nedoroscik and Clark Kent in the same room...\" said another.\n\nEven NBC's official Olympics account got in on the action, calling Nedoroscik \"the Clark Kent of pommel horse\" on X and sharing a side-by-side photo of him and of the late Christopher Reeve playing Kent in one of the Superman films.\n\nAsked about the memes during an interview on the Today show on Tuesday, July 30, Nedoroscik embraced them, saying he's seen them and finds them humorous.\n\n\"I think they're awesome,\" said Nedoroscik. \"You know, representing the people that wear glasses well.\"\n\nHosts Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie then asked whether he has been stopped yet as he \"walks down the streets\" because of the memes.\n\n\"Oh, not quite yet,\" he said -- though Kotb and Guthrie teased it'd be happening soon enough.\n\nNedoroscik wears glasses because he has strabismus, a condition where one eye is turned in a direction that's different from the other. More commonly known as crossed eyes, it can lead to double vision -- though, as Nedoroscik demonstrated in an August 2022 TikTok, he can alternate which eye is the dominant eye.\n\nAsked on Today by Kotb, 59, and Guthrie, 52, about how he was able to carry out his pommel horse routine without the use of his glasses, Nedoroscik admitted he doesn't see.\n\n\"It's not necessarily clear,\" the gymnast said. \"But the thing about pommel horse is if I keep [the glasses] on, they're going to fly somewhere.\"\n\nInstead, Nedoroscik relies on his intuition. \"When I go up on the pommel horse, it's all about feeling the equipment,\" he explained. \"I don't even really see when I'm doing my gymnastics. It's all in the hands. I can feel everything.\"\n\nFollowing Nedoroscik's display on the pommel horse, which helped the U.S. men's gymnastic team win their first Olympic medal in 16 years, the athelete spoke with reporters about what it felt like to have succeeded in garnering a high score on the apparatus.\n\n\"It was just the greatest moment of my life, I think,\" the athlete told reporters, including PEOPLE, in Paris of acing his routine with a 14.866. \"[I'm] so happy to have been there.\"\n\nThe sportsman said it'd been a \"really long day\" leading up to his moment in the spotlight, but that he completed his breathing exercises to stay calm. He said he heard big cheers for Brody Malone and Paul Juda, who were set to go up before him, and knew that they were setting him up for success.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n\"I kind of, in that moment, was like, 'Alright, let's run it back, then.

He knows exactly what to say to me.\"\n\n\"So when we got that chalk bucket, he kind of just settled me down and said, 'You're ready for this.'

That 80% would be good enough, even though Mikulak knew full well that Nedoroscik never does anything -- from his sport to solving a Rubik's Cube -- at 80%.\n\n\"You have to trick yourself,\" said Mikulak, a three-time Olympian turned coach. \"You've got to make sure you don't let all the noise get into your head.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nValparaiso University to eliminate 30 academic programs Davich: 'Mr. Safety' killed at dangerous bike trail intersection in Region Valpo jewelry store burglarized; holes cut in wall, cops say Mascot Hall of Fame to close in September, 'going out with confetti' Former U.S. Steel South Works site to be transformed into quantum computing park Pierogi Fest grew from one vendor who sold out in an hour to a wall-to-wall crush of starch-seeking revelers, expects record attendance Davich: Frankly, this is the best hot dog joint in the Region UPDATE: Valpo woman identified as deceased in fatal U.S. 20 crash Big Lots closing stores in Chicagoland and Indiana, warns it may close all stores Region police release photo of wanted man Police seek help identifying 2 captured on video following home invasion 24-Hour Pierogi People: Annual Whiting festival elevates the dumpling to an artform Gas prices spike over $4 a gallon in Northwest Indiana after storms cause refinery power outage NWI Business Ins and Outs: Cajun Express, Fuerte Restaurant, Frankie's Philly Steak, The Waxi Taxi, Phenix Salon Suites and Boot Barn opening Man charged with operating bar in LaPorte home\n\nThat usually isn't a problem for the 25-year-old from Worcester, Massachusetts. It takes a certain type of single-mindedness to make the choices Nedoroscik has made for the last decade, when he essentially decided to dedicate himself to a single pursuit, focusing on an event that has long been a weakness for the U.S. men's national team program.\n\nYes, there is monotony involved. How could there not be?\n\n\"I don't know how I don't lose my mind,\" Nedoroscik said before the Games. \"But every day I go into the gym and there's still something to do. There's still something to improve.\"\n\nNot anymore.\n\nProving a point\n\nHe drilled his set during qualifying on Saturday to earn a spot on the event finals later in the Games. But Monday night, things were different. Teammates Frederick Richard, Brody Malone, Paul Juda and Asher Hong had put together 17 straight routines without a miss, putting the Americans in position to reach the medal stand for the first time since 2008 in Beijing.\n\nWhile Nedoroscik had some wiggle room -- the U.S. had a fairly healthy lead after Juda and Malone hit their sets before Nedoroscik saluted the judges -- he also didn't want to merely hold on. He wanted to prove a point.\n\nNot just to himself, but to those who wondered if he deserved to be there in the first place.\n\nWhat followed were 45 seconds of sublime brilliance, with Nedoroscik's hands traveling from one end of the horse to the other, his legs swooping this way, then that.\n\nA few feet away, his four teammates -- and the sizable contingent of US fans inside Bercy Arena -- roared as a medal that seemed distant for a program that had finished a distant fifth in each of its last three trips under the rings -- drew closer.\n\nBy the time Nedoroscik neared his dismount, he knew his job was complete. The celebration began before his feet even hit the mat.\n\nAll those years, all those reps, both physical and mental, all the difficult times when he wondered whether to keep going, all the quirks he's developed along the way -- from the non-prescription goggles he sometimes rocks to the chef's kiss to the camera he occasionally makes -- led up to that moment.\n\nAnd he did not miss, delivering \"the exclamation point\" with a 14.866 to finish off a performance the U.S. men's program hopes provides serious momentum heading into the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I kind of in that moment was like, 'All right, let's run it back and let's go out there and do our thing,'\" Nedoroscik said.\n\nFilling a critical gap\n\nA \"thing\" that has long been a sore spot for the U.S. in major international competition. The 2012 Olympic team topped qualifying. Then they led off on pommel horse in the finals and saw their medal hopes vanish one mistake at a time.\n\nNedoroscik understood the history. It's one of the reasons he gravitated toward pommels. Another is the fact that it requires many things -- stamina, strength and creativity chief among them -- that he has in spades, particularly that last one.\n\nHe describes himself as a \"late bloomer\" on the event. Those early struggles only helped him press forward.\n\n\"Running into trouble on the apparatus early on taught me how to fight, how to stay on, how to really go for that routine,\" he said. \"And I think that that has stuck with me throughout.\"\n\nUnlike other events, which are painstakingly laid out and practiced on end for months if not years, pommel horse allows gymnasts to color outside the lines and make things up as they go on. Miss an element here? Well, maybe you can make it up trying something else later in the routine.\n\nHe says the end result is the feeling of \"flying through the air,\" though it's more akin to levitation.\n\nMore work to be done\n\nNedoroscik will soar into the event finals Saturday with a chance to put another medal in his carry-on before he heads home. His 15.200 qualifying score tied Ireland's Rhys McClenaghan for the tops among the eight finalists.\n\nHe is ready to ride the wave as far as it will take him. Yet whatever happens on Saturday or for the rest of his life for that matter, it will be difficult to top Monday night, when the guy with the curly hair and the glasses that made him the kind of social media sensation only the Olympics provides struck a blow for his sport, his teammates and himself.\n\n\"I'm really proud of these guys,\" he said while sitting alongside the group that became U.S. men's gymnastics royalty. \"I love you boys.\"\n\nOlympic Games Paris 2024: Scenes from the opening ceremony\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Credit - Jamie Squire-Getty Images)\n\nThe U.S. men's gymnastics team had high hopes for the Paris Olympics. After finishing fifth in the team event at the last three Olympic Games, it was time for a change. This time the team had its sights set on a medal -- something they hadn't achieved since the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.\n\nOn July 29, the U.S. men's team of Asher Hong, Paul Juda, Brody Malone, Stephen Nedoroscik, and Frederick Richard got it done and earned bronze behind Japan and China.\n\n\"We ended the medal drought that was 16 years in the making and I couldn't be happier for everybody,\" said Paul Juda, a University of Michigan gymnast.\n\nGetting to the podium wasn't just a matter of hitting every routine. The work began after the Tokyo Games, with some very deliberate strategizing. Under the current scoring system, athletes don't start with the same score, such as a 10.0, but instead have varying start values, depending on the difficulty of the elements they perform in their routines. Those scores are added to a score that encapsulates how well they perform those skills for the total score. So the more difficult the routines are, the more likely gymnasts are to earn higher scores overall.\n\nRead More: 'There's Actually Something Wrong.' Jade Carey Explains Why She Fell During Her Floor Routine\n\nUSA Gymnastics men's high-performance director Brett McClure knew that the U.S.'s difficulty scores, or start values, put them out of medal contention before they even hit the mats. No amount of perfect performances could change that. So he and his team focused heavily on incorporating more challenging skills in the gymnasts' routines.\n\nAt the U.S. Olympic trials in June to determine the team for Paris, McClure rattled off the average difficulty of each of the top teams and calculated what the U.S. would need to make the podium -- namely, outscoring squads such as Great Britain and Ukraine that have consistently surpassed the U.S. at recent world and Olympic events. In Tokyo, McClure said, the U.S. lagged about six points behind the bronze-medal finishers in difficulty scores, but by last year's world championships, that gap had narrowed to about two points -- easily bridged with stronger execution scores. \"Japan's difficulty right now is around 110, and China 108. Our difficulty scores are about 106 and Ukraine is 104 and Great Britain around 102. So we're great considering where we were in Tokyo, when we were already six points behind. We're in a much different position now.\"\n\nIndeed they were. Shaky performances during the qualification round in Paris, however, put the U.S. men back in their familiar position -- fifth -- coming into the team event. But in the team competition, qualification scores are scratched and scoring starts anew.\n\n\"You take it, you seize the moment,\" said Richard, Juda's teammate at Michigan. \"After day one [qualification], I was the one who was saying, 'It's all part of the process, trust in the end goal.' You don't have to win every single competition; you have to win the ones that matter. I knew that the day-one goal was to qualify and get the nerves out. Going into day two, we needed to capitalize on all the hard work we've done and it showed. We didn't wait to become the medalists. We decided we were going to do it. And every routine, we gave everything.\"\n\nThat included Nedoroscik, who was controversially the only specialist on the team, selected for his high scoring ability on pommel horse. He competed only on pommel horse, and none of the other five events, and the competition order put the U.S. on pommel horse in the last of six rotations, with Nedoroscik the last U.S. gymnast to compete, meaning he waited two and a half hours before he was called up. When he was, he electrified the crowd with his impressive and smooth swings and helped the U.S. clinch the bronze. But until then, his meditating and visualization techniques inspired the internet, turning him into a social media sensation as everyone speculated about how he managed to make the trip to Paris to perform on one event and one event only, and how he was occupying himself while waiting his turn.\n\nRead More: All About Jordan Chiles' Beyonce-Inspired Routine\n\nRichard had not only his family from Stoughton, Mass. in Bercy Arena, but his first coach Tom Fontecchio, who saw potential in young Richard when he followed his older sister to Fontecchio's gym in Massachusetts. The two remained close even after Richard left for college, and Fontecchio still watches every one of his former student's meets and regularly texts him with words of encouragement. \"He did a fantastic job,\" Fontecchio told TIME. \"In junior high, he had a goal listed in superlatives, and his superlative was, 'I want to be an Olympian.' He already knew that was going to be his goal and he just kept going with it.\"\n\nThe U.S. got off to a strong start on the rings, with Richard, the current world all-around bronze medalist, breaking the ice with a solid routine that set the stage for Malone, the national champion, and Hong, six-time NCAA champion who, along with Richard, was part of the U.S. bronze-medal-winning team at world championships in 2023.\n\nDuring Olympic trials, McClure's priority was to find the combination of athletes whose scores, when combined, would give the U.S. the highest number of starting value points when the team competed in Paris. \"The plan worked,\" Jordan Gaarenstroom, one of Juda's and Richard's coaches at Michigan, told TIME. \"It worked exactly how it should have worked. It was great to watch it.\"\n\nUnder the Olympic format, three athletes compete on six apparatus and all three scores count (unlike during the qualification, in which four gymnasts compete on each event and the top three scores are used). Richard competed in five of the six events, as did Malone. Malone was more consistent than he was during the qualification round, in which he made mistakes on the high bar, floor, and pommel horse.\n\n\"It's about having a short memory and putting it behind me,\" Malone said. \"Once it's done and over with, it's done and over with. I just had to reset my mind and get ready for the next competition, and that's what I did.\"\n\n\"Every single routine just kept getting better and better,\" McClure said of the 18 solid performances the gymnasts executed. Juda said the team agreed ahead of time not to look at the scoreboard, which kept track of where they stood after each rotation. Whenever the placements were announced in the arena, \"We joked, 'We don't want to know what place we are - stop telling us,'\" he said. \"It wasn't a matter of knowing, but a matter of feeling [that we would earn a medal].\"\n\nPreparing the men included ensuring that they conserved their strength and energy for the multiple days of performance ahead. For Richard, who was expecting to compete in the all-around event, that meant building up gradually, especially in the high-bar event, one of his strengths. His routine in qualification was less difficult than the one he performed in the team competition. \"This is a marathon, from two weeks ago when we got [to France], to training camp and then you come to Paris,\" said Gaarenstroom. \"And every day they are reminded they are Olympians. So it's high and low and high and low -- you've got to keep their energy in check so you just make small changes to give them a little less pressure.\"\n\nBut Richard's score in the qualification round, which determines who competes in the event finals, wasn't high enough to qualify him for the high-bar final, after judges scored his routine lower than he and his coaches expected. \"I knew this would be my high-bar final,\" he said of the team event. \"It's the routine I train every single day in the gym, and I'm one of the best high-bar gymnasts in the world, so I wanted to show that today, to my brothers and to my country, and that's what I did.\"\n\nRichard and Juda will be competing in the all-around competition on July 31. Juda jokes that Richard is always looking ahead and striving for more, saying there is always something \"cooler\" to be experienced, or accomplished. That will certainly be the case in Paris now that the team medal is around their necks. And it's clear where that ambition comes from. When TIME asked Richard's father Carl what he would say to his son, now an Olympic medalist, he said, \"We love you and you're the best. And you have one more achievement [left] here; bring another medal.\" An Olympian's job, it seems, is never done.\n\nThe gymnasts hope that the medal will reignite interest in men's gymnastics in the U.S., at a time when many colleges are shutting down their programs and limiting funding for the sport. \"Every single one of us came from an NCAA program,\" Juda said. \"If you want to keep seeing USA Gymnastics on the podium on the men's side, you have to give us more opportunities to compete in college.\"\n\nMcClure, for his part, is already looking ahead to 2028, when the Olympics will be held in Los Angeles. \"We are trending in the right direction,\" he said. \"Obviously Japan and China are still in another category. But if we want to get better and push for first place in L.A., then this [bronze] is going to be extremely motivating.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo

That was the plan. It wasn't take-no-prisoners; it was take-no-risks. Brett McClure, the high-performance director, harbored no delusions that they might beat Japan and China, historic programs and rivals that finished 1-2 in an epic photo finish. The U.S.' conservative approach enabled the team to finish only a point and a half out of second and two ahead of Great Britain.\n\nFor instance: Before clinching bronze with a score nearly .4 less than the 15.200 he posted in qualifying, Nedoroscik, a pommel horse specialist who sat around two hours waiting for something to do, got his marching orders from his coach.\n\n\"Eighty percent,\" Sam Mikulak told him, \"is all you need.\"\n\nNot what you'd read on Alabama's locker room wall, but, hey, it worked. He knew it's not good to get Nedoroscik too geeked. He's geeky enough as it is, which you'd know if you'd seen him in his black horn-rimmed glasses underneath the pile of backpacks he schlepped around for teammates at qualifying. His peers are built like fire hydrants. Nedoroscik looks like he should haunt a chemistry lab, not swing gracefully around and over a pommel horse. If they make this story into a movie, Michael Cera is a lock for the part.\n\nThe point is, Nedoroscik had one job to do, and if he wasn't exactly magnificent at it Monday, he was plenty good enough. Same with Malone. The squad's only two-time Olympian, a medal hopeful, he'd been a flop in qualifying. Literally. Fell four times across three apparatuses.\n\nLike Nedoroscik, he didn't put on a show Monday, but he didn't wobble once. In qualifying, the '22 world champ on the high bar needed three starts on the apparatus, ending up with just 10 points. When his score Sunday came up 14.166, his coaches protested, but their hearts weren't in it. They were just happy he didn't end up face-first on his finely chiseled chin.\n\nIn fact, the U.S. went 18 for 18 on six apparatuses, meaning no one slipped, fell or landed on his derriere. Might not sound like much to you, but Japan couldn't say that. Neither could China, whose Su Weide fell twice from the high bar in the final rotation, costing China two points and effectively the gold.\n\nJuda would be hard-pressed to make the starting lineups of either of the gold or silver medalists, but he set the tone for the U.S. on all four apparatuses he competed on Monday. Stuck the landing and turned it over to the next guy.\n\nWhen he volunteered to go first on the pommel horse in the final rotation, Hong could tell Juda's nerves were frayed. They were this close to a medal. They knew it, even if they refused to look at the scores. Stayed in their \"bubble,\" as they called it. But they had an idea the bronze was in hand after going 15 for 15.\n\nWhen Juda raised his hand and tentatively said he'd go first one more time, Hong moved in.\n\n\"Paul, you're the man for the job,\" he said.\n\n\"You earned this moment.\"\n\nThe sense of belief was all Juda needed to hear.\n\n\"I went up there,\" he said, \"and I was light as a feather.\"\n\nFunny thing is, Hong believes he just as easily could have handled the horse in the Olympics. It's his weakest, which is why Nedoroscik took his place, denying Hong an opportunity to compete for the all-around Thursday. But he's getting better on the horse. He was a half-point better on the bars Monday than he'd been in qualifying, and his 14.533 on the rings led the Americans, as did his spectacular 14.833 on the vault.\n\nGoing into the second rotation, the U.S. was in fifth place overall. Once Hong, a 5-foot-1 blur, landed his twisting, double-back somersault in the vault, the U.S. was in first.\n\n\"That,\" Mikulak said, \"was when then momentum was heating up, and that's Asher's M.O. He's gonna rise to the occasion. There's no way he's missing this. This is, like, his moment.\n\n\"This is what he's been dreaming of, and he finally got it.\"\n\nWhen not giving the team a shot of adrenaline on an apparatus, Hong is its head cheerleader. He and Richard, both still just 20, represent the high-wire future of the men's team. At one point it was hard to tell who'd expended more energy: Richard, a crowd-pleaser who added a gadget to his high bar routine, improving his qualifying score by .7; or Hong, who did everything but climb up on the bar with him.\n\nWeren't you afraid of wearing yourself out?\n\n\"Oh, no,\" Hong said, smiling. \"Hyping everybody gets me more hyped, too.\"\n\nOnce Nedoroscik landed, the rest of the U.S. team members let out everything they'd held in reserve all day. Next thing you knew, the closer, who called it \"the greatest moment of my life,\" was crowd-surfing his teammates. Malone, whose face is a mask in competition, looked like a kid at Christmas. They had a right to party. The men's team had waited 16 long years for this, since Richard and Hong were only 4 years old. The boys are all grown up.\n\n\u00a92024 The Dallas Morning News.

But they became tangible at Stanford, Michigan and Penn State.\n\nSo when it was time for those dreams to become fully, vividly realized inside a raucous Bercy Arena on Monday night, they leaned on the experiences they gained during all those meets in all those sometimes sparsely filled gyms that taught them about pressure and teamwork and belief.\n\nYes, the bronze medal the Americans so emphatically earned ended a 16-year drought on the sport's biggest stage.\n\nYet it was also a message to athletic directors at the dozen schools that still have Division I gymnastics - and to be honest, to the ones that don't, too - that the sport is worth saving.\n\n\"If you want to keep seeing USA Gymnastics and Team USA on a gymnastics podium, at least on the men\u00b4s side, you\u00b4re going to have to give us more opportunities to compete in college,\" said Juda, who is in graduate school at Michigan.\n\nTeam USA from left to right Brody Malone, Asher Hong, Fred Richard, Paul Juda and Stephen Nedoroscik, of United States, celebrate their bronze medal during the men's artistic gymnastics team finals round at Bercy Arena at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Monday, July 29, 2024, in Paris, France. (AP Photo/Abbie Parr)\n\nOpportunities that are in danger of vanishing quickly thanks to a rapidly evolving college sports landscape. It's a reality the five men who stood on the podium with their arms around each other are only too aware of.\n\nRichard, a rising junior at Michigan, has made it his life's mission to bring more people to a side of the sport that - at least in the U.S. anyway - has long plugged along anonymously.\n\nAnd while he's carved out a rapidly expanding niche on social media, Richard is savvy enough to understand the one thing guaranteed to attract people to men's gymnastics isn't a viral video, but hardware like the medal he kept grabbing in the giddy aftermath.\n\n\"My goal even here was to make a statement that the U.S. is getting stronger and stronger and we're only (going up),\" Richard said. \"And I think we did that today. I think a lot of young boys watching are inspired by us.\"\n\nThat's the way it was for Richard as a kid in the Boston suburbs. There were pictures on the wall at the gym of the medal-winning 2004 and 2008 U.S. men's Olympic teams. Richard would stare at the pictures and wonder how those teams put all the pieces together.\n\n\"It looks like they all came together on the same day and just did like these perfect routines,\" Richard said. \"And you\u00b4re like, how is that possible?\"\n\nRichard found out firsthand.\n\nThe Americans didn't record a major fall during any of their 18 routines in the final and finished closer to second-place China than fourth-place Britain. They leaned into the energy from a vocal contingent of U.S. fans that offered a hint of what it might look like in Los Angeles four years from now.\n\nMostly, however, they leaned on each other and their experiences to shake off an iffy qualifying session on Saturday in which they finished a sloppy fifth.\n\n\"We just told each other we were gonna treat it like an NCAA championships because we\u00b4ve all been there,\" Malone said. \"And it\u00b4s high pressure competing for a team. And it\u00b4s no different this competition. I mean yeah, this one\u00b4s a little bit different, a little bit bigger. But same concept.\"\n\nWith perhaps a much more impactful result.\n\nNedoroscik is 26. Malone is 24. Juda is 23. Hong and Richard are 20. There is a feeling of real momentum within the U.S. men's program for the first time in a while. Yet to keep it going, the pipeline behind them needs to keep churning.\n\nThere was a sense in the 2010s that the U.S. had grown stale in part because those at the core group at the top grew a little too comfortable due in part to a lack of competition from those trying to catch them.\n\nSam Mikulak went to three Olympics with teams that had considerable talent. He never came home with a medal, though on Monday night he was chatting with Nedoroscik as he prepared for his pommel horse set that served as the exclamation point.\n\nWhile they talked, Mikulak told Nedoroscik to stay calm, that 80 percent of his best would be good enough. To soak in a moment Mikulak dreamed of but never quite grasped.\n\nAnd when Nedoroscik gracefully swooped from one end of the horse to the other, his hands working dutifully in tandem on an event that has given the Americans fits for years, the bronze that felt in some ways like gold was won.\n\nStanding there in the aftermath, Mikulak couldn't help but speculate about what might lie ahead.\n\n\"I think the guys are going to be hungry for more,\" he said. \"And hopefully this spurs men\u00b4s gymnastics in the US like never before.\"\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nTeam USA from left to right Brody Malone, Asher Hong, Fred Richard, and Stephen Nedoroscik, of United States, celebrates bronze medal during the men's artistic gymnastics team finals round at Bercy Arena at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Monday, July 29, 2024, in Paris, France.

That 80% would be good enough, even though Mikulak knew full well that Nedoroscik never does anything -- from his sport to solving a Rubik's Cube -- at 80%.\n\n\"You have to trick yourself,\" said Mikulak, a three-time Olympian turned coach. \"You've got to make sure you don't let all the noise get into your head.\"\n\nWho's Donald Trump's pick for Missouri governor?

Is trade only 1? Woman from Valley Park drowns in Big River trying to help another canoeist\n\nThat usually isn't a problem for the 25-year-old from Worcester, Massachusetts. It takes a certain type of single-mindedness to make the choices Nedoroscik has made for the last decade, when he essentially decided to dedicate himself to a single pursuit, focusing on an event that has long been a weakness for the U.S. men's national team program.\n\nYes, there is monotony involved. How could there not be?\n\n\"I don't know how I don't lose my mind,\" Nedoroscik said before the Games. \"But every day I go into the gym and there's still something to do. There's still something to improve.\"\n\nNot anymore.\n\nProving a point\n\nHe drilled his set during qualifying on Saturday to earn a spot on the event finals later in the Games. But Monday night, things were different. Teammates Frederick Richard, Brody Malone, Paul Juda and Asher Hong had put together 17 straight routines without a miss, putting the Americans in position to reach the medal stand for the first time since 2008 in Beijing.\n\nWhile Nedoroscik had some wiggle room -- the U.S. had a fairly healthy lead after Juda and Malone hit their sets before Nedoroscik saluted the judges -- he also didn't want to merely hold on. He wanted to prove a point.\n\nNot just to himself, but to those who wondered if he deserved to be there in the first place.\n\nWhat followed were 45 seconds of sublime brilliance, with Nedoroscik's hands traveling from one end of the horse to the other, his legs swooping this way, then that.\n\nA few feet away, his four teammates -- and the sizable contingent of US fans inside Bercy Arena -- roared as a medal that seemed distant for a program that had finished a distant fifth in each of its last three trips under the rings -- drew closer.\n\nBy the time Nedoroscik neared his dismount, he knew his job was complete. The celebration began before his feet even hit the mat.\n\nAll those years, all those reps, both physical and mental, all the difficult times when he wondered whether to keep going, all the quirks he's developed along the way -- from the non-prescription goggles he sometimes rocks to the chef's kiss to the camera he occasionally makes -- led up to that moment.\n\nAnd he did not miss, delivering \"the exclamation point\" with a 14.866 to finish off a performance the U.S. men's program hopes provides serious momentum heading into the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I kind of in that moment was like, 'All right, let's run it back and let's go out there and do our thing,'\" Nedoroscik said.\n\nFilling a critical gap\n\nA \"thing\" that has long been a sore spot for the U.S. in major international competition. The 2012 Olympic team topped qualifying. Then they led off on pommel horse in the finals and saw their medal hopes vanish one mistake at a time.\n\nNedoroscik understood the history. It's one of the reasons he gravitated toward pommels. Another is the fact that it requires many things -- stamina, strength and creativity chief among them -- that he has in spades, particularly that last one.\n\nHe describes himself as a \"late bloomer\" on the event. Those early struggles only helped him press forward.\n\n\"Running into trouble on the apparatus early on taught me how to fight, how to stay on, how to really go for that routine,\" he said. \"And I think that that has stuck with me throughout.\"\n\nUnlike other events, which are painstakingly laid out and practiced on end for months if not years, pommel horse allows gymnasts to color outside the lines and make things up as they go on. Miss an element here? Well, maybe you can make it up trying something else later in the routine.\n\nHe says the end result is the feeling of \"flying through the air,\" though it's more akin to levitation.\n\nMore work to be done\n\nNedoroscik will soar into the event finals Saturday with a chance to put another medal in his carry-on before he heads home. His 15.200 qualifying score tied Ireland's Rhys McClenaghan for the tops among the eight finalists.\n\nHe is ready to ride the wave as far as it will take him. Yet whatever happens on Saturday or for the rest of his life for that matter, it will be difficult to top Monday night, when the guy with the curly hair and the glasses that made him the kind of social media sensation only the Olympics provides struck a blow for his sport, his teammates and himself.\n\n\"I'm really proud of these guys,\" he said while sitting alongside the group that became U.S. men's gymnastics royalty. \"I love you boys.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The NBC Olympics camera crew captured him having a little shuteye before his turn on the pommel horse --- Nedoroscik's only specialty out of all six apparatus that include floor, vault, rings, high bar and parallel bars.\n\nThe 25-year-old from Worcester, Massachusetts, may seem like a one-trick pony to non-gymastics fans but he sure knows his way around the pommel horse. He helped the men's team end a 16-year-long medal drought at the Olympics with a major score of 15.200.\n\nHe typically competes with a pair of goggles designed to stay on as he swings around the apparatus.

Follow live updates. - The Boston Globe", "body": "Stephen Nedoroscik does one thing very well. And he crushed it on Saturday. -- 9:30 a.m.\n\nMount the pommel horse. Compete at his highest level. Score well. Help Team USA.\n\nAt Saturday's men's gymnastics team qualification inside Bercy Arena, the Worcester native did his job very, very well.\n\n\"He killed it,\" said teammate Frederick Richard, the other half of Team USA's Massachusetts contingent as well as the squad's top all-around threat. \"I mean, that's his event. He knows he has a very important role to play on that event but he handles it like a king.\"\n\nOn Saturday, that meant anchoring the American's first rotation on pommel horse, where Nedoroscik's daring routine carries the highest difficulty score of all five gymnasts, filled as it is with one-handed spins, amazingly consistent movements, and impressive body control. But even if Nedoroscik has become well-accustomed to doing his one event and being finished, watching as his four other teammates compete at rings, vault, parallel bars, high bar and floor, helping them with their bags, making sure they have water, cheering them on, this day was different.\n\nThat's because Brody Malone, the team's most veteran gymnast and the only one back from Tokyo in 2021, came off the pommel horse when he went up first, a mistake that resulted in a disappointing 12.1. That meant Nedoroscik's score had to count toward the Americans' team total. In other words, the pressure was on.\n\n\"It definitely did get in my head a little bit,\" he said. \"You know, but at the same time the goal was the same. I wanted to hit a good routine. So whether or not someone fell before me didn't necessarily impact me. Obviously, as I was waiting there, I did see Brody's score come up. I didn't know that he made a mistake but mistakes happen. I'm not going to get mad at him or anything like that and [it] didn't really put any pressure on me.\"\n\nOverall, as an Olympic newbie, having just missed out on being a specialist on the Tokyo team, Nedoroscik was delighted with how his first attempt went. His 15.2 was the highest single score for any American routine.\n\n\"As soon as I got down, and I was giving all the guys high fives, Paul [Juda] literally pointed to my arm and said, 'You have goosebumps, man.' The moment was surreal. I'm so proud of what I did in that moment, I was like, Okay, I think I made the horse final and I think that now as well. I'm very happy.'\"\n\nBy Adam Himmelsbach\n\nPARIS -- As Frederick Richard discusses his place as an elite gymnast, he is asked to name other athletes who inspired his journey. For the first time in this conversation, the 20-year-old Stoughton, Mass., native sounds stumped.\n\nThen his voice begins to rise with confidence.\n\n\"I always just imagined myself doing all of these crazy skills,\" he says. \"I imagined myself going to the Olympics and doing all of this stuff that I'd invented, things that had never been done before. That was the person I was always chasing.\"\n\nRichard could become one of the faces of the Paris Olympics for the US as men's gymnastics qualifying begins Saturday. He is young and energetic and personable, with more than 680,000 TikTok followers and a burning desire to show the world what it has been missing.\n\nAsher Hong's gold (all-around) and silver (still rings) medals at the 2023 US Championships increase the chance the US will win its first Olympic team medal since 2008. Competing at Stanford, he won six gold medals in the last 2 years, and was an all-around bronze medalist in the NCAA championships in 2023. He finished first in the still rings at the team trials in June, and fourth in floor and parallel bars.\n\nAge: 23 | Hometown: Deerfield, Ill.\n\nPaul Juda was 19 when he became the youngest national team member after he competed in the 2020 Winter Cup. He won eight medals in three NCAA championships at Michigan. Juda was forced to miss the 2023 season due to an injury but still received the Nissen-Emery Award, given to the best senior collegiate male gymnast. Juda helped Michigan win its first floor title since 1992 at the 2024 NCAA men's gymnastics championship with his first-place finish. He competes in Ann Arbor alongside Stoughton's Frederick Richard.\n\nAge: 24 | Hometown: Summerville, Ga.\n\nBrody Malone wasn't expected to participate in this Olympics after suffering a knee injury at the 2023 DTB Cup. A year later, he managed to defy the odds to earn his second Olympic team berth. Malone finished fourth in horizontal bar in Tokyo in 2021 and advanced to the all-around final. He was a seven-time NCAA champion at Stanford and placed first in horizontal bar at the 2022 world championships. Malone and Asher Hong were teammates during their time at Stanford. He won the Nissen-Emery Award the year before Juda.\n\nAge: 25 | Hometown: Worcester\n\nNedoroscik grew up in Worcester and attended Worcester Technical High School before matriculating to Penn State in 2017. He is a specialist, competing only in pommel horse. Nedoroscik's focus makes him a not-so-secret weapon for the Americans. He won a gold medal at the 2021 world championships, and he is tied for the most titles in US history with four. He took home gold in the 2024 World Cup.\n\nAge: 20 | Hometown: Stoughton\n\nRichard trains at the Massachusetts Elite Gymnastics Academy in Millis and competes for Michigan, where he was named Big Ten gymnast of the year in April. He became a junior national team member in 2019, which helped boost his social media presence -- he has more than 670,000 followers and 30.5 million likes on TikTok and another 310,000 followers on Instagram. Richard won a bronze medal in the team and all-around at the 2023 world championships when he was 19, making him the youngest individual medalist in men's US history. He won the NCAA team, all-around, and still rings silver medals with Michigan in 2024. At the US championships this year, he placed first in floor, second in all-around and horizontal bars, and sixth in still rings.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Only the top eight qualifying scores in each event advance to the final.\n\nGet Olympics updates in your texts! Join USA TODAY Sports' WhatsApp Channel\n\nMeanwhile, from a team standpoint, the American men finished second in their qualification group. They were more than three points behind Great Britain but appear safely on track to qualify for Monday's team final - when the scores will reset and medals will be at stake.\n\nTwo more subdivisions of competition are still to come later Saturday, with dominant forces China and Japan still among the teams that are yet to compete.\n\nMalone's day got off to a bad start, with a fall on pommel horse, and only got worse from there. The nail in the metaphorical coffin was his performance on high bar, the event in which he won world championship medals in both 2021 and 2022. Malone missed the bar on one aerial element, then slipped off again a few minutes later - a devastating routine that effectively knocked him out of individual medal contention at these Games.\n\nThe two biggest stars on the men's team heading into Paris were Frederick Richard and Brody Malone. The former won the U.S. Olympic trials and has a massive following on social media. The latter returned from a gruesome knee injury to win his third U.S. all-around title earlier in the year.\n\nYet at Bercy Arena on Saturday, the most impressive performer of the day might have been a guy who was not considered a lock to even make the team: Paul Juda.\n\nThe Michigan product started off the day with a terrific routine on pommel horse - which is historically one of the Americans' worst events - and put up another big score on vault. Through four rotations, he was actually ahead of both Malone and Richard in the all-around standings.\n\nPommel horse specialist Stephen Nedoroscik also had an impressive and vital performance in his only event of the day, notching a score of 15.200 that will boost him into the individual final on that the apparatus.\n\nSaturday's competition served as the qualifying round for both the team and individual finals.\n\nThere are 12 national teams, spaced out across three subdivisions over the course of the day. The eight teams make the finals. China, Great Britain, Japan and Ukraine are among those expected to join the U.S. there.\n\nIndividually, the top 24 finishers in qualifying make the all-around final - but with the important caveat that there can be no more than two all-around finalists per country. It's this rule that essentially eliminated Malone. In apparatus-specific competition, like vault or pommel horse, the top eight qualifiers from Saturday advance.\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on social media @Tom_Schad.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karl Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brody_Malone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brody Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Juda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Juda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_rhythmic_individual_all-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's rhythmic individual all-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accor_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accor Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_artistic_team_all-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's artistic team all-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horizontal bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_artistic_individual_all-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's artistic individual all-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Scenario", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Scenario", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rope_Skipping/Clubs_and_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rope Skipping/Clubs and Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/NuCV5YLpBye53HOZLQN2CQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_sports_articles_558/d9b297519296adb2b7b11bc91a972ef6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Their arms were draped across each other's backs in a tight line as Stephen Nedoroscik mounted the pommel horse.\n\nWhen Nedoroscik's feet touched the mat again, they were all Olympic medalists.\n\nThe United States ended a 16-year Olympic medal drought, claiming bronze in the team final on Monday in Bercy Arena. Japan overcame a shocking fall by reigning Olympic all-around champion Hashimoto Daiki on pommel horse to edge out China, which suffered three falls on high bar in the final rotation.\n\nNedoroscik had waited two hours to perform his single routine of the day. The pommel horse specialist didn't look fazed, working through efficiently and sending his teammates into a euphoric celebration when he landed his dismount. He raised both fists in the air and wrapped coach Sam Mikulak in a hug. Mikulak lifted Nedoroscik in the air.\n\nJapan won with 259.594 points, 0.532 points ahead of China. The United States finished with 257.793 points.\n\nThe tight race at the top came from a three-year process that started when the Americans returned home from a third consecutive fifth-place Olympic finish in Tokyo. The United States was already out of medal contention when the Americans entered the arena three years ago. Their difficulty score during the team final was five points behind the top team Japan, a chasm even perfect execution could not close.\n\nThey needed to tip the math in their favor.\n\nIn an effort to boost the team's difficulty score, USA Gymnastics used a complicated bonus system that encouraged athletes to demonstrate upgraded skills. Typically, a fall while attempting a difficult element would decide an athlete's standing on the national team and the financial and marketing opportunities that come with the designation. But the bonus system, which began in 2022, offered a safety net of additional points at domestic competitions for more difficult skills that would have offset a fall.\n\nWhen Richard had just learned a tricky full-twisting high bar release in 2022, he took the risk of adding it to his competitive routine for the U.S. championship with assurance that even if he didn't catch the bar, the bonus system could provide a safety net. He aced the skill both days of competition and it's been in his routine since. He used it to become the youngest American man to win an all-around medal at the world championships when he took bronze in 2023 while helping the United States to team gold.\n\nThe Americans ended a nearly 10-year world championship drought by finishing third last year in Belgium. From a five-point difficulty gap at the 2021 Olympics, the United States was 2.1 points behind first-place Japan at the world championships and 0.7 point behind second-place China.\n\nThe math, as they say, was mathing.\n\n\"We're going to be able to control our own destiny [at the Olympics],\" U.S. high performance director Brett McClure said after the team was announced at U.S. Olympic trials.\n\nWhen the Americans were safely in medal position following Nedoroscik's hit routine, McClure handed an American flag to Malone. The 24-year-old was the only member of the U.S. team with prior Olympic experience. He didn't look the part during qualifications when he began the competition with a fall on pommel horse and fell twice on his signature event high bar.\n\nHe apologized to teammates after the competition.

That 80% would be good enough, even though Mikulak knew full well that Nedoroscik never does anything -- from his sport to solving a Rubik's Cube -- at 80%.\n\n\"You have to trick yourself,\" said Mikulak, a three-time Olympian turned coach. \"You've got to make sure you don't let all the noise get into your head.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nSierra signage going up at former Sioux City Bed Bath & Beyond North Sioux City crash kills one 4-year-old boy escaped from cage in Iowa home; deputies found him covered in feces on street Now streaming and on DVD: 'The Richmond Way' gives us the whole 'Ted Lasso' story BNSF Railway wants to remove collapsed Big Sioux River train bridge Sioux City's Lyons Park getting $1.22 million in upgrades Jason's Frozen Treats open second dine-in ice cream parlor Sioux City driver charged with vehicular homicide from weekend crash Body found in Floyd River in Sioux City Elk Point man killed in North Sioux City crash Wife of Dakota Dunes fatal stabbing suspect charged as an accessory Financial situation for McCook Lake residents still murky a month after flood State baseball: Scrapy dynamic duo sends Crusaders to state title game, down top seed Wahlert Woodbury County Court Report for July 22, 2024 Two dead following Sunday night two-vehicle accident in Sioux City's westside\n\nThat usually isn't a problem for the 25-year-old from Worcester, Massachusetts. It takes a certain type of single-mindedness to make the choices Nedoroscik has made for the last decade, when he essentially decided to dedicate himself to a single pursuit, focusing on an event that has long been a weakness for the U.S. men's national team program.\n\nYes, there is monotony involved. How could there not be?\n\n\"I don't know how I don't lose my mind,\" Nedoroscik said before the Games. \"But every day I go into the gym and there's still something to do. There's still something to improve.\"\n\nNot anymore.\n\nProving a point\n\nHe drilled his set during qualifying on Saturday to earn a spot on the event finals later in the Games. But Monday night, things were different. Teammates Frederick Richard, Brody Malone, Paul Juda and Asher Hong had put together 17 straight routines without a miss, putting the Americans in position to reach the medal stand for the first time since 2008 in Beijing.\n\nWhile Nedoroscik had some wiggle room -- the U.S. had a fairly healthy lead after Juda and Malone hit their sets before Nedoroscik saluted the judges -- he also didn't want to merely hold on. He wanted to prove a point.\n\nNot just to himself, but to those who wondered if he deserved to be there in the first place.\n\nWhat followed were 45 seconds of sublime brilliance, with Nedoroscik's hands traveling from one end of the horse to the other, his legs swooping this way, then that.\n\nA few feet away, his four teammates -- and the sizable contingent of US fans inside Bercy Arena -- roared as a medal that seemed distant for a program that had finished a distant fifth in each of its last three trips under the rings -- drew closer.\n\nBy the time Nedoroscik neared his dismount, he knew his job was complete. The celebration began before his feet even hit the mat.\n\nAll those years, all those reps, both physical and mental, all the difficult times when he wondered whether to keep going, all the quirks he's developed along the way -- from the non-prescription goggles he sometimes rocks to the chef's kiss to the camera he occasionally makes -- led up to that moment.\n\nAnd he did not miss, delivering \"the exclamation point\" with a 14.866 to finish off a performance the U.S. men's program hopes provides serious momentum heading into the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I kind of in that moment was like, 'All right, let's run it back and let's go out there and do our thing,'\" Nedoroscik said.\n\nFilling a critical gap\n\nA \"thing\" that has long been a sore spot for the U.S. in major international competition. The 2012 Olympic team topped qualifying. Then they led off on pommel horse in the finals and saw their medal hopes vanish one mistake at a time.\n\nNedoroscik understood the history. It's one of the reasons he gravitated toward pommels. Another is the fact that it requires many things -- stamina, strength and creativity chief among them -- that he has in spades, particularly that last one.\n\nHe describes himself as a \"late bloomer\" on the event. Those early struggles only helped him press forward.\n\n\"Running into trouble on the apparatus early on taught me how to fight, how to stay on, how to really go for that routine,\" he said. \"And I think that that has stuck with me throughout.\"\n\nUnlike other events, which are painstakingly laid out and practiced on end for months if not years, pommel horse allows gymnasts to color outside the lines and make things up as they go on. Miss an element here? Well, maybe you can make it up trying something else later in the routine.\n\nHe says the end result is the feeling of \"flying through the air,\" though it's more akin to levitation.\n\nMore work to be done\n\nNedoroscik will soar into the event finals Saturday with a chance to put another medal in his carry-on before he heads home. His 15.200 qualifying score tied Ireland's Rhys McClenaghan for the tops among the eight finalists.\n\nHe is ready to ride the wave as far as it will take him. Yet whatever happens on Saturday or for the rest of his life for that matter, it will be difficult to top Monday night, when the guy with the curly hair and the glasses that made him the kind of social media sensation only the Olympics provides struck a blow for his sport, his teammates and himself.\n\n\"I'm really proud of these guys,\" he said while sitting alongside the group that became U.S. men's gymnastics royalty. \"I love you boys.\"\n\nOlympic Games Paris 2024: Scenes from the opening ceremony\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Japan and China are the heavy favorites to battle for gold, but there are a handful of teams who are capable of challenging for a spot on the medal podium alongside them.\n\nThe U.S. and Great Britain are two of those teams.\n\nAfter the first subdivision of the qualification round, Great Britain (256.561) edged out the U.S. (253.229), with Canada finishing third (247.794) and Germany finishing fourth (245.395).\n\nJake Jarman of Great Britain leads the all-around (84.897), but perhaps the story of the day is 2023 World all-around bronze medalist Frederick Richard and 2022 NCAA all-around champion Paul Juda (82.865), advancing to the all-around final - knocking out three-time all-around national champion Brody Malone.\n\nMalone fell on pommel horse in the first rotation and had two falls on high bar, ending his chances before the competition even concluded. Malone will also miss the high bar final, an event where he is a world champion from 2022.\n\nComing into the competition, Malone and Richard were favored to advance as the top all-around gymnasts. However, Juda was undeniable today. Showing confidence and precision on every single event to qualify to his first major all-around final in his Olympic debut.\n\nGreat Britain took the lead over the United States early on with a 44.299 on vault, thanks to a couple of huge vaults from Harry Hepworth and 2023 World vault champion Jake Jarman. Both gymnasts performed two vaults, hoping to land a spot in the event final. Hepworth posted the highest average on vault with a 14.766, but Jarman wasn't too far behind with a 14.699.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. got off to a strong start (42.433) on the pommel horse - an event that historically has been one of the team's weaker events.\n\nJuda started the competition, showing clean circles and setting the U.S. team off on the right foot. The routine was so good, Juda couldn't help but let out a victorious scream after sticking his dismount; soaking in every moment of his first routine on the Olympic stage. Richard followed with a strong routine of his own, however the U.S. ran into a hiccup in the third spot when Malone fell off midway through his pommel horse routine, posting just a 12.100.\n\nFollowing a long wait for Malone's score, 2021 pommel horse world champion Stephen Nedoroscik rounded out the rotation with a superb set, doing exactly what he brought to Paris to do. Nedoroscik hasn't always performed his highest level of difficulty in competition this year but performed a 6.4 difficulty routine to set the benchmark for event qualification with a massive 15.200.\n\nOver on rings in the second rotation, Juda and Richard nailed their routines with Richard capping things off with a stuck double double. Malone rebounded well from his fall in the first rotation to put up a clean rings routine. Asher Hong posted the highest score of the rotation for Team USA (14.633). He'll be targeting a spot in the event finals with that score.\n\nGreat Britain maintained the lead after two rotations, led by Joe Fraser's 14.933 on parallel bars.\n\nIn the third rotation, the U.S. was a little conservative on vault and wasn't able to get any stuck landings. The highlight of the rotation was Hong's incredibly difficult Ri Se-Gwang, which he landed with a step back for a 14.700.\n\nIn the fourth rotation, Juda kept his momentum rolling with a 14.033 on parallel bars. Malone posted a 14.533, his highest score of the day.\n\nGreat Britain went big on the floor, with Jarman (14.766), Luke Whitehouse (14.544) and Hepworth (14.166) posting some of the highest scores of the first subdivision.\n\nOn high bar in the fifth rotation, Hong went the wrong way on his Tak full but recovered well for a 12.600. Next up, Malone fell on his Liukin and again on his Kolman - a devastating ending for his all-around and event final chances. His final score was 12.233. Richard rounded out the rotation with a stellar routine, good for a 14.166.\n\nOver on pommel horse for Great Britain, two-time Olympic champion Max Whitlock delivered a huge routine. His 15.166 puts him behind Nedoroscik by just .034.\n\nIn the final rotation, Richard went out of bounds on his opening tumbling pass on floor, but his 13.833 was enough to lock in his spot in the all-around final for Team USA, along with Juda, who went 13.966 on floor. Hong posted the highest score for the Americans on floor with a 14.100.\n\nOther notable performances from individuals competing in the first subdivision included Mahdi Olfati of Iran, who vaulted an impressive Yurchenko double pike just hours after serving as the flag bearer for his country. Israel's Artem Dolgopyat posted a 14.466 on floor, the event where he is the reigning Olympic champion.\n\nAhmad Abu Al Soud of Jordan, who also was a flag bearer, fell on the pommel horse (12.466). Abu Al Soud, who is a world silver and bronze medalist on the event, will miss the event finals.", "source": {"uri": "nbcolympics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "nbcolympics.com"}, "authors": [],

It's their first time on the podium in 16 years.\n\nThe team came to Monday's event in a close race with Great Britain for the bronze. Nedoroscik would be the team's last hope to hold on to that medal.\n\nIn 45 seconds, the 25-year-old Worcester Tech graduate electrified the crowd at Bercy Arena, culminating with a perfect dismount to rapturous applause and chants of 'USA, USA.\" His teammates lifted him as he walked off the mat to a team-best score of 14.866.\n\nNBC Olympics posted the routine on social media with the simple caption, \"Moment = Met.\"\n\nJapan took home gold in the all-around competition, and China earned silver.\n\nDespite being a US and world champion, Nedoroscik was considered a controversial pick for the Paris Olympics because he only competed in the pommel horse, according to The Athletic. Most of the US men's gymnastics team performed in all or most of the six events.\n\nThat meant he spent hours on the sidelines Monday waiting for his chance to prove he deserved his spot. And he did just that, turning in one of the most memorable moments for the US team of the Paris Games thus far.\n\nIt's fitting that the glasses-wearing Nedoroscik drew comparisons to Clark Kent as he is now being called the Superman of these games.\n\nThe US men's gymnastics team also won a bronze medal in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nClick here to follow Daily Voice Worcester and receive free news updates.", "source": {"uri": "dailyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Worcester, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Worcester, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accor_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accor Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Olympic_broadcasts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC Olympic broadcasts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_Bruins_women's_gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UCLA Bruins women's gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kent"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kent"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://edge.dailyvoice.com/upload/323821648_728218168658297_8896747667324135770_n.jpg?width=1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 242, "textEnd": 249}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

14.866, one of the best pommel horse scores of the day, and secured Team USA the bronze medal behind Japan and China.\n\nWhile the U.S. women's gymnastics team has dominated the sport in the last decade, this was the men's squad's first spot on the podium since 2008.\n\nAnother Massachusetts gymnast provided more points to Team USA's total of 257.793 -- Frederick Richard earned cheers from a watch party back in Stoughton as performed in four different events: floor, rings, parallel bars and horizontal bars.\n\n\"We've been giving it everything and today it all came together,\" Richard

In each of the past three Summer Olympics, the Americans have finished fifth.\n\nWhile women's gymnastics remains a marquee sport in the U.S., things have waned on the men's side of things. That's why taking home any medal in Paris was big for the men's team.\n\nLed by national champion Brody Malone, Stephen Nedoroscik, Frederick Richard, Paul Juda and Asher Hong, the Americans had a terrific group performance, ultimately edging out Great Britain for third place.\n\nMalone competed in five of six events, while Nedoroscik delivered a clutch performance on pommel horse to secure a trip to the podium.\n\nThe bronze win was largely the result of a change in approach by USA Gymnastics coaches. In previous years, Team USA's routines simply weren't difficult enough, and coaches looked to change that.\n\n\"In an effort to boost the team's difficulty score, USA Gymnastics used a complicated bonus system that encouraged athletes to demonstrate upgraded skills,\" Thuc Nhi Nguyen of the Los Angeles Times wrote.\n\nBy offering a bonus system that rewarded more difficult skills and helped offset falls during the team-selection process, they found a squad that could truly compete on the biggest stage. Fortunately, it executed.\n\nAnd while winning a bronze during an Olympics that features 329 medal events might not seem like a big deal, it's huge for the American men's gymnastics landscape.\n\nJapan took gold in the event, while China won silver. If Team USA uses its third-place performance as a springboard to the 2028 Olympics, perhaps it will have a shot at its first gold in more than four decades.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kristopher_knox@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Kristopher Knox", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_Bruins_women's_gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UCLA Bruins women's gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Juda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Juda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asher_Hong", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asher Hong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brody_Malone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brody Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1722280546/c8vqngsp9z3dgbp8a6si.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Nedoroscik, 25, he began his gymnastics journey in 2003. Gymnastics was the only sport he played in high school and decided to focus solely on pommel horse after winning the Junior Olympic Nationals in 2015 and 2016, his only times competing in the event.\n\nUnlike some other gymnasts who learn all six disciplines (floor, vault, parallel bars, horizontal bar, pommel horse, and still rings), Nedoroscik stars on just one: pommel horse.\n\nHe is appearing in his first Olympics after narrowly missing out on being a part of the 2021 Tokyo roster. At the team qualification on Saturday, Nedoroscik scored a 15.2, the highest score for any American gymnast through the qualification.\n\nJoining the Nittany Lions in college, Nedoroscik instantly made an impact, securing the 2017 and 2018 pommel horse titles at the national championships.\n\nNedoroscik won the Nissen Emery Award in 2020, given to the nation's most outstanding senior college gymnast. He continued his success after graduating with a degree in electrical engineering, winning United State pommel horse championships in four consecutive years, from 2021-24. His four US pommel horse titles are the tied for the most in American history.\n\nHave you seen his goggles? They are not prescribed, yet play an integral role in his look and his confidence.

That 80% would be good enough, even though Mikulak knew full well that Nedoroscik never does anything -- from his sport to solving a Rubik's Cube -- at 80%.\n\n\"You have to trick yourself,\" said Mikulak, a three-time Olympian turned coach. \"You've got to make sure you don't let all the noise get into your head.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

It takes a certain type of single-mindedness to make the choices Nedoroscik has made for the last decade, when he essentially decided to dedicate himself to a single pursuit, focusing on an event that has long been a weakness for the U.S. men's national team program.\n\nYes, there is monotony involved. How could there not be?\n\n\"I don't know how I don't lose my mind,\" Nedoroscik said before the Games. \"But every day I go into the gym and there's still something to do. There's still something to improve.\"\n\nNot anymore.\n\nProving a point\n\nHe drilled his set during qualifying on Saturday to earn a spot on the event finals later in the Games. But Monday night, things were different. Teammates Frederick Richard, Brody Malone, Paul Juda and Asher Hong had put together 17 straight routines without a miss, putting the Americans in position to reach the medal stand for the first time since 2008 in Beijing.\n\nWhile Nedoroscik had some wiggle room -- the U.S. had a fairly healthy lead after Juda and Malone hit their sets before Nedoroscik saluted the judges -- he also didn't want to merely hold on. He wanted to prove a point.\n\nNot just to himself, but to those who wondered if he deserved to be there in the first place.\n\nWhat followed were 45 seconds of sublime brilliance, with Nedoroscik's hands traveling from one end of the horse to the other, his legs swooping this way, then that.\n\nA few feet away, his four teammates -- and the sizable contingent of US fans inside Bercy Arena -- roared as a medal that seemed distant for a program that had finished a distant fifth in each of its last three trips under the rings -- drew closer.\n\nBy the time Nedoroscik neared his dismount, he knew his job was complete. The celebration began before his feet even hit the mat.\n\nAll those years, all those reps, both physical and mental, all the difficult times when he wondered whether to keep going, all the quirks he's developed along the way -- from the non-prescription goggles he sometimes rocks to the chef's kiss to the camera he occasionally makes -- led up to that moment.\n\nAnd he did not miss, delivering \"the exclamation point\" with a 14.866 to finish off a performance the U.S. men's program hopes provides serious momentum heading into the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I kind of in that moment was like, 'All right, let's run it back and let's go out there and do our thing,'\" Nedoroscik said.\n\nFilling a critical gap\n\nA \"thing\" that has long been a sore spot for the U.S. in major international competition. The 2012 Olympic team topped qualifying. Then they led off on pommel horse in the finals and saw their medal hopes vanish one mistake at a time.\n\nNedoroscik understood the history. It's one of the reasons he gravitated toward pommels. Another is the fact that it requires many things -- stamina, strength and creativity chief among them -- that he has in spades, particularly that last one.\n\nHe describes himself as a \"late bloomer\" on the event. Those early struggles only helped him press forward.\n\n\"Running into trouble on the apparatus early on taught me how to fight, how to stay on, how to really go for that routine,\" he said. \"And I think that that has stuck with me throughout.\"\n\nUnlike other events, which are painstakingly laid out and practiced on end for months if not years, pommel horse allows gymnasts to color outside the lines and make things up as they go on. Miss an element here? Well, maybe you can make it up trying something else later in the routine.\n\nHe says the end result is the feeling of \"flying through the air,\" though it's more akin to levitation.\n\nMore work to be done\n\nNedoroscik will soar into the event finals Saturday with a chance to put another medal in his carry-on before he heads home. His 15.200 qualifying score tied Ireland's Rhys McClenaghan for the tops among the eight finalists.\n\nHe is ready to ride the wave as far as it will take him. Yet whatever happens on Saturday or for the rest of his life for that matter, it will be difficult to top Monday night, when the guy with the curly hair and the glasses that made him the kind of social media sensation only the Olympics provides struck a blow for his sport, his teammates and himself.\n\n\"I'm really proud of these guys,\" he said while sitting alongside the group that became U.S. men's gymnastics royalty. \"I love you boys.\"\n\nOlympic Games Paris 2024: Scenes from the opening ceremony\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Jake Jarman (84.897) and Joe Fraser (84.666) posted the top all-around scores and six-time Olympic medalist Max Whitlock provided a jolt with an electric pommel horse routine - his signature event - that left the 31-year-old looking relieved.\n\nWhitlock's 15.166 trailed only American Stephen Nedoroscik, a specialist whose 15.200 likely earned him a spot in the event finals and gave his teammates some early momentum.\n\nIt didn't last.

Competing in the 2024 Paris Olympics, he removes them for his sole event, the pommel horse, a dazzling routine that helped Team USA's men's gymnastics team win bronze on Monday, July 29.\n\nNedoroscik's transformation from a mild-mannered, bespectacled mechanical engineer to a powerful athlete defying gravity on the pommel horse draws comparisons to Clark Kent turning into Superman.\n\nIn an interview earlier today on July 30, Nedoroscik could be heard saying, \"I think they're awesome,\" adding \"I'm representing people that wear glasses well.\"\n\nDuring the interview with co-anchor Hoda Kotb, he revealed that he wore his sunglasses due to his eye sensitivity, a condition that he previously discussed on social media.\n\n\"It's not necessarily clear, but the thing about pommel horse is if I keep them on, they're gonna fly somewhere,\" Nedoroscik explained.\n\nHe further added, \"When I go up on the pommel horse, it's all about feeling the equipment. I don't even really see when I'm doing my gymnastics. It's all in the hands -- I can feel everything.\"\n\nNedoroscik has strabismus, or crossed eyes, a condition he revealed on TikTok. Strabismus, caused by issues with eye muscles, leads to misaligned eyes, resulting in depth perception loss, blurry, or double vision.\n\nGlasses or contacts can help, and other treatments include surgery, eye muscle exercises, and prism lenses. Additionally, Nedoroscik has coloboma, a genetic condition where part of the eye tissue is missing at birth, making him photophobic, or light-sensitive.\n\nThis explains why he borrowed Hoda's sunglasses. Symptoms include vision loss and blindness in specific areas. There's no cure, but glasses, contact lenses, low vision aids, or surgery can help.\n\nHe has also revealed that sometimes he just wears glasses for good luck as a superstition.\n\nFor the unfamiliar, Born on October 28, 1998, Stephen John Nedoroscik is an American artistic gymnast specializing in the pommel horse.

Credit - Gabriel Bouys -- AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe name doesn't exactly roll off the tongue -- Stephen Nedoroscik -- but you can just call him The Pommel Horse guy.\n\nThat's what social media is dubbing their newly minted star.\n\nIt's Nedoroscik's specialty in gymnastics, and the sole reason he was put on the U.S. men's team. The Massachusetts native now trains in Florida, and is a four-time U.S., two-time NCAA, and 2021 world champion on the event.\n\nPommel horse? What's that? That's the event in which gymnasts mount -- yes, mount -- what's called a horse that is 160-cm. long and 135-cm. wide with two handles on top. You grab the handles and swing your legs around in creative ways -- around, above, and next to the horse. You can even move from one end of the horse to the other -- a move that Nedoroscik does especially well.\n\nRead More: How the U.S. Men's Gymnastics Team Won Their First Medal in 16 Years\n\nNedoroscik was put on the five-member U.S. Olympic team because he's so good on that event. His selection came as a surprise to many gymnastics fans, who questioned the sanity of USA Gymnastics in banking on a specialist who only competes on one of the six events in men's gymnastics. What if he makes a mistake? What if other gymnasts on the team get injured and you run out of alternates to replace them? A specialist, in the gymnastics world, is therefore a very risky thing to be.\n\nBut all the chatter didn't seem to bother the bespectacled Nedoroscik, who, as luck would have it, was scheduled to compete in the last of six rotations, and last in the lineup. That meant he waited for 2.5 hours before it was his turn to mount that pommel.\n\nWhat Nedoroscik did to while away the time is now stuff of internet legend. Snaps of him with his head back, eyes closed, and seemingly dozing have become a meme. But Nedoroscik was just in full preparation mode.\n\n\"I did my breathing exercises, and I could hear all the guys cheering for [teammates] Brody [Malone] and Paul [Juda], and I thought, 'Sounds like everything is going well,'\" he said. \"I knew at that moment that every guy hit every single routine. And I have this thing, if everybody hits [their routines] before me, then I never miss. So I thought 'let's go out there and do our thing.'\"\n\nAnd do his thing he did, swinging, and swinging, and swinging some more to put, as he called it, \"an exclamation point\" on the competition.\n\nIt will surprise absolutely no one that Nedoroscik, an electrical engineering graduate from Penn State, is highly superstitious. He used to wear goggles that were part of a competition superstition after a friend gifted them and he wore them as a prank -- but successfully completed a hard routine. He steers clear of songs that he's listened to before having a bad routine -- \"Thunder\" and \"Riptide\" are big ones (sorry, Imagine Dragons and Vance Joy). Since the 2021 world championships, however, he's been trying to rid himself of those rituals by indulging in them to \"break the curses.\"\n\nIronically, when it comes to his career, Nedoroscik has been more laissez-faire. He concentrated on pommel horse after 2014, when a coach who had trained the national pommel horse champion the previous year came to his club gym in Worcester and told him he could also be a national champion one day.\n\n\"I figured, this guy has seen a national champion so he must see something in me,\" Nedoroscik said. \"That year I won my first ever junior national title. I had no idea how gymnastics worked and didn't even know that college was a thing for gymnasts. So I started talking to coaches and ended up at Penn State. I didn't know how to get on the national team, but won the Winter Cup one year and then made the national team. I thought, 'dude [being a specialist] is awesome'!\"\n\nIt's taken him from recreational gymnast to national and world champion to, now, an Olympic medalist. And emerging internet star.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik",

That was the plan. It wasn't take-no-prisoners; it was take-no-risks. Brett McClure, the high performance director, harbored no delusions that they might beat Japan and China, historic programs and rivals that finished 1-2 in an epic photo-finish. The U.S.' conservative approach enabled the team to finish only a point-and-a-half out of second and two ahead of Great Britain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor instance: Before clinching bronze with a score nearly .4 less than the 15.200 he posted in qualifying, Nedoroscik, a pommel horse specialist who sat around two hours waiting for something to do, got his marching orders from his coach.\n\n\"Eighty percent,\" Sam Mikulak told him, \"is all you need.\"\n\nNot what you'd read on Alabama's locker room wall, but, hey, it worked. He knew it's not good to get Nedoroscik too geeked. He's geeky enough as it is, which you'd know if you'd seen him in his black horn-rimmed glasses underneath the pile of backpacks he schlepped around for teammates at qualifying. His peers are built like fire hydrants. Nedoroscik looks like he should haunt a chemistry lab, not swing gracefully around and over a pommel horse. If they make this story into a movie, Michael Cera is a lock for the part.\n\nThe point is, Nedoroscik had one job to do, and if he wasn't exactly magnificent at it Monday, he was plenty good enough. Same with Malone. The squad's only two-time Olympian, a medal hopeful, he'd been a flop in qualifying. Literally. Fell four times across three apparatuses.\n\nLike Nedoroscik, he didn't put on a show Monday, but he didn't wobble once. In qualifying, the '22 world champ on the high bar needed three starts on the apparatus, ending up with just 10 points. When his score Sunday came up 14.166, his coaches protested, but their hearts weren't in it. They were just happy he didn't end up face-first on his finely chiseled chin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, the U.S. went 18-for-18 on six apparatuses, meaning no one slipped, fell or landed on his derriere. Might not sound like much to you, but Japan couldn't say that. Neither could China, whose Su Weide fell twice from the high bar in the final rotation, costing China two points and effectively the gold.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJuda would be hard-pressed to make the starting lineups of either of the gold or silver medalists, but he set the tone for the U.S. on all four apparatuses he competed on Monday. Stuck the landing and turned it over to the next guy.\n\nWhen he volunteered to go first on the pommel horse in the final rotation, Hong could tell Juda's nerves were frayed. They were this close to a medal. They knew it, even if they refused to look at the scores. Stayed in their \"bubble,\" as they called it. But they had an idea the bronze was in hand after going 15-for-15.\n\nWhen Juda raised his hand and tentatively said he'd go first one more time, Hong moved in.\n\n\"Paul, you're the man for the job,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You earned this moment.\"\n\nThe sense of belief was all Juda needed to hear.\n\n\"I went up there,\" he said, \"and I was light as a feather.\"\n\nFunny thing is, Hong believes he just as easily could have handled the horse in the Olympics. It's his weakest, which is why Nedoroscik took his place, denying Hong an opportunity to compete for the all-around Thursday. But he's getting better on the horse. He was a half-point better on the bars Monday than he'd been in qualifying, and his 14.533 on the rings led the Americans, as did his spectacular 14.833 on the vault.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoing into the second rotation, the U.S. was in fifth place overall. Once Hong, a 5-foot-1 blur, landed his twisting, double-back somersault in the vault, the U.S. was in first.\n\n\"That,\" Mikulak said, \"was when then momentum was heating up, and that's Asher's M.O. He's gonna rise to the occasion. There's no way he's missing this. This is, like, his moment.\n\n\"This is what he's been dreaming of, and he finally got it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen not giving the team a shot of adrenaline on an apparatus, Hong is its head cheerleader. He and Richard, both still just 20, represent the high-wire future of the men's team. At one point it was hard to tell who'd expended more energy: Richard, a crowd-pleaser who added a gadget to his high bar routine, improving his qualifying score by .7; or Hong, who did everything but climb up on the bar with him.\n\nWeren't you afraid of wearing yourself out?\n\n\"Oh, no,\" Hong said, smiling. \"Hyping everybody gets me more hyped, too.\"\n\nOnce Nedoroscik landed, the rest of the U.S. team members let out everything they'd held in reserve all day. Next thing you knew, the closer, who called it \"the greatest moment of my life,\" was crowd-surfing his teammates. Malone, whose face is a mask in competition, looked like a kid at Christmas. They had a right to party. The men's team had waited 16 long years for this, since Richard and Hong were only 4 years old. The boys are all grown up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter/X: @KSherringtonDMN\n\nRelated StoriesView MoreCoppell's Chiaka Ogbogu, U.S. women's volleyball avoid worst vs. China in Olympic openerU.S. women

Mistakes on pommel horse, floor exercise and, most surprisingly, high bar left him trailing both Frederick Richard and Paul Juda in the all-around standings, while wiping away any chance he had of reaching an individual final in Paris.\n\nOnly two gymnasts per country are allowed to advance to the 24-person all-around final, which is July 31.\n\n\"Just silly mistakes that I don't usually make,\" said Malone, who finished 30th overall. \"But I mean, it happens. It's sports. You'll not always be perfect. So I'm just going to go reset tomorrow in the gym, reset my foundation with some basics and then just be ready for team finals.\"\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nGet Olympics updates in your texts! Join USA TODAY Sports' WhatsApp Channel\n\nThe first round of competition at elite gymnastics competitions serves as a catch-all qualifier, used to determine both the individuals who make all-around and apparatus-specific finals as well as the teams that will compete in the team final. Only eight individuals make the final for each apparatus, and only eight nations reach the team final on July 29.\n\nThe American men finished second in their four-team qualification group, significantly behind Great Britain. But they placed fifth overall to advance to the final, when the scores will reset and medals will be at stake.\n\n\"It answered a lot of questions for us,\" high-performance director Brett McClure said of Great Britain's performance. \"Our strategy is to go out there and do everything we can, because I think if we put it all together, we're right there with them.\"\n\nPart of that gap between Great Britain and the U.S. can be traced back, unfortunately, to Malone's uncharacteristically rough day.\n\nUsually one of Team USA's most steady and consistent performers, he started off the competition with a fall in the first rotation, pommel horse. And he ended it with a slip in the last rotation, floor exercise. He received scores in the 12s for both routines - well below his usual marks and below par for a team, and athlete, with medal aspirations. In a format where teams drop their lowest score on each event, the U.S. men counted only two of Malone's.\n\nThe nail in the metaphorical coffin, however, was Malone's performance on high bar, the event in which he won a world championship in 2022. He missed the bar on one release move, then stalled after catching the bar too close on another release and had to drop off - a devastating sequence that effectively knocked him out of individual medal contention at these Games.\n\nRichard and Juda said Malone apologized to the team shortly after leaving the floor.\n\n\"We all have bad days,\" Richard said. \"I lost the NCAA championships in April. I came back stronger for (U.S.) championships. I know what it's like to not perform as well as you can, but that's part of the sport.\n\n\"Looking at the full picture, today is not the day we needed him.\"\n\nMalone's loss will likely prove to be Juda's gain. The Michigan product was not considered a lock to even make the Olympic team a few months ago, but he started off the day with a terrific routine on pommel horse - which is historically one of the Americans' worst events - and put up another big score on vault.\n\nPommel horse specialist Stephen Nedoroscik also had an impressive and vital performance in his only event of the day, notching a score of 15.200 that was tied for the best of the day. He will be the only American man to compete in an apparatus final.\n\n\"I don't think that our performance today is going to be concerning,\" Nedoroscik said. \"... I still think we have a fantastic chance to medal.\"\n\nThe U.S. men are attempting to win their first team medal at the Olympics since 2008 - and, at least entering Saturday, they appeared to have solid odds. Team USA doesn't have the difficulty required to keep pace with China or Japan. But with perennial medal contender Russia out of the picture - the result of a team sports suspension levied by the International Olympic Committee - they are expected to be in the mix with Great Britain and Ukraine for the bronze.\n\n\"We didn't watch any scores. We're not going to watch any scores,\" Juda said. \"We're just going to go into our routines and lay the cards where they fall.\"", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA

He watched as his teammates hit routine after routine, and he warmed up and tried not to think about what he'd understood since he saw the start list: He would decide whether the U.S. earned its first Olympic medal in the men's gymnastics team event in 16 years.\n\nThirty-eight seconds later, as he flung himself off the pommel horse, he let himself think it: Bro, if you hit this dismount, your team wins a medal.\n\n\"And I stuck it!\" he said afterward, the bronze dangling around his neck, a grin stretched across his face.\n\n\"There's gonna be no pressure that matches that,\" said U.S. teammate Asher Hong.\n\nThe gymnasts insisted later that they had abided by the rule they set for themselves not to watch the scoreboard. \"We make jokes about it, when [the PA announces] the place we're in, we're like, 'We don't want to know that information! Stop telling us!'\" said Paul Juda. But they could tell.\n\n\"It wasn't a matter of knowing,\" he said. \"It was a matter of feeling.\"\n\nThey felt good all day, which was a welcome change from a qualifying round that went so poorly that de facto team captain Brody Malone apologized to his teammates afterward. The Americans finished Saturday's qualifiers ranked fifth and seemed to be a world away from top contenders Japan, who would win gold, and China who would take silver. They made only three individual finals: Frederick Richard and Juda in the all-around, and Nedoroscik in the pommel horse. But they reminded themselves that Monday's final \"was the day that mattered,\" Hong said. \"We got 18 routines to hit, and that's our goal.\"\n\nThe same four gymnasts-Hong, Juda, Malone and Richard-hit the first 17. Then came Nedoroscik.\n\nBy literal luck of the draw, the Americans would begin on the still rings, which meant they would end on the pommel horse, historically their most challenging event. Its mix of balance and movement has bedeviled generations of gymnasts. But not Nedoroscik, who loves it so much he decided in high school to specialize in it. And he has been so successful-in 2021 he became the first American to win gold in the event at the world championships-that the U.S. coaches decided their team should be four all-arounders and one man who can do only one thing.\n\nIt was a risky decision. But this U.S. team does not just tolerate risk. It embraces it. After a decade of frustrating results, the coaches decided heading into Paris to reshape the program, implementing a program that incentivizes athletes to attempt more difficult skills.\n\n\"We took a lot of hits on that, because not a lot of people believed in it,\" said Syque Caesar, the coach who devised the system. \"I even was critical of it, and I helped put it together. But I think tonight proved that it can work.\"\n\nGymnastics scores comprise two elements: an execution score, which starts at 10 and decreases with mistakes, and a difficulty-score, which is open-ended. The Americans had been prioritizing consistency, which led athletes to choose easier routines that they were sure they could stick. This made for clean meets but meant that realistically they never had a shot at the podium, not when their opponents began with such higher potential values. So in 2022, the coaching staff instituted a bonus system that awarded gymnasts extra tenths of a point-sometimes even more than a point-in domestic competitions for attempting difficult skills.\n\nIt was a controversial change. Many athletes balked at first. Even high performance director Brett McClure-the official responsible for implementing the system-needed the hard sell. \"Very hard,\" he said. \"But if it's what the coaches and athletes want, to have that buffer to make mistakes and still make national teams, still get funding, do all of these things, then I support it, 100%.\"\n\nIt's just math, said Caesar. He likens it to another sport, baseball, that underwent a shift toward analytics two decades ago: \"We Moneyballed the sport,\" he said.\n\nOn Friday, they looked more like the Oakland A's of 2024 than of 2002. But on Monday, they showed up ready to go, charging through the practice area while the other athletes looked on, bemused. Leading off the event, Richard stuck the landing on his rings routine and set off a U-S-A chant in the stands.\n\nThat became a trend as they hit routine after routine. The gymnasts began to feel as if the whole arena was behind them.\n\n\"Instead of trying to prove people wrong,\" Richard says, \"You're proving them right.\"\n\nThe Americans slowly built their advantage, improving their scores from qualifying on each apparatus.\n\n\"Every routine is an opportunity to build momentum,\" Richard had told his teammates.\n\nAs they continued to perform flawlessly, their joy became almost desperate. Hong and Juda may have expended more energy cheering than they did competing. But after Malone-the 2022 high bar world champion who fell twice on the apparatus in qualifying and missed the event final-nailed his high bar routine, they huddled and reminded one another not to get too far ahead of themselves.\n\nMeanwhile, Caesar was doing no such thing. He knew exactly where the team stood and exactly what it had to do. The margin over Great Britain and Ukraine was large enough that the U.S. needed only to avoid mistakes.\n\n\"We started crunching the numbers, and we're like, 'Just stay on the horse,'\" Caesar said.\n\nNedoroscik did one better. He all but floated through his routine, reminding himself only to think about the next skill. And then, suddenly, there was no next skill. His teammates grabbed him and tossed him into the air. They draped themselves in the American flag and laughed and cried. Nedoroscik came to Paris for 38 seconds. The celebration will last much longer.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Risky Strategy, Fearless Execution Brings U.S. Men's Gymnastics Back to the Podium.", "source": {"uri": "bnd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belleville News-Democrat"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephanie_apstein@bnd.com", "name": "Stephanie Apstein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Juda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Juda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asher_Hong", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asher Hong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brody_Malone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brody Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syque_Caesar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Syque Caesar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rings (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horizontal bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julius Caesar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Rhythmic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Rhythmic", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Organizations", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/xsu98q/picture290555219/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/96b3b47d-6cf6-469c-8ebe-da374b7d1dc4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

It takes a certain type of single-mindedness to make the choices Nedoroscik has made for the last decade, when he essentially decided to dedicate himself to a single pursuit, focusing on an event that has long been a weakness for the U.S. men's national team program.\n\nYes, there is monotony involved. How could there not be?\n\n\"I don't know how I don't lose my mind,\" Nedoroscik said before the Games. \"But every day I go into the gym and there's still something to do. There's still something to improve.\"\n\nNot anymore.\n\nProving a point\n\nHe drilled his set during qualifying on Saturday to earn a spot on the event finals later in the Games. But Monday night, things were different. Teammates Frederick Richard, Brody Malone, Paul Juda and Asher Hong had put together 17 straight routines without a miss, putting the Americans in position to reach the medal stand for the first time since 2008 in Beijing.\n\nWhile Nedoroscik had some wiggle room -- the U.S. had a fairly healthy lead after Juda and Malone hit their sets before Nedoroscik saluted the judges -- he also didn't want to merely hold on. He wanted to prove a point.\n\nNot just to himself, but to those who wondered if he deserved to be there in the first place.\n\nWhat followed were 45 seconds of sublime brilliance, with Nedoroscik's hands traveling from one end of the horse to the other, his legs swooping this way, then that.\n\nA few feet away, his four teammates -- and the sizable contingent of US fans inside Bercy Arena -- roared as a medal that seemed distant for a program that had finished a distant fifth in each of its last three trips under the rings -- drew closer.\n\nBy the time Nedoroscik neared his dismount, he knew his job was complete. The celebration began before his feet even hit the mat.\n\nAll those years, all those reps, both physical and mental, all the difficult times when he wondered whether to keep going, all the quirks he's developed along the way -- from the non-prescription goggles he sometimes rocks to the chef's kiss to the camera he occasionally makes -- led up to that moment.\n\nAnd he did not miss, delivering \"the exclamation point\" with a 14.866 to finish off a performance the U.S. men's program hopes provides serious momentum heading into the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I kind of in that moment was like, 'All right, let's run it back and let's go out there and do our thing,'\" Nedoroscik said.\n\nFilling a critical gap\n\nA \"thing\" that has long been a sore spot for the U.S. in major international competition. The 2012 Olympic team topped qualifying. Then they led off on pommel horse in the finals and saw their medal hopes vanish one mistake at a time.\n\nNedoroscik understood the history. It's one of the reasons he gravitated toward pommels. Another is the fact that it requires many things -- stamina, strength and creativity chief among them -- that he has in spades, particularly that last one.\n\nHe describes himself as a \"late bloomer\" on the event. Those early struggles only helped him press forward.\n\n\"Running into trouble on the apparatus early on taught me how to fight, how to stay on, how to really go for that routine,\" he said. \"And I think that that has stuck with me throughout.\"\n\nUnlike other events, which are painstakingly laid out and practiced on end for months if not years, pommel horse allows gymnasts to color outside the lines and make things up as they go on. Miss an element here? Well, maybe you can make it up trying something else later in the routine.\n\nHe says the end result is the feeling of \"flying through the air,\" though it's more akin to levitation.\n\nMore work to be done\n\nNedoroscik will soar into the event finals Saturday with a chance to put another medal in his carry-on before he heads home. His 15.200 qualifying score tied Ireland's Rhys McClenaghan for the tops among the eight finalists.\n\nHe is ready to ride the wave as far as it will take him. Yet whatever happens on Saturday or for the rest of his life for that matter, it will be difficult to top Monday night, when the guy with the curly hair and the glasses that made him the kind of social media sensation only the Olympics provides struck a blow for his sport, his teammates and himself.\n\n\"I'm really proud of these guys,\" he said while sitting alongside the group that became U.S. men's gymnastics royalty. \"I love you boys.\"\n\nOlympic Games Paris 2024: Scenes from the opening ceremony\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

He did what he had come to Paris to do.\n\nThe internet also took notice of the gymnast from the state of Massachusetts.\n\nSoon, he was being referred to as Mr Pommel Horse. His girlfriend changed her profile on X, formerly Twitter, to \"Ms Pommel Horse\".\n\nFans also discovered one of his hobbies: solving Rubik's cubes. He finished one in less than 10 seconds the day of the competition.\n\nIn a interview on Tuesday, Mr Nedoroscik told NBC's The Today Show that solving the puzzle is \"stress relief\".\n\n\"I love to solve it - it's just fun,\" he said.\n\nSocial media users compared him to Clark Kent, Superman's alter-ego who wears glasses.\n\nMr Nedoroscik, waiting for his routine, sat on the sidelines in glasses, before taking them off to compete.\n\n\"Obsessed with this guy on the US men's gymnastics team,\" one user wrote in a viral post.\n\n\"He just sits there until he's activated like a sleeper agent, whips off his glasses like Clark Kent and does a pommel horse routine that helps deliver the team its first medal in 16 years.\"\n\nNBC's Olympics X account called him \"the Clark Kent of pommel horse\".\n\nMr Nedoroscik has strabismus, or crossed eyes, which can cause double vision.\n\nIn a 2022 post on TikTok, he showed his followers how his condition allows him to alternate which eye is the dominant eye.\n\nHe told The Today Show he thought the memes about him are \"awesome\" and represent \"the people that wear glasses well\".\n\nHe was asked how he was able to carry out Monday's routine without his glasses, though he has competed in prescription goggles in the past.\n\n\"It's not necessarily clear,\" he said of his vision.\n\n\"But the thing about pommel horse is if I keep [the glasses] on, they're going to fly somewhere.\".\n\nIn the end, he said, it's \"all about feeling the equipment\".\n\n\"I don't even really see when I'm doing my gymnastics.

Nedoroscik showed up to the Olympics looking less like an elite gymnast and more like a guy getting a PhD in astrophysics. He had one job, and he cheered for his teammates while waiting for his big moment. And then, in true hero fashion, he took of his thick, wide-rimmed glasses and performed superhuman feats on the pommel horse.\n\nBut that's not all. As writer Whitney Fleming pointed out, there's an important life lesson buried in Nedoroscik's story that shouldn't get lost in the celebration.\n\n\"Sometimes, the world needs a Simone Biles to blow us away with raw talent, and sometimes, we need someone like Stephen Nedoroscik to remind us that a nerdy (his words), bespectacled engineer who can solve a Rubik's Cube in under 10 seconds can be a hero,\" Fleming wrote on Facebook before sharing why she loves his story.\n\n\"When he didn't progress in gymnastics like he wanted to, he threw himself into the one event he excelled at: the pommel horse. He's won all sorts of competitions as an event specialist, and literally was put on the team because he scores so big on this one apparatus.\n\nDuring today's team finals, he spent the day bringing his teammates water, giving high fives, and cheering on every performance with incredible enthusiasm. And then it was his turn.\n\nNedoroscik was the last athlete to compete on the team's last rotation. He needed to hit his routine for the Americans to end a 16-year medal drought. No pressure.\n\nIt was a build-up right out of an iconic sports movie (Do you believe in miracles?)\n\nWhile the pressure kept building in the gym, he meditated. A slight smile crept onto his face when he heard the cheers for his teammate's score. And then, like Clark Kent turning into Superman, he took off his jacket, removed his glasses, and puffed out his chest--and HE KILLED IT!\"\n\nFleming shared the lesson we can all take from Nedoroscik's unusual success story:\n\n\"Nedoroscik took an untraditional path to get to the pinnacle of his sport and it paid off with an Olympic Bronze medal.\n\nThere is no one way to success, there is no one way to do this life, and there is no one way to find your purpose.\n\nBe unapologetically and unabashedly you in every way possible, and you might end up the hero of your story as well.\"\n\nThat's such an important lesson to share with our kids, who may look at big name athletes and start believing there are limited ways to find success. The reality is every story is unique, every person has their own way of doing things, and there's no \"right\" path to achieve your goals, whatever they may be.\n\nThank you, Stephen Nedoroscik, for being a delightful example and the hero we didn't know we needed.\n\nYou can follow Whitney Fleming on Facebook and Instagram, and find her upcoming book, \"You're Not a Failure: My Teen Doesn't Like Me Either,\" here.\n\n(And in case you missed Stephen Nedoroscik's team final pommel horse routine, here you go.)", "source": {"uri": "upworthy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Upworthy"},

That's largely due to the performances of two athletes from Massachusetts.\n\nThis is the first time since 2008 the men's team won a medal. Stoughton's Frederick Richard was a standout for the U.S. He earned the squad's top scores in the floor exercise (14.466), parallel bars (14.566) and the horizontal bar (14.833).\n\nWith the competition winding down, the hopes for a medal for the U.S. all came down to Worcester's Stephen Nedoroscik. Prior to the Olympics, he told NEPM, \"I never like to say that we're definitely going to medal. But I'll tell you what -- we have a very good chance of medaling.\"\n\nAnd he turned out to be right.\n\nNedoroscik turned in a clutch performance, scoring 14.866 -- which was tied for the second-best score registered by any athlete Monday in Paris in the pommel horse.\n\nNedoroscik is a former world champion in the event, but he missed out on making the U.S. team for the previous Olympics in Tokyo three years ago. He said before the games he tried to learn from that disappointment.\n\n\"I'm just so honored and proud to be representing Team USA. It is a dream come true, but I feel like these last three years have taught me so much about staying with the sport, staying motivated, and, you know, it's all worth it in the end,\" Nedoroscik said.\n\nIt is also the first Olympic appearance for Stoughton's Frederick, who has immerged as something of the face of the U.S. men's Olympic contingent.\n\nBy about a half point, Japan ended up winning the gold medal Monday, edging China, which picked up the silver.\n\nThere are still more opportunities for the U.S. men to earn medals in gymnastics.

The Massachusetts native now trains in Florida, and is a four-time U.S., two-time NCAA, and 2021 world champion on the event.\n\nPommel horse? What's that? That's the event in which gymnasts mount -- yes, mount -- what's called a horse that is 160-cm. long and 135-cm. wide with two handles on top. You grab the handles and swing your legs around in creative ways -- around, above, and next to the horse. You can even move from one end of the horse to the other -- a move that Nedoroscik does especially well.\n\nNedoroscik was put on the five-member U.S. Olympic team because he's so good on that event. His selection came as a surprise to many gymnastics fans, who questioned the sanity of USA Gymnastics in banking on a specialist who only competes on one of the six events in men's gymnastics. What if he makes a mistake? What if other gymnasts on the team get injured and you run out of alternates to replace them? A specialist, in the gymnastics world, is therefore a very risky thing to be.\n\nBut all the chatter didn't seem to bother the bespectacled Nedoroscik, who, as luck would have it, was scheduled to compete in the last of six rotations, and last in the lineup. That meant he waited for 2.5 hours before it was his turn to mount that pommel.\n\nWhat Nedoroscik did to while away the time is now stuff of internet legend. Snaps of him with his head back, eyes closed, and seemingly dozing have become a meme. But Nedoroscik was just in full preparation mode.\n\n\"I did my breathing exercises, and I could hear all the guys cheering for [teammates] Brody [Malone] and Paul [Juda], and I thought, 'Sounds like everything is going well,'\" he said. \"I knew at that moment that every guy hit every single routine. And I have this thing, if everybody hits [their routines] before me, then I never miss. So I thought 'let's go out there and do our thing.'\"\n\nAnd do his thing he did, swinging, and swinging, and swinging some more to put, as he called it, \"an exclamation point\" on the competition.\n\nIt will surprise absolutely no one that Nedoroscik, an electrical engineering graduate from Penn State, is highly superstitious. He used to wear goggles that were part of a competition superstition after a friend gifted them and he wore them as a prank -- but successfully completed a hard routine. He steers clear of songs that he's listened to before having a bad routine -- \"Thunder\" and \"Riptide\" are big ones (sorry, Imagine Dragons and Vance Joy). Since the 2021 world championships, however, he's been trying to rid himself of those rituals by indulging in them to \"break the curses.\"\n\nIronically, when it comes to his career, Nedoroscik has been more laissez-faire. He concentrated on pommel horse after 2014, when a coach who had trained the national pommel horse champion the previous year came to his club gym in Worcester and told him he could also be a national champion one day.\n\n\"I figured, this guy has seen a national champion so he must see something in me,\" Nedoroscik said. \"That year I won my first ever junior national title. I had no idea how gymnastics worked and didn't even know that college was a thing for gymnasts. So I started talking to coaches and ended up at Penn State. I didn't know how to get on the national team, but won the Winter Cup one year and then made the national team. I thought, 'dude [being a specialist] is awesome'!\"\n\nIt's taken him from recreational gymnast to national and world champion to, now, an Olympic medalist.

U-S-A! U-S-A!\n\nBut what makes that historic moment even more amazing is the fact that two of the members marked the first earned medals for New Englanders in the 2024 Paris Olympics: Stephen Nedoroscik of Worcester, Massachusetts, and Frederick Richard of Stoughton, Massachusetts.\n\nTheir win with their teammates Paul Juda, Brody Malone and Asher Hong is a testament to their dedication, perseverance, and exceptional skill.\n\nNo surprise that USA Gymnastics would give them a shout out on X either.\n\nAnd did you know that, according to NBC, Nedoroscik \"qualified for the Olympic team solely on the strength of his pommel horse routine\"?\n\nYou can watch his incredible routine that helped win the bronze medal here.\n\nThe 25-year-old Massachusetts native said after his routine, according to PEOPLE, \"It was just the greatest moment of my life, I think. [I'm] so happy to have been there.\"\n\nAnd Nedoroscik certainly has become a fan favorite and the face of a bunch of memes comparing him to Clark Kent thanks to his glasses. If you've been following the games, you've probably seen some of them.\n\nThe other Massachusetts native making a name for himself, 20-year-old Richard, according to USA TODAY, \"delivered team-best performances in the floor, parallel bars and horizontal bar,\" which helped the USA to its bronze win.\n\nAdditionally, Boston.com stated that he is the youngest male American gymnast to win an individual all-around medal at the 2023 World Artistic Gymnastics Championship.\n\nHow amazing is that?\n\nTheir hard work paid off on the world's biggest stage, likely inspiring future generations of athletes from New England and beyond, but it's only the beginning.\n\n\"We're told all our lives the American dream, you have a dream and you give everything every day towards it and eventually it comes true,\" Richard said, according to USA Today. \"And we all are always waiting to see if that's really true, but I'm standing here with a medal around my neck after going to the gym every day, hours and hours and giving everything. It's like the universe paid you back, so I'm living the American dream. That's what it feels like.\"\n\nBut don't worry, those two aren't done for the games quite yet.

Japan and China are the heavy favorites to battle for gold, but there are a handful of teams that can challenge for a spot on the medal podium alongside them.\n\nThe United States and Great Britain are among these teams.\n\nAfter the first subdivision of the qualifying round, Great Britain (256.561) was ahead of the United States (253.229), with Canada finishing third (247.794) and Germany finishing fourth (245.395).\n\nGreat Britain's Jake Jarman leads the all-around (84.897), but the story of the day may be 2023 world all-around bronze medalist Frederick Richard and 2022 NCAA all-around champion Paul Juda (82.865), who advanced to the all-around final and knocked off three-time national all-around champion Brody Malone.\n\nMalone fell on the pommel horse in the first rotation and had two falls on the high bar, ending his chances before the competition even ended. As a result, Malone will also miss the high bar final, an event on which he is the world champion as of 2022.\n\nConsidering Malone's performance in training, high performance director Brett McClure said his performance today had come as a surprise.\n\n\"He didn't have a good day,\" McClure said. \"I hope he can recover and refocus for the team final.\"\n\nHeading into the competition, Malone and Richard were favored to qualify as the top all-around gymnasts. However, Judah was undeniable today, displaying confidence and precision on every event to advance to his first all-around grand final in his Olympic debut.\n\nJudah performed well under pressure and was the United States' best player for most of the competition.\n\n\"A few months ago or maybe even a few years ago, I don't think I would have been able to do this,\" Judah said after the competition. \"I've worked really hard on the sports psychology side of things, my mental health, my athletic performance, etc. and it was those rehearsals that really allowed me to do what I did today. Over the last couple of weeks, I felt like I could be first on a few events and probably on pommel horse. As most gymnasts know, it's one of the toughest events to compete in, but I knew if I was put first, I would earn it myself... and I was ready for it.\"\n\nGreat Britain took the lead over the United States early on with a 44.299 on vault, thanks to two huge vaults from Harry Hepworth and Jarman, the 2023 world vault champion. Both gymnasts landed two vaults, hoping to secure a spot in the apparatus final. Hepworth posted the highest average on vault with a 14.766, but Jarman wasn't too far behind with a 14.699.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States got off to a good start (42.433) on pommel horse, an event that has historically been one of the team's weakest.\n\nJudah opened the competition by performing clean circles and giving the U.S. team the lead. The routine was so good that Judah couldn't help but let out a victory cry after nailing his dismount, enjoying every moment of his first routine on the Olympic stage. Richard followed with a solid routine, but the U.S. ran into trouble in third place when Malone fell midway through his pommel horse routine, scoring just 12.100.\n\nAfter a long wait to hear Malones' score, 2021 pommel horse world champion Stephen Nedoroscik rounded out the rotation with a superb routine, doing exactly what he came to Paris to do. Nedoroscik hasn't always performed at his highest level of difficulty in competition this year, but delivered a 6.4 difficulty routine to set the benchmark for qualifying for the event with a massive 15.200.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karl Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horizontal bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Juda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Juda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Jarman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake Jarman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brody_Malone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brody Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_artistic_individual_all-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's artistic individual all-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_McClure", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brett McClure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_artistic_team_all-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's artistic team all-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Vaulting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Vaulting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://images.nbcolympics.com/sites/default/files/2024-07/1920x1080_Frederick-Richard_GettyImages-2163519932.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

But they became tangible at Stanford, Michigan and Penn State.\n\nSo when it was time for those dreams to become fully, vividly realized inside a raucous Bercy Arena on Monday night, they leaned on the experiences they gained during all those meets in all those sometimes sparsely filled gyms that taught them about pressure and teamwork and belief.\n\nYes, the bronze medal the Americans so emphatically earned ended a 16-year drought on the sport's biggest stage.\n\nYet it was also a message to athletic directors at the dozen schools that still have Division I gymnastics -- and to be honest, to the ones that don't, too -- that the sport is worth saving.\n\n\"If you want to keep seeing USA Gymnastics and Team USA on a gymnastics podium, at least on the men's side, you're going to have to give us more opportunities to compete in college,\" said Juda, who is in graduate school at Michigan.\n\n\"My goal even here was to make a statement that the U.S. is getting stronger and stronger and we're only (going up),\" Richard said. \"And I think we did that today. I think a lot of young boys watching are inspired by us.\"\n\nThat's the way it was for Richard as a kid in the Boston suburbs. There were pictures on the wall at the gym of the medal-winning 2004 and 2008 U.S. men's Olympic teams. Richard would stare at the pictures and wonder how those teams put all the pieces together.\n\n\"It looks like they all came together on the same day and just did like these perfect routines,\" Richard said. \"And you're like, how is that possible?\"\n\nRichard found out firsthand.\n\nThe Americans didn't record a major fall during any of their 18 routines in the final and finished closer to second-place China than fourth-place Britain. They leaned into the energy from a vocal contingent of U.S. fans that offered a hint of what it might look like in Los Angeles four years from now.\n\nMostly, however, they leaned on each other and their experiences to shake off an iffy qualifying session on Saturday in which they finished a sloppy fifth.\n\n\"We just told each other we were gonna treat it like an NCAA championships because we've all been there,\" Malone said. \"And it's high pressure competing for a team. And it's no different this competition. I mean yeah, this one's a little bit different, a little bit bigger. But same concept.\"\n\nWith perhaps a much more impactful result.\n\nNedoroscik is 26. Malone is 24. Juda is 23. Hong and Richard are 20. There is a feeling of real momentum within the U.S. men's program for the first time in a while. Yet to keep it going, the pipeline behind them needs to keep churning.\n\nThere was a sense in the 2010s that the U.S. had grown stale in part because those at the core group at the top grew a little too comfortable due in part to a lack of competition from those trying to catch them.\n\nSam Mikulak went to three Olympics with teams that had considerable talent. He never came home with a medal, though on Monday night he was chatting with Nedoroscik as he prepared for his pommel horse set that served as the exclamation point.\n\nWhile they talked, Mikulak told Nedoroscik to stay calm, that 80 percent of his best would be good enough. To soak in a moment Mikulak dreamed of but never quite grasped.\n\nAnd when Nedoroscik gracefully swooped from one end of the horse to the other, his hands working dutifully in tandem on an event that has given the Americans fits for years, the bronze that felt in some ways like gold was won.\n\nStanding there in the aftermath, Mikulak couldn't help but speculate about what might lie ahead.\n\n\"I think the guys are going to be hungry for more,\" he said. \"And hopefully this spurs men's gymnastics in the US like never before.\"", "source": {"uri": "wdef.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News

They hope the NCAA will take notice - ExBulletin", "body": "PARIS (AP) -- Before they found themselves together, arms crossed, in a brotherhood forever etched in American Olympic legend, Brody Malone, Frederick Richard, Asher Hong, Paul Juda and Stephen Nedoroscik were middle schoolers.\n\nSure, the childhood dreams the members of the U.S. men's gymnastics team have had began in small gyms scattered across the country. But they've become tangible at Stanford, Michigan and Penn State.\n\nSo when it came time to fully and vividly realize those dreams in a noisy Bercy Arena on Monday night, they drew on the experiences they gained from all those encounters in all those sometimes sparsely-filled gyms that taught them about pressure, teamwork and confidence.\n\nYes, the bronze medal won with such brilliance by the Americans put an end to 16 years of drought on the biggest sporting stage.\n\nBut it was also a message to the athletic directors at the dozen schools that still have Division I gymnastics classes, and, to be fair, to those that don't, that the sport is worth saving.\n\nIf you want to continue to see USA Gymnastics and Team USA on the podium in gymnastics, at least on the men's side, you're going to have to give us more opportunities to compete in college, said Juda, who is a graduate student at Michigan.\n\nOpportunities that are likely to disappear quickly due to a changing college sports landscape. It's a reality the five men standing on the podium with their arms around each other are all too aware of.\n\nRichard, a rising junior at Michigan, is on a mission to introduce more people to a side of the sport that, at least in the United States, has long been pursued anonymously.\n\nAnd while he's carved out a growing niche on social media, Richard is savvy enough to understand that the only thing guaranteed to draw people to men's gymnastics isn't a viral video, but hardware like the medal he kept grabbing in the aftermath.\n\nMy goal here was to show that the United States is getting stronger and stronger and we're just going from strength to strength, Richard said. And I think we did that today. I think a lot of young guys that are watching are inspired by us.\n\nThat's how Richard lived as a kid growing up in suburban Boston. On the gym walls were pictures of the 2004 and 2008 U.S. men's Olympic medal-winning teams. Richard would look at the pictures and wonder how those teams put all the pieces together.\n\n\"It seems like they all got together on the same day and did like perfect routines,\" Richard said. And you wonder how that's possible?\n\nRichard discovered it with his own eyes.\n\nThe Americans didn't have a major fall in their 18 routines in the final and finished closer to second-place China than fourth-place Great Britain. They were buoyed by the energy of a contingent of American fans who gave a glimpse of what the competition might look like in Los Angeles four years from now.\n\nBut they relied on each other and their experiences to recover from a difficult qualifying session on Saturday, in which they finished a poor fifth.\n\n\"We figured we'd treat this like an NCAA championship because we've all been there,\" Malone said. \"And it's a lot of pressure to compete for a team. And this competition is no different. I mean, yeah, this one is a little different, a little bigger. But the concept is the same.\"\n\nWith perhaps a much more impactful result.\n\nNedoroscik is 26, Malone is 24, Judah is 23, Hong and Richard are 20. For the first time in a long time, there is a real sense of momentum within the U.S. men's program. But for that to continue, the pipeline that supports them needs to keep churning.\n\nBy the 2010s, there was a sense that the United States had become obsolete, partly because those at the top of the core group had become a little too comfortable, partly because of the lack of competition from those trying to catch up.\n\nSam Mikulak has competed in three Olympics with teams that featured considerable talent. He has never gone home with a medal, though Monday night he was chatting with Nedoroscik as he prepared for his pommel horse that served as an exclamation point.\n\nAs they talked, Mikulak told Nedoroscik to stay calm, that 80 percent of his effort would be enough. To enjoy a moment Mikulak had dreamed of but never quite grasped.\n\nAnd when Nedoroscik gracefully glided from one end of the horse to the other, his hands working dutifully in tandem on an event that has given Americans fits for years, the bronze that somehow felt like gold was won.\n\nStanding there after the events, Mikulak couldn't help but speculate about what might happen.\n\n\"I think the guys are going to want more,\" he said. \"And hopefully it'll boost men's gymnastics in the United States like never before.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Summer Olympics:

After finishing fifth in the team event at the last three Olympic Games, it was time for a change. This time the team had its sights set on a medal -- something they hadn't achieved since the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.\n\nOn July 29, the U.S. men's team of Asher Hong, Paul Juda, Brody Malone, Stephen Nedoroscik, and Frederick Richard got it done and earned bronze behind Japan and China.\n\n\"We ended the medal drought that was 16 years in the making and I couldn't be happier for everybody,\" said Paul Juda, a University of Michigan gymnast.\n\nGetting to the podium wasn't just a matter of hitting every routine. The work began after the Tokyo Games, with some very deliberate strategizing. Under the current scoring system, athletes don't start with the same score, such as a 10.0, but instead have varying start values, depending on the difficulty of the elements they perform in their routines. Those scores are added to a score that encapsulates how well they perform those skills for the total score. So the more difficult the routines are, the more likely gymnasts are to earn higher scores overall.\n\nRead More: 'There's Actually Something Wrong.' Jade Carey Explains Why She Fell During Her Floor Routine\n\nUSA Gymnastics men's high-performance director Brett McClure knew that the U.S.'s difficulty scores, or start values, put them out of medal contention before they even hit the mats. No amount of perfect performances could change that. So he and his team focused heavily on incorporating more challenging skills in the gymnasts' routines.\n\nAt the U.S. Olympic trials in June to determine the team for Paris, McClure rattled off the average difficulty of each of the top teams and calculated what the U.S. would need to make the podium -- namely, outscoring squads such as Great Britain and Ukraine that have consistently surpassed the U.S. at recent world and Olympic events. In Tokyo, McClure said, the U.S. lagged about six points behind the bronze-medal finishers in difficulty scores, but by last year's world championships, that gap had narrowed to about two points -- easily bridged with stronger execution scores. \"Japan's difficulty right now is around 110, and China 108. Our difficulty scores are about 106 and Ukraine is 104 and Great Britain around 102. So we're great considering where we were in Tokyo, when we were already six points behind. We're in a much different position now.\"\n\nIndeed they were. Shaky performances during the qualification round in Paris, however, put the U.S. men back in their familiar position -- fifth -- coming into the team event. But in the team competition, qualification scores are scratched and scoring starts anew.\n\n\"You take it, you seize the moment,\" said Richard, Juda's teammate at Michigan. \"After day one [qualification], I was the one who was saying, 'It's all part of the process, trust in the end goal.' You don't have to win every single competition; you have to win the ones that matter. I knew that the day-one goal was to qualify and get the nerves out. Going into day two, we needed to capitalize on all the hard work we've done and it showed. We didn't wait to become the medalists. We decided we were going to do it. And every routine, we gave everything.\"\n\nThat included Nedoroscik, who was controversially the only specialist on the team, selected for his high scoring ability on pommel horse. He competed only on pommel horse, and none of the other five events, and the competition order put the U.S. on pommel horse in the last of six rotations, with Nedoroscik the last U.S. gymnast to compete, meaning he waited two and a half hours before he was called up. When he was, he electrified the crowd with his impressive and smooth swings and helped the U.S. clinch the bronze. But until then, his meditating and visualization techniques inspired the internet, turning him into a social media sensation as everyone speculated about how he managed to make the trip to Paris to perform on one event and one event only, and how he was occupying himself while waiting his turn.\n\nRead More: All About Jordan Chiles' Beyonce-Inspired Routine\n\nRichard had not only his family from Stoughton, Mass. in Bercy Arena, but his first coach Tom Fontecchio, who saw potential in young Richard when he followed his older sister to Fontecchio's gym in Massachusetts. The two remained close even after Richard left for college, and Fontecchio still watches every one of his former student's meets and regularly texts him with words of encouragement. \"He did a fantastic job,\" Fontecchio told TIME. \"In junior high, he had a goal listed in superlatives, and his superlative was, 'I want to be an Olympian.' He already knew that was going to be his goal and he just kept going with it.\"\n\nThe U.S. got off to a strong start on the rings, with Richard, the current world all-around bronze medalist, breaking the ice with a solid routine that set the stage for Malone, the national champion, and Hong, six-time NCAA champion who, along with Richard, was part of the U.S. bronze-medal-winning team at world championships in 2023.\n\nDuring Olympic trials, McClure's priority was to find the combination of athletes whose scores, when combined, would give the U.S. the highest number of starting value points when the team competed in Paris. \"The plan worked,\" Jordan Gaarenstroom, one of Juda's and Richard's coaches at Michigan, told TIME. \"It worked exactly how it should have worked. It was great to watch it.\"\n\nUnder the Olympic format, three athletes compete on six apparatus and all three scores count (unlike during the qualification, in which four gymnasts compete on each event and the top three scores are used). Richard competed in five of the six events, as did Malone. Malone was more consistent than he was during the qualification round, in which he made mistakes on the high bar, floor, and pommel horse.\n\n\"It's about having a short memory and putting it behind me,\" Malone said. \"Once it's done and over with, it's done and over with. I just had to reset my mind and get ready for the next competition, and that's what I did.\"\n\n\"Every single routine just kept getting better and better,\" McClure said of the 18 solid performances the gymnasts executed. Juda said the team agreed ahead of time not to look at the scoreboard, which kept track of where they stood after each rotation. Whenever the placements were announced in the arena, \"We joked, 'We don't want to know what place we are - stop telling us,'\" he said. \"It wasn't a matter of knowing, but a matter of feeling [that we would earn a medal].\"\n\nPreparing the men included ensuring that they conserved their strength and energy for the multiple days of performance ahead. For Richard, who was expecting to compete in the all-around event, that meant building up gradually, especially in the high-bar event, one of his strengths. His routine in qualification was less difficult than the one he performed in the team competition. \"This is a marathon, from two weeks ago when we got [to France], to training camp and then you come to Paris,\" said Gaarenstroom. \"And every day they are reminded they are Olympians. So it's high and low and high and low -- you've got to keep their energy in check so you just make small changes to give them a little less pressure.\"\n\nBut Richard's score in the qualification round, which determines who competes in the event finals, wasn't high enough to qualify him for the high-bar final, after judges scored his routine lower than he and his coaches expected, so he knew he would get only one shot to do the more challenging routine. \"I knew this would be my high-bar final,\" he said of the team event. \"It's the routine I train every single day in the gym, and I'm one of the best high-bar gymnasts in the world, so I wanted to show that today, to my brothers and to my country, and that's what I did.\"\n\nRichard and Juda will be competing in the all-around competition on July 31. Juda jokes that Richard is always looking ahead and striving for more, saying there is always something \"cooler\" to be experienced, or accomplished. That will certainly be the case in Paris now that the team medal is around their necks. And it's clear where that ambition comes from. When TIME asked Richard's father Carl what he would say to his son, now an Olympic medalist, he said, \"We love you and you're the best. And you have one more achievement [left] here; bring another medal.\" An Olympian's job, it seems, is never done.\n\nThe gymnasts hope that the medal will reignite interest in men's gymnastics in the U.S., at a time when many colleges are shutting down their programs and limiting funding for the sport. \"Every single one of us came from an NCAA program,\" Juda said. \"If you want to keep seeing USA Gymnastics on the podium on the men's side, you have to give us more opportunities to compete in college.\"\n\nMcClure, for his part, is already looking ahead to 2028, when the Olympics will be held in Los Angeles. \"We are trending in the right direction,\" he said. \"Obviously Japan and China are still in another category. But if we want to get better and push for first place in L.A., then this [bronze] is going to be extremely motivating.\"", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"},

At one point in time, his chances of making it to Paris seemed uncertain. Now he will be leaving Paris - with his team - as an Olympic medalist.\n\nHong's spot on the team seemed uncertain at one point too, after finishing tenth all-around at the national championships, where the results were pivotal for selection. Nevertheless, he was resolute in not letting a disappointing performance derail his dream.\n\n\"I just put in the work after champs,\" Hong said. \"I just wanted to make the team really bad and show that I was the man for the job and that I could (deliver) clutch performances, and I did at trials. I just trusted the training leading up to this competition. I think the doubt fueled my training to get to this point.\"\n\nNedoroscik has had his ups and downs as well - dealing with wrist injuries along with the disappointment of not making the Tokyo Olympic team in 2021.\n\nAs a pommel horse event specialist, Nedoroscik has spent the past three years perfecting his craft to be prepared for just one 40-second routine if called upon. Along the way, he has become a world champion and a four-time national champion on the event.\n\nWhen the team arrived at the competition hall ahead of the final, Nedoroscik's first move was busting out the Rubik's cube - which he solved in 9.3 seconds (falling short of his fastest time of 8.6 seconds) - before getting a quick stretch in with the team. Then came the long wait - over two hours - for his moment to shine.\n\nIt was no problem for Nedoroscik, who watched his teammates drill routine after routine. \"How could you go crazy (sitting around) when all your boys are hitting routines and sticking vaults?\" Nedoroscik said.\n\nThe team competed with a calm, confidence - staying in their \"bubble\" to avoid seeing how other teams were doing. After each rotation, Nedoroscik and Richard intentionally covered their ears and yelled at each other so they wouldn't hear the scores being announced in the arena.\n\nThe mindset coming into the competition was to treat the Games as if it was an NCAA Championship - a familiar environment for all five team members. Malone and Nedoroscik are graduates of Stanford and Penn State, while Hong currently reps Stanford. Juda and Richard compete for the University of Michigan.\n\n\"We've all been through the NCAA program, and we've all competed at the NCAA championships, so we just went out there and treated it like that,\" Malone said. \"We were competing for the team; competing for each other, and it made it a little bit easier.\"\n\nDuring the fourth rotation, Nedoroscik headed to the training gym to get warmed up. He knew exactly what he needed to do in the sixth and final rotation as the very last gymnast for Team USA.\n\n\"The whole time I was just thinking about the competition and when it was going to be my turn,\" Nedoroscik. \"I planned days ahead what it was going to look like, so I just followed that plan to a tee, and it worked out very well.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcolympics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "nbcolympics.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karl Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Olympic_broadcasts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Olympic broadcasts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rubik's Cube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Cardinal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanford Cardinal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/College_and_University", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/College and University", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rope_Skipping/Clubs_and_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rope Skipping/Clubs and Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://images.nbcolympics.com/sites/default/files/2023-03/ParisDefaultThumbnail.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

It takes a certain type of single-mindedness to make the choices Nedoroscik has made for the last decade, when he essentially decided to dedicate himself to a single pursuit, focusing on an event that has long been a weakness for the U.S. men's national team program.\n\nYes, there is monotony involved. How could there not be?\n\n\"I don't know how I don't lose my mind,\" Nedoroscik said before the Games. \"But every day I go into the gym and there's still something to do. There's still something to improve.\"\n\nNot anymore.\n\nProving a point\n\nHe drilled his set during qualifying on Saturday to earn a spot on the event finals later in the Games. But Monday night, things were different. Teammates Frederick Richard, Brody Malone, Paul Juda and Asher Hong had put together 17 straight routines without a miss, putting the Americans in position to reach the medal stand for the first time since 2008 in Beijing.\n\nWhile Nedoroscik had some wiggle room -- the U.S. had a fairly healthy lead after Juda and Malone hit their sets before Nedoroscik saluted the judges -- he also didn't want to merely hold on. He wanted to prove a point.\n\nNot just to himself, but to those who wondered if he deserved to be there in the first place.\n\nWhat followed were 45 seconds of sublime brilliance, with Nedoroscik's hands traveling from one end of the horse to the other, his legs swooping this way, then that.\n\nA few feet away, his four teammates -- and the sizable contingent of US fans inside Bercy Arena -- roared as a medal that seemed distant for a program that had finished a distant fifth in each of its last three trips under the rings -- drew closer.\n\nBy the time Nedoroscik neared his dismount, he knew his job was complete. The celebration began before his feet even hit the mat.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAll those years, all those reps, both physical and mental, all the difficult times when he wondered whether to keep going, all the quirks he's developed along the way -- from the non-prescription goggles he sometimes rocks to the chef's kiss to the camera he occasionally makes -- led up to that moment.\n\nAnd he did not miss, delivering \"the exclamation point\" with a 14.866 to finish off a performance the U.S. men's program hopes provides serious momentum heading into the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I kind of in that moment was like, 'All right, let's run it back and let's go out there and do our thing,'\" Nedoroscik said.\n\nFilling a critical gap\n\nA \"thing\" that has long been a sore spot for the U.S. in major international competition. The 2012 Olympic team topped qualifying. Then they led off on pommel horse in the finals and saw their medal hopes vanish one mistake at a time.\n\nNedoroscik understood the history. It's one of the reasons he gravitated toward pommels. Another is the fact that it requires many things -- stamina, strength and creativity chief among them -- that he has in spades, particularly that last one.\n\nHe describes himself as a \"late bloomer\" on the event. Those early struggles only helped him press forward.\n\n\"Running into trouble on the apparatus early on taught me how to fight, how to stay on, how to really go for that routine,\" he said. \"And I think that that has stuck with me throughout.\"\n\nUnlike other events, which are painstakingly laid out and practiced on end for months if not years, pommel horse allows gymnasts to color outside the lines and make things up as they go on. Miss an element here? Well, maybe you can make it up trying something else later in the routine.\n\nHe says the end result is the feeling of \"flying through the air,\" though it's more akin to levitation.\n\nMore work to be done\n\nNedoroscik will soar into the event finals Saturday with a chance to put another medal in his carry-on before he heads home. His 15.200 qualifying score tied Ireland's Rhys McClenaghan for the tops among the eight finalists.\n\nHe is ready to ride the wave as far as it will take him. Yet whatever happens on Saturday or for the rest of his life for that matter, it will be difficult to top Monday night, when the guy with the curly hair and the glasses that made him the kind of social media sensation only the Olympics provides struck a blow for his sport, his teammates and himself.\n\n\"I'm really proud of these guys,\" he said while sitting alongside the group that became U.S. men's gymnastics royalty. \"I love you boys.\"\n\nOlympic Games Paris 2024: Scenes from the opening ceremony\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

China, seeking its fourth Olympic team title, posted a team total of 263.028. Japan, a seven-time Olympic champion, finished second at 260.594.\n\nThe five-man Chinese team, missing veteran Sun Wei after he was injured during training Thursday, used a series of spectacular routines on rings and parallel bars to stamp itself as the favorite heading into Monday's final.\n\nJapan, the reigning world champion, dealt with a couple of uncharacteristic mistakes by current world and Olympic gold medalist Daiki Hashimoto but still finished well clear of third-place Britain.\n\nWhile the 22-year-old Hashimoto will get a chance to defend his title in the all-around, he won't on high bar -- his signature event -- after stumbling during his dismount. Hashimoto appeared to be dealing with right shoulder discomfort for much of the afternoon and was tended to by a Team Japan trainer shortly after finishing up on still rings though he said afterward he was not hurt.\n\nHashimoto is currently third in the all-around through two subdivisions at 85.064, behind teammate Shinnousuke Oka (86.865) and China's Zhang Boheng (88.597).\n\nThe scores will reset for the team finals, though the only real question is who will join China and Japan on the podium with defending champion Russia ineligible due to the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe Japanese settled for silver at home in Tokyo in 2021, losing to the Russians by just over a tenth of a point in a close final while China took bronze a little further back.\n\n\"It was frustrating,\" Japan's Kazuma Kaya said. \"But we kept practicing every day for success today. Next time, in (the team final), I want the gold medal.\"\n\nThe gold isn't the only medal in question. Bronze is a toss-up, too, though Britain made a strong case by topping the first subdivision, a group that included the U.S. Ukraine overcame a nightmarish set on high bar to slip past the U.S. and into fourth at 253.893, dropping the Americans into fifth at 253.229.\n\nItaly, Switzerland and Canada also advanced to the finals, with the Canadians claiming the eighth and final spot by less than a quarter of a point over Turkey.\n\nThe British insist they don't have any sort of rivalry with the U.S., even if the two programs have spent the better part of a decade jockeying for position at nearly every major international event.\n\nBritain sent a very real if unspoken message: it is more than capable of grabbing a bronze to go with the one it somewhat unexpectedly won in London a dozen years ago.\n\nJake Jarman's 84.897 all-around total was just ahead of teammate Joe Fraser while Max Whitlock -- in his fourth and final Games -- fought off the jitters he knew would come to score a 15.133 on pommel horse and give Britain plenty of momentum.\n\n\"A lot of people have asked me that question in terms of 'How's it feel to be above the U.S.?' \" Whitlock said. \"To be honest, you take it with a pinch of salt. I think it's really important to kind of just think about our job.\"\n\nRussia's absence creates a medal opportunity for the U.S., Britain and Ukraine behind another duel between China and Japan for gold. Still, Whitlock downplayed the idea that if Russia was involved, a team medal for anyone outside the sport's Big Three would be out of the question.\n\n\"If they were in, you'd like to think that they'd be up near the top,\" Whitlock said. \"So with them not, of course, there's a little bit of (a better opportunity to medal), but only a little bit.\"\n\nThe American men -- hoping to repeat the bronze they won at the world championships last fall -- weren't nearly as sharp in front of an audience that included U.S. First Lady Jill Biden, who clapped along with American star Frederick Richard's floor routine and posed for pictures with a somewhat subdued team afterward.\n\nWhile Richard called the experience \"pretty sick,\" he regretted not being able to show Biden a \"cooler\" routine after he scored a 13.833, a bit below what he knows he'll need to medal in the all-around finals next week.\n\nRichard wasn't the only one. The U.S. arrived in Paris hoping to earn a team medal at the Olympics for the first time since a bronze in Beijing 16 years ago. While that certainly remains on the table, Richard & Co. will need to be significantly better going forward after pommel horse specialist Stephen Nedoroscik became the only American to make an apparatus final.\n\nBrody Malone, who returned from a catastrophic leg injury in March 2023 to win the U.S. Championships in early June and make his second Olympic team, fell once on pommel horse and twice on high bar.\n\nHis second miscue on high bar -- a high-risk, high-reward event in which Malone won gold at the 2022 world championships -- forced the Americans to use Asher Hong's 12.600, one of the reasons the U.S. ended up 3.322 behind Britain.\n\n\"It was definitely not perfect,\" U.S. high-performance director Brett McClure said. \"And it was a few too many mistakes. I feel leading into team finals we need to clean some things up.\"\n\nMax Whitlock, of Great Britain, performs on the pommel horse during a men's artistic gymnastics qualification round at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Saturday, July 27, 2024, in Paris, France.

But they became tangible at Stanford, Michigan and Penn State.\n\nSo when it was time for those dreams to become fully, vividly realized inside a raucous Bercy Arena on Monday night, they leaned on the experiences they gained during all those meets in all those sometimes sparsely filled gyms that taught them about pressure and teamwork and belief.\n\nYes, the bronze medal the Americans so emphatically earned ended a 16-year drought on the sport's biggest stage.\n\nYet it was also a message to athletic directors at the dozen schools that still have Division I gymnastics -- and to be honest, to the ones that don't, too -- that the sport is worth saving.\n\n\"If you want to keep seeing USA Gymnastics and Team USA on a gymnastics podium, at least on the men's side, you're going to have to give us more opportunities to compete in college,\" said Juda, who is in graduate school at Michigan.\n\nOpportunities that are in danger of vanishing quickly thanks to a rapidly evolving college sports landscape. It's a reality the five men who stood on the podium with their arms around each other are only too aware of.\n\nRichard, a rising junior at Michigan, has made it his life's mission to bring more people to a side of the sport that -- at least in the U.S. anyway -- has long plugged along anonymously.\n\nAnd while he's carved out a rapidly expanding niche on social media, Richard is savvy enough to understand the one thing guaranteed to attract people to men's gymnastics isn't a viral video, but hardware like the medal he kept grabbing in the giddy aftermath.\n\n\"My goal even here was to make a statement that the U.S. is getting stronger and stronger and we're only (going up),\" Richard said. \"And I think we did that today. I think a lot of young boys watching are inspired by us.\"\n\nThat's the way it was for Richard as a kid in the Boston suburbs. There were pictures on the wall at the gym of the medal-winning 2004 and 2008 U.S. men's Olympic teams. Richard would stare at the pictures and wonder how those teams put all the pieces together.\n\n\"It looks like they all came together on the same day and just did like these perfect routines,\" Richard said. \"And you're like, how is that possible?\"\n\nRichard found out firsthand.\n\nThe Americans didn't record a major fall during any of their 18 routines in the final and finished closer to second-place China than fourth-place Britain. They leaned into the energy from a vocal contingent of U.S. fans that offered a hint of what it might look like in Los Angeles four years from now.\n\nMostly, however, they leaned on each other and their experiences to shake off an iffy qualifying session on Saturday in which they finished a sloppy fifth.\n\n\"We just told each other we were gonna treat it like an NCAA championships because we've all been there,\" Malone said. \"And it's high pressure competing for a team. And it's no different this competition. I mean yeah, this one's a little bit different, a little bit bigger. But same concept.\"\n\nWith perhaps a much more impactful result.\n\nNedoroscik is 26. Malone is 24. Juda is 23. Hong and Richard are 20. There is a feeling of real momentum within the U.S. men's program for the first time in a while. Yet to keep it going, the pipeline behind them needs to keep churning.\n\nThere was a sense in the 2010s that the U.S. had grown stale in part because those at the core group at the top grew a little too comfortable due in part to a lack of competition from those trying to catch them.\n\nSam Mikulak went to three Olympics with teams that had considerable talent. He never came home with a medal, though on Monday night he was chatting with Nedoroscik as he prepared for his pommel horse set that served as the exclamation point.\n\nWhile they talked, Mikulak told Nedoroscik to stay calm, that 80 percent of his best would be good enough. To soak in a moment Mikulak dreamed of but never quite grasped.\n\nAnd when Nedoroscik gracefully swooped from one end of the horse to the other, his hands working dutifully in tandem on an event that has given the Americans fits for years, the bronze that felt in some ways like gold was won.\n\nStanding there in the aftermath, Mikulak couldn't help but speculate about what might lie ahead.\n\n\"I think the guys are going to be hungry for more,\" he said. \"And hopefully this spurs men's gymnastics in the US like never before.\"", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Joe sets give estate shoppers chance to live out their 'man-childhood'\n\nThat usually isn't a problem for the 25-year-old from Worcester, Massachusetts. It takes a certain type of single-mindedness to make the choices Nedoroscik has made for the last decade, when he essentially decided to dedicate himself to a single pursuit, focusing on an event that has long been a weakness for the U.S. men's national team program.\n\nYes, there is monotony involved. How could there not be?\n\n\"I don't know how I don't lose my mind,\" Nedoroscik said before the Games. \"But every day I go into the gym and there's still something to do. There's still something to improve.\"\n\nNot anymore.\n\nProving a point\n\nHe drilled his set during qualifying on Saturday to earn a spot on the event finals later in the Games. But Monday night, things were different. Teammates Frederick Richard, Brody Malone, Paul Juda and Asher Hong had put together 17 straight routines without a miss, putting the Americans in position to reach the medal stand for the first time since 2008 in Beijing.\n\nWhile Nedoroscik had some wiggle room -- the U.S. had a fairly healthy lead after Juda and Malone hit their sets before Nedoroscik saluted the judges -- he also didn't want to merely hold on. He wanted to prove a point.\n\nNot just to himself, but to those who wondered if he deserved to be there in the first place.\n\nWhat followed were 45 seconds of sublime brilliance, with Nedoroscik's hands traveling from one end of the horse to the other, his legs swooping this way, then that.\n\nA few feet away, his four teammates -- and the sizable contingent of US fans inside Bercy Arena -- roared as a medal that seemed distant for a program that had finished a distant fifth in each of its last three trips under the rings -- drew closer.\n\nBy the time Nedoroscik neared his dismount, he knew his job was complete. The celebration began before his feet even hit the mat.\n\nAll those years, all those reps, both physical and mental, all the difficult times when he wondered whether to keep going, all the quirks he's developed along the way -- from the non-prescription goggles he sometimes rocks to the chef's kiss to the camera he occasionally makes -- led up to that moment.\n\nAnd he did not miss, delivering \"the exclamation point\" with a 14.866 to finish off a performance the U.S. men's program hopes provides serious momentum heading into the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I kind of in that moment was like, 'All right, let's run it back and let's go out there and do our thing,'\" Nedoroscik said.\n\nFilling a critical gap\n\nA \"thing\" that has long been a sore spot for the U.S. in major international competition. The 2012 Olympic team topped qualifying. Then they led off on pommel horse in the finals and saw their medal hopes vanish one mistake at a time.\n\nNedoroscik understood the history. It's one of the reasons he gravitated toward pommels. Another is the fact that it requires many things -- stamina, strength and creativity chief among them -- that he has in spades, particularly that last one.\n\nHe describes himself as a \"late bloomer\" on the event. Those early struggles only helped him press forward.\n\n\"Running into trouble on the apparatus early on taught me how to fight, how to stay on, how to really go for that routine,\" he said. \"And I think that that has stuck with me throughout.\"\n\nUnlike other events, which are painstakingly laid out and practiced on end for months if not years, pommel horse allows gymnasts to color outside the lines and make things up as they go on. Miss an element here? Well, maybe you can make it up trying something else later in the routine.\n\nHe says the end result is the feeling of \"flying through the air,\" though it's more akin to levitation.\n\nMore work to be done\n\nNedoroscik will soar into the event finals Saturday with a chance to put another medal in his carry-on before he heads home. His 15.200 qualifying score tied Ireland's Rhys McClenaghan for the tops among the eight finalists.\n\nHe is ready to ride the wave as far as it will take him. Yet whatever happens on Saturday or for the rest of his life for that matter, it will be difficult to top Monday night, when the guy with the curly hair and the glasses that made him the kind of social media sensation only the Olympics provides struck a blow for his sport, his teammates and himself.\n\n\"I'm really proud of these guys,\" he said while sitting alongside the group that became U.S. men's gymnastics royalty. \"I love you boys.\"\n\nOlympic Games Paris 2024: Scenes from the opening ceremony\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The U.S. arrived in Paris hoping to earn a team medal at the Olympics for the first time since a bronze in Beijing 16 years ago.

Asher Hong (Tomball, Texas), Paul Juda (Deerfield, Ill.), Brody Malone (Aragon, Ga.), Stephen Nedoroscik (Worcester, Mass.) and Frederick Richard (Stoughton, Mass.) won the U.S. men's team Olympic medal for the first time since winning bronze in 2008.\n\nEven as the athletes celebrated their routines enthusiastically, the team remained calm under pressure after taking the lead after two rotations on the rings and vault. While powerhouses Japan and China turned to their strongest apparatus and moved into the top two spots, the United States continued to grind out sets to score 257.793 and earn its spot on the medal podium. Japan won the gold with a score of 259.594, narrowly edging out China, who finished second with a score of 259.062.\n\nAfter finishing fifth in qualifying on Saturday, the Americans posted higher scores on 14 of 18 routines on Monday night and had the second-best team scores on vault (44.032) and rings (42.732) and the third-best score on high bar (42.365).

Join USA TODAY Sports' WhatsApp Channel\n\nThe grit and enthusiasm that's in the DNA of every American athlete wasn't going to get them on the podium. It wasn't going to get people invested in them when the Olympics came to Los Angeles in 2028. The U.S. men were going to have to change their gymnastics, ramping up the difficulty of their routines.\n\nIt wouldn't be easy, especially when the Americans are so heavily dependent on NCAA programs. The scoring system and priorities are different in NCAA gymnastics, and adding difficulty wouldn't necessarily be in the best interest of gymnasts still in college.\n\nThe Americans also had to accept there would be some ugly results in the interim. A gymnast doesn't just go out one day and add a point or a half-point to a routine. It takes time and practice. Of falling and making mistakes until a skill becomes second nature, especially in competition.\n\nBut if the Americans ever wanted a medal, they were going to have to do more than talk.\n\n\"We had to trust the process,\" Mikulak said. \"The first couple of years were rough.\"\n\nIt worked, though. The bronze medal hanging around the U.S. men's necks Monday night is proof.\n\nThe medal is the Americans' first at an Olympics since 2008, when they also won a bronze. It comes a year after they snapped a nine-year drought at the world championships, also with a bronze.\n\n\"I just hope it shows promise, shows capability and shows that when you put trust in one another and you put the hard work in that things do happen,\" said Paul Juda, a member of both drought-busting teams.\n\n\"You don't just have to show up every time and expect fourth or expect fifth,\" Juda added.\n\nThe USA TODAY app brings you every Team USA medal -- right when it happens. Download for full Olympics coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and much more.\n\nOlympic champion Japan and silver medalist China are still in a different class than the American men. Both teams made major mistakes -- reigning world and Olympic all-around champion Daiki Hashimoto fell off pommel horse in Japan's first event, and China's Su Weide fell off high bar twice and botched the landing on his vault -- and they were still about two points in front of the Americans.\n\nJapan had one event in which every score was 14.733 or higher, and two others in which every score was above 14.5. The Chinese had three scores of 15.1 or higher, including a 16 on parallel bars by Zou Jingyuan.\n\nOf the U.S. men's six scores above 14.5, three came on vault, where scores are higher than on other events.\n\nBut the Americans know they're on the right path. Asher Hong and Frederick Richard, the two youngest members of the team, both had 14.833s vault and high bar, respectively. The Americans gambled by taking Stephen Nedoroscik, whodoes only one event, but he delivered with a 14.866 on pommel horse -- on the last routine of the last event, no less.\n\nThey also were closer to silver than they were fourth place, and this medal will only serve to motivate them further.\n\n\"We're going to be creating history,\" Richard said. \"They used to have pictures in my gym of the past Olympic teams that medaled, and I'd always look at that like, 'Man, what if I was one of those people one day?'

They did the darned thing.\n\nEven better is they have a road map now.\n\n\"What we've been doing the last few years has been working,\" said Brett McClure, the men's high-performance director. \"I think the next generation coming up is even stronger.\"\n\nThe U.S. men moved up two spots between Tokyo and Paris.

They Hope the NCAA Notices", "body": "PARIS (AP) -- Before they stood with their arms wrapped around each other in a brotherhood forever etched into U.S. Olympic lore, Brody Malone, Frederick Richard, Asher Hong, Paul Juda and Stephen Nedoroscik were collegians.\n\nYes, the dreams the members of the U.S. men's gymnastics team had fostered since childhood began in small gyms scattered across the country. But they became tangible at Stanford, Michigan and Penn State.\n\nSo when it was time for those dreams to become fully, vividly realized inside a raucous Bercy Arena on Monday night, they leaned on the experiences they gained during all those meets in all those sometimes sparsely filled gyms that taught them about pressure and teamwork and belief.\n\nYes, the bronze medal the Americans so emphatically earned ended a 16-year drought on the sport's biggest stage.\n\nYet it was also a message to athletic directors at the dozen schools that still have Division I gymnastics -- and to be honest, to the ones that don't, too -- that the sport is worth saving.\n\n\"If you want to keep seeing USA Gymnastics and Team USA on a gymnastics podium, at least on the men's side, you're going to have to give us more opportunities to compete in college,\" said Juda, who is in graduate school at Michigan.\n\nOpportunities that are in danger of vanishing quickly thanks to a rapidly evolving college sports landscape. It's a reality the five men who stood on the podium with their arms around each other are only too aware of.\n\nRichard, a rising junior at Michigan, has made it his life's mission to bring more people to a side of the sport that -- at least in the U.S. anyway -- has long plugged along anonymously.\n\nAnd while he's carved out a rapidly expanding niche on social media, Richard is savvy enough to understand the one thing guaranteed to attract people to men's gymnastics isn't a viral video, but hardware like the medal he kept grabbing in the giddy aftermath.\n\n\"My goal even here was to make a statement that the U.S. is getting stronger and stronger and we're only (going up),\" Richard said. \"And I think we did that today. I think a lot of young boys watching are inspired by us.\"\n\nThat's the way it was for Richard as a kid in the Boston suburbs. There were pictures on the wall at the gym of the medal-winning 2004 and 2008 U.S. men's Olympic teams. Richard would stare at the pictures and wonder how those teams put all the pieces together.\n\n\"It looks like they all came together on the same day and just did like these perfect routines,\" Richard said. \"And you're like, how is that possible?\"\n\nRichard found out firsthand.\n\nThe Americans didn't record a major fall during any of their 18 routines in the final and finished closer to second-place China than fourth-place Britain. They leaned into the energy from a vocal contingent of U.S. fans that offered a hint of what it might look like in Los Angeles four years from now.\n\nMostly, however, they leaned on each other and their experiences to shake off an iffy qualifying session on Saturday in which they finished a sloppy fifth.\n\n\"We just told each other we were gonna treat it like an NCAA championships because we've all been there,\" Malone said. \"And it's high pressure competing for a team. And it's no different this competition. I mean yeah, this one's a little bit different, a little bit bigger. But same concept.\"\n\nWith perhaps a much more impactful result.\n\nNedoroscik is 26. Malone is 24. Juda is 23. Hong and Richard are 20. There is a feeling of real momentum within the U.S. men's program for the first time in a while. Yet to keep it going, the pipeline behind them needs to keep churning.\n\nThere was a sense in the 2010s that the U.S. had grown stale in part because those at the core group at the top grew a little too comfortable due in part to a lack of competition from those trying to catch them.\n\nSam Mikulak went to three Olympics with teams that had considerable talent. He never came home with a medal, though on Monday night he was chatting with Nedoroscik as he prepared for his pommel horse set that served as the exclamation point.\n\nWhile they talked, Mikulak told Nedoroscik to stay calm, that 80 percent of his best would be good enough. To soak in a moment Mikulak dreamed of but never quite grasped.\n\nAnd when Nedoroscik gracefully swooped from one end of the horse to the other, his hands working dutifully in tandem on an event that has given the Americans fits for years, the bronze that felt in some ways like gold was won.\n\nStanding there in the aftermath, Mikulak couldn't help but speculate about what might lie ahead.\n\n\"I think the guys are going to be hungry for more,\" he said. \"And hopefully this spurs men's gymnastics in the US like never before.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Only the top eight teams at the end of qualification on Saturday will contest Monday's men's team final.\n\nBritain's Jake Jarman delivered his usual confident performance to lead the all-around standings with 84.897 points.\n\nHis compatriot Joe Fraser was in second, with Americans Frederick Richard and Paul Juda in third and fourth.\n\nAmerican pommel horse specialist Stephen Nedoroscik, the 2021 world champion on the apparatus, breezed through his difficult routine and the crowd erupted when he nailed his dismount in the only event he will compete in at the Games.\n\nNedoroscik earned 15.200 from the judges, making him the first gymnast to score above a 15 points in the subdivision.\n\nWhitlock, who struck gold on the apparatus at the last two Olympics and also owns three pommel world titles, swivelled up and down the horse as he executed a routine with the highest difficulty on the apparatus. He trailed Nedoroscik with a score of 15.166. Scores from qualifying are not carried over to the finals. .\n\n\"We all done exactly what we needed to do as a team. We really, really come together and we can't ask for more,\" Whitlock told reporters.\n\nAmerican Brody Malone's return to the Olympic stage after his recovery from a devastating knee injury was not what he would have hoped for.\n\nAfter falling off the pommel horse, he struggled to find his rhythm and failed to make the cut for the all-around final as he trailed in 11th place after just the first of three sub divisions. He was well behind compatriots Richard and Juda. A maximum of two competitors from each country can contest the individual finals.\n\n\"I think it was obviously below expected of us, but for the day we got the job done,\" said Richard. \"Again, it's getting adjusted to everything and I think we all did that.\"\n\nTwenty four competitors will contest the all-around final on Wednesday. The top eight athletes at the end of the day's qualifying on each apparatus, with a maximum of two from each country, will progress to the finals.

High-fives were loudly exchanged, with chalk flying into the air.\n\nThe United States men's gymnastics team won a bronze medal here Monday -- their first in 16 years - through talent and training, of course. A whole lot of passion and teamwork didn't hurt either as \"U-S-A, U-S-A\" chants echoed around Bercy Arena.\n\nIt was the US men's first team medal since securing a bronze in 2008.\n\nThe American team of Asher Hong, Paul Juda, Frederick Richard, Stephen Nedoroscik and Brody Malone were giant slayers here, going from fifth in qualifying to the podium by routinely surpassing expectations. As a group they surpassed their qualifying scores in 14 of 18 possible chances.\n\nThey finished with a team score of 257.793. Japan took gold with 259.594. China finished with the silver at 259.062.\n\nIn the final rotation, pommel horse, the Americans looked to hold onto a third place slot. They led Ukraine by 1.798; Great Britain by 3.966. It was a matter of delivering as they had all day.\n\nFirst it was Juda who produced a brilliant 13.900. Next up, Malone, who had shaken off a tough day of qualifying, including a meager 12.100 on pommel. Bang. He went 13.700 and flexed as he walked off.\n\nLast up, the pommel specialist Nedoroscik who was near flawless with a that sent the American team in hysterics. Long overshadowed by their female counterparts, this was a statement.\n\nThe Americans were nearly impossible not to root for, an all-for-one, one-for-all brigade that cheered each other on by shouting and stomping and jumping around on the side. Every stuck landing and high score was celebrated like a Super Bowl. You couldn't miss them.\n\nThey led after two rotations and while holding off powerhouse Japan and China was too much to ask, they stayed above the others to max out their potential. That bronze will feel pretty golden.\n\nRichard of Stoughton, Mass. delivered electrifying, team-high scorer performances on parallel bars (14.566), the horizontal bar (14.833) and floor (14.466) to leave the American-heavy crowd roaring. Hong, of Tomball, Texas, meanwhile led on rings (14.533) and vault (14.833) to pace the US.\n\nMalone and Juda were consistent throughout, the team avoiding a single major blemish that could leave them out of the medals.\n\nIn the team event, each country sends three competitors out on six different disciplines. All the scores are tallied.

The competition to get on the podium was incredibly tight, and everything rode on the pommel horse performance of the U.S. athlete in the glasses who is now being compared to Clark Kent.\n\nTeam USA of men's gymnastics won their first Olympic medal in 16 years thanks to Nedoroscik.\n\nNot only was Nedoroscik Nedoro-SICK on the pommel horse, but he also came off as incredibly relatable. There have been numerous jokes about the fact that he wears those glasses, one shot of him looking like he's napping in the middle of an Olympic event, and you might have even seen the words \"pommel horse guy\" trending on Twitter.\n\nNedoroscik is a pommel horse specialist and 2021 World Champion on the U.S. men's national team who began training as a gymnast in 2003 when he was only four or five years old. In high school, he felt that he was only getting better on the pommel horse and decided to focus on that skill in particular. It paid off.\n\nHe also has a degree in electrical engineering from Pennsylvania State University.\n\nNedoroscik's iconic glasses combined with his ability to perform incredible physical feats have earned him a comparison to Superman's alter ego, Clark Kent. Some even feel that he strikes a resemblance to the well-known comic book character, on and off the pommel horse, or at least to Christopher Reeve from the 1978 film Superman.\n\nThe gymnast has already reacted to the Clark Kent memes thanks to an interview with The Today Show on July 30, where hosts Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie asked him how he felt about the comparisons.\n\n\"I think they're awesome,\" he said. \"You know, representing the people that wear glasses well.\"\n\nSure, that's what you're flattered about.\n\nPeople do seem to be fixated on the glasses. Nedoroscik has strabismus, a vision disorder that causes the eyes to fail to properly align with each other when focusing on a single point. This can result in amblyopia or \"lazy eye,\" or double vision if the disorder presents later in life.\n\nStrabismus affects two percent of all children and can sometimes be fixed with surgery, but the symptoms are more often treated with the use of glasses. Those with the condition can often pick which eye is dominant at will. The gymnast demonstrated how his condition manifests in a TikTok video from 2022.\n\nNedoroscik has earned comparisons to Clark Kent as well as other well-known protagonists because he only ever seems to remove his glasses just before his gymnastics performances. Additionally, fellow nerds and general glasses wearers are beyond psyched to see their kind represented on an Olympic stage.", "source": {"uri": "dailydot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Dot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lindsey_weedston@dailydot.com", "name": "Lindsey Weedston", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Kent_(Smallville)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clark Kent (Smallville)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Reeve", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Reeve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter_ego", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alter ego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrical engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(American_TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Today (American TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblyopia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amblyopia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vision disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strabismus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerd", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nerd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah_Guthrie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Savannah Guthrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoda_Kotb", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hoda Kotb"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Dressage", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Dressage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://uploads.dailydot.com/2024/07/Steve-Nedoroscik-memes.jpg?auto=compress&fm=pjpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 1662, "textEnd": 1669}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

The Americans, who finished third at the 2023 world championships ahead of Great Britain, were at 253.229.\n\nThe U.S. arrived in Paris believing it had a legitimate chance to medal in the team competition for the first time since earning a bronze in Beijing 16 years ago.\n\nThere is work to be done after the British put on a largely mistake-free clinic across six rotations. Jake Jarman (84.897) and Joe Fraser (84.666) posted the top all-around scores and six-time Olympic medalist Max Whitlock provided a jolt with an electric pommel horse routine -- his signature event -- that left the 31-year-old looking relieved.\n\nWhitlock's 15.166 trailed only American Stephen Nedoroscik, a specialist whose 15.200 likely earned him a spot in the event finals and gave his teammates some early momentum.\n\nFrederick Richard and Paul Juda will now represent the Americans in the all-around. While Richard, who earned bronze in the all-around at the 2023 world championships, was expected to advance, Juda's performance is a bit of a surprise.\n\nThe 23-year-old Juda, who unabashedly broke down in tears after being named to the five-man Olympic squad, thrust his arms into the air after his dismount on floor exercise. His all-around total of 82.865 was fourth among early qualifiers, trailing only Richard (83.498), Jarman and Fraser.\n\nQualifying continues later Saturday, with longtime rivals and gold medal favorites Japan and China competing in the second of three subdivisions.

While all-arounders compete at six apparatuses, Nedoroscik is a pommel horse specialist. The event that most male gymnasts despise is his calling card.\n\nAnd every time he takes to the pommel horse, he wears his goggles, which most people think are a prescription. They are not, and their existence came from an unexpected place.\n\n\"They were a Secret Santa gift from a teammate,\" said Nedoroscik, who acquired the eyewear during his first year at Penn State, where he competed until 2020. \"I wore them during a meet as a joke, and then I did well. We joked that they must have some magic in them, so I kept wearing them.\"\n\nAt the trials in St. Louis, there will be fans in the stands wearing T-shirts printed with his goggles after a gymnastics website started selling them when Nedoroscik won the pommel horse title at the National Championships on June 5.\n\nThe victory was just one of many Nedoroscik has earned nationallysince he started focusing his training on pommels in high school. Hehas brought home two Junior Olympic and NCAA titles, as well as the Nissen-Emery Award , the collegiate gymnastics equivalent of the Heisman Trophy.\n\nHis childhood coach, Bob Donahue of Sterling Academy of Gymnastics, led Nedoroscik to the unusual path of focusing on just one apparatus at the end of his sophomore year of high school.\n\n\"He was talented, but not progressing the way we thought he could, which was frustrating,\" said Donahue. \"But everyone could see how well he was doing on pommel horse. It's so unusual of an event, and you can be very helpful to a college team if you're good at it.\"\n\nNedoroscik bought into the idea of only focusing on pommels. His parents even bought a pommel horse for his backyard.\n\n\"He was that dedicated,\" said Liz Gonzalez, another Sterling coach.\n\nIt immediately paid off. Nedoroscik won his first national Junior Olympic title that season.\n\nHis prowess led him to Penn State, where he competed for four years and earned a degree in electrical engineering. He still trains with his college coaches as he vies for an Olympic spot.\n\nNedoroscik is hoping to earn the fifth spot on the team -- one that wasn't available until June 5. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG), the sport's international governing body, made a controversial decision to change team sizes for the Tokyo Olympics. Instead of the five-gymnast teams seen in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, the team size was reduced to four. However, nations could earn an additional spot either via continental championships or World Cup events. With many World Cup events canceled due to the pandemic, the US had only one chance left to earn their extra spot: the 2021 Pan American Championships in Rio de Janiero, their continental championship.\n\nHowever, another controversial change by the FIG gave Nedoroscik an opportunity to earn his own berth. Individuals could clinch spots separate from their nation's team by competing at a series of World Cup events. After the series conclusion, the most successful gymnast on an apparatus would earn a spot in Tokyo.\n\nIn early 2020, Nedoroscik attempted to earn an Olympic spot that way. He won the pommel horse title at the Melbourne World Cup in February and needed two more victories to win the spot outright. He traveled to Baku, Azerbaijan in mid-March for his second World Cup event. Training was going well, and his confidence was high.\n\nThen he got a startling wake-up from one of his Penn State coaches, who traveled with him to the meet.\n\n\"My coach knocked on my door at 5 a.m., and said, 'We just got notice that we have to leave immediately because of the pandemic,'\" said Nedoroscik.\n\nReluctantly, Nedoroscik withdrew, and eventually, the event was called off.\n\nWith other World Cup events canceled and the Olympics postponed, Nedoroscik's opportunity to earn his own spot in Tokyo vanished. His only hope was that fifth team spot, which USA Gymnastics officials said would go to a specialist with a good possibility of finishing on the podium.\n\nAs a team of American gymnasts fought for the spot at the Pan Ams, Nedoroscik was at the US Championships, waiting to see if there would be an Olympic spot for him to contend for.\n\n\"It was such a mood changer,\" said Nedoroscik. \"Before, I wasn't sure if my competing would even be worth it if we didn't get that extra spot.\"\n\nWith that boost, Nedoroscik went on to win the pommel title and advanced to the trials with several other specialists. His childhood coaches think that out of that group, he has the best chance of them all to stand on the Olympic podium.\n\n\"The others don't compare as highly internationally on their event as Stephen does,\" said Donahue.\n\nIf Nedoroscik doesn't make the Olympic team, he will continue to try for the World Championships team this fall. But he's hoping that if he can improve on his winning routines from the US Championships two weeks ago, the focus he's had for the last seven years will pay off with an Olympic spot.\n\n\"I have a pretty simple goal: I want to do what I've been doing in training,\" said Nedoroscik. \"I want to show everyone that I'm clean and consistent.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType":

China, seeking its fourth Olympic team title, posted a team total of 263.028. Japan, a seven-time Olympic champion, finished second at 260.594.\n\nThe five-man Chinese team, missing veteran Sun Wei after he was injured during training Thursday, used a series of spectacular routines on rings and parallel bars to stamp itself as the favourite heading into Monday's final.\n\nJapan, the reigning world champion, dealt with a couple of uncharacteristic mistakes by current world and Olympic gold medalist Daiki Hashimoto but still finished well clear of third-place Britain.\n\nWhile the 22-year-old Hashimoto will get a chance to defend his title in the all-around, he won't on high bar - his signature event - after stumbling during his dismount. Hashimoto appeared to be dealing with right shoulder discomfort for much of the afternoon and was tended to by a Team Japan trainer shortly after finishing up on still rings though he said afterward he was not hurt.\n\nHashimoto is currently third in the all-around through two subdivisions at 85.064, behind teammate Shinnousuke Oka (86.865) and China's Zhang Boheng (88.597).\n\nThe scores will reset for the team finals, though the only real question is who will join China and Japan on the podium with defending champion Russia ineligible due to the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe Japanese settled for silver at home in Tokyo in 2021, losing to the Russians by just over a tenth of a point in a close final while China took bronze a little further back.\n\n\"It was frustrating,\" Japan's Kazuma Kaya said. \"But we kept practising every day for success today. Next time, in (the team final), I want the gold medal.\"\n\nThe gold isn't the only medal in question. Bronze is a toss-up, too, though Britain made a strong case by topping the first subdivision, a group that included the U.S. Ukraine overcame a nightmarish set on high bar to slip past the U.S. and into fourth at 253.893, dropping the Americans into fifth at 253.229.\n\nItaly, Switzerland and Canada also advanced to the finals, with the Canadians claiming the eighth and final spot by less than a quarter of a point over Turkey.\n\nThe British insist they don't have any sort of rivalry with the U.S., even if the two programs have spent the better part of a decade jockeying for position at nearly every major international event.\n\nBritain sent a very real if unspoken message: it is more than capable of grabbing a bronze to go with the one it somewhat unexpectedly won in London a dozen years ago.\n\nJake Jarman's 84.897 all-around total was just ahead of teammate Joe Fraser while Max Whitlock - in his fourth and final Games - fought off the jitters he knew would come to score a 15.133 on pommel horse and give Britain plenty of momentum.\n\n\"A lot of people have asked me that question in terms of 'How's it feel to be above the U.S.?'\" Whitlock said. \"To be honest, you take it with a pinch of salt. I think it's really important to kind of just think about our job.\"\n\nRussia's absence creates a medal opportunity for the U.S., Britain and Ukraine behind another duel between China and Japan for gold. Still, Whitlock downplayed the idea that if Russia was involved, a team medal for anyone outside the sport's Big Three would be out of the question.\n\n\"If they were in, you'd like to think that they'd be up near the top,\" Whitlock said. \"So with them not, of course, there's a little bit of (a better opportunity to medal), but only a little bit.\"\n\nThe American men - hoping to repeat the bronze they won at the world championships last fall - weren't nearly as sharp in front of an audience that included U.S. First Lady Jill Biden, who clapped along with American star Frederick Richard's floor routine and posed for pictures with a somewhat subdued team afterward.\n\nWhile Richard called the experience \"pretty sick,\" he regretted not being able to show Biden a \"cooler\" routine after he scored a 13.833, a bit below what he knows he'll need to medal in the all-around finals next week.\n\nRichard wasn't the only one. The U.S. arrived in Paris hoping to earn a team medal at the Olympics for the first time since a bronze in Beijing 16 years ago. While that certainly remains on the table, Richard & Co. will need to be significantly better going forward after pommel horse specialist Stephen Nedoroscik became the only American to make an apparatus final.\n\nBrody Malone, who returned from a catastrophic leg injury in March 2023 to win the U.S. Championships in early June and make his second Olympic team, fell once on pommel horse and twice on high bar.\n\nHis second miscue on high bar - a high-risk, high-reward event in which Malone won gold at the 2022 world championships - forced the Americans to use Asher Hong's 12.600, one of the reasons the U.S. ended up 3.322 behind Britain.\n\n\"It was definitely not perfect,\" U.S. high-performance director Brett McClure said. \"And it was a few too many mistakes. I feel leading into team finals we need to clean some things up.\"", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Not so much. Coming off his third national all-around title in Fort Worth, Texas, last month, he looked more like the gymnast still rehabbing from a horrific knee/leg injury last year that required three surgeries. He misfired once on the pommel horse Saturday and needed three starts on the high bar, his specialty.\n\nPraised by his teammates for his unflappable nature, he nevertheless apologized to them after the U.S. finished second in its subdivision Saturday to Great Britain, 256.561 to 253.229.\n\nHere's why that's problematic: China, with its 13 world championships and bronze from Tokyo, and Japan, defending silver medalist and last year's world champs, are overwhelming favorites for the top two spots in Monday's finals. Third place is probably up for grabs between the U.S. and Great Britain, which took third and fourth, respectively, at last year's worlds.\n\nThe U.S. men will need a rebound by Malone to have any shot at their first medal since 2008.\n\nHong is counting on it.\n\n\"Some days you're gonna be off and some days you're gonna be on,\" said Hong, who grew up in Plano and now lives outside Houston. \"But, I mean, you know, Brody's a dog and a competitor, so I know he's gonna give it his all in the team finals.\"\n\nLike Richards, Juda and Nedoroscik, top scorer of the subdivision in the pommel horse, Hong didn't hold back. His scores led the U.S. in rings (14.633), floor (14.100) and vault (14.566, his average on the two attempts required of contenders for the vault finals). He's third overall in rings, fifth on vault and sixth on floor.\n\nBecause Nedoroscik competes on the pommel horse in Hong's place, the latter is ineligible for the all-around, which requires points from all six events.\n\nHong said he tried to treat the qualifier as if it were any old meet, but it was hard to tell by his results and reactions. During Richard's floor routine, you could hear Hong's screams in the upper regions of Bercy Arena.\n\n\"I wanted to tone it down a little bit because it's not team finals,\" he said. \"And, you know, it's not a marathon, it's a sprint.\n\n\"We've got a long week ahead of us.\"\n\nMalone made it a little bit longer Saturday. Brett McClure, the men's high-performance director, said he was \"surprised\" by the two-time Olympian's day. He conceded they must get him right for Monday in order to have a shot at a team medal. Finishing fifth, as they have in the last three Olympics, is getting a little stale. They'd looked ready for something better after finishing third at the World Championships, when McClure called the goal of a medal \"attainable.\"\n\nThey can still win one, but it looks harder from here.\n\n\"We can't hold anything back in the team finals,\" McClure said Saturday. \"Great Britain looks amazing.\"\n\nJust like the future looks for Hong, only 20. His family -- father, Rick; mother, Karen; and brothers Xander, 18, and Kiefer, 16 -- got a close-up view of his Olympic coming-out party Saturday, though Asher couldn't exactly pinpoint where they were. He thought he could hear his mother, which is saying something, given the racket the crowd made for the Americans.\n\nPretty soon the family will take its act on the road, when Xander joins Asher this fall at Stanford. He'll get to see his big brother as BMOC.\n\nNot a little ironic, too, seeing as how both Xander and Kiefer are each at least a head taller. Asked if they give him a hard time about being the shortest of the Brothers Hong, Asher smiled and said, \"Sometimes.\"\n\nHe said it over his shoulder, as a team official whisked him off to a meeting with the first lady. Not a bad day at all. They'll just need a better one Monday.\n\n\u00a92024 The Dallas Morning News. Visit dallasnews.com.

He fell during his events and even apologized to his teammates later on. However, the national champion did not spend a lot of his energy and time stressing over those mistakes but rather looked to improve in the final rounds to give his team the boost it needed for a medal.\n\n\"The first night was a fluke for Brody.

Let's get in this competition.' And he was like, 'Absolutely.'

And after also placing fifth in Saturday's qualifying competition it appeared that the Yanks would fall short again.\n\nBut with team leader Brody Malone rebounding from a dreadful first night to set the tone his colleagues turned the page and never looked back.\n\n\"Every single routine just kept getting better and better and better,\" said Brett McClure, the men's high performance director. \"This team deserved it and they absolutely earned it tonight.\"\n\nThis was the medal that meant the most to the US males especially since there won't be many more here.\n\nRichard, the world bronze medalist from Stoughton, has a chance in Wednesday's all-around. But Nedoroscik, the bespectacled pommel specialist, is the only one who qualified for an apparatus final.\n\nThe Americans won the team bronze medal at last year's world championships without Malone, who was recovering from a ghastly knee injury.\n\nSo they were positioned to finally cash in, especially with the Russians banned from the Games because of their country's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAll the Americans needed to do was what historically has been beyond their ability -- to hit all 18 routines with authority. No pratfalls, no stumbles. And the man most under the spotlight was Malone, the only holdover from the Tokyo team from three years ago.\n\nHe'd fallen twice from the horizontal bar and come off the horse in qualifying, missing the all-around. But this was a different day, a different challenge, a different opportunity.\n\n\"It's about having a short memory and putting it behind me,\" Malone said. \"Once it was done and over with, it's done and over with. You can't do anything about it. I just had to reset my mind and get ready for the next competition. and that's what I did.\"\n\nAfter starting off strong on still rings and vault the Americans were first among the eight teams, more than a point ahead of the Japanese.\n\n\"You take it. You seize the moment,\" said Richard. \"We didn't wait to become the medalists. We decided we were going to do it. And every routine we gave everything.\"\n\nStill ahead, though, were the horizontal bar and the horse, two treacherous events where medals can vanish with a slip of the hand. \"Staying on the high bar is always Priority No. 1,\" said Juda.\n\nNot only did his colleagues stay on, they finished second to Japan. When it came down to the horse, the final event, the Yanks had what they knew they had to have -- a nearly two-point cushion over the British, who'd been in their way ever since Beijing.\n\nAnd they had the man they wanted going up last -- Nedoroscik, the former world champion on the apparatus. \"My teammates did every single routine before me,\" he said. \"I've never fallen when everyone did it before me.\"\n\nAfter Nedoroscik went crisp and clean and their podium finish was secure, his teammates hoisted him like a hero and passed around the Stars and Stripes to drape across their shoulders.\n\n\"Tonight we celebrate,\" declared McClure, who was on the 2004 squad that won a breakthrough silver in Athens. \"We did what we haven't done in so long.\"\n\nIt was a bronze that felt like gold after 16 years off the medal stand. \"We're trending in the right direction,\" said McClure. \"Obviously Japan and China are still in another category. If we want to get better and push for first place in LA (in 2028) then this is going to be extremely motivating.\"\n\nWhat the federation hopes is that boys watching at home on TV will decide to chalk up and go after an Olympic medal of their own in a decade or so.\n\nUnlike the American women, who have an unparalleled pipeline from the toddler level upward, the men come out of a diminishing development pool.\n\nIn the late 1960s more than 200 Div. 1 colleges had teams. Now only a dozen do, most of them in the Big 10 and the service academies. Relatively few high schools offer boys squads and the club system overwhelmingly attracts girls.\n\nBut USA Gymnastics produced five guys who envisioned five rings in their future and they mined precious metal here.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone", "type":

China leads qualifying with 263.028 points, followed by Japan with 260.594. Japan's Daiki Hashimoto is aiming to defend his all-around title despite some setbacks. Other teams, including Britain and the U.S., vie for medals.\n\nLongtime men's gymnastics rivals China and Japan appear headed for another tight finish at the Olympics.\n\nThe sport's two superpowers surged to the top of qualifying at Bercy Arena on Saturday. China, seeking its fourth Olympic team title, posted a team total of 263.028. Japan, a seven-time Olympic champion, finished second at 260.594.\n\nThe five-man Chinese team, missing veteran Sun Wei after he was injured during training Thursday, used a series of spectacular routines on rings and parallel bars to stamp itself as the favorite heading into Monday's final.\n\nJapan, the reigning world champion, dealt with a couple of uncharacteristic mistakes by current world and Olympic gold medalist Daiki Hashimoto but still finished well clear of third-place Britain.\n\nWhile the 22-year-old Hashimoto will get a chance to defend his title in the all-around, he won't on high bar -- his signature event -- after stumbling during his dismount. Hashimoto appeared to be dealing with right shoulder discomfort for much of the afternoon and was tended to by a Team Japan trainer shortly after finishing up on still rings though he said afterward he was not hurt. Hashimoto is currently third in the all-around through two subdivisions at 85.064, behind teammate Shinnousuke Oka (86.865) and China's Zhang Boheng (88.597).\n\nThe scores will reset for the team finals, though the only real question is who will join China and Japan on the podium with defending champion Russia ineligible due to the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe Japanese settled for silver at home in Tokyo in 2021, losing to the Russians by just over a tenth of a point in a close final while China took bronze a little further back.\n\n\"It was frustrating,\" Japan's Kazuma Kaya said. ''But we kept practicing every day for success today. Next time, in (the team final), I want the gold medal.\" The gold isn't the only medal in question. Bronze is a toss-up, too, though Britain made a strong case by topping the first subdivision, a group that included the U.S. Ukraine overcame a nightmarish set on high bar to slip past the U.S. and into fourth at 253.893, dropping the Americans into fifth at 253.229.\n\nItaly, Switzerland and Canada also advanced to the finals, with the Canadians claiming the eighth and final spot by less than a quarter of a point over Turkey.\n\nThe British insist they don't have any sort of rivalry with the U.S., even if the two programs have spent the better part of a decade jockeying for position at nearly every major international event.\n\nBritain sent a very real if unspoken message: it is more than capable of grabbing a bronze to go with the one it somewhat unexpectedly won in London a dozen years ago.\n\nJake Jarman's 84.897 all-around total was just ahead of teammate Joe Fraser while Max Whitlock -- in his fourth and final Games -- fought off the jitters he knew would come to score a 15.133 on pommel horse and give Britain plenty of momentum.\n\n''A lot of people have asked me that question in terms of How's it feel to be above the U.S.?''' Whitlock said. \"To be honest, you take it with a pinch of salt. I think it's really important to kind of just think about our job.\" Russia's absence creates a medal opportunity for the U.S., Britain and Ukraine behind another duel between China and Japan for gold. Still, Whitlock downplayed the idea that if Russia was involved, a team medal for anyone outside the sport's Big Three would be out of the question.\n\n\"If they were in, you'd like to think that they'd be up near the top,\" Whitlock said. \"So with them not, of course, there's a little bit of (a better opportunity to medal), but only a little bit.\" The American men -- hoping to repeat the bronze they won at the world championships last fall -- weren't nearly as sharp in front of an audience that included U.S. First Lady Jill Biden, who clapped along with American star Frederick Richard's floor routine and posed for pictures with a somewhat subdued team afterward.\n\nWhile Richard called the experience \"pretty sick,\" he regretted not being able to show Biden a \"cooler\" routine after he scored a 13.833, a bit below what he knows he'll need to medal in the all-around finals next week.\n\nRichard wasn't the only one. The U.S. arrived in Paris hoping to earn a team medal at the Olympics for the first time since a bronze in Beijing 16 years ago. While that certainly remains on the table, Richard & Co. will need to be significantly better going forward after pommel horse specialist Stephen Nedoroscik became the only American to make an apparatus final.\n\nBrody Malone, who returned from a catastrophic leg injury in March 2023 to win the U.S. Championships in early June and make his second Olympic team, fell once on pommel horse and twice on high bar.\n\nHis second miscue on high bar -- a high-risk, high-reward event in which Malone won gold at the 2022 world championships -- forced the Americans to use Asher Hong's 12.600, one of the reasons the U.S. ended up 3.322 behind Britain.\n\n\"It was definitely not perfect,\" U.S. high-performance director Brett McClure said. \"And it was a few too many mistakes. I feel leading into team finals we need to clean some things up.\"", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Longtime men's gymnastics rivals China and Japan appear headed for another tight finish at the Olympics.\n\nParis, Jul 28 (AP) Longtime men's gymnastics rivals China and Japan appear headed for another tight finish at the Olympics.\n\nThe sport's two superpowers surged to the top of qualifying at Bercy Arena on Saturday. China, seeking its fourth Olympic team title, posted a team total of 263.028. Japan, a seven-time Olympic champion, finished second at 260.594.\n\nAlso Read | IND vs SL 2nd T20I 2024, Kandy Weather, Rain Forecast and Pitch Report: Here's How Weather Will Behave for India vs Sri Lanka Match at Pallekele International Cricket Stadium.\n\nThe five-man Chinese team, missing veteran Sun Wei after he was injured during training Thursday, used a series of spectacular routines on rings and parallel bars to stamp itself as the favorite heading into Monday's final.\n\nJapan, the reigning world champion, dealt with a couple of uncharacteristic mistakes by current world and Olympic gold medalist Daiki Hashimoto but still finished well clear of third-place Britain.\n\nAlso Read | Paris Olympics 2024: Canada Women's Football Team Docked Six Points for Spying Scandal; Three Coaches Banned.\n\nWhile the 22-year-old Hashimoto will get a chance to defend his title in the all-around, he won't on high bar -- his signature event -- after stumbling during his dismount. Hashimoto appeared to be dealing with right shoulder discomfort for much of the afternoon and was tended to by a Team Japan trainer shortly after finishing up on still rings though he said afterward he was not hurt.\n\nHashimoto is currently third in the all-around through two subdivisions at 85.064, behind teammate Shinnousuke Oka (86.865) and China's Zhang Boheng (88.597).\n\nThe scores will reset for the team finals, though the only real question is who will join China and Japan on the podium with defending champion Russia ineligible due to the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe Japanese settled for silver at home in Tokyo in 2021, losing to the Russians by just over a tenth of a point in a close final while China took bronze a little further back.\n\n\"It was frustrating,\" Japan's Kazuma Kaya said. \"But we kept practicing every day for success today. Next time, in (the team final), I want the gold medal.\"\n\nThe gold isn't the only medal in question. Bronze is a toss-up, too, though Britain made a strong case by topping the first subdivision, a group that included the U.S. Ukraine overcame a nightmarish set on high bar to slip past the U.S. and into fourth at 253.893, dropping the Americans into fifth at 253.229.\n\nItaly, Switzerland and Canada also advanced to the finals, with the Canadians claiming the eighth and final spot by less than a quarter of a point over Turkey.\n\nThe British insist they don't have any sort of rivalry with the U.S., even if the two programs have spent the better part of a decade jockeying for position at nearly every major international event.\n\nBritain sent a very real if unspoken message: it is more than capable of grabbing a bronze to go with the one it somewhat unexpectedly won in London a dozen years ago.\n\nJake Jarman's 84.897 all-around total was just ahead of teammate Joe Fraser while Max Whitlock -- in his fourth and final Games -- fought off the jitters he knew would come to score a 15.133 on pommel horse and give Britain plenty of momentum.\n\n\"A lot of people have asked me that question in terms of How's it feel to be above the U.S.?'\" Whitlock said. \"To be honest, you take it with a pinch of salt. I think it's really important to kind of just think about our job.\"\n\nRussia's absence creates a medal opportunity for the U.S., Britain and Ukraine behind another duel between China and Japan for gold. Still, Whitlock downplayed the idea that if Russia was involved, a team medal for anyone outside the sport's Big Three would be out of the question.\n\n\"If they were in, you'd like to think that they'd be up near the top,\" Whitlock said. \"So with them not, of course, there's a little bit of (a better opportunity to medal), but only a little bit.\"\n\nThe American men -- hoping to repeat the bronze they won at the world championships last fall -- weren't nearly as sharp in front of an audience that included U.S. First Lady Jill Biden, who clapped along with American star Frederick Richard's floor routine and posed for pictures with a somewhat subdued team afterward.\n\nWhile Richard called the experience \"pretty sick,\" he regretted not being able to show Biden a \"cooler\" routine after he scored a 13.833, a bit below what he knows he'll need to medal in the all-around finals next week.\n\nRichard wasn't the only one. The U.S. arrived in Paris hoping to earn a team medal at the Olympics for the first time since a bronze in Beijing 16 years ago. While that certainly remains on the table, Richard & Co. will need to be significantly better going forward after pommel horse specialist Stephen Nedoroscik became the only American to make an apparatus final.\n\nBrody Malone, who returned from a catastrophic leg injury in March 2023 to win the U.S. Championships in early June and make his second Olympic team, fell once on pommel horse and twice on high bar.\n\nHis second miscue on high bar -- a high-risk, high-reward event in which Malone won gold at the 2022 world championships -- forced the Americans to use Asher Hong's 12.600, one of the reasons the U.S. ended up 3.322 behind Britain.\n\n\"It was definitely not perfect,\" U.S. high-performance director Brett McClure said. \"And it was a few too many mistakes. I feel leading into team finals we need to clean some things up.\" (AP)", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The whole team erupted into celebration as if they had just won gold despite Japan being the true victors, surging back from fifth place at the halfway point to deliver heartbreak to China.\n\n\"I was like, five feet in the air jumping,\" U.S. gymnast Frederick Richard exclaimed as he described the moment.\n\nThat energy had been building throughout the event as the Americans stuck landing after landing, igniting belief they could stand on the team medals podium for the first time since the 2008 Beijing Games.\n\n\"Every stick builds the momentum,\" Richard said.\n\nThe Americans opened Monday's team final on still rings, a great place to start according to the U.S. men's high performance director.\n\n\"We knew we could go three-for-three easily,\" Brett McClure told reporters, before explaining that Asher Hong's massive vault in the next rotation kicked the guys into gear.\n\n\"Once he put that on his feet I was like, now we're rolling,\" McClure said.\n\nThe Americans then worked through parallel bars, horizontal bar and floor exercise, besting their scores from qualifications on each apparatus.\n\nMalone's horizontal bar effort marked redemption after suffering two uncharacteristic falls during qualifying, but a focused mindset was the key to success on Monday.\n\n\"(The team) made it a very strong point before going into the competition that we were going to make sure to stay in our bubble,\" Malone told reporters.\n\nRichard hopes the Americans' clutch performance in Paris has made an impact on the next generation.\n\n\"I think a lot of young boys watching are inspired by us, and that makes me really happy.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Gabrielle T\u00e9trault-Farber)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News &

Not so much. Coming off his third national all-around title in Fort Worth last month, he looked more like the gymnast still rehabbing from a horrific knee/leg injury last year that required three surgeries. He misfired once on the pommel horse Saturday and needed three starts on the high bar, his specialty.\n\nPraised by his teammates for his unflappable nature, he nevertheless apologized to them after the U.S. finished second in its subdivision Saturday to Great Britain, 256.561 to 253.229.\n\nHere's why that's problematic: China, with its 13 world championships and bronze from Tokyo, and Japan, defending silver medalist and last year's world champs, are overwhelming favorites for the top two spots in Monday's finals. Third place is probably up for grabs between the U.S. and Great Britain, which took third and fourth, respectively, at last year's worlds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe U.S. men will need a rebound by Malone to have any shot at their first medal since 2008.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHong is counting on it.\n\nPhotos: Highs and lows for Team USA in men's gymnastics qualifying at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris 22 imagesView Gallery\n\n\"Some days you're gonna be off and some days you're gonna be on,\" said Hong, who grew up in Plano and now lives outside Houston. \"But, I mean, you know, Brody's a dog and a competitor, so I know he's gonna give it his all in the team finals.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike Richards, Juda and Nedoroscik, top scorer of the subdivision in the pommel horse, Hong didn't hold back. His scores led the U.S. in rings (14.633), floor (14.100) and vault (14.566, his average on the two attempts required of contenders for the vault finals). He's third overall in rings, fifth on vault and sixth on floor.\n\nBecause Nedoroscik competes on the pommel horse in Hong's place, the latter is ineligible for the all-around, which requires points from all six events.\n\nHong said he tried to treat the qualifier as if it were any old meet, but it was hard to tell by his results and reactions. During Richard's floor routine, you could hear Hong's screams in the upper regions of Bercy Arena.\n\n\"I wanted to tone it down a little bit because it's not team finals,\" he said. \"And, you know, it's not a marathon, it's a sprint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We've got a long week ahead of us.\"\n\nMalone made it a little bit longer Saturday. Brett McClure, the men's high-performance director, said he was \"surprised\" by the two-time Olympian's day. He conceded they must get him right for Monday in order to have a shot at a team medal. Finishing fifth, as they have in the last three Olympics, is getting a little stale. They'd looked ready for something better after finishing third at the World Championships, when McClure called the goal of a medal \"attainable.\"\n\nThey can still win one, but it looks harder from here.\n\n\"We can't hold anything back in the team finals,\" McClure said Saturday. \"Great Britain looks amazing.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust like the future looks for Hong, only 20. His family -- father, Rick; mother, Karen; and brothers Xander, 18, and Kiefer, 16 -- got a close-up view of his Olympic coming-out party Saturday, though Asher couldn't exactly pinpoint where they were. He thought he could hear his mother, which is saying something, given the racket the crowd made for the Americans.\n\nPretty soon the family will take its act on the road, when Xander joins Asher this fall at Stanford. He'll get to see his big brother as BMOC.\n\nNot a little ironic, too, seeing as how both Xander and Kiefer are each at least a head taller. Asked if they give him a hard time about being the shortest of the Brothers Hong, Asher smiled and said, \"Sometimes.\"\n\nHe said it over his shoulder, as a team official whisked him off to a meeting with the First Lady. Not a bad day at all. They'll just need a better one Monday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter/X: @KSherringtonDMN\n\nRelated StoriesView MoreRussian media throw shade at Paris Olympics, which TV won't showOlympic medal tracker:

But they became tangible at Stanford, Michigan, and Penn State.\n\nSo, when it was time for those dreams to become fully, vividly realized inside a raucous Bercy Arena on Monday night, they leaned on the experiences they gained during all those meets in all those sometimes sparsely filled gyms that taught them about pressure and teamwork and belief.\n\nYes, the bronze medal the Americans so emphatically earned ended a 16-year drought on the sport's biggest stage.\n\nYet it was also a message to athletic directors at the dozen schools that still have Division I gymnastics -- and to be honest, to the ones that don't, too -- that the sport is worth saving.\n\n\"If you want to keep seeing USA Gymnastics and Team USA on a gymnastics podium, at least on the men's side, you're going to have to give us more opportunities to compete in college,\" said Juda, who is in graduate school at Michigan.\n\nThose opportunities are in danger of vanishing quickly, thanks to a rapidly evolving college sports landscape. It's a reality the five men who stood on the podium with their arms around each other are only too aware of.\n\nRichard, a rising junior at Michigan, has made it his life's mission to bring more people to a side of the sport that -- at least in the U.S. -- has long plugged along anonymously.\n\nAnd while he's carved out a rapidly expanding niche on social media, Richard is savvy enough to understand the one thing guaranteed to attract people to men's gymnastics isn't a viral video, but hardware like the medal he kept grabbing in the giddy aftermath.\n\n\"My goal even here was to make a statement that the U.S. is getting stronger and stronger, and we're only [going up],\" Richard said. \"And I think we did that today. I think a lot of young boys watching are inspired by us.\"\n\nThat's the way it was for Richard as a kid in the Boston suburbs. There were pictures on the wall at the gym of the medal-winning 2004 and 2008 U.S. men's Olympic teams. Richard would stare at the pictures and wonder how those teams put all the pieces together.\n\n\"It looks like they all came together on the same day and just did like these perfect routines,\" Richard said. \"And you're like, how is that possible?\"\n\nRichard found out firsthand.\n\nThe Americans didn't record a major fall during any of their 18 routines in the final and finished closer to second-place China than fourth-place Britain. They leaned into the energy from a vocal contingent of U.S. fans that offered a hint of what it might look like in Los Angeles four years from now.\n\nMostly, however, they leaned on each other and their experiences to shake off an iffy qualifying session on Saturday in which they finished a sloppy fifth.\n\n\"We just told each other we were gonna treat it like an NCAA championships because we've all been there,\" Malone said. \"And it's high pressure competing for a team. And it's no different [in] this competition. I mean, yeah, this one's a little bit different, a little bit bigger. But same concept.\"\n\nWith perhaps a much more impactful result.\n\nNedoroscik is 26. Malone is 24. Juda is 23. Hong and Richard are 20. There is a feeling of real momentum within the U.S. men's program for the first time in a while. Yet to keep it going, the pipeline behind them needs to keep churning.\n\nThere was a sense in the 2010s that the U.S. had grown stale in part because those at the core group at the top grew a little too comfortable, due in part to a lack of competition from those trying to catch them.\n\nSam Mikulak went to three Olympics with teams that had considerable talent. He never came home with a medal, though on Monday night he was chatting with Nedoroscik as he prepared for his pommel-horse set that served as the exclamation point.\n\nWhile they talked, Mikulak told Nedoroscik to stay calm, that 80 percent of his best would be good enough. To soak in a moment Mikulak dreamed of, but never quite grasped.\n\nAnd when Nedoroscik gracefully swooped from one end of the horse to the other, his hands working dutifully in tandem on an event that has given the Americans fits for years, the bronze that felt in some ways like gold was won.\n\nStanding there in the aftermath, Mikulak couldn't help but speculate about what might lie ahead.\n\n\"I think the guys are going to be hungry for more,\" he said. \"And hopefully this spurs men's gymnastics in the U.S. like never before.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com",

In the span of one Olympic moment, those specs have become something of an internet sensation. They are not, however, some prop a la Miranda Priestly in \"The Devil Wears Prada,\" tossed on and off for effect; Nedoroscik has a disease that renders his eyes permanently dilated.\n\n\"But I don't need to see when I do pommel horse,\" Nedoroscik said, a bronze medal draped around his neck and a grin spread across his face. \"It's all by feel.\"\n\nNedoroscik felt his way through a two-minute set and into Olympic lore. A pommel horse specialist in Paris to do one thing exceptionally well, he was the last man to compete in Monday's men's gymnastics team final. His team in contention but not yet assured of its first medal of any kind in 16 years, Nedoroscik discarded his glasses, walked up to the horse and started swinging.\n\nThousands of miles and an ocean away, Randy Jepson watched and knew Nedoroscik was going to clinch the medal. Some eight years ago, Nedoroscik sent him the equivalent of a cold call, emailing the Penn State gymnastics coach a video of him from high school. Though a junior Olympic champion, Nedoroscik didn't have a single college offer. His singularity of gymnastics purpose understandably made him less appealing in a sport in which few schools sponsor the sport and there are even fewer scholarships to offer. But Penn State and Jepson long have liked their pommel horse specialists; the school has produced 12 national champions in the event. He was intrigued, but Nedoroscik hadn't been to campus -- or at least Jepson didn't think he had.\n\nThen one day, scrolling through social media, the coach spied a picture on Nedoroscik's feed of some very familiar squirrels hanging around a very familiar spot.\n\n\"It was Penn State squirrels in the Penn State parking garage,\" Jepson said with a laugh. Nedoroscik had come to State College to check out Penn State and its facilities, but never told Jepson he was coming. Eventually, Jepson learned that was part of Nedoroscik's quirky charm.\n\nHe is a delightful analytical nerd, an electrical engineering major who enjoys solving (not attempting, but solving) a Rubik's Cube in his spare time. He gets ticked if it takes under 10 seconds. Yet he's also hilariously goofy, quick to poke fun at himself and the best sort of teammate. Accustomed to waiting around to do his thing, Nedoroscik pours his spare time and all of his energy into cheering on his teammates.\n\nHe did it at Penn State, where he eventually won two national titles, and he does it now, on the senior circuit. As Team USA made its way around the other five rotations in the team final, Nedoroscik could be found in full warmups, cupping his hands over his mouth and barking cheers to his teammates.\n\n\"It's not easy being a specialist,\" Jepson said. \"You have to wait around, and there's a lot of pressure to perform. But Stephen is such a joy to be around. He's an amazing, amazing teammate.\"\n\nHe also is exceptionally good at the one thing he does, though his path here has been bumpy. His last collegiate season was canceled by COVID, and his first shot at an Olympic berth ended disastrously. He fell on the first day of competition at trials, finishing third and failing to make the team. He rebounded after Tokyo to win the 2021 world championship in pommel horse, but 2022 and 2023 was pockmarked with as many lows and highs.\n\nThe analyst in Nedoroscik considered his circumstances, realizing he was more hellbent on winning than simply doing his routine. That wasn't how Jepson taught him to do things.\n\n\"One thing at a time, that's it,\" Jepson said. So Nedoroscik went back to his roots, worrying only about finishing his first Russian flop, an incredibly difficult skill but the first in his routine. From there he went to the second and so forth, solving the pommel horse with the same diligence he took to the Rubik's Cube.\n\nThe result is a man who manages to stay calm in the face of inordinate pressure. What Nedoroscik had to go through during the team final is not nice. The luck of the draw -- bad in this case -- put the U.S. on the rings to start, which means, as you roll around the competition floor in a counterclockwise direction, pommel horse would be last. The lineups are stacked as well. Three athletes compete on each apparatus, and all three scores count. They go worst to best, which means Nedoroscik would be the last man on the last apparatus for the U.S.\n\nThe men's team does not score-watch. When the public address announcers share the standings after each rotation, Frederick Richard and Nedoroscik cover their ears and yell, \"La la la la,\" to block out the information. But the crowd tells you what you don't want to know, and so do the routines. The United States hit one routine after another -- eventually going a perfect 18 for 18 -- and the noise in a very heavily pro-U.S. crowd picked up like a steady crescendo. Chants of \"U-S-A\" filled Bercy Arena, and even if you didn't know what exactly was going on, it was impossible to not know what was actually going on.\n\nBy the time they rolled around to the last rotation, they were poised to medal. But they had to hit the routines to ensure it. Paul Juda nailed his, as did Brody Malone, and then came Nedoroscik. The morning of the competition, he posted a video of a solved Rubik's Cube on his Instagram. Done in 9.321 seconds.\n\n\"Good omen,\" he wrote.\n\nBack in State College, Jepson saw the video and thought the same. Then he sat down in his house, flipped on the TV and watched Nedoroscik begin to swing.\n\n\"He did that first Russian flop, and I said, 'Oh, he's got this,\" Jepson said. \"He absolutely has this.\"\n\nNedoroscik kept swinging, dismounted, and grabbed his glasses. He could see clearly, all the way to the bronze medal that eventually hung around his neck.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

(WHDH) - Massachusetts Olympic gymnasts Stephen Nedoroscik and Frederick Richard helped clinch the bronze medal for Team USA Monday, with the moment making its rounds online and across TV channels.\n\nNow, Nedoroscik, 25, of Worcester, and Richard, 20, of Stoughton, will be returning to the state as hometown heroes.\n\nAs soon as Nedoroscik dismounted from the pommel horse -- his specialty -- during the men's gymnastics team final at the Paris 2024 Olympics, his teammates hugged him with great fervor.\n\nSome are calling the Worcester gymnast Clark Kent, because he took off his glasses and became a hero up there on the gym floor.\n\n\"He just fell in love with the pommel horse and kind of just became obsessed,\" said Jon Rydzefski, who trained with him at Sterling Gym, north of Worcester. \"And that was his thing, that's what he only wanted to do, all the time. He'd get pried away to do the other events, because you had to at that age.\"\n\n\"But, his heart, that's what he wanted to go to and all that work paid off,\" Rydzefski continued.\n\nAlso making his mark, Richard competed in the floor exercise, parallel bars, horizontal bar, and still rings events, pushing his team to a solid bronze medal -- the first U.S. men's gymnastics team medal since 2008.\n\nStoughton Public Schools hosted an Olympics watch party Monday night, with Richard's family members, former teachers, and local community members in attendance. On the district's Facebook page, Richard's headshot sits front and center as the account's cover photo.\n\nStoughton High School Principal Juliette Miller couldn't be prouder.\n\n\"He met with me around his sophomore year or late freshman year, told me that he was going to be in the Olympics. That's what his goal was. He was striving for that. We've known all along to expect great things from him,\" Miller said.\n\nBack at the Sterling gym, young gymnasts said they were determined to follow in the Olympians' footsteps.\n\n\"It's pretty crazy to think about an Olympian doing gymnastics where I'm doing gymnastics,\" said Jacob Jones.\n\nRichard is scheduled to compete again Wednesday, and Nedoroscik will be back on the pommel horse Saturday.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 Sunbeam Television.

I think it's really important to kind of just think about our job.\"\n\nOne that Whitlock and his four teammates did extremely well over two-plus hours in front of an audience that included U.S. first lady Jill Biden, who clapped along with American star Frederick Richard's floor routine and posed for pictures with a somewhat subdued team afterward.\n\nWhile Richard called the experience \"pretty sick,\" he regretted not being able to show Biden a \"cooler\" routine after he scored a 13.833, a bit below what he knows he'll need in order to medal in the all-around finals next week.\n\nRichard wasn't the only one. The U.S. arrived in Paris hoping to earn a team medal for the first time since a bronze in Beijing 16 years ago. While that certainly remains on the table, Richard & Co. will need to be sharper on Monday night.\n\nBrody Malone, who returned from a catastrophic leg injury in March 2023 to make his second Olympic team, fell once on pommel horse and twice on high bar and likely will miss all-around and event finals.\n\nThe second miscue on high bar -- a high-risk, high-reward event in which Malone won gold at the 2022 world championships -- forced the Americans to use Asher Hong's 12.600, one of the reasons the U.S. ended up 3.322 behind Britain.\n\n\"It was definitely not perfect,\" U.S. high performance director Brett McClure said. \"And it was a few too many mistakes. I feel leading into team finals we need to clean some things up.\"\n\nMalone's miscues opened the door for Paul Juda. The 23-year-old doesn't do the most difficult gymnastics, focusing more on execution to stay competitive. McClure put Juda up first on five of the six events, a position that requires more than a little mental toughness because it can set the tone for an entire rotation.\n\nJuda seems uniquely suited for the position.\n\n\"I just knew that if they put me first, that I earned that myself,\" said Juda, a Michigan student who says he has worked extensively with a sports psychologist over the last couple of years. \"And with my team behind me ... I was ready for it.\"\n\nWhen Malone faltered, it created an opportunity to compete in the all-around finals that few -- perhaps Juda himself at some point -- saw coming.\n\n\"I think today would have been one of those things where I got to say I did all-around at the Olympics, but then to hopefully be making an all-around final, I think that's the cooler thing,\" Juda said. \"And, you know, the coolest thing is yet to come.\"\n\nQualifying continues later Saturday, with longtime rivals and gold medal favorites Japan and China competing in the second of three subdivisions. The top eight team finishers advance to the team finals on Monday.\n\nThe one superpower that won't be in the mix is Russia. The defending Olympic champions will miss the Paris Games as part of the fallout of the war with Ukraine. Russia's absence creates an opportunity for the U.S., Britain and perhaps Ukraine to reach the podium.\n\n\"If they were in, you'd like to think that they'd be up near the top,\" Whitlock said. \"So

I think it's really important to kind of just think about our job.\"\n\nOne that Whitlock and his four teammates did extremely well over two-plus hours in front of an audience that included U.S. first lady Jill Biden, who clapped along with American star Frederick Richard's floor routine and posed for pictures with a somewhat subdued team afterward.\n\nWhile Richard called the experience \"pretty sick,\" he regretted not being able to show Biden a \"cooler\" routine after he scored a 13.833, a bit below what he knows he'll need in order to medal in the all-around finals next week.\n\nRichard wasn't the only one. The U.S. arrived in Paris hoping to earn a team medal for the first time since a bronze in Beijing 16 years ago. While that certainly remains on the table, Richard & Co. will need to be sharper on Monday night.\n\nBrody Malone, who returned from a catastrophic leg injury in March 2023 to make his second Olympic team, fell once on pommel horse and twice on high bar and likely will miss all-around and event finals.\n\nThe second miscue on high bar -- a high-risk, high-reward event in which Malone won gold at the 2022 world championships -- forced the Americans to use Asher Hong's 12.600, one of the reasons the U.S. ended up 3.322 behind Britain.\n\n\"It was definitely not perfect,\" U.S. high performance director Brett McClure said. \"And it was a few too many mistakes. I feel leading into team finals we need to clean some things up.\"\n\nMalone's miscues opened the door for Paul Juda. The 23-year-old doesn't do the most difficult gymnastics, focusing more on execution to stay competitive. McClure put Juda up first on five of the six events, a position that requires more than a little mental toughness because it can set the tone for an entire rotation.\n\nJuda seems uniquely suited for the position.\n\n\"I just knew that if they put me first, that I earned that myself,\" said Juda, a Michigan student who says he has worked extensively with a sports psychologist over the last couple of years. \"And with my team behind me ... I was ready for it.\"\n\nWhen Malone faltered, it created an opportunity to compete in the all-around finals that few -- perhaps Juda himself at some point -- saw coming.\n\n\"I think today would have been one of those things where I got to say I did all-around at the Olympics, but then to hopefully be making an all-around final, I think that's the cooler thing,\" Juda said. \"And, you know, the coolest thing is yet to come.\"\n\nQualifying continues later Saturday, with longtime rivals and gold medal favorites Japan and China competing in the second of three subdivisions. The top eight team finishers advance to the team finals on Monday.\n\nThe one superpower that won't be in the mix is Russia. The defending Olympic champions will miss the Paris Games as part of the fallout of the war with Ukraine. Russia's absence creates an opportunity for the U.S., Britain and perhaps Ukraine to reach the podium.\n\n\"If they were in, you'd like to think that they'd be up near the top,\" Whitlock said. \"So with them not, of course, there's a little bit of (a better opportunity to medal) but only a little bit.\"", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"},

Ukraine overcame a high-bar nightmare to overtake the United States and move into fourth place with 253.893 points, with the Americans fifth with 253.229 points.\n\nThe United States, which finished third at the 2023 world championships, arrived in Paris confident it had a legitimate chance of winning a medal in the team competition for the first time since winning bronze in Beijing 16 years ago.\n\nThree-time U.S. champion Brody Malone fell twice on the high bar and once on the pommel horse during men's gymnastics qualifying and will not advance to the all-around final. AP Photo/Morry Gash\n\nMalone's second error on the high bar - a high-risk, high-reward event on which he won gold at the 2022 world championships - forced the Americans to use Asher Hong's 12.600, one of the reasons the United States fell 3.322 behind Great Britain in the first subdivision.\n\n\"It definitely wasn't perfect,\" U.S. high performance director Brett McClure said. \"And there were a few too many mistakes. I think going into the team finals, we need to improve on some things.\"\n\nFrederick Richard and Paul Juda will represent the Americans in the all-around final.\n\nChina's five-man team, without veteran Sun Wei after he was injured during training on Thursday, used a series of spectacular routines on the rings and parallel bars to establish themselves as favourites heading into Monday's final.\n\nJapan's Hashimoto will have a chance to defend his all-around title, but he won't be able to do so on the high bar, his favourite event, after stumbling on his dismount. He appeared to be suffering from discomfort in his right shoulder for much of the afternoon and was treated by a Japanese team coach shortly after finishing on the high bars.\n\nHashimoto finished third overall after two subdivisions with a score of 85.064, behind teammate Shinnosuke Oka (86.865) and China's Zhang Boheng (88.597).\n\nThe scores will be reset for the team finals, although the only real question is who will join Japan and China on the podium, with defending champions Russia ineligible due to the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe British put on a flawless display over six rounds. Jake Jarman (84.897) and Joe Fraser (84.666) posted the best all-around scores, and six-time Olympic medallist Max Whitlock, 31, provided a boost with an electric pommel horse routine - his favourite event - that took the pressure off him.\n\n\"A lot of people have asked me this question: 'How does it feel to be above the United States?'\" said Whitlock, who is competing in his fourth and final Games. \"To be honest, you have to take it with a grain of salt. I think it's really important to think about our job.\"\n\nWith a time of 15.133, Whitlock was trailed only by American Stephen Nedoroscik, a 25-year-old specialist whose time of 15.200 likely earned him a spot in the final and gave his teammates an early boost.\n\n\"It went really well today. I handled my nerves really well,\" Nedoroscik said. \"I worked my whole life to get to those 45 seconds.\"\n\n\"It's the biggest stage in the world for sure. It only happens once every four years, but at the same time, I'm putting chalk on my hands and doing the horse for the team, it's nothing different.\"\n\nRichard scored 13.833 on floor for the Americans, just below what he knows he'll need to medal in the all-around final next week.\n\nWhile Richard, who won bronze in the all-around at the 2023 world championships, was expected to lead, Judah's performance was somewhat surprising.\n\nJuda, 23, who broke down in tears after being selected for the five-man Olympic team, raised his arms in the air after his floor walk. His overall total of 82.865 points puts him fourth among the early qualifiers, behind Richard (83.498), Jarman and Fraser.\n\n\"I think today I could have said I did the all-around at the Olympics, but I also hope to be able to make the all-around final, I think that's the coolest part,\" Judah said. \"And you know, the coolest thing is yet to come.\"\n\nNedoroscik will also compete in the team final, where three men per country will compete on each apparatus and all three scores will count.\n\nThe third subdivision will end later Saturday. The top eight teams will advance to the team final on Monday.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 24, 2020, / Compare-autoinsurance.Org has launched a new blog post that presents the main benefits of comparing multiple car insurance quotes.

After his big night, Nedoroscik got a two-word message from girlfriend Tess McCracken on Instagram.\n\n\"History = Made,\" McCracken wrote on Instagram.\n\nMcCracken, who posted Instagram stories throughout the day cheering on her boyfriend, went on to say how proud she was of his accomplishment.\n\n\"The most insane, magical day watching you close it out to bring home the first team medal for USA in sixteen years\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8. Words can't capture how proud I am of you.\"\n\nStephen Nedoroscik's Girlfriend a Star in Her Own Right\n\nMcCracken and Nedoroscik were both collegiate gymnasts at Penn State. In her senior season, McCracken was nominated for the AAI Award, an award given to the nation's most outstanding senior. She also earned a spot on the Academic All-Big Ten selection and was named a Big Ten Distinguished Scholar.\n\nThe couple met on campus before their freshmen year started and dated all four years. When they graduated in 2020, Nedoroscik took to Instagram to share his love for McCracken.\n\n\"Four years ago I had my entire collegiate experience ahead of me. Little did I know I had already found my favorite part about college. I love you @tess.mccracken and happy four years.\"\n\nStephen Nedoroscik's Big Night in Paris\n\nNedoroscik has been something of a specialist for Team USA, competing exclusively on the pommel horse dating back to his high school days, USA Today's Tom Schad reported.\n\nHeading into Monday's team competition, Nedoroscik admitted that he felt some pressure, especially because of his long wait to compete.\n\n\"(But) I thought about it before, about how I get to be the last person that goes in the Olympics,\" Nedoroscik said. \"I put that in my head as a positive. Like, I can be the exclamation point.\"\n\nBut Nedoroscik's unusual preparation gained some viral interest, with television cameras catching his meditative moments on the sidelines as he waited for his turn to compete. He delivered when it mattered, turning in a show-stopping performance on the pommel horse and earning a score of 14.866, good enough to earn the United States its first medal in the team all-around since 2008.\n\nNedoroscik struggled at times before Paris, falling in the 2021 Olympic trials and ultimately being replaced on Team USA. He also missed the final at the world championships in 2022, where the American team finished fifth, Schad noted.\n\nBut when it mattered the most at the Paris Olympics, Nedoroscik delivered.\n\n\"It's like a Cinderella story, fairy tale ending,\" said Sam Mikulak, one of Nedoroscik's coaches. \"I just hope everyone starts believing and gives him the credit that's due - especially Team USA, for creating the procedures that got him on the team.\"\n\nAfter his performance helped secure a medal for the United States, Nedoroscik took a moment to soak it all in.\n\n\"It was just the greatest moment of my life, I think,\" Nedoroscik said.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nathan_dougherty@heavy.com", "name": "Nathan Dougherty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAI_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AAI Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Olympic_&_Paralympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2004_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's_artistic_team_all-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's artistic team all-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_artistic_team_all-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's artistic team all-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinderella (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Mikulak", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Mikulak"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rope_Skipping/Clubs_and_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rope Skipping/Clubs and Teams", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Stephen-Nedoroscik-e1722309073177.jpg?quality=65&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 87, "textEnd": 94}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Hashimoto appeared to be dealing with right shoulder discomfort for much of the afternoon and was tended to by a Team Japan trainer shortly after finishing up on still rings.\n\nHashimoto is currently third in the all-around through two subdivisions at 85.064, behind teammate Shinnousuke Oka (86.865) and China's Zhang Boheng (88.597).\n\nThe scores will reset for in the team finals, though the only real question is who will join them on the podium with defending champion Russia ineligible due to the war in Ukraine.\n\nBritain is in third after topping the first subdivision with 256.561. Ukraine overcame a nightmarish set on high bar to slip past the U.S. and into fourth at 253.893, with the Americans fifth at 253.229.\n\nThe British insist they don't have any sort of rivalry with the U.S., even if the two programs have spent the better part of a decade jockeying for position at nearly every major international event.\n\nBritain sent a very real if unspoken message: it is more than capable of grabbing a bronze to go with the one it somewhat unexpectedly won in London a dozen years ago.\n\nJake Jarman's 84.897 all-around total was just ahead of teammate Joe Fraser while Max Whitlock -- in his fourth and final Games -- fought off the jitters he knew would come to score a 15.133 on pommel horse and give Britain plenty of momentum.\n\n\"A lot of people have asked me that question in terms of 'How's it feel to be above the U.S.?'\" Whitlock said. \"To be honest, you take it with a pinch of salt. I think it's really important to kind of just think about our job.\"\n\nOne that Whitlock and his four teammates did extremely well over two-plus hours in front of an audience that included U.S. first lady Jill Biden, who clapped along with American star Frederick Richard's floor routine and posed for pictures with a somewhat subdued team afterward.\n\nWhile Richard called the experience \"pretty sick,\" he regretted not being able to show Biden a \"cooler\" routine after he scored a 13.833, a bit below what he knows he'll need in order to medal in the all-around finals next week.\n\nRichard wasn't the only one. The U.S. arrived in Paris hoping to earn a team medal for the first time since a bronze in Beijing 16 years ago. While that certainly remains on the table, Richard & Co. will need to be sharper in the finals.\n\nBrody Malone, who returned from a catastrophic leg injury in March 2023 to make his second Olympic team, fell once on pommel horse and twice on high bar and likely will miss all-around and event finals.\n\nThe second miscue on high bar -- a high-risk, high-reward event in which Malone won gold at the 2022 world championships -- forced the Americans to use Asher Hong's 12.600, one of the reasons the U.S. ended up 3.322 behind Britain.\n\n\"It was definitely not perfect,\" U.S. high performance director Brett McClure said. \"And it was a few too many mistakes. I feel leading into team finals we need to clean some things up.\"\n\nMalone's miscues opened the door for Paul Juda. The 23-year-old doesn't do the most difficult gymnastics, focusing more on execution to stay competitive. McClure put Juda up first on five of the six events, a position that requires more than a little mental toughness because it can set the tone for an entire rotation.\n\nJuda seems uniquely suited for the position.\n\n\"I just knew that if they put me first, that I earned that myself,\" said Juda, a Michigan student who says he has worked extensively with a sports psychologist over the last couple of years. \"And with my team behind me ... I was ready for it.\"\n\nWhen Malone faltered, it created an opportunity to compete in the all-around finals that few -- perhaps Juda himself at some point -- saw coming.\n\n\"I think today would have been one of those things where I got to say I did all-around at the Olympics, but then to hopefully be making an all-around final, I think that's the cooler thing,\" Juda said. \"And, you know, the coolest thing is yet to come.\"\n\nRussia's absence creates an opportunity for the U.S., Britain and Ukraine to reach the podium in the finals, which figures to be another duel between China and Japan.\n\nStill, Whitlock downplayed the idea that if Russia was involved, a team medal would be out of the question.\n\n\"If they were in, you'd like to think that they'd be up near the top,\" Whitlock said. \"So with them not, of course, there's a little bit of (a better opportunity to medal), but only a little bit.\"\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games",

The Americans posted a total of 257.793 points to edge Britain for the bronze. Frederick Richard and Brody Malone were at the top of their game, and every member of the US team contributed.

The Japanese team, which trailed by more than three points going into the last apparatus, overtook its rivals after China's Su Weide fell twice off the horizontal bar and Xiao Ruoteng underperformed under pressure. Russia, which won gold at the Tokyo Games, is not competing in Paris because of its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe women's final, featuring seven-time Olympic medalist Simone Biles, takes place on Tuesday.

Their goal of a podium is within reach, we could see them sticking together after having successfully completed this rotation on the high bar.\n\n\"We wanted to make sure we didn't get sidetracked by the moment,\" Judah said. \"We were definitely in a kind of flow and the last thing we wanted to do was rush. There were still two critical events left and without successful events, there was no way this was going to happen. So this was a turning point.\"\n\nJudah, Hong and Richard gave the team exactly what they needed during the floor rotation, with the highlight being the crowd's reaction to Richard's blocked landings in the second half of his routine. The U.S. team remained third overall after floor, leaving three pommel horse routines between them and an Olympic medal.\n\nJudah and Malone both posted higher scores than they had in qualifying in first and second place, leaving Nedoroscik, the pommel horse specialist, to close out the round for the United States. In an effort to prepare and remain oblivious to the scores, both from other countries and his own team, Nedoroscik had taken the high bar and floor rotations off the competition floor in the warm-up room. As Nedoroscik prepared to compete, he said he wasn't aware that his routine would decide whether his country would win a team medal. He was only aware of the energy coming from his teammates ahead of him.\n\n\"I could hear all the guys cheering, it seemed to be going really well,\" Nedoroscik said. \"At that point, I knew all the guys had nailed all the routines. I have this thing where if everyone else does it before me, I never fail.\"\n\nThat tradition continued for Nedoroscik. Before his feet even touched the mat on his downhill run, the arena was filled with thunderous applause and collective cheers. His teammates wasted no time as he was greeted with a series of bear hugs on the floor. Once the scores were finalized and the number 3 was displayed on the screen next to USA, it took only moments for American flags to be draped across the backs of each team member. A series of American chants began again, this time a little louder.\n\n\"It's surreal,\" Richard said. \"We're all going to make history.\"\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Judah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Judah"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horizontal bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karl Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downhill_(ski_competition)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Downhill (ski competition)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surrealism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Scenario", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Scenario", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.imgur.com/AoyxWyw.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

But they became tangible at Stanford, Michigan and Penn State.\n\nSo when it was time for those dreams to become fully, vividly realized inside a raucous Bercy Arena on Monday night, they leaned on the experiences they gained during all those meets in all those sometimes sparsely filled gyms that taught them about pressure and teamwork and belief.\n\nYes, the bronze medal the Americans so emphatically earned ended a 16-year drought on the sport's biggest stage.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It's a reality the five men who stood on the podium with their arms around each other are only too aware of.\n\nRichard, a rising junior at Michigan, has made it his life's mission to bring more people to a side of the sport that -- at least in the U.S. anyway -- has long plugged along anonymously.\n\nAnd while he's carved out a rapidly expanding niche on social media, Richard is savvy enough to understand the one thing guaranteed to attract people to men's gymnastics isn't a viral video, but hardware like the medal he kept grabbing in the giddy aftermath.\n\n\"My goal even here was to make a statement that the U.S. is getting stronger and stronger and we're only (going up),\" Richard said. \"And I think we did that today. I think a lot of young boys watching are inspired by us.\"\n\nThat's the way it was for Richard as a kid in the Boston suburbs. There were pictures on the wall at the gym of the medal-winning 2004 and 2008 U.S. men's Olympic teams. Richard would stare at the pictures and wonder how those teams put all the pieces together.\n\n\"It looks like they all came together on the same day and just did like these perfect routines,\" Richard said. \"And you're like, how is that possible?\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nRichard found out firsthand.\n\nThe Americans didn't record a major fall during any of their 18 routines in the final and finished closer to second-place China than fourth-place Britain. They leaned into the energy from a vocal contingent of U.S. fans that offered a hint of what it might look like in Los Angeles four years from now.\n\nMostly, however, they leaned on each other and their experiences to shake off an iffy qualifying session on Saturday in which they finished a sloppy fifth.\n\n\"We just told each other we were gonna treat it like an NCAA championships because we've all been there,\" Malone said. \"And it's high pressure competing for a team. And it's no different this competition. I mean yeah, this one's a little bit different, a little bit bigger. But same concept.\"\n\nWith perhaps a much more impactful result.\n\nNedoroscik is 26. Malone is 24. Juda is 23. Hong and Richard are 20. There is a feeling of real momentum within the U.S. men's program for the first time in a while. Yet to keep it going, the pipeline behind them needs to keep churning.\n\nMalone was born in 2000 in Johnson City, Tennessee, before his family moved to Georgia.\n\nThere was a sense in the 2010s that the U.S. had grown stale in part because those at the core group at the top grew a little too comfortable due in part to a lack of competition from those trying to catch them.\n\nSam Mikulak went to three Olympics with teams that had considerable talent. He never came home with a medal, though on Monday night he was chatting with Nedoroscik as he prepared for his pommel horse set that served as the exclamation point.\n\nWhile they talked, Mikulak told Nedoroscik to stay calm, that 80 percent of his best would be good enough. To soak in a moment Mikulak dreamed of but never quite grasped.\n\nAnd when Nedoroscik gracefully swooped from one end of the horse to the other, his hands working dutifully in tandem on an event that has given the Americans fits for years, the bronze that felt in some ways like gold was won.\n\nStanding there in the aftermath, Mikulak couldn't help but speculate about what might lie ahead.\n\n\"I think the guys are going to be hungry for more,\" he said. \"And hopefully this spurs men's gymnastics in the US like never before.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your

Here's what Stephen Nedoroscik has shared about his eye conditions.\n\nU.S. gymnast Stephen Nedoroscik wears glasses, which seems to be a rarity among athletes going for the gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nHe takes them off when he competes on the pommel horse -- his only event and a dazzling routine that helped Team USA's men's gymnastics team win the bronze medal in the team final on Monday, July 29.\n\nNedoroscik's transformation from a mild-mannered bespectacled mechanical engineer on the sidelines to powerful athlete defying gravity on the pommel horse is drawing comparisons to Clark Kent turning into Superman when he removes his glasses.\n\nThe gymnast talked with TODAY co-anchor Hoda Kotb while wearing her sunglasses because of an eye sensitivity -- a condition he's talked about on social media.\n\nHere's what Nedoroscik has shared about his eyesight:\n\n\"It's not necessarily clear, but the thing about pommel horse is if I keep them on, they're gonna fly somewhere,\" Nedoroscik told TODAY about his preference to take off his glasses.\n\n\"When I go up on the pommel horse, it's all about feeling the equipment. I don't even really see when I'm doing my gymnastics. It's all in the hands -- I can feel everything.\"\n\nNedoroscik has crossed eyes -- or strabismus, the medical term for the condition, he revealed on TikTok.\n\nIt happens when a problem affects eye muscles, causing the eyes to not line up properly and point in different directions, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology.\n\nStrabismus usually develops in infants and kids under 3, but it can also start later in life, the American Optometric Association notes.\n\nPeople with strabismus can lose depth perception, or develop blurry or double vision. Glasses or contacts can help patients see better. Other treatment options include surgery, eye muscle exercises and prism lenses that help manage the misalignment of the eyes.\n\nThis genetic condition happens when some of the tissue that makes up the eye is missing at birth, according to the National Eye Institute. One or both eyes could be affected.\n\nThere are different types of coloboma depending on which part of the eye is impacted. The missing tissue could involve the eyelid, lens, macula, optic nerve, retina or middle layer of the eye, the American Academy of Ophthalmology notes.\n\nNedoroscik has talked about living with coloboma on TikTok, explaining he's photophobic, or light sensitive, because of it -- perhaps why he borrowed Hoda's sunglasses.\n\nOther symptoms include vision loss; not being able to see in a specific location, such as the upper part of the field of vision; or blindness.\n\nThere's no cure, but glasses or contact lenses can help. Some patients may need low vision aids or surgery.\n\nThey haven't made an appearance at the Olympics yet, but Nedoroscik began wearing the sports goggles his freshman year at Penn State. His college teammates called them \"The Specs,\" noting they were a Secret Santa gift that had no prescription lenses.\n\n\"They are simply for fun, kind of my trademark. I like to have fun out there,\" Nedoroscik said in a 2022 video profile, adding he considers them a good luck charm. \"From day one of competing with them, they had a little bit of magic to them.\"\n\nHe sometimes uses them for comfort and \"superstitious reasons,\" rather than improving his eyesight, according to his official Olympics profile.", "source": {"uri": "today.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TODAY.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strabismus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_artistic_team_all-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's artistic team all-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraocular_muscles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extraocular muscles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gravity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoda_Kotb", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hoda Kotb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunglasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunglasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mechanical engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coloboma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coloboma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lens"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_perception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depth perception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Optometric_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Optometric Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Ophthalmology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Academy of Ophthalmology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplopia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diplopia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Visual impairment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Children_and_Adolescents", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Children and Adolescents", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1024x512_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/gymnast-stephen-nedoroscik-glasses-zz-240730-f190f1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 478, "textEnd": 485}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

The 25-year-old American gymnast, who trains and competes in precisely one of the six events in the sport of men's artistic gymnastics, is in some ways the male answer to 2017 world champion Morgan Hurd, a bespectacled, chalk-covered hero. Unlike Hurd, however, who famously competes glasses-on, these days Nederoscik pulls a full Kent-to-Superman: competing on muscle memory, instinct, feel, and pure unadulterated American-grade will to power -- vision be damned!\n\nIf this sounds abjectly bananas, you should probably know that Nedoroscik is one of the best pommel horse workers in the world. He also just helped put the stars and stripes on the medal podium in men's gymnastics for the first time since Sarah Palin said she could see Russia from her house.\n\nTo appreciate the full extent of Nedoroscik's most recent triumph -- and that of his four teammates, Fred Richard, Paul Juda, Asher Hong, and Brody Malone -- you should probably also understand the U.S. men's program's fraught history with this sport, given that it receives markedly less media attention than women's artistic gymnastics does. (Yes, a sport where the \"default\" is the women's version!)\n\nMuch like on the women's side, the U.S. really didn't have a medal-contending program (or any medal-contending athletes) until the late 1970s, when Kurt Thomas established himself as a one-man Uncle Sam juggernaut, walking away from the 1979 world championships with six medals. Thomas also pioneered three skills, including a rollout tumbling skill that is now effectively banned across the sport (for falling-on-head reasons) and, most historically, what was once called the Thomas Flare and is now so standard across the repertoire that it's just a flare:\n\nHowever, the Olympics in which Thomas had his best shot to medal were the 1980 Moscow Games, which the U.S. famously boycotted. And indeed, the first time in modern history the U.S. men ever did win a team medal was their gold in 1984. However, this was a gold-with-an-asterisk: The Los Angeles Games were revenge-boycotted by the USSR, whose program would have decimated anyone in their vicinity. Nevertheless, the Reagan-era Wheaties industrial complex managed to gloss over this fact enough to rocket the men to stardom (as it did on the women's side with Mary Lou Retton's success). In some cases that stardom has lasted: '84 stars Bart Conner and Tim Daggett have both been successful commentators for decades. (In the short term, both Conner and certified team hot guy Mitch Gaylord also parlayed their golden fame into brief, campy, but honestly delightful movie roles.)\n\nBy the 1988 Seoul Games, though, the U.S. resumed its usual place in the men's canon: off the podium. In fact, between 1984 and 2001, not a single American man graced a world or Olympic medal stand. Between 2001 and 2008, it appeared the drought was over; this became especially true when Paul Hamm won all-around gold in Athens in 2004, and the team took away silver that year and bronze in Beijing four years later. But then, the drought resumed.\n\nYes, there were numerous individual stars, a few individual medals, and team bronzes at world championships in 2011 and 2014. But for the past three Olympics, the top three men's teams (always Japan, China, and either Russia or Great Britain) have been untouchably good. In 2024, however, with even Shein Russia banned for who knows how long -- a ban helped, in no small part, by the odious behavior of the team's gymnasts -- there has been a possible medal spot with the U.S.'s name on it. Not only that, but since 2020, the men's program has been in an aggressive rebuilding phase, and currently boasts a plethora of young talent. The program built this year's Olympic team with a bronze medal in sight -- and with some help from a disquieting if unsurprising source.\n\nJust like for our undergraduates writing papers, and I guess someone's daughter writing a \"heartfelt\" fan letter to her favorite hurdler, they let A.I. do it. All right, that's an oversimplification, but the program did run all possible score scenarios (based on performance at Olympic Trials) through an algorithm, and the team the algorithm picked was Malone, Juda, Hong, Richard, and Nedoroscik. Was it a good idea? When the U.S. team sustained numerous mistakes in qualifying last Saturday, I had my doubts. But when it came to Monday's team finals, the numbers, in the end, didn't lie.\n\nAnd that brings us back to Nedoroscik and his one event. Using a precious five-man team slot for a single event specialist would, in most configurations, seems like a bad idea. And it would be a bad idea, except for the fact that Nedoroscik's difficulty on pommels is very high. A difficulty value that high (in recent competitions his start value can near the mid-to-high 16s, depending on what he decides to do) means a final score in or near those rare 15s -- unless, of course, he falls. And I cannot emphasize enough how easy it is to fall off his event.\n\nThat possibility was at the heart of this meet's heart-pounding puzzle. I will admit that I had my doubts about this ChatGPT squad until the very last event they competed. Their placement in qualifying meant that they would end team finals on the single most brutal and nerve-destroying apparatus across all versions of gymnastics for time immemorial: that accursed pommel horse.\n\nDo you get nervous watching gymnasts on the balance beam? Sure you do! But despite the beam's formidable specs -- four inches wide; four feet off the ground -- gymnasts at least get to pause in cute little poses between physics-defying acrobatic and dance elements, to gather themselves and right small wrongs. (When these cute little poses look a little wonky, they are usually unplanned; these are what your commentators will call a \"wobble,\" \"bobble,\" or \"correction.\") So on beam, despite the terror-inducing flips and leaps, gymnasts are able to largely stop moving without technically stopping moving.\n\nDo you know what you cannot do for a single microsecond on the pommel horse? Stop moving. In addition to the general coordination all gymnastics apparatus require, this event demands simultaneous abdominal and upper body might, massive cardio stamina, intricate rhythm, and total precision of hand placement. If a gymnast goes even the slightest bit off rhythm while circling or flaring around this Kafkan torture apparatus, he's cooked. In every other event in both men's and women's gymnastics, it is not only possible but an everyday occurrence to use muscle to make a \"save\" (or prevent a fall). In pommels this is straight-up impossible. I hate this event so much! Set it on fire!\n\nOf course, if we set the pommel horse ablaze, that would mean there would be no Stephen Nedoroscik, and all timelines in this story lead back to this magnificent Weezer's IT guy-looking dude. His four teammates all did more than their part on the first five events in the final: stuck vaults! Solid rings! Great floor! Staying on the godforsaken high bar (second only to pommels on my kill list)! The bronze medal was suddenly very literally the U.S. team's to lose -- on the event where the literal best gymnasts the world has ever seen have choked.\n\nWorse yet, because the U.S. went last on pommels, and also because Nedoroscik was in the anchor spot, in order for the U.S. to clinch the bronze medal, he had to first sit in the arena with his glasses on and wait for almost three damn hours. (He was able to warm up a bit in the adjacent practice gym, but he did not get more than the usual 30-second \"touch\" on the actual podium equipment.) As my colleague Dvora Meyers put it: \"Watching the U.S. men on pommel horse in their final rotation may cause dry mouth, heart palpitations and sweaty palms. Speak to your doctor to see if watching pommels is right for you.\" I can tell you: It is not.\n\nBut then, my friends! This happened.\n\nHe did it! They did it! Sixteen-year medal drought over! Shitty qualifying meet forgotten! United States of Beyonc\u00e9 forever and ever -- amen! The much more famous women's team has called 2024 their \"redemption tour,\" but they are not alone in their redemption. The men's team final didn't just redeem (for now) the use of A.I. in sports, or the gamble of putting a one-event specialist on an Olympic team, or even glasses wearers such as myself who are unable to use contacts (represent!). Most importantly, this medal has redeemed the U.S. men's gymnastics program as world-class, because many of these guys are young and, health willing, you will see them on a medal podium again. Is it even possible that this team bronze will cause someone to, when I say I love \"gymnastics,\" ask Which gymnastics, men's or women's? Well, hold on there, Bucko. I'm all for equal rights between the sexes, but let's not get carried away.", "source": {"uri": "slate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slate Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri":

China posted a team total of 263.028, with Japan right behind in at 260.594.\n\nThe five-man Chinese team, missing veteran Sun Wei after he was injured during training Thursday, used a series of spectacular routines on rings and parallel bars to stamp itself as the favorite heading into Monday's final.\n\nJapan, the reigning world champion, dealt with a couple of uncharacteristic mistakes by current world and Olympic gold medalist Daiki Hashimoto but still finished well clear of third-place Great Britain.\n\nWhile the 22-year-old Hashimoto will get a chance to defend his title in the all-around, he won't on high bar -- his signature event -- after stumbling during his dismount. Hashimoto appeared to be dealing with right shoulder discomfort for much of the afternoon and was tended to by a Team Japan trainer shortly after finishing up on still rings though he said afterward he was not hurt.\n\nHashimoto is currently third in the all-around through two subdivisions at 85.064, behind teammate Shinnousuke Oka (86.865) and China's Zhang Boheng (88.597).\n\nThe scores will reset for the team finals, though the only real question is who will join China and Japan on the podium with defending champion Russia ineligible due to the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe Japanese settled for silver at home in Tokyo in 2021, losing to the Russians by just over a tenth of a point in a close final while China took bronze a little further back.\n\n\"It was frustrating,\" Japan's Kazuma Kaya said. \"But we kept practicing every day for success today. Next time, in (the team final), I want the gold medal.\"\n\nThe gold isn't the only medal in question. Bronze is a toss-up, too, though Britain made a strong case by topping the first subdivision, a group that included the U.S. Ukraine overcame a nightmarish set on high bar to slip past the U.S. and into fourth at 253.893, dropping the Americans into fifth at 253.229.\n\nThe British insist they don't have any sort of rivalry with the U.S., even if the two programs have spent the better part of a decade jockeying for position at nearly every major international event.\n\nBritain sent a very real if unspoken message: it is more than capable of grabbing a bronze to go with the one it somewhat unexpectedly won in London a dozen years ago.\n\nJake Jarman's 84.897 all-around total was just ahead of teammate Joe Fraser while Max Whitlock -- in his fourth and final Games -- fought off the jitters he knew would come to score a 15.133 on pommel horse and give Britain plenty of momentum.\n\n\"A lot of people have asked me that question in terms of 'How's it feel to be above the U.S.?'\" Whitlock said. \"To be honest, you take it with a pinch of salt. I think it's really important to kind of just think about our job.\"\n\nRussia's absence creates a medal opportunity for the U.S., Britain and Ukraine behind another duel between China and Japan for gold. Still, Whitlock downplayed the idea that if Russia was involved, a team medal for anyone outside the sport's Big Three would be out of the question.\n\n\"If they were in, you'd like to think that they'd be up near the top,\" Whitlock said. \"So with them not, of course, there's a little bit of (a better opportunity to medal), but only a little bit.\"\n\nThe American men -- hoping to repeat the bronze they won at the world championships last fall -- weren't nearly as sharp in front of an audience that included U.S. First Lady Jill Biden, who clapped along with American star Frederick Richard's floor routine and posed for pictures with a somewhat subdued team afterward.\n\nWhile Richard called the experience \"pretty sick,\" he regretted not being able to show Biden a \"cooler\" routine after he scored a 13.833, a bit below what he knows he'll need to medal in the all-around finals next week.\n\nRichard wasn't the only one. The U.S. arrived in Paris hoping to earn a team medal at the Olympics for the first time since a bronze in Beijing 16 years ago. While that certainly remains on the table, Richard & Co. will need to be significantly better going forward.\n\nBrody Malone, who returned from a catastrophic leg injury in March 2023 to win the U.S. Championships in early June and make his second Olympic team, fell once on pommel horse and twice on high bar.\n\nHis second miscue on high bar -- a high-risk, high-reward event in which Malone won gold at the 2022 world championships -- forced the Americans to use Asher Hong's 12.600, one of the reasons the U.S. ended up 3.322 behind Britain.\n\n\"It was definitely not perfect,\" U.S. high-performance director Brett McClure said. \"And it was a few too many mistakes. I feel leading into team finals we need to clean some things up.\"\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "idahostatejournal.com", "dataType": "news",

Credit: Tim Clayton/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nStephen Nedoroscik, aka Pommel Horse Guy, proved to be an early Team USA standout in the 2024 Paris Olympics on Monday, delivering a medal-winning performance.\n\nHowever, it wasn't just Nedoroscik's stunning performance on the pommel horse for the U.S. men's gymnastics team that had folks talking. Like a cheesy scene from She's All That, parts of the internet couldn't quite believe a dude with glasses -- gasp -- could also be a world-class gymnast. Nedoroscik also got the requisite Clark Kent comparisons, considering he has dark hair and specs.\n\nTo be clear, Nedoroscik is a world-class gymnast. He specializes in the pommel horse event -- like, that's all he does -- and he absolutely crushed his routine to secure Team USA a bronze medal, the team's first medal since 2008. The team even lifted him in triumph after his performance.\n\nThe internet was chock full of memes, praise, and, to be honest, a bit of thirst for Nedoroscik. It was pretty cool to see someone who had one job freaking nail it for the team.\n\nThe Olympics typically produce celebrities out of nowhere. Athletes who train in relative obscurity get their shot at being heroes for a day.

The Japanese men's team claimed gold with an epic comeback over its top rival China, who took the silver.\n\nTeam USA's stellar showing was a welcome improvement from Saturday's qualifying round, with the mostly green Olympic team of Frederick Richard, Paul Juda, Brody Malone, Asher Hong and pommel horse \"secret weapon\" Stephen Nedoroscik hitting all of their routines.\n\nNext up, Richard and Juda will compete in the all-around final and Nedoroscik in the pommel horse final.\n\nYuto Horigome of Japan successfully defended his Olympic gold medal in Paris after a gnarly final in which he earned the highest single-trick score. Americans Jagger Eaton and Nyjah Huston won silver and bronze.\n\nIn an all-North American podium, Katie Grimes and Emma Weyant of Team USA finished silver-bronze in women's 400m individual medley behind Summer McIntosh, the 17-year-old Canadian phenom and now first-time Olympic gold medalist.\n\nAmerican swimmers won four medals at the Olympics Monday, but none of them gold. Besides Grimes and Weyant, Ryan Murphy took a bronze in the 100-meter backstroke, and Luke Hobson earned a bronze of his own in the 200 freestyle.\n\nAmerican backstroke great Ryan Murphy hung on for a bronze medal in the men's 100m backstroke final, behind Thomas Ceccon of Italy and Xu Jiayu of China.\n\nOn the clay court where he won 14 French Open titles, Rafael Nadal likely bid adieu to Roland Garros on Day 3 of the Paris Olympics. First seed Novak Djokovic bested Nadal 6-1, 6-4 to punch his ticket to Round 3.\n\nAfter the defeat, the two-time Olympic champion was weary of being asked about his future. And he's still playing at the Olympics, pairing with Carlos Alcaraz in doubles for Spain.\n\nA'ja Wilson and Breanna Stewart were dominant down low for the U.S. women's basketball team, which ran its Olympic winning streak to 56 games with a 102-76 win over Japan in its Paris debut. The U.S. women are pursuing an unprecedented 8th straight Olympic basketball gold in Paris.\n\nIlona Maher created a try and almost scored another as the U.S. women's rugby sevens team reached the Olympic semifinals for the first time with a 17-7 win over Britain on Monday.\n\nThey'll face the defending champs, New Zealand, for a spot in the gold-medal match.\n\nConcerns about the water quality in the Seine River led officials to call off the swimming portion of an Olympic triathlon training session for a second straight day.\n\nOrganizers overseeing the event at the Paris Games are optimistic that triathletes will be able to swim in the city's famed waterway when the competition starts Tuesday.\n\nThe sport's governing body, World Triathlon, its medical team and city officials are banking on sunny weather and higher temperatures to bring levels of E. coli and other bacteria below the necessary limits to stage the swim portion of the race, which also includes biking and running.\n\nWorld Triathlon made the decision to cancel the swim workout early Monday following a meeting over water quality in the Seine, which is closely linked to the weather.

Only one is a pommel horse hero.\n\nStephen Nedoroscik, a 25-year-old from Worcester, Massachusetts, has strabismus, more commonly known as crossed eyes, which can lead to double vision. He won gold on the pommel horse at the 2021 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships but was not wearing glasses when scoring 14.866 on the pommel horse in Paris on Monday, a performance that secured a bronze, the first gymnastics men's team medal for the US since 2008.\n\nAll the same, Nedoroscik donned his spectacles to celebrate on the podium and while resting his eyes beforehand, an embodiment of the ordinary and the extraordinary that sparked an avalanche of memes and Clark Kent/Superman comparisons that even the most myopic social media users would find hard to miss, and which he declared \"awesome\".\n\nHe told the Today programme that he is \"representing people that wear glasses well\" - striking a blow for a segment of society that is often mocked as being more likely to be found in the library than the gym, and underlining that a physical imperfection need not preclude an athlete from producing a superlative performance.\n\nHis vision, he added, is \"not necessarily clear, but the thing about pommel horse is if I keep [my glasses] on, they're gonna fly somewhere. When I go up on the pommel horse, it's all about feeling the equipment. I don't even really see when I'm doing my gymnastics. It's all in the hands - I can feel everything.\"\n\nNedoroscik was a college star at Penn State, winning two NCAA pommel horse titles and graduating with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering.\n\nAs a pommel horse specialist selected ahead of all-arounders in the six-apparatus, five team-member event, the onus was on Nedoroscik to excel in his single area of expertise, the expectations comparable to that faced by an NFL kicker with the Super Bowl on the line. He also had the added strain of going last, having to wait for nearly three hours, and \"probably had the most pressure than any other athlete tonight on the competition floor,\" Brett McClure, the US high performance director, told the Washington Post.\n\n\"I really wanted to make the Olympic team, and I knew that there was going to be backlash to it. I do one event compared to these guys that are phenomenal all-arounders. And I am a phenomenal horse guy. But it's hard to fit on a five-guy team,\" he told the Post.\n\nBut he delivered his 40-second routine with aplomb, reclaimed his glasses and held them aloft as his teammates mobbed him, becoming the newest visually impaired sporting hero.\n\nThe American world champion artistic gymnast Morgan Hurd competed triumphantly in spectacles, using a strap to keep them in place after she decided that contact lenses made her eyes dry. Rebeca Andrade, the Brazilian 2020 Olympic and multiple world champion gymnast, has myopia and astigmatism. She struggles to see the vault as she sprints towards it and cannot read the big screens that flash up her scores, but chooses to compete without contacts as she feels that she performs better with blurry vision, believing that it sharpens her instincts.\n\nMartina Navratilova, Billie Jean King, Eric Dickerson, Edgar Davids and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar are among the famous athletes who played at the highest level in glasses or goggles, but they are outliers despite the large percentage of people with less-than-perfect sight. Contact lenses offer obvious advantages and many professional teams have turned to vision science in a bid to improve performances, both to correct individual defects and to alter the sporting environment, for example by changing kit colours. Nike hired an eye expert, Dr Alan Reichow, who designed tinted glare-reducing contact lenses, a green golf putter and a ball that would be easier for Premier League players to spot during murky winter light.\n\nThe focus will be on Nedoroscik again on Saturday as he targets an individual gold. But the bronze is not his only impressive feat in France. Before the final, the Killer Sudoku fan, who said he spent 45 hours solving one puzzle, posted an image of a Rubik's cube on social media which he appears to have finished in 9.3 seconds - about half a second below his personal best.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_dart@theguardian.com", "name": "Tom Dart", "type":

Here's what Stephen Nedoroscik has shared about his eye condition.\n\nU.S. gymnast Stephen Nedoroscik wears glasses, which seems to be a rarity among athletes going for the gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nHe takes them off when he competes on the pommel horse -- his only event and a dazzling routine that helped Team USA's men's gymnastics team win the bronze medal in the team final on Monday, July 29.\n\nNedoroscik's transformation from a mild-mannered bespectacled mechanical engineer on the sidelines to powerful athlete defying gravity on the pommel horse is drawing comparisons to Clark Kent turning into Superman when he removes his glasses.\n\nThe gymnast talked with TODAY co-anchor Hoda Kotb while wearing her sunglasses because of an eye sensitivity -- a condition he's talked about on social media.\n\nHere's what Nedoroscik has shared about his eyesight:\n\nWhat he sees when he competes without glasses\n\n\"It's not necessarily clear, but the thing about pommel horse is if I keep them on, they're gonna fly somewhere,\" Nedoroscik told TODAY about his preference to take off his glasses.\n\n\"When I go up on the pommel horse, it's all about feeling the equipment. I don't even really see when I'm doing my gymnastics. It's all in the hands -- I can feel everything.\"\n\nHe has strabismus\n\nNedoroscik has crossed eyes -- or strabismus, the medical term for the condition, he revealed on TikTok.\n\nIt happens when a problem affects eye muscles, causing the eyes to not line up properly and point in different directions, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology.\n\nStrabismus usually develops in infants and kids under 3, but it can also start later in life, the American Optometric Association notes.\n\nPeople with strabismus can lose depth perception, or develop blurry or double vision. Glasses or contacts can help patients see better. Other treatment options include surgery, eye muscle exercises and prism lenses that help manage the misalignment of the eyes.\n\nHe has coloboma\n\nThis genetic condition happens when some of the tissue that makes up the eye is missing at birth, according to the National Eye Institute. One or both eyes could be affected.\n\nThere are different types of coloboma depending on which part of the eye is impacted. The missing tissue could involve the eyelid, lens, macula, optic nerve, retina or middle layer of the eye, the American Academy of Ophthalmology notes.\n\nNedoroscik has talked about living with coloboma on TikTok, explaining he's photophobic, or light sensitive, because of it -- perhaps why he borrowed Hoda's sunglasses.\n\nOther symptoms include vision loss; not being able to see in a specific location, such as the upper part of the field of vision; or blindness.\n\nThere's no cure, but glasses or contact lenses can help. Some patients may need low vision aids or surgery.\n\nHe sometimes wears sports goggles for 'superstitious reasons'\n\nThey haven't made an appearance at the Olympics yet, but Nedoroscik began wearing the sports goggles his freshman year at Penn State. His college teammates called them \"The Specs,\" noting they were a Secret Santa gift that had no prescription lenses.\n\n\"They are simply for fun, kind of my trademark. I like to have fun out there,\" Nedoroscik said in a 2022 video profile, adding he considers them a good luck charm. \"From day one of competing with them, they had a little bit of magic to them.\"\n\nHe sometimes uses them for comfort and \"superstitious reasons,\" rather than improving his eyesight, according to his official Olympics profile.\n\nThis story first appeared on TODAY.com.

He was a natural gymnast with the work ethic and drive to reach the elite.\n\nSo as he stood before that pommel horse, on the precipice of making his lifelong dream a reality, a moment of self-awareness held no risk of interrupting his concentration.\n\n\"I touched my hands on the pommel and I'm thinking, 'Now this feels like every other pommel. Now it's time for me to listen to my breath,'\" he said.\n\nIt held no risk of interrupting his joy.\n\n\"But then, it's funny, like halfway through the routine, I'm like, 'OK, I kind of got this, I can definitely do this,\" he said, \"'and I'm really up here right now.\"\n\nIt held no risk of interrupting his skills. When his feet hit the ground and it was official: Frederick Richard, Olympian?\n\n\"I thought, 'OK, I did it. I'm that guy.\"\n\nAs it turns out, after one day of qualifiers for the men's gymnastic event, Richard is more \"the guy\" for Team USA than anyone even anticipated here in Paris. He was the highest all-around scorer on the US team, which was expected. But it will be his Michigan teammate Paul Juda who will join him in the individual all-around final and not Brody Malone, the lone Olympic veteran on the team, who struggled on every rotation.\n\nMalone, fresh off the triumphant return from a devastating knee injury that didn't stop him from making the team, came off the pommel, fell twice from the high bar (on which he is the reigning world champion), put his hands down on a double-double move on floor and failed to completely stick his landings on the three other events.\n\nRichard had no such issues, seemingly gaining confidence with each pass, from a penultimate routine on his best event, the high bar, when his turn as the team anchor had First Lady Jill Biden clapping animatedly in the crowd, to his final pass on the floor, which while not as smooth, capped an overall successful day.\n\nRichard intends to perform even better during team finals on Monday, and better again at the individual all-around finals on Wednesday. If he's holding nothing back, he hopes to be the best in the world by the time the Olympics hits home shores in Los Angeles in 2028. Such is his personal mandate for these next two weeks, by the end of which he wants the world to know what Frederick Richard (not Fred, s'il vous pla\u00eet) and the rest of his teammates are busy building in their gyms.\n\n\"I want to say Team USA made a statement to the world that we're getting better and better on the men's side and we represented the country well,\" he said. \"And I want to say that the world knows Frederick Richards's name and that he's, he's going to keep getting stronger and stronger and in 2028 he'll probably be the greatest gymnast in the world.\"\n\nStanding beneath the stands of the Bercy Arena speaking to reporters after competing, Richard finishes his bold statement with a laugh. He is serious about his goals, but he is far from an overly serious personality. He is the very definition of joie de vivre, smiling as he pronounces his full name with a lovely French accent, lauding his teammates like Malone, who apologized to the team after his rough day but whom Richard adamantly defended from needing to make such amends, and pommel horse specialist and fellow Massachusetts native Stephen Nedoroscik, whose 15.2 on his only event was the USA's highest single score of the day.\n\nMalone's foibles were more than enough to remind us how quickly it can all unravel, and by contrast, how much Richard accomplished in his first-ever Olympic experience. From that little boy who bounced out of his crib and drove his parents crazy with his tumbling antics, he set his goal early in life.\n\n\"You know, I've grown up my whole life wishing there were some Black gymnasts dominating the sport on the men's side, that I can look up to, wishing that the sport was 20 times bigger,\" he said. \"Now I have an opportunity to contribute to that and make that happen. So I just view it as an opportunity now, every day is an opportunity to compete to make the sport bigger to make my dreams happen.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_rhythmic_individual_all-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's rhythmic individual all-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_bars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parallel bars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horizontal bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoughton,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stoughton, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stoughton, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Juda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Juda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brody_Malone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brody Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karl Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accor_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accor Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/_8seSh2KuVsWrSRaOqBhffICXGI=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/WOOFRIKF6CDDP5VCK3E2QHND24.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

Let's Talk About How It Happened", "body": "Getting pumped for the bronze, the U.S. Men's gymnastics team won our hearts and our attention at the 2024 Olympics.\n\nUntil last night, the U.S. Men's gymnastics team hadn't earned a team medal since 2008. It might not feel that long ago, until you realize the oldest competitor on this team, viral pommel horse master Stephen Nedoroscik, was only 9 years old the last time it happened. Then time, and emotion, hits you like a ton of bricks. This is the story of how a bronze medal five men shared has totally captured the zeitgeist of the 2024 Olympics (so far).\n\nAt the time of this writing, the United States has the most medals so far per country, at 20, and has already earned three gold medals in the men's swimming 400-m relay, the 100-m women's butterfly, which went to Torri Huske, and women's individual foil, which went to Kiefer Lee. A lot of the big US success stories have been silver and bronze medals this year, with Luke Hobson swimming the men's freestyle faster then he'd ever swum it and Gretchen Walsh coming in a close second behind Huske in the butterfly.\n\nBut it was the men's all-around gymnastics events that really had me on the edge of my seat this week. Notwithstanding viral pommel horse guy, Brody Malone sticking with his journey for a second Olympics to try and win a medal for his mom, who died of cancer in 2012, really stuck with me. His teammates include the talkative and talented Fred Richard, whose goal is to grow his TikTok following and bring more eyeballs to the sport. There's Asher Hong, whose spry athletics make him one of the most identifiable of the teammates, and Paul Juda, who made sticking every routine with minimal mistakes look effortless and graceful.\n\nThe aforementioned Nedorosck was a viral meme all night, as the camera kept cutting to him sitting on the sidelines and staying calm by keeping his eyes closed leading up to his one event. He didn't wear his glasses on the pommel horse, telling the NY Times later that he needs to wear them to see normally, given his eyes are permanently dilated, but he doesn't require them when he's competing; he'd rather go in blind.\n\nThey were trying for a bronze. They took fewer risks than they might have, and the effort in restraint paid off: they did exactly what they needed to do to land the third place medal for the first time in 16 years. It wasn't a gold, but it was still really, really compelling TV.\n\nIt was Frederick Richard - who runs a TikTok account called FrederickFlips - who spent a considerable amount of time during his Olympics spotlight trying to explain that it's time the world sees men's gymnastics as a viable sport. He noted in his interview there was a point where he was \"winning all my competitions but no one knows because men's gymnastics doesn't get any attention.\" His goal for the 2024 Olympics team is to use the platform to change that:\n\nI think they've managed it quite well. And as we head into more from women's gymnastics and the men's individual events, they've certainly captured my attention in a sea of viral Olympics moments from Michael Jordan, Hoda Kotb (living her best life with Tom Cruise) and more. Not bad company to be in.\n\nThe Olympics continues on NBC with performances from women's gymnastics and the men's individual events on the 2024 TV schedule. Here's how to watch upcoming gymnastics.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_rawden@cinemablend.com", "name": "Jessica Rawden", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Men's_Gymnastics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Men's Gymnastics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Butterfly stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torri_Huske", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torri Huske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foil_(fencing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foil (fencing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Juda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Juda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Richard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Richard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asher_Hong", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asher Hong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Walsh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gretchen Walsh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brody_Malone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brody Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoda_Kotb", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hoda Kotb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Cruise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mc2T6Y2DWSkgeaJ977xBQg-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

Except, apparently, if you're the internet's beloved \"Pommel Horse Guy,\" otherwise known as Team USA's Stephen Nedoroscik. The gymnast and pommel horse specialist has won over audiences not so much for his flawless execution on his preferred apparatus, but his willingness to nap, chill, and appear pretty bored for three or more hours while waiting for his time to shine: that is, the moment he mounts the pommel horse. Energetically, Nedoroscik seems like the quiet quitter of Olympians; people, in particular, love his \"nerdy kid\" glasses. Technically, he is the sole reason that Team USA's men's gymnastics team broke its 16-year medal drought on Monday, according to NBC News. In other words, he is so much more than just Pommel Horse Guy.\n\nThe 25-year-old Penn State alum was tapped for Team USA to fill a very specific need, NBC reports. The men's gymnastics team hadn't won any medals since Bush was still in office, and naturally has had to contend with the charm and unfettered greatness of the women's team. While gymnasts often have a specialty apparatus or performance, they typically need to be able to participate in multiple events to make the Olympic squad. Not so for Pommel Horse Guy. Nedoroscik is apparently so good at pommel horse and pommel horse only that the team made an exception for him, banking on the man appearing to fall asleep on their sidelines (NBC claims he was just meditating, okay) to bring home the gold ... or whatever he could manage. Sure enough, with Nedoroscik's help, they scored a bronze medal in the team final on Monday. Big ups to Pommel Horse Guy.\n\nWinning team spirit aside, Pommel Horse Guy feels like the perfect Olympic answer to our country's general online absurdism as of late. The juxtaposition of this guy who seems extremely bored at a high-intensity event like the Paris Games feels so goofy. Also, it's not like Nedoroscik is a specialist in floor or parallel bars, but in an apparatus as niche and silly-sounding as the pommel horse. It's perfect internet catnip, really. It certainly doesn't hurt that he was also the only American man to qualify for an individual apparatus final in Paris. Whatever the vibes may be, they are working.

As a pommel horse specialist, his nearly flawless routine helped Team USA secure a bronze medal. During the broadcast, viewers noticed his distinctive look with his eyes closed under his glasses. Now, fans are curious to know why Stephen Nedoroscik wears glasses.\n\nHere is everything to know about why Stephen Nedoroscik wears glasses.\n\nWhy does Stephen Nedoroscik wear glasses?\n\nStephen Nedoroscik started wearing sports glasses during his time at Penn State. These glasses were a Secret Santa gift from his teammate Ben Cooperman. After performing exceptionally well while wearing them, he continued to use them, and soon, the glasses became a part of his routine. Therefore, the glasses are more for their symbolic value than any practical need.\n\nAccording to Essentially Sports, the gymnast said, \"They were a Secret Santa gift from a teammate. We joked that they must have some magic in them, so I kept wearing them. They're more for show than anything. They don't have prescription in them.\"\n\nPreviously, Nedoroscik also opened up on TikTok about having strabismus, a condition that causes crossed eyes. He reached out to doctors on the platform for more information about his diagnosis and demonstrated his experience with the condition to his followers. While the strabismus doesn't seem to affect his performance, it may influence his choice to wear glasses.\n\nNedoroscik also noted that he relies on feel rather than sight for the pommel horse. According to the Washington Post, he said, \"I don't think I actually use my eyes on pommel horse. It's all feeling. I see with my hands.\" Though he occasionally competes without them, the glasses remain a significant part of his persona. He wore them on the podium and while celebrating with his teammates.", "source": {"uri": "comingsoon.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "ComingSoon.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "disheeta_maheshwari@comingsoon.net", "name": "Disheeta Maheshwari", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Santa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secret Santa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_State_Nittany_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penn State Nittany Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strabismus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Glass", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Glass", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Glass", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Glass", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Vision", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Vision", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Glassware", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Glassware", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Crystal_and_Glass", "label": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Crystal and Glass", "wgt": 43}], "image": "https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Stephen-Nedoroscik-glasses-eyesight.jpg?resize=1200,630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

From the outset of the meet, the U.S. displayed an abundance of confidence and energy on their mission for a medal. They showed immense improvement from the qualifying meet, where they were forced to count falls. Today they counted no falls to tally a 257.793. Japan took gold (259.594) and China took silver (259.062).\n\nTeam USA began on rings while Japan and China both started on floor exercise. As for the scoring, each team puts up their best three gymnasts on each event and all three scores count toward the team total.\n\nTeam USA started off strong with Fred Richard sticking his double-double off the rings for a 14.033. Brody Malone kept the momentum going with a 14.166, a great start after rocky qualifications for him. Asher Hong competed third and led the way with a 14.533 after a laid-out double-double. After rotation one, the U.S. sat in fifth place.\n\nThe men kept the energy alive on vault with Paul Juda sticking his Kasamatsu 1.5 and scoring a 14.666. Brody Malone matched Juda with another stuck vault for a 14.533. Last up was Asher Hong for a sky-high vault that scored a 14.833 to lead the team once again and help Team USA surge into first place. Following Hong's vault, the crowd began chanting \"USA, USA.\"\n\nThe team headed to parallel bars for rotation three, where Brody Malone showed a great set with nice lines, including a double pike dismount for a 14.433. Fred Richard kept things going for the squad, firing a 14.566 with a double front dismount where he fought for every tenth and had to take small hop forward on the landing. Asher Hong rounded out the rotation, dismounting with a double front half out stuck to score a 14.4.\n\nHigh Bar was up next, and this was a critical event for Team USA to hit to maintain third place. Paul Juda started off with a 13.366. Fred Richard hit another routine to earn a 14.833 after a double-double dismount. The pressure was all on Brody Malone, who fell twice in qualifications. But he came up clutch for Team USA when it counted, catching all his releases and sticking his laid-out double-double dismount. After four rotations, the U.S. held onto third place.\n\nTeam USA moved to floor for rotation five out of six. Paul Juda scored a 14.2 after\n\ndisplaying a double-double, a Randi (front 2.5 twist), double-full, a 2.5 punch front full and a full-in. Asher Hong was up next and earned a 14.133 after showing huge tumbling, including a front double-full to front double front. Fred Richard led the way on floor with a 14.466 after a big 2.5 twisting double tuck. Once again, the team maintained third place heading into the sixth and final rotation and a chance at a bronze medal.\n\nThe pressure was on for Team USA to to make all three routines on pommel horse to medal. Paul Juda hit his set to score a 13.900, and Brody Malone followed up with the second hit for a 13.700, which was a great comeback day for Malone. Stephen Nedoroscik, who waited the entire competition to show his specialty, hit with a 14.866 to lead the team on the event and clinch the bronze for U.S. Men's Gymnastics for the first time in 16 years.\n\nChina and Japan added excitement going into the final rotation with China in the lead over Japan.

Here are the biggest stories from another action-packed day in France.\n\nThe United States men's artistic gymnastics team won its first medal since 2008 in a thrilling finish. Needing a strong showing in the final rotation, the men stepped up on the pommel horse to earn a bronze medal.\n\nBrody Malone redeemed himself after a difficult qualifying round, scoring a 13.7. Stephen Nedoroscik (a.k.a. Pommel Horse Guy a.k.a. Clark Kent) stole the show, however, waiting more than two hours to perform on the pommel horse and putting up a 14.866 score.\n\nNedoroscik is eyeing gold in the pommel horse final, which is slated for Saturday, while Paul Juda and Frederick Richard will compete in the all-around final on Wednesday.\n\nJapan ultimately won gold in the event, coming from behind in the final rotation to topple China, which settled for silver.\n\nCanadian prodigy Summer McIntosh won gold -- perhaps the first of many -- on Monday night in competition marked by newcomers and nations not always represented on the podium.\n\nMcIntosh easily took the 400-meter individual medley, a race the 17-year-old normally dominates and has the world record.\n\nDavid Popovici won the 200 free, becoming the first Romanian man to ever take a swimming gold. Reno native Luke Hobson won bronze. Mona McSharry earned bronze in the 100 breaststroke, delivering the first swimming medal to Ireland since 1996.\n\n\"I'm a little scared to look at my phone,\" a beaming McSharry, 23, told reporters. \"But I got to hug my family, cousins, a big group of Irish people that were down by the bottom, behind the podium, so that was great. No words were spoken but I think just a lot of smiles and happiness.\"\n\nLas Vegas native Katie Grimes and Sarasota, Florida's Emma Weyant took silver and bronze, respectively, behind McIntosh.\n\nRyan Murphy, who grew up near Jacksonville and attended UC Berkeley, won bronze in the 100 backstroke.\n\nThe U.S. women's basketball team began its quest for an eighth straight gold medal, dispatching Japan 102-76 to open group play. This game was not close. USA had a massive size advantage and exploited it at every opportunity.\n\nA'ja Wilson and Breanna Stewart combined for 46 points and 21 rebounds. Brittney Griner, playing overseas for the first time since her detainment in Russia in 2022, added 11 points and nine boards of her own.\n\nFor all the discussion leading up to the games on who was left off the team, Monday was a reminder how much talent remains on the squad in Paris. The U.S. is loaded, and it's going to be difficult for the competition to keep up.\n\nTwo American men medaled in skateboarding street, but in a shocking fashion. Yuto Horigome of Japan, the defending gold medalist, took home the top spot again. He wasn't in position to win any hardware until his final trick -- a nollie 270 to nosebluntside -- stunned the crowd and scored a massive 97.08.\n\nIt was good enough to overcome American Jagger Eaton, who finished second, only 0.10 points behind Horigome. Nyjah Huston, a 15-time X Games skateboarding gold medalist, won bronze, his first Olympic medal.\n\nEaton and Huston were trading the top two spots for most of the event until Horigome's fifth and final trick upended the order.\n\nOlga Kharlan won bronze in women's sabre, Ukraine's first medal in Paris.\n\n\"Ukraine, I love you,\" Kharlan exclaimed after the win. \"This is for you, my dear, this is for you!\"\n\nKharlan overcame a six-point deficit to defeat South Korea's Choi Sebin.\n\n\"I brought a medal to my country, and it's the first one, and it's going to be a good start for all our athletes who are here because it's really tough to compete when in your country is a war,\" she said. \"Every medal, it's like gold. I don't care [that] it's bronze. It's gold.\"\n\nKharlan was disqualified from last year's world championships because she refused to shake the hand of a Russian opponent. She was granted an exception to compete by the International Olympic Committee after backlash to the disqualification.\n\nThe U.S. women's rugby sevens team won its quarterfinal match vs. Great Britain, advancing to the semifinals in the event for the first time in its Olympic history.\n\nNeither the American men nor women have made it this far in the rugby sevens tournament. The U.S. came from behind to secure their spot, trailing Great Britain 7-0 before reeling off 17 straight points to win 17-7.\n\nIt was not only redemption for the States, who finished sixth at the Tokyo games, but revenge -- Great Britain knocked them out of the quarterfinals in 2021.\n\nThe U.S. will face New Zealand, the reigning gold medalist, in the semis on Tuesday.", "source": {"uri":

Jake Jarman (84.897) and Joe Fraser (84.666) posted the top all-around scores and six-time Olympic medalist Max Whitlock provided a jolt with an electric pommel horse routine - his signature event - that left the 31-year-old looking relieved.\n\nWhitlock's 15.166 trailed only American Stephen Nedoroscik, a specialist whose 15.200 likely earned him a spot in the event finals and gave his teammates some early momentum.\n\nIt didn't last. Brody Malone, who came back from a horrific leg injury to win his third U.S. championship in June, fell twice on high bar and once on pommel horse to scuttle his chances of returning to the all-around finals.\n\nJake Jarman, of Great Britain, competes on the parallel bars during a men's artistic gymnastics qualification round at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Saturday, July 27, 2024, in Paris, France. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)\n\nInstead, Frederick Richard and Paul Juda will represent the Americans. While Richard - who earned bronze in the all-around at the 2023 world championships - expected to advance, Juda's performance is a bit of a surprise.\n\nThe 23-year-old - who unabashedly broke down in tears after being named to the five-man Olympic squad - thrust his arms into the air after his dismount on floor exercise. His all-around total of 82.865 was fourth among early qualifiers, trailing only Richard (83.498), Jarman and Fraser.\n\nQualifying continues later Saturday, with longtime rivals and gold medal favorites Japan and China competing in the second of three subdivisions. The top eight team finishers advance to the team finals on Monday.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nJoe Fraser, of Great Britain, celebrates after competing on the horizontal bars during a men's artistic gymnastics qualification round at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Saturday, July 27, 2024, in Paris, France.

The USWNT is always one of the bigger focuses considering they are led by perennial gymnast Simone Biles. However, the USMNT has come alive and secured a medal for the first time since 2008.\n\nMore news: France's Leon Marchand Shines While Team USA Tops the 2024 Olympic Medal Count\n\nThe USMNT won the bronze medal in Artistic Gymnastics at the Paris 2024 Olympics.\n\nThe U.S. secured bronze with an overall score of 257.793, while China took the silver with a score of 259.062, and Japan secured gold with an overall score of 259.594.\n\nChina lost out on gold by 0.532 and the U.S. by 1.801. The U.S. also nearly walked away with silver, but was beaten by China with a score margin of 1.269.\n\nSome of the strongest apparatuses for the U.S. was the pommel horse, which the USMNT scored an overall 44.032. They were narrowly beaten by Great Britain, who secured an overall score of 44.466.\n\nThe horizontal bars were also one of the better events for the USMNT, who secured an overall score of 42.365 compared to leaders in Japan, who secured an overall score of 43.565.\n\nThe USMNT secured the bronze by a strong performance from Stephen Nedoroscik, who came in and secured a 14.866 score on the pommel horse, tying Japan's Takaaki Sugino. The leader of the apparatus was Great Britain's Max Whitlock, who secured 15.266.\n\nIt has been a long road for the USMNT, as the gymnastics team has placed fifth in the previous three Summer Olympics, and even placed fifth in the qualifying event that took place on Saturday.\n\nNedoroscik came in as the pommel horse specialist and only contributed to the overall team score with his performance and his massive 14.866 score.\n\nPaul Juda and Asher Hong also propelled the USMNT into a bronze medal with their performances on the vault. Hong came in with a strong 14.833 score, and Juda was right behind with a 14.666 score.\n\nFrederick Richard also scored 14.833 on the horizontal bar, helping the gymnastic team to secure their first medal since 2008.\n\nBrody Malone was meant to qualify for the all-around and compete for a medal but dealt with some strong adversity during the qualifying rounds. He later apologized to his teammates and corrected his issues.\n\nMalone ended up scoring 14.166 in rings, 14.533 in the vault, 14.433 in parallel bars, and 14.166 in the horizontal bars apparatus.\n\nMalone and the USMNT did not give up, and their efforts have led to a bronze medal.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_brizuela@newsweek.com", "name": "James Brizuela", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artistic gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_women's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States women's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takaaki_Sugino", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Takaaki Sugino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Juda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Juda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asher_Hong", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asher Hong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brody_Malone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brody Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Whitlock", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Whitlock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_bars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parallel bars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horizontal bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Rhythmic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Rhythmic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2438568/us-mens-gymnastics.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=e8d0b319bc63f3f3f3d7f5f8609d47fd", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

Here are the biggest stories from another action-packed day in France.\n\nThe U.S. men's artistic gymnastics team won its first medal since 2008 in a thrilling finish. Needing a strong showing in the final rotation, the men stepped up on the pommel horse to earn a bronze medal.\n\nBrody Malone redeemed himself after a difficult qualifying round, scoring a 13.7. Stephen Nedoroscik (aka Pommel Horse Guy aka Clark Kent) stole the show, however, waiting more than two hours to perform on the pommel horse and putting up a 14.866 score.\n\nNedoroscik is eyeing gold in the pommel horse final, which is scheduled for Saturday, while Paul Juda and Frederick Richard will compete in the all-around final Wednesday.\n\nJapan ultimately won gold in the event, coming from behind in the final rotation to topple China, which settled for silver.\n\nCanadian prodigy Summer McIntosh won gold -- perhaps the first of many -- on Monday night in competition marked by newcomers and nations not always represented on the podium.\n\nMcIntosh, 17, easily took the 400-meter individual medley, a race she normally dominates and in which has the world record.\n\nDavid Popovici won the 200 free, becoming the first Romanian man to ever take a swimming gold. Reno, Nevada, native Luke Hobson won bronze. Mona McSharry earned bronze in the 100 breaststroke, delivering the first swimming medal to Ireland since 1996.\n\n\"I'm a little scared to look at my phone,\" a beaming McSharry, 23, told reporters. \"But I got to hug my family, cousins, a big group of Irish people that were down by the bottom, behind the podium, so that was great. No words were spoken, but I think just a lot of smiles and happiness.\"\n\nLas Vegas native Katie Grimes and Emma Weyant, of Sarasota, Florida, took silver and bronze, respectively, behind McIntosh.\n\nRyan Murphy, who grew up near Jacksonville, Florida, and attended UC Berkeley, won bronze in the 100 backstroke.\n\nThe U.S. women's basketball team began its quest for an eighth straight gold medal, dispatching Japan 102-76 to open group play. This game wasn't close. The U.S. had a massive size advantage and exploited it at every opportunity.\n\nA'ja Wilson and Breanna Stewart combined for 46 points and 21 rebounds. Brittney Griner, playing overseas for the first time since her detainment in Russia in 2022, added 11 points and nine boards.\n\nFor all the discussion leading up to the Games about who was left off the team, Monday's game was a reminder how much talent remains on the squad in Paris. The U.S. is loaded, and it's going to be difficult for the competition to keep up.\n\nTwo American men medaled in skateboarding street, but in a shocking fashion. Yuto Horigome of Japan, the defending gold medalist, took home the top spot again. He wasn't in position to win any hardware until his final trick -- a nollie 270 to nosebluntside -- stunned the crowd and scored a massive 97.08.\n\nIt was good enough to overcome American Jagger Eaton, who finished second, only 0.10 points behind Horigome. Nyjah Huston, a 15-time X Games skateboarding gold medalist, won bronze, his first Olympic medal.\n\nEaton and Huston were trading the top two spots for most of the event until Horigome's fifth and final trick upended the order.\n\nOlga Kharlan won bronze in women's saber, Ukraine's first medal in Paris.\n\n\"Ukraine, I love you,\" Kharlan exclaimed after the win. \"This is for you, my dear, this is for you!\"\n\nKharlan overcame a six-point deficit to defeat South Korea's Choi Sebin.\n\n\"I brought a medal to my country, and it's the first one, and it's going to be a good start for all our athletes who are here, because it's really tough to compete when in your country is a war,\" she said. \"Every medal, it's like gold. I don't care [that] it's bronze. It's gold.\"\n\nKharlan was disqualified from last year's world championships because she refused to shake the hand of a Russian opponent. The International Olympic Committee granted her an exception to compete after the disqualification sparked backlash.\n\nThe U.S. women's rugby sevens team won its quarterfinal match vs. Great Britain, advancing to the semifinals for the first time in its Olympic history.\n\nNeither the American men nor women have made it this far in the rugby sevens tournament. The U.S. came from behind to secure its spot, trailing Great Britain 7-0 before reeling off 17 straight points to win 17-7.\n\nIt was not only redemption for the States, who finished sixth at the Tokyo Games, but also revenge -- Great Britain knocked them out of the quarterfinals in 2021.\n\nThe U.S. will face New Zealand, the reigning gold medalist, in the semis on Tuesday.", "source":

That guy's name is Stephen Nedoroscik, who executed a pommel horse routine that left his teammates cheering, jumping, and fist-pumping with excitement the second he planted his feet back on the ground.\n\nSeconds before he began the routine, Nedoroscik, 25, removed his eye glasses, earning him the nickname \"Clark Kent\" on social media as he transitioned into his competitive alter-ego. For Nedoroscik, however, those glasses are what keep his two vision-impairing conditions at bay: strabismus and coloboma, which he publicly addressed on social media.\n\n\"Basically I'm cross-sighted, and I can switch my dominant eye on command,\" Nedoroscik said in a TikTok he posted in August 2022, in which he was hoping to get some more info about his conditions from eye doctors online.\n\nStrabismus is also known as eye misalignment, according to the Cleveland Clinic. One eye is turned in a different direction than the other, usually as a result of problems with the muscles that control eye movement. While it's mainly found in childhood, it is possible for childhood strabismus to remain if it wasn't treated, or to come back in adulthood.\n\nAround 4% of the U.S., or around 13 million people, have crossed eyes, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nComplications that can arise from strabismus include blurry vision, eye strain, fatigue, headaches, poor three-dimensional vision, and double vision. A lazy eye may also develop, which happens when the brain receives two images from eyes looking in different directions. In an effort to avoid double vision, the brain may ignore what the turned eye sees, causing poor vision development in that eye.\n\nNedoroscik's other condition, coloboma, occurs when part of the tissue that makes up the eye is missing. This happens during pregnancy, when a baby's eye does not fully develop normally.\n\nAccording to the National Eye Institute, symptoms of coloboma include vision loss or blindness, low vision, and sensitivity to light.\n\nIn both cases of strabismus and coloboma, symptoms can be treated with corrective lenses -- in Nedoroscik's case, his Clark Kent glasses.For years, Nedoroscik has been perfecting his pommel horse routine -- the only gymnastic event Nedoroscik came to Paris for (thus, the \"pommel horse guy\" was born), as he watched the rest of his teammates in the other events of the Team All-Around competition. And he did not disappoint his teammates. Outside of gymnastics, Nedoroscik has another talent: solving Rubik's Cubes in 10 seconds or less.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ani_freedman@fortune.com", "name": "Ani Freedman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strabismus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Glasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coloboma", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coloboma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Clinic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eye movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplopia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diplopia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muscle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fatigue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_strain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eye strain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blurred_vision", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blurred vision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Photophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-pommel-horse-guy-e1722365226767.jpg?resize=1200,600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

He is now 11th in the first subdivision; the top 24 gymnasts from across three subdivisions advance to the finals.\n\nOnly two gymnasts from each Olympic committee can advance to the all-around finals. Given that Malone finished well behind teammates Frederick Richard and Paul Juda, who finished third and fourth, respectively, he will not advance.\n\nMalone underwent multiple surgeries for a gruesome knee injury sustained last year, but recovered in time to win his third national all-around title in June. Malone performed incredibly well at Team USA trials, finishing second, just behind Richard.\n\nHe struggled on Saturday, receiving a 0.3 deduction on vault and earning just a 6.033 on horizontal bar, his best event and his highest difficulty. Malone finished fourth overall in the high bar at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, but is now unlikely to make the finals for the event.\n\nMalone's only hope for the finals is to advance on an individual apparatus. He competed well on parallel bars, earning 14.533 points and finishing fourth in the subdivision. However, only the top eight from all three subdivisions will advance, meaning that an appearance at the finals is not guaranteed.\n\nRichard and Juda, meanwhile, will move on to the next round.

He delivered a pommel horse routine that scored 14.886 points, enough to put the U.S. men on an Olympic podium for the first time in 16 years.\n\nWhen it was over, his teammates hoisted him into the air, and he raised his hands above his head.\n\n\"It was just the greatest moment of my life, I think,\" he said.\n\nIt wasn't so great three years ago. Not for Nedoroscik.\n\nHe fell at the 2021 Olympic Trials, prompting USA Gymnastics to select Yoder for Tokyo. He was world champion in 2021 but fell again at the 2022 World Championships, where the Americans finished fifth in team standings.\n\n\"Look, Steven is unreal,\" Yoder said. \"He was when we were going to head-to-head. We had a lot of great opportunities to compete against each other. We both had successes and failures in those times as well.\"We were people who pushed each other to be the best. I could not be more proud to be sitting in that golf cart watching him getting it done for our country.\"\n\nYoder, 27, now living in Jacksonville Beach, Fla., retired from gymnastics and is social media content manager for the PGA Tour. He made the world team in 2018 and was an all-around bronze medalist at the 2014 Youth Olympics.In the individual event final at Tokyo, Yoder finished sixth.\n\nFrom 2017-21, he and Nedoroscik alternated victories on pommel horse. Nedoroscik, of Penn State, won NCAA titles in 2017 and 2018. Yoder, of Ohio State, did so in 2019.\n\nYoder said his late coach, Gene Watson, always told him pommel horse was the one event in which a gymnast could never take a break.\n\n\"It's nonstop focus for 50 seconds,\" Yoder said. \"You've got to be locked in the entire time. Those hand positions can be tricky. It's easy to lose it.\"\n\nHoosiers in Paris: Here are the Indiana athletes competing in the 2024 Olympics\n\nAfter team bronze was secured, Nedoroscik became a sensation on social media, as much for his nerdy appearance as for his gymnastics excellence. He went from a glasses-wearing Clark Kent to caped Superman.\n\nAwaiting the team final, he solved a Rubik's Cube in 9.32 seconds. It's a hobby of his.\n\nAfter years of hyping himself up, Nedoroscik said he came to learn it was better to calm himself down. Of course, he felt pressure.\n\n\"(But) I thought about it before, about how I get to be the last person that goes in the Olympics,\" Nedoroscik said. \"I put that in my head as a positive. Like, I can be the exclamation point.\"\n\nIt was an exclamation point rippling across the Atlantic, spilling onto a Florida golf course.\n\nTom Schad of USA Today contributed to this report.

But, his parents are his biggest supporters and got him to where he is today.\n\nBorn on October 28, 1998, the Olympic gymnast had humble beginnings when his parents found out that he was climbing all over the furniture at their house. His parents called him \"Spider Monkey\" and it has stuck ever since. They eventually enrolled him at a local gym in 2003 and the rest is history. \"On the first day there, I climbed a rope all the way to the top,\" Nedoroscik told NBC News. \"After that, they invited me to join the gymnastics team. We accepted it, and that was it.\"\n\nRelated: Meet Simone Biles' biological and adoptive parents\n\nIn 2024, Stephen qualified for the Paris Olympics earlier this year, making history as the only American gymnast to qualify as a single-event specialist. And man did he deliver! His performance on the pommel horse helped the US Men's Gymnast team secure a bronze medal -- the first for the American men's gymnastics team since 2008.\n\nHis performance garnered lots of praise and he went viral for sleeping right before he absolutely destroyed it on the pommel horse. Donning his famous glasses, he's been dubbed the \"Clark Kent\" of gymnastics for his stellar abilites.\n\nCheryl Nederoscik is Stephen's mother. According to her LinkedIn, she's a Client Exprience Manager at BayStateSavings Bank. A week before he headed off the Paris, his parents held a send off in his hometown of Worcester, Massachussetts.\n\n\"Everybody's dream is to make it to the Olympics,\" she told Spectrum News 1. \"Obviously, they all want to do well. But it's such an obstacle to conquer. It's just impressive.\n\nJohn Nederoscik is Stephen's father. At the same event, he became very nostalgic and proud of all his son's accomplishments. \"It started to hit us last night when we met the old families from Sterling, where he used to practice. So, that's when it started to pick up a little bit for me,\" he said. \"I think you can't prepare for this. I mean, this is the pinnacle of the sport. So, I don't think he's been this high before.\"", "source": {"uri": "stylecaster.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "StyleCaster"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lea_veloso@stylecaster.com", "name": "Lea Veloso", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furniture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Furniture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Kent_(Smallville)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clark Kent (Smallville)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spectrum News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Worcester, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Worcester, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/stephen-Nedoroscik-parents.jpg?w=650", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1998-10-28", "textStart": 201, "textEnd": 217}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

By the time Richard made his way beyond the medal stand, by the time he was in a media mixed zone and an official podium-placing press conference, by the time he was scratching the back of his neck as the weight of the bronze medal around it pulled against his skin, the signature effervescence had been replaced by something different.\n\n\"It's sinking in, but it still feels pretty unreal,\" he said, eyes wide. \"We're going to be written in history. All of us. That's crazy to think about. They used to have pictures in my gym of the past Olympic teams that medaled and I would look at that and think, 'Man, what if I was one of those people one day?'\n\nAnd what a way to make it happen. A total team effort, yes, but one absolutely energized by the 20-year-old Michigan undergrad who got his start bouncing off the walls of his family home.\n\nA team-high 14.833 on the high bar that nearly set Bercy Arena alight with its electricity, but more importantly, drove Team USA past the midpoint of the six-apparatus rotation with momentum that proved unstoppable. A team-best 14.466 on the ensuing floor routine, his final contribution of the contest, where he (once again) stuck his landing and then bounced his way back around the mat to join his teammates. Another team-best 14.566 on the earlier parallel bars. And a steady, strong and -- most importantly -- mistake-free 14.033 on the rings, the first routine of the night for Team USA and the perfect tone-setter.\n\nHis Olympics aren't over yet. Richard and Juda will be in the field of 24 competing in Wednesday's all-around final; one more opportunity to show off the range of skills that included side-by-side, near-perfect vaults Monday. But with the best gymnasts from the golden Japanese and silver Chinese teams earning the top four qualifying spots, that challenge is steep. (Richard finished 10th.) In coming up short on his one other goal -- make the individual event final in the high bar -- Richard could feel the competitive fire getting stoked for this team goal.\n\nSo there he was, wingspan encircled around Malone, Juda, and Hong as they stood by the corner of the pommel horse watching Nedoroscik. This quintet of men bonded for eternity by shared hope, shared pride, and ultimately, shared achievement. When Nedoroscik hit the ground with a solid, two-footed thud, no one needed to wait for the 14.866 that would later flash as the Americans' single best score of the night.\n\n\"I was jumping so high. Like, I was five feet in the air jumping,\" Richard said. \"I was incredibly thankful and just proud of us because we put a lot of work into it. And it all paid off.\"\n\nWhat a moment. A life-changing moment. A new permanent descriptor tethered to their names, written in red, white, blue, and bronze: Olympic medal winners.\n\nOnly a few days ago, Richard was asked to consider what he wanted people to say when these Olympics are done. What he wanted the American public to know about this team and about his personal journey. What the future might hold for this child of immigrants who found his passion at such a young age, who pursued his dream through endless days of practice in the gym, who followed his heart to the Big Ten and learned the true value of being part of a bigger whole. Who came to Paris with his eye on some hardware and won it.\n\n\"I want to say Team USA made a statement to the world that we're getting better and better on the men's side and we represented the country well,\" he said. \"And I want to say that the world knows Frederick Richards's name and that he's, he's going to keep getting stronger and stronger, and in 2028 he'll probably be the greatest gymnast in the world.\"\n\nThe Los Angeles Games might prove him right.

Just before his big moment came in the team all-around final, cameras caught Nedoroscik, bespectacled in a pair of glasses, seemingly taking a quick nap on the sideline. The athlete then ditched the eyewear and performed a near-perfect routine that clinched a bronze medal for Team USA, the sport's first in 16 years. Images of Nedoroscik have subsequently gone viral, and many celebrated his zenned-out behavior, comparing him to Superman's Clark Kent.\n\n\"Obsessed with this guy on the US men's gymnastics team who's only job is pommel horse, so he just sits there until he's activated like a sleeper agent, whips off his glasses like Clark Kent,\" one user on X, formerly Twitter, wrote.\n\nNedoroscik, for his part, told Today he loves the memes. \"I'm representing people who wear glasses well,\" he said. He also noted that shedding the glasses really does make him quite blind. \"I don't even really see when I'm doing my gymnastics,\" he said. \"It's all in the hands. I can feel everything.\"\n\nAfter struggling with mental blocks and dropping from competition at the Tokyo 2020 games (held in 2021 due to COVID-19), Biles headed to Paris with all eyes turned to her comeback. On Tuesday, she shepherded the women's team to gold in the all-around final, and the internet soon went crazy for her historic trajectory.\n\n\"Simone Biles is not a generational talent,\" one fan wrote on X. \"She's so good that they had to create a new difficulty level to score her. She has multiple moves named after her. She's not a generational talent. She's the best to have ever existed. And we're all blessed to be able to witness it.\"\n\nOffline, though, Biles has been clear that this Olympics was her most personal yet. Netflix's Simone Biles: Rising director Katie Walsh previously told The Hollywood Reporter that Biles was headed to Paris as \"a mature woman who knows what she wants and is really doing this for herself in a way that you don't always see, especially in gymnastics. It would be wonderful for her to win all the gold medals, but I think the showing up and putting herself out there has been the greatest achievement.\"\n\nMaher first rose to TikTok fame during the Tokyo games for her candid videos about life in the athlete's village. She surpassed one million followers shortly after, and has since entertained fans with educational content about women's rugby, female athletes and her journey with body positivity. Maher and her team won the bronze medal at the Paris Olympics, the first time Team USA ever landed on the women's rugby sevens podium.\n\n\"I'm a female athlete in a sport that's not very big, especially in America,\" Maher told The Guardian of her online following. \"It's not a money-making sport ... I want to make sports a career and I don't think many women can think that way.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Maher's campaign to increase the American rugby fandom spread to NFL alum Jason Kelce, who went viral for a shirt plastered with Maher's face.\n\nThe New Heights podcast posted on X, \"Jason's Olympic fits just get better and better.\"", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zoe_g_phillips@hollywoodreporter.com", "name": "Zoe G.

But he wasn't resting when his eyes were closed, he was visualizing what he had to do next.\n\n\"I do it all the time,\" Nedoroscik told the Washington Post about his habit of visualizing. \"Sometimes I think I do it too much, but what else am I to do with those empty spaces?\"\n\nIndeed, the Penn State grad told the paper that he had visualized his routine \"about 100 times.\" By the time it was his turn to go, Nedoroscik didn't even need his glasses.\n\n\"I don't think I actually use my eyes on pommel horse,\" he said. \"It's all feeling. I see with my hands.\"\n\nVisualizing isn't just helpful for Olympic medalists. Neuroscientist and executive coach Tara Swart previously told CNBC Make It that visualization can be a useful tool to help people achieve their goals.\n\n\"You would be surprised how many high-powered executives secretly have action or vision boards at home or saved on their computers,\" Swart said in 2019.\n\nVision boards can help because there's not much difference to your brain between a strongly imagined vision and an actual experience. She said it's important to visualize what it is already like to have accomplished what you want to achieve rather than see it as a goal.\n\nPut your vision board somewhere you will regularly see it, such as next to your bed or in your closet, so that you constantly encourage yourself to make decisions and take steps towards reaching your goals.\n\nKeeping your goals top of mind, she said, can help remove some of the stress of taking action to achieve them.\n\n\"It cannot just be that you create a fantasy image of your ideal life and wait for your life to magically change,\" she said. \"You've got to do things too and move yourself towards that.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pommel_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pommel horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Nedoroscik", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Nedoroscik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscientist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neuroscientist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fantasy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/07/108013636-1722355979202-gettyimages-2163817196-659_0099075664JPG.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9768598", "eventUri": "eng-9768598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

In the absence of the reigning Olympic team champions, the Russian Olympic Committee, China and Japan are undoubtedly the favorites for gold.\n\nThe two teams went head-to-head during the qualification round where China got the bragging rights, edging out Japan by over two points. In the team final, it will hope to turn those bragging rights into a gold medal.\n\nHowever, expect Japan to be hot on China's heels after not performing up to its own expectations during qualifications.\n\nNotably defending Olympic all-around champion Daiki Hashimoto had a rough day - falling on floor exercise and high bar (where he won the gold medal in Tokyo). With Daiki performing at full-strength, Japan has all the ingredients to win gold. The pressure will be on China to be clean and deliver another performance like it did during qualifications if it wants to come out on top.\n\nThe format for the team final is three athletes up, all scores count. The scores from qualifications do not carry over so all eight teams will start from scratch.\n\nBoth China and Japan have a built in cushion from the rest of the field thanks to the difficulty in their routines, meaning a few mistakes here or there shouldn't impact the gold and silver positions. However, both teams have made it clear they want gold. The little details will make a difference in the competition between themselves.\n\n\"In Tokyo we got a silver medal (in the team competition) with a little margin,\" Kaya Kazuma said after the qualification round. \"So it was frustrating, but we kept practicing every day for success today. Next time, in (the team final), I want the gold medal.\"\n\nJapan last won the Olympic title in 2016. China won the title in 2012.\n\nThe battle for bronze will be just as exciting as the battle for gold.\n\nGreat Britain finished third in qualifications, Ukraine finished fourth and the United States finished fifth.\n\nHowever those placements don't bring much comfort.\n\n\"A lot of people have asked me that question in terms of 'how does it feel to be above the USA?' Max Whitlock said after the competition. \"To be honest, take that with a pinch of salt ...

The men's race has been postponed to Wednesday at 10:45 a.m. local time (4:45 a.m. ET), immediately following the women's event, which is scheduled for 8 a.m.\n\nBoth triathlons remain subject to water tests complying with the established World Triathlon thresholds for swimming, and the original contingency competition day of Friday, Aug. 2 also remains in place, the World Triathlon statement said. -- Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nOlympic swimming today: What to watch\n\nIn the pool, American Bobby Finke is the reigning Olympic champion in the men's 800-meter free. In Paris he likely will be challenged by Australia's Samuel Short and Ireland's Daniel Wiffen.\n\nOlympic gymnastics today: What to watch\n\nIt's the day of the women's team final and the Americans have had this one circled on their calendars. In Tokyo, Simone Biles withdrew from the team event after struggling on vault. The Americans went on to win silver behind Russia (or ROC as the team was called). It was the first time since the 2010 world championships that the Americans did not win the team title at a worlds or Olympics. For the Paris Olympics, Russia is not allowed to compete as a team. Led by Biles, the U.S. won the gold at the 2023 world championships followed by Brazil (silver) and France (bronze).\n\nHow Stephen Nedoroscik delivered on pommel horse to seal US gymnastics' Olympic bronze\n\nPARIS -- Hours before the men's gymnastics team final at the 2024 Paris Olympics, Stephen Nedoroscik solved a Rubik's Cube in 9.32 seconds.

The event was marked by extraordinary performances, culminating in an exciting finale. KXAN's Jala Washington caught up with Team USA after the competition.\n\nGymnast Stephen Nedoroscik, who delivered a final performance on pommel horse, recalled the decisive moment. \"Yeah, I mean, the last step in the whole competition, the pressure was on. Right before I went, these guys told me, 'We trust you, we have your back.' It's all I needed to hear. I went up there. I knew what I had to do. So I just went out there and did it. And as soon as I landed, that dismount and stuck it. I couldn't get the smile off my face man. That's a moment I'll never forget.\"\n\nWhen asked about the pressure, gymnast Frederick Richard said, \"I would say obviously you have pressure, but I think there was a big thing looming over us and that was opportunity. And we wanted to take that opportunity. We knew we worked really hard to seize the moment, seize the opportunity, and then that's what we did today.\"\n\nGymnast Brody Malone commented on the crowd's energy, \"Oh yeah, it felt kind of. I felt like Olympic trials, almost. I mean, it makes it very easy to go out and hit really good routines when you've got energy like that in the crowd and energy.

Jake Jarman and Joe Fraser wil lalso go in the pommel.\n\nNext for GB will be rings, then vault, then parallel bars before horizontal bar and, finally, the floor.\n\nWhitlock described his \"crazy\" relief after the double defending champion successfully negotiated the qualifying round for the Olympic men's pommel competition at the Bercy Arena in Paris.\n\nWhitlock, who is competing at his last Games, scored 15.166, placing him second behind Stephen Nedoroscik of the US after the first qualifying rotation, a result that means his place in next Saturday's eight-man apparatus final is effectively assured.\n\nThe 31-year-old, who won the pommel title in both 2016 and 2020 but has struggled with injury since reversing a retirement decision in the wake of his success in Tokyo, believes he is still capable of plenty of improvements.\n\n\"The relief is crazy,\" admitted Whitlock, who also did his bit to help the team with routines on horizontal and parallel bars. \"I had to wait a while to present that routine, so I was mega pleased.\n\n\"Of course there's some increases I can make, some bits that I can clean up a little bit, difficulty I can increase on. But it's a huge relief to come out and do it successfully.\"\n\nA successful team performance saw Great Britain top the standings at the top of the first rotation ahead of the US and Germany, with Jake Jarman top-scoring on floor and Harry Hepworth leading the way on vault with a score of 14.766.\n\nThe results should be good enough to ensure at least one individual final for all five of the men's team, and leave them in with a shout of landing their first team medal since their bronze at London 2012.\n\nJoe Fraser, the former world parallel bars final whose all-around score of 84.666 was only eclipsed by team-mate Jake Jarman in the first rotation, paid tribute to his team's ability to deliver under pressure.\n\n\"Me and the team really just gave it our all out there,\" said Fraser. \"We really put our necks on the line and just gave it our all.\n\n\"We weren't really focusing too much on the finals, it was more about trying to put out our best work today.

So far so good at the Olympics for the Americans with plenty of events to go.\n\nThe table of the top 10 countries at the Olympics can be seen below (ordered by gold medal count).\n\nOne of the highlights for USA Monday was Penn State's Stephen Nedoroscik clinching the country's first men's gymnastics team medal since 2008.\n\nNedoroscik is considered a pommel horse specialist and it's the only event he competed in during the all around. It was also the last routine on the last rotation of the day for the Americans, meaning he had to sit in anticipation of the event for hours.\n\nIn the end, Nedoroscik scored a massive 14.866 in the final routine of the day for Team USA. At that point, the celebration was on with teammates hugging one another and waiting for it to go official that they'd be standing on the podium.\n\nBut with athletic competitions come off the field happenings as well. Brazilian swimmer Ana Carolina Vieira was banished after sneaking out of the village.\n\nAccording to Tom Balogun of the Daily Mail, Vieira, 22, snuck out to meet up with boyfriend and fellow swimmer Gabriel Santos without authorization. When questioned, Vieira was reportedly disrespectful and challenging.\n\nSantos was also disciplined but allegedly apologized for leaving and breaking the rules.\n\nNot only that, but other countries noticed the absence of basketball superstar Caitlin Clark from the Olympics.\n\nAhead of the matchup between the United States and Japan in Paris, a Japanese fan brought in and raised a sign that said 'You need Caitlin Clark to beat us'. It was enough to get the attention of the players as A'ja Wilson was pointing it out to Britney Griner and Alyssa Thomas.\n\nTo be clear, the sign couldn't have ended up less true.

In some instances, there are athletes who quite literally help market their sport exponentially purely through athletic achievement and/or vibes.\n\nWe've got a few such candidates here in 2024.\n\nWe're but a few days into the Paris Games and it's already looking like this year's Olympics could be an all-timer for memorable breakout stars. If you've been watching the action and/or following on social media, you've seen some of the fresh new faces that are amping up these Olympics. To make it easier on you, I'm packaging them all in one post. Best of all: This story will update as we continue to get more stars as the Olympics moves on into August.\n\nIlona Maher: Rugby sensation, social media star\n\nWomen's Rugby Sevens is getting an overdue glow-up at the Paris Games, thanks in large part to Team USA's push to the semifinals. The biggest reason? Maher, who is a force of nature and an irresistible watch. The Vermonter is playing in her second Olympics with Team USA, but she had her first mega-viral moment over the weekend when she channeled Derrick Henry and Marshawn Lynch en route to this score in the United States' 36-7 win over Japan.\n\nHell yeah, that's the stuff.\n\nMaher's far from the only reason to watch women's rugby sevens -- Massachusetts' Kristi Kirshe and North Carolina's Sammy Sullivan are also awesome -- but her uncommon combination of size and power makes Maher a phenomenal watch. With the increasing (and overdue) rise in women's sports popularity in recent years, Maher's emergence for Team USA has given American sports yet another reason to champion its amazing female athletes.\n\nBeyond her on-field dominance, the 27-year-old Maher is ultra-savvy with social media. She has amassed more than 1.5 million Instagram followers and is even more popular on TikTok, where she frequently speaks on body positivity and encouraging women to be comfortable in their own skin. She's also recruited the recently retired Jason Kelce to endorse women's rugby for Team USA.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Ilona Maher (@ilonamaher)\n\nMaher's personality and potent power is a breath of fresh air.\n\nAfter bruising past Great Britain, 17-7, on Monday, Maher and Team USA will play vs. New Zealand at 9:30 a.m. ET on Tuesday in the semifinals. Not bad for a program only making its third Olympics appearance in history -- and going for its first medal.\n\nStephen Nedoroscik: Bespectacled gymnast getting superhero comps\n\nWhen the glasses come off, the competition is ON.\n\nThe United States men's gymnastics team almost never medals. In the previous 19 Summer Olympics, they'd made it to the podium only twice.\n\nBut on Monday, a 16-year drought ended when Team USA took bronze, comfortably out-performing Great Britain and Ukraine in order to clinch third place; Japan won gold and China got the silver.\n\nAs the team got closer to its rare reality, the cameras panned to a nerdy-looking pommel horse specialist named Stephen Nedoroscik, who hadn't competed on any of the other disciplines (parallel bars, high bar, floor exercise, rings, vault). Watching Brody Malone's insane athleticism was one thing -- and Malone is himself a star in the making, to be sure -- but NBC's framing of Nedoroscik's lead-up to the horse set the stage and turned him into a viral sensation.\n\nThe guy's got serious Clark Kent aura, you know?\n\nNedoroscik was brought across the Atlantic Ocean for one reason and one reason only: to throw his body around a pommel horse in a lithe-yet-powerful fashion. He nailed it, and in doing so, he clinched the bronze for the United States.\n\nNedoroscik will get another big moment on Wednesday, when he'll compete in the individual pommel horse competition.\n\nL\u00e9on Marchand: French swimmer goes supernova in home country\n\nSwimming has a new superstar, and this time, it's not an athlete from America or Australia.\n\nBy pretty much every account, L\u00e9on Marchand's gold medal-wining 400-meter individual medley performance Sunday at La D\u00e9fense Arena was a once-in-a-lifetime type of event. The hometown kid, just 22, stepped onto the platform as the overwhelming favorite, then proceeded to cruise to first by touching the final wall in 4:02.95, beating Michael Phelps' 16-year Olympic record in the process.\n\nWith thousands on hand to cheer on the Frenchman, they synchronized their \"Al-lez! L\u00e9-on!\" cheers so that Marchand would hear them as he bobbed his head out of the water on the breast stroke and butterfly. Pretty cool, that. For a few moments, a swim meet took on the din and rhythm of a soccer match.\n\nWe'll be getting more of Marchand this week. He's set to compete for the podium in the 200m breaststroke, the 200m butterfly and the 200m IM.\n\nThe greatest venue ... ever?\n\nIt's not just humans who are emerging as breakout stars. And, fine, it's not like the Eiffel Tower doesn't consistently get its due.\n\nBut check this view of the beach volleyball venue in Paris. This is ... the best sporting backdrop in the history of our species?\n\nA phenomenal vista, and the picture-perfect iconography for these Olympic Games. (A shoutout to the fencing venue as well, which is also a breathtaking sight to behold.)\n\nWe knew beach volleyball would have its moment in the sun (and under the stars), but the images are even better than expected. Paris, which last hosted the Olympics in 1924, is a place beautifully built for the Summer Olympiad. It's images like this that all but ensure it won't wait another 100 years before the City of Light gets to host the Games again.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS

Michael Phelps stands behind Katie Ledecky in support of her after criticism from fans\n\nIn a thrilling turn of events at the men's gymnastics team final this Monday at the Summer Olympics in Paris, all eyes were not only on the athletes but also on the stands. Brody Malone's fianc\u00e9e, Serena Ortiz, stole the spotlight as she passionately cheered for the 24-year-old American gymnast, adding an extra layer of excitement to the competition.\n\nMalone, hailing from Tennessee, delivered an epic routine on the horizontal bar, igniting hopes for a medal among fans. One enthusiastic supporter tweeted, \"The USA is having its best final in over a decade here at #Paris2024.\n\nHorizontal Bar: Paul Juda was very good (13.366). Fred Richard was magnificent (14.333). And 2022 World champion Brody Malone does the best routine he has yet in Paris. America is on fire!\" the fan tweeted.\n\nAs NBC's cameras panned to the stands, Serena Ortiz could be seen watching intently, her pride evident. She later expressed her support on Instagram, writing, \"Words can't express how proud I am of this man. Bonjour Paris!!\" With their wedding set for May 2025, the couple might soon have an Olympic medal to celebrate alongside their nuptials.\n\nBrody Malone's gymnastics resume is impressive, featuring titles such as the 2021 U.S. all-around champion and seven-time NCAA champion. Despite a rocky start in the individual competition with an untimely fall on the pommel horse that scored him 12.100 points, Malone showed resilience.\n\nThough his routine on the horizontal bar, his strongest event, was marred by missed releases and a poor catch, earning him 12.233 points, he didn't let it dampen his spirits.\n\nMalone's perseverance shone through as he helped secure Team USA's spot in the team finals. With China and Japan as heavy favorites, the American team's chances for gold were slim. However, Malone's toughness and determination kept their medal hopes alive.\n\nIn the end, all the hardships were worth it. The US Men'sGymnasticsTeam captured their first Olympic medal in the team event since the 2008 Beijing Olympics, capturing a bronze with consistent performances from all five members. Japan won gold and China won silver.\n\nAs the team final unfolded, the atmosphere was electric. With Ortiz's heartfelt support and Malone's relentless drive, the narrative of their journey captivated fans and added a personal touch to the Olympic drama. The future looks bright for Malone, both in his gymnastics career and his upcoming life with Ortiz.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The theme of this year's event- \"Closing the Gap: Breastfeeding support for all', focuses on inclusive support and access to breastfeeding resources for every mother and child, with emphasis on survival, health and wellbeing.\n\nAlso, the objectives of this year's commemoration are to inform communities about the inequalities that exist in breastfeeding support and prevalence, to anchor breastfeeding as an equaliser to close gaps within society and to engage and galvanise actions in reducing inequalities in breastfeeding support by focusing on vulnerable groups.\n\nGiving a background details of the initiative, Malang N. Fofana, acting executive Director of National Nutrition Agency, recalled that World Breastfeeding Week, is an initiative of the WHO and UNICEF that seeks to support exclusive breastfeeding in the first-six months of a child's life and to reduce food insecurity and the many health benefits associated with it.\n\n\"As enshrined in the 'Convention on the Rights of the Child', every infant and child has right to good nutrition. The World Health Organization has reported that under nutrition is associated with 45% of child deaths globally.\" ED Fofana said\n\nThe rate of exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months, he emphasised, has steadily increased over the years from 48% in 2013 to 54% in 2019 to 2020.\n\nHowever, he maintained that more support is still needed to promote, protect and support optimal and young child nutrition, in order to meet the 60% targets, set out in the national nutrition policy 2021- 2025 and the global nutrition target of 70% by 2030 as set by the World Health Assembly.\n\n\"It is gratifying to note that The Gambia has already exceeded the global Nutrition target of increasing exclusive breastfeeding to 50% by 2025.\"\n\nFor his part, Sanjally Tarawally, Deputy Director of Health Promotion and Education at the Ministry of Health, said breastfeeding can act as an equaliser in society and that efforts must be made to ensure everyone has access to breastfeeding support and opportunities.\n\nHe reminded that it is essential that no-one is left behind especially vulnerable mothers who may need additional support to reduce breastfeeding inequalities.\n\nDr Yulia Widiati, Child Survival and Development Manager at UNICEF, said breastmilk contains essential antibodies that protect children against diseases; breastmilk is a safe, nutritious, and sustainable source of good nutrition for children.\n\nShe also revealed that, The Gambia is among the few countries that have achieved significant progress in exclusive breastfeeding, with 54% of children exclusively breastfed in 2019.\n\nThe country, she added, is on course to achieving the 2025 global nutrition target of increasing the rate of exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months up to at least 50%.\n\nWhile this is a significant improvement, she said many women across the country face barriers, such as harmful marketing practices, lack of access to quality healthcare, and weak family friendly policies, when making infant feeding decisions.\n\nYulia also pointed out that to build on World Health Assembly target of 50 per cent by 2025 and ultimately the global target of 70 per cent by 2030, these barriers must be addressed with UNICEF supporting the Government of The Gambia to remove those barriers.", "source": {"uri": "thepoint.gm", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Point Newspaper"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Breastfeeding_Week", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Breastfeeding Week"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Breastfeeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prevalence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Convention on the Rights of the Child"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emergency department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malnutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UNICEF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gambia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Gambia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Gambia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_and_Social_Care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Department of Health and Social Care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breast milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Health Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antibody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://thepoint.gm/assets/Featured-Articles/World-Breastfeeding-Week-.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794513", "eventUri": "eng-9794513", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "dateEnd": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 291, "textEnd": 304}], "sentiment": 0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

The organization said this provides a child with ideal nutrition, and supports growth and development.\n\nAccording to the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention, breastfeeding is good for both mother and child. It says breast milk is the best source of nutrition for most babies, and as a baby grows, a mother's breast milk changes to meet the baby's nutritional needs.\n\nBreastfed babies are said to have a lower risk of asthma, obesity, type 1 diabetes, severe lower respiratory disease, acute otitis media (ear infections), sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), gastrointestinal infections (diarrhea/vomiting), and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) for preterm infants.\n\nBenefits to mothers who breastfeed include a lower risk of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure.\n\nWorld Breastfeeding Awareness Month aims to highlight the benefits that breastfeeding can bring to the health and welfare of babies, as well as a wider push for maternal health, focusing on good nutrition, poverty reduction and food security.\n\nBreastfeeding Week, which runs through Wednesday, August 7, aims to raise awareness of the health and well-being outcomes of breastfeeding and the importance of supporting mothers to breastfeed for as long as they wish.\n\nIn a previous Nassau Guardian article, Trineka Hall, BNBA president, said the baby's benefits are vast as a result of breastfeeding. Because of those benefits, the BNBA's mission seeks to sensitize people to the benefits of breastfeeding.\n\nHall, a mother of three, spoke from experience, having breastfed her oldest child for approximately three to four weeks before she chose to feed formula via a bottle. She said then that she did so due to a lack of information at the time that she could express her milk, pump it, store it, and take it to the nursery, so she just went ahead and gave her baby formula.\n\nBy the time she had her second child, she had met Nurse Carlotta Klass, the lactation coordinator at the time, who educated her on breastfeeding. Armed with the correct information, Hall said she exclusively breastfeed her second child for two and a half years, and her third child until the child no longer wanted the breast.\n\nIt was through breastfeeding her second and third children that Hall said she learned firsthand the benefits of breastfeeding, which she said included the closeness and bonding with the baby, the specific nutrition only she could provide as a mother, the cost savings, and the health benefits for not only the baby but for herself as well.\n\nThe lactation consultant also said she noticed the financial difference between having her first child and her other children after giving one formula, and breastfeeding the other two. She said she saved money on formula, bottles and the like.\n\nShe encourages pregnant mothers to consider trying to breastfeed for the first six months and to notice the money they save. She said the added benefit would be healthier, smarter children.\n\nAccording to the nurse, when learning to breastfeed, the most important thing a mother-to-be can do to prepare is to have confidence in herself and plan ahead. She said that committing to breastfeeding starts with a mother's belief that she can do it.\n\nWomen are also encouraged to get good prenatal care when pregnant, talk to their doctor about their plans to breastfeed, and ensure that the facility at which they plan to give birth has staff and the means to support successful breastfeeding. Mothers-to-be can also take a breastfeeding class, ask a doctor to recommend a lactation consultant for support after the baby is born, talk to friends who have breastfed, or consider joining a breastfeeding support group like BNBA. Equally important, officials say, is the mother-to-be talking to their spouse, partner, and other family members about how they can help them successfully breastfeed.\n\nThe World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action (WABA) states that empowerment is a process that requires evidence-based unbiased information and support to create the enabling environment where mothers can breastfeed optimally, and that as breastfeeding is in the mother's domain, when fathers, partners, families, workplaces and communities support her, breastfeeding improves. The process, they say, can be supported as breastfeeding is a team effort and everyone needs to protect, promote and support it.\n\nFamily members can assist by being kind and encouraging, good listeners, and helping to ensure new mothers get enough to drink and enough rest by helping around the house, and taking care of any other children who are in the home.\n\nMothers are encouraged to breastfeed as soon as possible after giving birth, then at least eight to 12 times every 24 hours to promote milk production. New mothers are advised that in the first few days after birth, that a baby will likely need to breastfeed about every one to two hours during the day and a few times at night, as healthy babies develop their own feeding patterns. Mothers are encouraged to follow their baby's cues for when he/she is ready to eat.\n\nAnd while there are many benefits to baby and mother breastfeeding, there are common breastfeeding challenges that mothers should be aware of - sore nipples; low milk supply; oversupply of milk; strong let-down reflex; engorgement; plugged ducts; breast infection (mastitis); fungal infections; inverted, flat or very large nipples; and nursing strike. But lactation specialists say for every challenge, there is a solution.", "source": {"uri": "thenassauguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nassau Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shavaughn_moss@thenassauguardian.com", "name": "Shavaughn Moss", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Breastfeeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIDS", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SIDS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Otitis media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_formula", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infant formula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_1_diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Type 1 diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Type 2 diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gastrointestinal disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breast milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrotizing_enterocolitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Necrotizing enterocolitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ovarian cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Pediatrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Academy of Pediatrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antibody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diarrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Preterm birth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hypertension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vomiting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hormone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Special_Needs", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Special Needs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thenassauguardian.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/2b/02b56a5e-513d-11ef-9e84-575d0d15ad0b/66ad90cf126a6.image.jpg?crop=1528%2C802%2C0%2C108&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794513", "eventUri": "eng-9794513", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 1829, "textEnd": 1837}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Prakash, Consultant Paediatrician and Neonatologist at Prashanth Hospitals - Velachery and Kolathur shared the following insights.\n\nGlobally, it is estimated that exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months and continued breastfeeding up to at least two years could prevent a significant number of infant deaths. Breastfeeding offers substantial health benefits that not only enhance the immediate well-being of infants but also contribute to their long-term health and development.\n\nAlternatives When Breastfeeding is Not Possible\n\nIn cases where a mother's milk is not available, pasteurized donor human milk serves as a valuable alternative for extremely and moderately preterm infants in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). This option provides many of the protective benefits of breast milk, supporting the health of vulnerable newborns.

This initiative aims to leverage data from a nuclear technique that accurately measures breast milk consumption and determines the exclusivity of breastfeeding.\n\nWorld Breastfeeding Week, observed in the first week of August, promotes the protection, promotion, and support of breastfeeding. According to the World Health Organization, exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life shields infants from infections and reduces mortality rates.\n\nThe IAEA's Database on Human Milk Intake, which has compiled data from 34 countries using the deuterium oxide dose-to-mother (DTM) technique, provides valuable insights into how much breast milk infants consume and whether they are exclusively breastfed. Despite the progress, the database lacks sufficient data from high-income countries, hindering a comprehensive understanding of global breastfeeding practices and disparities.\n\n\"The evidence we have so far is limited to a few countries, mostly from the Global South. To draw more robust conclusions and support policy development, we need broader data, including from the Global North,\" says Victor Ochieng Owino, a nutrition specialist at the IAEA.\n\nThe DTM technique, which tracks deuterium, a stable isotope of hydrogen, as it transfers from mother to infant, offers a more precise measurement of breastfeeding exclusivity than self-reported data. The IAEA encourages more countries to adopt this non-invasive method to monitor progress towards exclusive breastfeeding targets.\n\nCornelia Loechl, Head of the Nutritional and Health-Related Environmental Studies Section at the IAEA, explains, \"Our goal with the Database on Human Milk is to create a comprehensive global repository of DTM data. This will facilitate in-depth analyses and improve our understanding of breastfeeding behaviors and their determinants, leading to more effective interventions.\"\n\nThe DTM data is already influencing public health policies. For instance, a study in Mauritania revealed that awareness campaigns significantly increased exclusive breastfeeding rates in targeted areas. Similarly, in South Africa, mentoring and counseling programs improved exclusive breastfeeding rates. Additionally, research in Western Kenya linked food insecurity with reduced breast milk intake, highlighting the impact of maternal nutrition on breastfeeding.\n\nLaunched in 2022, the IAEA's human milk intake database continues to expand, offering insights into the relationships between breastfeeding practices and various factors like socio-economic status. A recent analysis using the database suggested that maternal education level may not significantly impact breast milk intake, although trends in countries with lower Human Development Index (HDI) indicated higher breast milk intake. This underscores the need for more comprehensive data from diverse contexts.\n\nBreastfeeding is integral to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and aligns with several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It combats malnutrition, protects infants from infections, and supports maternal health by reducing the risk of certain diseases. Expanding the database with global data is crucial for closing evidence gaps and improving breastfeeding practices to benefit future generations.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Breast milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Atomic Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Breastfeeding_Week", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Breastfeeding Week"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Breastfeeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_North_and_Global_South", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Global North and Global South"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heavy water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Ochieng", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victor Ochieng"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deuterium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Isotope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_high-income_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Bank high-income economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maternal health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human Development Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable Development Goals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malnutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mauritania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mauritania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Environmental_Health", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Environmental Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Non-Toxic_Living", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Non-Toxic Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/01_08_2019_19_17_29_2651155.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794513", "eventUri": "eng-9794513", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

80 per cent of Hong Kong mothers say they need more and cleaner breastfeeding facilities", "body": "Survey of 1,400 mothers and in-depth interviews with 30 by Equal Opportunities Commission show they also faced discrimination from employers\n\nMore than 80 per cent of Hong Kong mothers say they need more breastfeeding facilities in public places and struggle to find hygienic nursing rooms, a study by the city\u2019s equality watchdog has found.\n\nThe Equal Opportunities Commission on Tuesday marked World Breastfeeding Week by calling on authorities and venue operators to foster a more breastfeeding-friendly environment, as part of a wider initiative to encourage childbirth in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cWe must not only build more breastfeeding facilities and improve sanitary conditions but also promote a cultural shift towards breastfeeding, including among employers and venue operators,\u201d said Ferrick Chu Chung-man, executive director of the commission.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that most breastfeeding facilities are being provided by shopping malls instead of offices and government \u2026 the authorities should take the lead and do more to promote the culture of breastfeeding, especially in sports and cultural venue,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to the study, which surveyed more than 1,400 mothers between July and September last year, 81 per cent said there should be more hygienic breastfeeding facilities in public places, while 75 per cent said such facilities should cater to more privacy.\n\nAbout half of the respondents struggled with long queues outside nursing rooms with poor sanitary conditions when breastfeeding or lactating in commercial and government premises.\n\nIn-depth interviews with 30 mothers further revealed their plight, with some lamenting that nursing rooms were located inside disabled toilets, or were even misused by venue staff to take naps.\n\nThey added that some nursing rooms did not separate the breastfeeding and diaper-changing areas, which prevented parents from concurrently using spaces for different uses, leading to longer waiting times.\n\nA few added that their husbands struggled to find a place to change their children\u2019s diapers in public because some nursing rooms permitted entry only to females.\n\nA quarter of interviewees in the focus group reported discrimination and harassment, including one working mother who was told by a male supervisor she should lactate only in view of a surveillance camera.\n\nA few others were stopped from breastfeeding in public by security guards or restaurant staff, or received unwelcoming stares.\n\nThe research team also reviewed 50 government premises and 50 shopping malls and found that eight and 10 of them respectively did not have any baby care facilities, and almost all that did were built before 2000.\n\nEven if they did, their size was too small, with 40 per cent of government premises and 50 per cent of shopping centres failing to comply with size recommendations for such facilities laid out by the Buildings Department.\n\nThe study also found that most of these facilities did not use gender-neutral symbols and had locks that were poorly designed for parents carrying babies.\n\nDoris Tsui Ue-ting, the watchdog\u2019s head of policy, research and training, suggested that the government provide more incentives for the private sector to build sufficient breastfeeding facilities of good quality, including tax reduction, gross floor area ratio concessions, and award schemes.\n\n\u201cA fundamental way to solve the supply-demand problem is to revise the guidelines of the Buildings Department to require commercial premises to build more than one baby care and lactation room in each building,\u201d she said.\n\nTsui said private developers should offer solutions to meet the demand for such facilities, including providing mobile breastfeeding stations during peak periods.\n\nThey should also improve the design and sanitary conditions of facilities to be more inclusive, including separating breastfeeding and diaper-changing spaces and allowing males to enter the latter, she added.\n\nMore education and training was also needed for employers to reduce discrimination against women breastfeeding in the workplace, Tsui said.\n\nShe revealed the watchdog had received 17 complaints \u2013 over 80 per cent of which involved discrimination by employers \u2013 following an amendment to the sex discrimination ordinance in 2021 to offer legal protection to breastfeeding mothers.\n\nBut that figure could be an underrepresentation of workplace discrimination against breastfeeding mothers because of the Covid-19 pandemic, when many people avoided going out, she added.\n\nIn 2022, the city\u2019s breastfeeding rate upon new mothers\u2019 hospital discharge stood at 85 per cent. Mothers who exclusively breastfed their babies till they were six months old was 22 per cent in 2020.\n\nTo support breastfeeding, the government is set to launch its first breastmilk bank in the first quarter of 2025, aiming to collect 1,000 litres annually and help 450 to 600 babies who are born either prematurely or with serious illnesses each year.\n\nThe bank will start accepting applications from eligible mothers in the fourth quarter of this year.\n\nThe Hospital Authority will also launch massage classes for new mothers to teach them how to relieve pain and discomfort during and after breastfeeding.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Opportunities_Commission_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Equal Opportunities Commission (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Breastfeeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_mall", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shopping mall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sanitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hygiene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lactation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Childbirth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding_in_public", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breastfeeding in public"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Child care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breast milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Employment discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military discharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massage"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/images/canvas/2024/08/06/680f9b15-00dd-4ecb-8b6c-73220513a135_e92ecc4b.jpg?itok=GkEnKDaU", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794513", "eventUri": "eng-9794513", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Making the best decisions and caring for their newborns is essential for new mothers. One widespread misconception is that nursing is always simple and instinctive; however, many moms have issues like discomfort, low milk production, or difficulty latching. Knowing this can encourage them to seek assistance from lactation consultants or medical professionals instead of feeling defeated or unworthy.\n\nThere's also a misunderstanding that formula feeding is as healthy as breastfeeding; nevertheless, breast milk has special nutrients and antibodies that are matched to the needs of the infant and can strengthen their immune system. Furthermore, despite evidence that it strengthens emotional development and creates a stable attachment, some people think breastfeeding will make a child overly dependent. Additionally, it gives moms the confidence to breastfeed for as long as they and their children want to, knowing that it's a natural and healthy decision.\n\nBreast milk has special nutrients and antibodies, strengthening the infant's immune system. (Image Credit: Canva)\n\nIn general, dispelling these stereotypes can lead to better breastfeeding experiences, enhanced health outcomes for mothers and infants, and a more accepting community. In a conversation with Jagran English, Dr. Anagha Madhuraj Kulkarni, an international lactation consultant at Rainbow Children's Hospital at Marathahalli in Bengaluru, discussed common myths about breastfeeding that everyone should be aware of.\n\nAccording to Dr. Anagha, a new baby's arrival brings great delight and significant change. You might love the cuddling and your newfound purpose, but you might also have restless nights and never-ending diaper duty. Although it can be difficult at times, breastfeeding, also known as chestfeeding, is frequently praised as a unique bonding experience. We will dispel five widespread misconceptions about breastfeeding in this post, offering guidance and useful tips to help you through this important part of caring for your child.\n\nAlso Read: Consuming Water From Plastic Bottles May Raise Blood Pressure; Says Study\n\nBreastfeeding shouldn't hurt, but in the early days when your body gets used to nursing, it's natural to feel some tenderness and sensitivity in your breasts and nipples. Due to pregnancy hormone changes, nipples become sensitive. It's called transient soreness. See a lactation consultant for help if you experience ongoing pain or discomfort. They can assist in identifying any problems and offer advice on proper deep latch techniques and nursing positions to ensure a more comfortable experience.\n\nAlthough there are numerous benefits to nursing, it also takes time and effort. Unlike formula feeding, you won't need to mix the formula, heat the water, clean and disinfect the equipment, or prepare the bottles. When you breastfeed, especially during those late-night feedings, your baby will always have access to milk at the right temperature and time. This could streamline the process and reduce the overall time involved.\n\nWhile it may seem instinctual for babies to root, latch, and suck when breastfed, breastfeeding is actually an art and skill with deep latch technique that you and your child must learn. Although babies are born with the ability to locate the breast and begin nursing, it takes coordination and learning. Consider nursing like a dance: your infant will naturally follow the moves, but it will take time and practice to get the hang of it. Breastfeeding might be difficult at first, but with patience and persistence, it will become easier and more natural for you both.\n\nCrying is always a communication sign between you and your baby. Your infant may cry, but this does not always indicate that you are not nursing your child well enough. Babies use crying as a means of expressing their demands, which might include the need for comfort and attention, overstimulation, a soiled diaper, discomfort from being too hot or cold, or just hunger. See your pediatrician for advice if you observe your baby crying more than usual or if you're worried that the crying could be due to inadequate feeding.\n\nAdditionally, you can get help and answers to any questions you may have regarding feeding and breastfeeding techniques from lactation consultants and professionals.\n\nHaving big or small breasts has no bearing on how much milk you can produce. Regardless of the size of their breasts or nipples, babies can nurse successfully. Finding the ideal posture for both you and your infant may need some guidance. The advice of a lactation consultant or breastfeeding peer counselor can greatly aid in finding what works best for both of you.\n\nAlso Read: 3 Easy Exercises Recommended By Expert To Practise In Office For Back Strain Relief\n\nFinally, Dr. Anagha said, dispelling these widespread misconceptions about breastfeeding enables you to have a more knowledgeable and satisfying experience by highlighting the facts. Nursing has its difficulties, but by knowing the reality behind these myths, you may arm yourself with the information and self-assurance you need to get through it. Remember that every mother's breastfeeding journey and nursing experience is different, and getting help from friends, family, and specialists can be very beneficial. Recognize that you are giving your child a loving and advantageous start in life as you accept the process with openness and patience.\n\nDr. Anagha also gave a tip for all new mothers, saying that breastfeeding is always best and that it is a baby's first right to receive nutritious breastmilk.", "source": {"uri": "english.jagran.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jagran English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation_consultant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lactation consultant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Breastfeeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Breast milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instinct", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instinct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antibody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_formula", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infant formula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Immune system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nutrient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latch_(breastfeeding)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Latch (breastfeeding)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nipple", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nipple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stereotype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hormone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blood pressure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://imgeng.jagran.com/images/2024/08/06/article/image/breastfeedingmyths-1722946731174.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794513", "eventUri": "eng-9794513", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

The need for a resilient manufacturing operation is a lesson well learned during the pandemic and even more so since. The key to a resilient manufacturing operation is the combination of people and technology. The people are the linchpin, and nothing good is going to happen without the right people doing the right things. But those people need the right tools as well. One of the most powerful tools for manufacturing is also one of the most powerful tools for humankind. It\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI), and it\u2019s near the top of the news just about every day. In manufacturing, the opportunities for AI are being talked about a lot, but like everywhere else, AI is still in its infancy. But it\u2019s not going to be there for long. AI is growing rapidly, and its use in manufacturing is growing rapidly as well. The applications are endless. Let\u2019s spend some time looking at some specific ways that AI can be used in manufacturing.

AI takes huge amounts of data, typically millions of data points, analyzes them in real time and makes predictions as to what\u2019s going to happen. The league has employed AI to evaluate players and help prevent injuries. In manufacturing, it\u2019s the same idea. AI takes the huge amounts of data a manufacturing operation generates, analyzes that data in real time and makes predictions as to what\u2019s going to happen, far enough in advance to make necessary decisions. It\u2019s only a short step from AI predictions to AI prescriptions. AI analyzes the data, makes the predictions and then makes specific prescriptions as to what needs to be corrected before the situation gets out of hand or even occurs at all. AI can also close the loop, provide the feedback and execute the prescriptions on its own, correcting the situation before anyone even knows a problem existed. Predictive Maintenance This use of AI has been going on for a while under the label of machine learning. But the latest versions are all AI, and it\u2019s already having a huge impact on manufacturing operations. Just like predictive analytics, AI collects huge amounts of data from key manufacturing assets such as equipment, machines and processes, analyzes that data in real time and then predicts when that equipment or machine might fail. This allows for maintenance to be run on the equipment right before it fails and no sooner. It also allows maintenance to be scheduled when it won\u2019t impact production operations. Applying AI reduces failures that impact production, reduces unplanned downtime and significantly reduces the cost of maintenance. Recipe Optimization Many industries don\u2019t have the luxury of using raw materials that have little variability. Most process industries, like food and beverage manufacturing, for example, simply take the available raw materials, knowing that variability is just part of the business. Milk comes from different dairies. Grain comes from different farms. Variability in raw materials is just the nature of industries like food and beverage. But consumers don\u2019t really want variability in the products they buy, so manufacturers must make invariable products from variable raw materials. One way they do that is through dynamic recipes. The idea is recipes are adjusted product by product and run by run based on the specific characteristics of the raw materials. Based on the variability of the raw materials and the need for invariant products, this process gets complicated very quickly. That\u2019s exactly where AI comes in. AI takes the data from the raw materials in all their variations, considers the products to be made and then precisely adjusts the recipes to ensure that the products are made correctly the first time. AI then takes it a step further and optimizes the changes in the recipes to optimize the use of the raw materials so that not only is the product made correctly, but it\u2019s also made for the lowest cost. That is a game-changing use of AI in food and beverage manufacturing. Crew Optimization One of the lessons learned from the pandemic is that manufacturing operations must be flexible when it comes to crewing. On any given day, some people might be out sick, some might be needed for other jobs, some might be on a special assignment and some might just need to go to the dentist. This means that getting the right people on the right job to keep the manufacturing operations running can be quite a challenge. Again, this is where AI comes in. AI analyzes the available personnel and the tasks required to run the manufacturing operations. AI also analyzes the specific certifications of the available personnel. After all, only certified people are allowed to work on certain processes and on certain equipment. AI even considers the history of the personnel knowing that some people simply work better on certain equipment or certain assignments than others. AI analyzes the available data in real time and determines the most optimal assignment of personnel. AI maximizes manufacturing output by effectively using the available personnel. When more personnel become available, AI reanalyzes the situation and determines a new optimal set of assignments. Conclusion AI is a powerful tool that can have a significant impact in many areas of manufacturing. Whether it\u2019s predictive and prescriptive analytics, predictive maintenance, recipe optimization or crew optimization, AI can have a significant role in helping build a resilient manufacturing operation. The ability to optimize crews, optimize recipes, minimize downtime and maintenance costs and prevent problems before they even occur is, by definition, what a resilient operation is all about. We\u2019ve only scratched the surface of AI applications in manufacturing. In the next post, we\u2019ll look at even more ways AI helps build a resilient manufacturing operation. Stay tuned.

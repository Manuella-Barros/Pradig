CAS in a statement on its website on Friday in a unan-imous decision rejected the appeals by World Athletics and WADA and confirms the decision by the World Athlet-ics Disciplinary Tribunal that Amusan did not commit any anti-doping rule violation. Amusan, 27, was charged in July 2023 with missing three anti-doping tests in a period of 12 months, but was cleared of the offence by the Disciplinary Tribunal of the sport\u2019s govern-ing body, World Athletics. However, World Athletics and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against that de-cision. CAS said in a statement on Friday stated, \u201cThe Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has dismissed the appeals filed by World Athletics (WA) and by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) against the decision issued on 17 August 2023 (the Challenged Decision) by the World Athletics Disci-plinary Tribunal (WADT) in relation to the hurdler Olu-watobiloba (Tobi) Amusan (Nigeria). \u201cAccordingly, the Chal-lenged Decision in which the WADT considered that Tobi Amusan did not violate Rule 2.4 of the WA Anti-Doping Rules (WA ADR) and that no period of ineligibility should be imposed on the Athlete is confirmed.\u201d Amusan was initially charged with committing an Anti-Doping Rule Violation (ADRV) under Rule 2.4 WA ADR following three alleged whereabouts failures within a 12-month period. \u201cIn their respective appeal to CAS, WA and WADA had sought the imposition of a two-year period of ineligi-bility. The CAS Panel held a hearing on 19 January 2024. Having deliberated, the CAS Panel has issued its decision today (Friday) dismissing both appeals. The CAS Panel unani-mously acknowledged that the Athlete committed two filing failures but did not confirm the existence of a missed test, alleged by WA and WADA, which would have been the third Whereabouts Failure committed within a 12-month period. \u201cAccordingly, the CAS Pan-el concluded that the Athlete did not commit an ADRV and that the Challenged Decision should be confirmed.\u201d Amusan set the world re-cord of 12.12sec in the world championships in Eugene, Or-egon, in July 2022 and went on to win the title. She finished sixth in the world championships in Bu-dapest last year. World Athletics\u2019 anti-dop-ing rules say any athlete failing to declare their whereabouts for a doping test on three oc-casions over a 12-month period is ineligible to compete for two years.", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"408\" height=\"435\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Amusan-3-e1719638032687.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" /></div>&#160;&#8230;Athlete Can Compete At The Paris Olympics Nigeria\u2019s Tobi Amu\u00adsan, the world\u2019s 100m hurdles record hold\u00ader, is free to compete at the Paris Olympics follow\u00ading the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) clearing her of doping violation at the in\u00adstance of World Athletics.

However, the company's EBIT margin is projected to contract due to recent wage hikes.\"\n\nThe deal pipeline remains robust, focusing on demand recovery in the second half of FY25. Furthermore, management's commentary on the demand environment would be a key thing to watch out for, he added.\n\nAccording to analysts at Motilal Oswal, TCS is likely to have grown 1.6 per cent QoQ CC, led by deal scale-up, including the BSNL deal, which is ramping up as per plan. Its EBIT margin may contract 150 bps QoQ owing to wage hikes in Q1FY25.\n\nOn HCL Tech, analysts expect a 2 per cent sequential decline in revenue for the quarter, influenced by customary annual productivity adjustments to clients and planned reductions in its IT services segment. Margin contraction of 80 basis points is expected quarter-on-quarter due to seasonal challenges. The company is expected to maintain its FY25 revenue growth forecast of 3-5 per cent.\n\nOn the overall IT sector, brokerage firm Motilal Oswal in its note said, \"The brutal winter of discretionary spend cuts in the industry is likely over, but there is little evidence of a recovery in the flow business. Hence, we are on track for one of the weakest first quarters for at least 10 years. The situation, though slightly better, is eerily similar to what we witnessed in 1HFY24. We would be looking for signs of recovery in discretionary spending in the form of deal activities, which have been heavily skewed towards cost-takeout projects.\"\n\nThe brokerage added that revenue growth of Tier-I IT companies in Q1FY25 is estimated to be in the range of -0.5% to +2.0% QoQ in CC.

According to analysts, IT companies are expected to post moderate growth rate improvement for many companies, driven by seasonal strength, large deal ramp-up, and fewer cuts in discretionary programmes.\n\nTCS Q1 Earnings\n\nAccording to analysts at Motilal Oswal, TCS is likely to have grown 1.6 per cent QoQ CC, led by deal scale-up, including the BSNL deal, which is ramping up as per plan. Its EBIT margin may contract 150 bps QoQ owing to wage hikes in Q1FY25.\n\nIt added that the deal pipeline should remain healthy. Outlook on near-term demand & pricing environment, BFSI, and deal wins are key monitorables.\n\nInfosys Q1 Earnings\n\nAccording to Motilal Oswal, Infosys is expected to see a rebound in revenue growth to 2.0 per cent QoQ CC, on account of ramp-up of large deals won in FY24. Motilal Oswal expects the deal TCV to be robust in Q1; however, deals should be skewed towards the cost-takeout initiatives.\n\nThe operating margin for Infosys in Q1 is expected to increase by 30 basis points, supported by growth momentum and the absence of wage hikes. Infosys' operating margin is likely to reach 20.4%. The company is also likely to maintain its growth guidance of 1-3% in constant currency for FY25, according to Motilal Oswal.\n\nOverall IT Sector Q1 Expectations\n\nManish Chowdhury, head (research) at StoxBox, said, \"We anticipate moderate growth rate improvement for many companies, driven by seasonal strength, large deal ramp-up, and fewer cuts in discretionary programs. The EBIT margin will vary sequentially across different companies based on wage revision, but it will be steady or increasing for many on a YoY basis.\"\n\nAlthough large and mega-deal announcements have been somewhat moderate, the timing of large deal signings tends to be volatile, and signings can bounce back for others in Q2FY25. Our focus would remain on management commentaries indicating the emergence of green shoots in growth and revival in H2FY25. Furthermore, the increasing adoption of new-generation technologies, particularly AI, is expected to counterbalance the slow growth in enterprise spending, he added.\n\n\"Another trigger for the IT companies is the possibility of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September 2024 that may show early recovery, particularly in the BFS sector. We believe the valuation across the companies remains comfortable and our outlook remains positive on the sector,\" Chowdhury said.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motilal_Oswal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motilal Oswal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosys", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infosys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Consultancy_Services", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tata Consultancy Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCLTech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "HCLTech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest_and_taxes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earnings before interest and taxes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlook_(Indian_magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outlook (Indian magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Sanchar_Nigam_Limited", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 52}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/07/tcs-hcl-2024-07-4db808c9e02e2ba4d6fb8a646fe63366-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720389", "eventUri": "eng-9720389", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 317, "textEnd": 324}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-12", "textStart": 349, "textEnd": 356}], "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

However, TCS may face margin pressure due to wage hikes.\n\nAlso read: Ahead of IT results season, GenAI revenues a key metric to determine growth of companies\n\nThe company is set to release its Q1 results on Thursday. According to brokerage estimates, TCS is expected to report a net profit ranging from \u20b911,771 crore to \u20b912,140 crore for the June quarter, representing a 6-9 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) increase compared to Q1FY24's net profit of \u20b911,074 crore. Sequentially, there could be a slight dip of 3-5 per cent.\n\nRevenue is anticipated to grow by 4-5 per cent Y-o-Y, with estimates ranging between \u20b962,086 crore and \u20b962,491 crore.\n\nNuvuma Securities predicts that TCS will achieve 14 per cent quarter-on-quarter (Q-o-Q) CC revenue growth and 1.1 per cent Q-o-Q US Dollar growth, driven by recovery in the BFSI sector and continued strength in manufacturing. However, they also expect margins to decline by 140 basis points (bp) Q-o-Q due to wage increases.\n\nAlso read: TCS partners with XEROX for IT transformation\n\nKotak Institutional Equities attributes TCS's revenue growth to strong order signings from previous quarters, including $150 million from the BSNL deal. This would lead to marginal growth compared to the March 2024 quarter.\n\nICICI Securities estimates a 1.8 per cent Q-o-Q CC revenue growth for TCS, driven by traction in BFSI, retail (consumer business group), and hi-tech segments from deals announced in Q1. They also anticipate a 186 bp Q-o-Q decline in EBIT margin due to higher employee costs. The brokerage eagerly awaits management commentary on enterprise discretionary spending, deal announcements, campus hiring, large deals, and the BFSI sector's turnaround.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on July 10, 2024", "source": {"uri": "thehindubusinessline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "@businessline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Consultancy_Services", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tata Consultancy Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Broker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotak_Mahindra_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kotak Mahindra Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Sanchar_Nigam_Limited", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICICI_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ICICI Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest_and_taxes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earnings before interest and taxes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BP"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/kg7agk/article68388380.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2024-02-19T132401Z_1999367118_RC2P56AM1JMZ_RTRMADP_3_TCS-RESULTS.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720389", "eventUri": "eng-9720389", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-07-", "textStart": 2109, "textEnd": 2116}], "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

So all eyes will be on the country's largest software exporter Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which will be kicking off the first-quarter earnings season.\n\nAnalysts appear cautiously optimistic on the sector overall, expecting marginal improvement in FY25 on the back of discretionary spending improving and the hype around generative AI. TCS and HCLTech were relatively consistent in delivering growth in FY24, compared with tier-I IT peers like Infosys, Wipro and Tech Mahindra, all of which saw a significant slowdown.\n\nAs the street gears up for TCS' upcoming earnings announcement on July 11, here are the five key themes to watch for:\n\nRevenue growth and margins\n\nTCS is expected to deliver a modest sequential growth in revenue of 1.6 percent, driven by a ramping up of large deals including cost takeout ones, or those that involve reducing costs for clients. According to analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities (KIE), this will include an estimated $150 million from a $1.8 billion deal with the state-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited.\n\nThe quarter is also expected to see weak revenue in the financial services and telecom verticals. There will be an impact of cross-currency headwinds too.\n\nThe company's EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes, or operating) margin is likely see a decline of 130 basis points over the previous quarter, especially as it rolled out wage hikes during the April-June period, according to Moneycontrol's poll average of 11 brokerage firms.\n\n\"We expect EBIT margins to be impacted by 200bps QoQ on wage hikes (double-digit for top performers); offset partially by utilization improvement, pyramid optimisation, and other productivity benefits. Sub-contracting cost has bottomed out in FY24,\" an ICICI Securities report said.\n\nDuring Q4 earnings conference call in April, TCS had announced annual increments in the range of 4.5-7 percent with double-digit hikes in pay for top performers starting from April 1.\n\nLast year, 'exceptional' performers got 12-15 percent salary hikes.\n\nThe impact of the current wage hike cycle is expected to reflect on the margins. Interestingly, for the first time in 19 years, TCS' headcount in the fourth quarter declined by 13,249 on an annualised basis.\n\nDemand outlook\n\nWhile TCS in the three months to March reported an all-time high quarterly order book of $13.2 billion, Q1 was subdued in comparison.\n\nSome of the deals signed during this quarter were a generative AI and cloud transformation deal with Xerox, a GenAI partnership with Amazon Web Services and a BFSI deal with Burgan Bank, to name a few.\n\n\"We expect $11- 12 billion of deal wins, driven by a high rate of closures of cost takeout deals. Renewal component in deals will be higher, in our view. Focus will be on TCS's ability to leverage its strengths in 'Run' spends and outperform on revenue growth in FY2025E,\" the KIE report said.\n\nThe street will keep a close eye on the management commentary around discretionary spending coming back and outlook on how demand will pan out in FY25. Focus will also be on BFSI recovery, and demand in North America, UK and Europe.\n\nAccording to analysts, the worst is over for discretionary spending delays and clients are slowly getting on track with their technology budgets, though they still remain wary.\n\nGenerative AI pipeline\n\nGenAI has become an important driver for IT firms in recent times as discretionary spend remained elusive.\n\nAfter Accenture, TCS was the only IT major to share its GenAI deal pipeline numbers. As of Q4, TCS' Gen AI pipeline had doubled to $900 million with over 200 active engagements.\n\nLast month, Accenture reported that its Gen AI bookings were worth over $900 million in the second quarter. This takes the total GenAI bookings to $2 billion for the fiscal year to date.\n\nTCS being a close competitor that has started calling out its GenAI deal pipeline, the results announcement will be a watched event for any new updates.\n\nHiring plans\n\nTCS CEO and managing director K Krithivasan has already indicated that the company will be adding around 40,000 freshers in FY25, similar to what it had hired in the previous fiscal year. But the sector overall has been marred by both fresher and lateral hiring delays.\n\nIT companies have been hiring in a controlled manner since FY24, aiming to improve utilisation rates as demand has remained hard to come by amidst macroeconomic uncertainty.\n\nAccording to analysts, lateral hiring in FY25 will be driven by niche skills in areas like AI, cloud computing and cybersecurity.\n\nAs hiring trends are closely linked to the demand expected in the IT services sector, TCS' hiring plans for FY25 will be closely tracked by shareholders.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com",

According to analysts, India's largest IT services company is expected to have experienced revenue growth surpassing that of the past five quarters, despite a potential decline in profit and margins.\n\nAlthough the IT giant's key figures for the June quarter may be softer, this is unlikely to disappoint the market.

Most verticals and geographies saw sequential growth too. Given this, one could ask the question 'Have the business fundamentals in the IT sector bottomed out?' If so, given TCS' track record of best-in-class execution and history of successfully adapting to multiple tech and non-tech disruptions in the industry, investors can expect TCS to be on a growth path. However, given many factors that contribute to uncertainty at different levels, it would be too early to celebrate if you are a TCS investor. Here are five reasons why Q1 results is not an all-clear signal and investors need to stay cautious.\n\nFor one, on a year-on-year basis, the numbers still look lacklustre. Constant currency (CC) revenue growth at 4.4 per cent remains weak. Key vertical BFSI, which accounts for 32 per cent of revenue, reported flat performance, and key geography North America reported a 1 per cent decline. While CEO Krithivasan re-iterated that he believes FY25 will be better than FY24, it does not set a high bar given the fact that FY24 CC revenue growth was a weak 3.4 per cent.\n\nTwo, at a trailing PE of 30 times the TCS stock is still priced as though it is a mid-teens percentage growth stock, compared to its current low single-digit growth. During the years FY17 and FY18 when TCS reported similar low-single-digit percentage revenue growth, TCS traded in the PE range of 16 to 23 times. So at current valuation, any better-than-expected performance is already priced in.\n\nThree, the long-term disruptive impact of IT on the business of IT services companies like TCS is still unclear. According to Krithivasan, people generally tend to over-estimate the near-term positive impact of disruptive technologies, while they under-estimate the long-term positive impact. This reflects his belief that AI benefits for TCS are more likely to flow in the medium to long term. From this, the indications are clear there is unlikely to be any meaningful uplift to TCS business or financials from AI.\n\nWith regard to long term, yes, there is a strong case to be made that TCS can benefit from AI, as it did from the cloud digitisation theme and related disruptions in the previous decade. However, as mentioned above, the reason, investors benefitted from the successful adaptations of the company to technological evolution was that the company then was priced for the uncertainty unlike now, where it is more than priced to perfection with regard to potential gains from AI.\n\nFour, the US recession threat still looms for Indian IT services companies. A fiery debate is still on, as to whether a recession has been delayed or derailed. It may be imprudent to conclude that a US soft-landing is certain, just as it was to conclude in early 2023 that a recession was certain. So far in 2024, the Q1 US GDP at 1.6 per cent and estimates for around similar growth in Q2, reflect a slowdown compared to quarterly GDP growth in the range of 2-4.9 per cent. How this trends will remain a crucial barometer for the FY25 performance of TCS, given the company derives around 52 per cent of revenue from the region.\n\nFive, Accenture and TCS are globally the industry bellwethers for IT services and consulting. Their financial, share performance and valuations tend to track each other. Yet, what is worth noting is that a clear divergence has been emerging recently. This is something that we pointed out in our bl.portfolio edition dated April 30 (Accenture sets the tone for IT stocks from here). Their share performance and valuation have been taking a divergent trend. Over the last one year, while Accenture shares are down 4 per cent, TCS shares are up 20 per cent. In the last five years, the earnings CAGR for Accenture, at 10 per cent, has been marginally better than that of TCS at 9 per cent. While in the current FY, TCS is expected to marginally outpace Accenture, given history and Accenture's higher share in consulting/AI revenues, TCS' current 20 per cent premium valuation is something to take note of. For most investors focused on Indian stocks, why does this matter? It's because over a period of time, this differential is likely to get bridged by Accenture shares outperforming TCS shares. This makes TCS relatively a less attractive stock for global investors, or Indian investors too who are willing to invest in international stocks. The other way to look at it is - global investors are not showing as much enthusiasm on IT services/consulting stocks as Indian investors. Wondering why this is the case might help address some blind spots.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on July 11, 2024", "source": {"uri": "thehindubusinessline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "@businessline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Consultancy_Services", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tata Consultancy Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Physical education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accenture", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accenture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sequence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_per_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earnings per share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Growth stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disruptive innovation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_(communication)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Media (communication)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_annual_growth_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Compound annual growth rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barometer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/dpwk0t/article68393880.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2024-07-11T101630Z_251220447_RC2NF5AMJ7BH_RTRMADP_3_TCS-RESULTS.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720389", "eventUri": "eng-9720389", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-30", "textStart": 3565, "textEnd": 3573}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-07-", "textStart": 4772, "textEnd": 4779}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

The company does not provide revenue growth guidance, but investors will look at management commentary on the outlook. Here are important parameters the investors need to see in the results:\n\nEBIT Margin\n\nTCS' EBIT margins are expected to contract by 150 basis points (bps) QoQ, owing to wage hikes in Q1FY25. A basis point is equal to a 100th percentage point.\n\nRevenue Growth\n\nAccording to a CNBC-TV18 poll, TCS is likely to register a quarter-on-quarter revenue growth of 1.5 per cent at Rs 62,170 crore, compared to Rs 61,237 crore in the March 2024 quarter.\n\n\"We expect TCS's revenue growth to be sequentially in the lower single digits, led by contributions from recent deal wins,\" Manish Chowdhury, head of research, StoxBox.\n\nGrowth in key verticals\n\nTCS has higher dependence on the banking, financial services & insurance (BFSI) and the retail verticals than its peers in the industry, and its growth in these segments will be a key watch out for. BFSI contributes the highest about 31 per cent of the company's total revenues, while retail accounts for about 14 per cent to the total revenue.\n\nManagement Commentary on Outlook\n\nManagement commentary on the outlook on demand environment would be key thing to watch out for. Outlook on near-term demand & pricing environment, BFSI, and deal wins are key monitorables.\n\nDeal Pipeline\n\nAccording to Motilal Oswal, the deal pipeline should remain healthy.\n\n\"The deal pipeline remains robust, focusing on demand recovery in the second half of FY25,\" Stoxbox's Chowdhury said.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Consultancy_Services", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tata Consultancy Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest_and_taxes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earnings before interest and taxes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC_TV18", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC TV18"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlook_(Indian_magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outlook (Indian magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/04/tcs-12-2024-04-417447686fbc8578ed4fe4e3eebbf963-16x9.png?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720389", "eventUri": "eng-9720389", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 80, "textEnd": 87}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

During the same time last year, the IT behemoth has reported a profit of \u20b911,120 crore. On a sequential basis, profit fell by 3.1 per cent, as the firm reported a profit of \u20b912,502 crore in the previous quarter.\n\nRegional markets continue to outperform western geographies when it comes to growth. India revenue rose by 61.8 per cent, meanwhile the revival in UK business has stagnated reporting a y-o-y growth of 6 per cent. North America and Continental Europe continue to show minimal recovery. The IT major reported a negative growth of 1.1 per cent in North America, although granted that the degrowth has moderated since the last quarter. Revenues only grew by 0.9 per cent in Continental Europe. Top verticals such as BFSI and Consumer Business continue to show degrowth of 0.9 per cent and 0.3 per cent. Although granted that there has been moderation in degrowth here as well.\n\nEven as the management maintains that FY25 is expected to be better than FY24, they were ready to call out when economic recovery begins decisively in the US and Continental Europe. \"Growth this quarter remains similar to last quarter, that is the reason that we are not ready to call out growth,\" K Krithivasan, CEO of TCS, said at the press conference.\n\nDrop in deal wins\n\nThe IT firm also saw a sharp drop in deal wins in the first quarter of FY25 with the order book at $8.3 billion.\n\nIts total contract value (TCV) for the quarter was 18.6 per cent lower from the $10.2 billion from the previous year and 37 per cent down from the previous quarter, the company said on July 1\n\nAlso read\n\nMarkets rebound in early trade; TCS, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, Infosys and SBI among top gainers\n\nThe management gave guidance of an order book between $7-9 billion going forward. They further added that AI has a $1.5-billion pipeline at present.\n\nRevenue grew year-on-year by 5.2 per cent to \u20b962,613 crore in Q1FY25 against \u20b959,381 crore of revenues reported in the same quarter in the previous year.\n\nOperating margins fell from the target 26 per cent achieved last quarter to 24.7 per cent in Q1FY25. Reduction in operating margin comes from the absorbing of the wage hike.\n\nAttrition level\n\nAttrition in the LTM IT continued to fall to 12.1 per cent in Q1FY25, in FY24 the attrition numbers were 12.5 per cent. Headcount at the end of Q1FY25 stood at 6,06,998. After reducing headcounts for four consecutive quarters, TCS added 5,452 associates in Q1FY25.\n\nTCS CHRO Milind Lakkad noted that attrition trend has largely stabilised and is not expected to change more than a few basis points going forward.\n\nHiring plan\n\nLakkad also added that the IT firm had hired 11,000 trainees in this quarter, contributing to the positive net addition seen at present. Lakkad deferred from predicting whether the IT firm will continue to increase its headcount going forward, stating that the IT firm will hire close to 40,000 freshers this financial year.\n\nKrithivasan further added that TCS is expected to complete network rollout for BSNL by this fiscal-end.\n\nThe company has declared an interim dividend of \u20b910 per equity share of \u20b91 each of the company.\n\nReacting to the results, Manish Chowdhury, Head of Research, StoxBox said, \"TCS' Q1FY25 result gave a mild surprise on the upside as sequential CC revenue growth of 2.2 per cent reflected an improving business environment in the US. Large deals made in the last year seem to be getting converted into revenue along with the ramp-up of the BSNL deal. The lowering attrition and the net headcount addition is a major positive and augurs well for the company's utilisation levels and subsequently its EBIT margin. Despite wage hikes in the quarter TCS managed to report a beat on EBIT margin estimates.\"\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on July 11, 2024", "source": {"uri": "thehindubusinessline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "@businessline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrowth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Degrowth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Consultancy_Services", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tata Consultancy Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Continental Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosys", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infosys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Steel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tata Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tata Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State Bank of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Sanchar_Nigam_Limited", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest_and_taxes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earnings before interest and taxes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/avwqa9/article68393731.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2024-01-14T183111Z_1473839541_RC2OF5AJ0UVX_RTRMADP_3_TCS-EXPANSION.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720389", "eventUri": "eng-9720389", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 1700, "textEnd": 1706}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-07-", "textStart": 3956, "textEnd": 3963}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

The India-headquartered company has staff in multiple Irish counties including Dublin, Cork, Athlone and Galway, along with more than 1,400 staff in Donegal.\n\nThe IT giant has made some significant strides in recent years, taking an interest in emerging technology such as the metaverse and EV technology. In Ireland, TCS recently secured a major Government contract to manage a new pension auto-enrolment system. The contract is reportedly valued at up to \u20ac150m.\n\nTCS' Irish operations have grown under the leadership of Deepak Chaudhari, who became the country head for TCS Ireland in 2018. Bringing decades of leadership experience to the role, Chaudhari has been focused on boosting TCS Ireland's role both nationally and internationally.\n\n\"The way I describe my purpose of being here is to bring global experiences and deliver them locally,\" he said. \"We've got deep industry domain expertise in several industries and we work with some of the top customers in every industry. So there's a lot to learn from all of our experiences.\n\n\"How can we bring those experiences for the benefit of Irish companies is the purpose that I operate with.\"\n\nA greater Irish focus\n\nTCS has had a presence in Ireland for a long time, but Chaudhari said the initial operation here was quite small, being designed to support global clients that had operations in Ireland. But in recent years, the IT giant has had a greater focus on \"the Irish market in itself\".\n\n\"Knowing the role Ireland is playing across Europe, and the progressive economy it is, we felt it was prudent for us to really invest into the geography as well as be a part of contributing to the growth of the economy,\" he said.\n\nOne of the biggest expansions for TCS Ireland came in 2020 when it acquired Donegal-based Pramerica. This paved the way for TCS' to develop its global delivery centre in Letterkenny. The company provides a range of services from this centre, from cloud and IT support to cybersecurity protection.\n\nChaudhari said TCS has transferred staff over to support this centre, in response to the growing business the company has in Ireland and elsewhere.\n\n\"That's providing services to both Irish clients and European and UK and US customers,\" Chaudhari said. \"That was one of the key breakthroughs for TCS. But even so, after that, we have taken several initiatives with our customers, which has been really groundbreaking for us to really establish very deep into particular industries.\"\n\nChaudhari said TCS is working with \"key companies\" who are shaping the everyday life of Irish citizens, such as businesses in utilities, car manufacturers and large banks.\n\n\"We've also been working with pharmaceutical and retail companies as well, and also shaping up the education sector,\" he said. \"So we are helping with the digital marketing solutions as well for the mock examinations, working with companies there. So I'm very proud of being able to make an impact across industries where we are able to influence and help better Irish citizens.\n\n\"I do want to bring TCS to a very strong player within the Irish market for both the public sector and private sector. And we remain invested and committed to make it happen for our customers and also for the Irish Government.\"\n\nDigital transformation\n\nTCS has won various awards for innovation and was listed in a Forbes list of the top 100 most innovative companies in the world. With a focus on so many industries, Chaudhari shared some of the key technologies that clients are focusing on.\n\nOne of those is - unsurprisingly - AI. Chaudhari said these days, it seems like no meeting is done without the mention of AI.\n\n\"I think AI has existed for a number of years, but it's got its prominence much more in the recent years, especially with the advent of generative AI and the way the impacts could be realised, both at a personal and organisational level,\" he said.\n\nChaudhari said TCS did a \"massive survey\" with more than 1,300 business consultants across multiple industries and found that the vast majority had \"already taken some steps\" into adopting AI technology. But he also said that many of these consultants had not worked out the impacts that AI will cause \"from a data point of view\".\n\n\"So there is a short-term focus and a long-term focus every company is trying to grapple through,\" Chaudhari said. \"There's a lot of emphasis on certain quick wins, what companies could have by the short-term views of digital investments, automation, AI-led interventions.\"\n\nTo help companies on their AI journey, Chaudhair said TCS has launched WisdomNext, a platform that provides access to a number of large language models.\n\nThe goal of this platform is to bring multiple AI and cloud services into a single interface have AI models that are designed to help specific industries, such as utilities, retail or banking.\n\nChaudhari said digital transformation remains a key goal for many companies and one Irish example he shared of TCS' work in this sector is with AIB Life. This tech-led joint venture was set up last year by AIB and Great-West Lifeco. TCS was chosen as its partner to build and operate a end-to-end, cloud-based platform.\n\nIn addition to designing and deploying the enabling technology stack, TCS is also providing IT, customer, and claims handling services for AIB Life. These services are being provided by TCS' global deliver centre in Letterkenny.\n\nAIB Life was recently awarded the global Celent Model Insurer Award in the category of 'Digital and Emerging Technologies'.\n\n\"We are happy to kind of bring our products and platforms and implement them digitally, offer digital solutions to our customers,\" Chaudhari said. \"They are able to very quickly get entire systems up and running and launch themselves into the market and provide the services there. So you don't need to start looking at the hardware, the servers, the software... everything can come as a service and you just need to configure it right for your business needs.\"\n\nChaudhari said cybersecurity is another key area being looked at by TCS' customers, so the IT giant is also providing cybersecurity protection from its Letterkenny facility.\n\n\"We provide services to Irish customers as well as a number of global customers from Letterkenny,\" he said. \"So security is becoming a big challenge and we are hoping to play a good role to help our customers as well.\"\n\nFind out how emerging tech trends are transforming tomorrow with our new podcast, Future Human: The Series.

Our AI Gen A pipeline has doubled in the quarter to $1.5 billion. Our investments of research and innovation continues.\"\n\n\"We continue to see strong traction for our AI offerings in the market. Our WisdomNext platform, that helps the enterprises in adoption of Gen AI at scale, has received very strong customer reception,\" he added.\n\nKrithivasan said that these engagements continue to be for smaller-duration projects, however, some projects are turning out to be longer as the use-cases mature over time.\n\nThe CEO further said the number of engagements going into production is steadily increasing. The company applied for 154 patents in Q1 and were granted 277 patents.\n\nLast month, Accenture had announced that the company's new Gen AI bookings were worth over $900 million in its just concluded quarter.

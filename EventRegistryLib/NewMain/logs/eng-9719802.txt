According to SFGate, DeGeneres did not shy away from her exit from the spotlight.\n\n\"Let me catch you up on what's been going on with me since you last saw me,\" she said. \"I got chickens. Oh yeah, and I got kicked out of show business for being mean.\"\n\nShe continued to open up about how that drastic change affected her (The Ellen DeGeneres Show was on air for 19 seasons), noting that she now realizes her sensitivity.\n\nRelated: Ellen DeGeneres Announces Dates for Her 'Final' Stand-Up Tour Across North America\n\n\"I used to say, 'I don't care what people say about me,'\" she admitted. \"Now I realize I said that during the height of my popularity.\"\n\nShe went on to joke: \"Next time, I'll be kicked out for being old. Old, gay and mean, the triple crown.\"\n\nWhile wanting to make the crowd laugh, the outlet reported she also addressed where the accusations about her may have come from.\n\n\"I can be demanding and impatient and tough,\" she explained. \"I am a strong woman. I am many things, but I am not mean.\"\n\nDeGeneres said because her intent wasn't to be mean, she wasn't a mean person -- even if sometimes it came off that way, according to SFGate.\n\nWhen later questioned about whether she would return to fame in the future, now that she has had time to reflect on her mistakes, DeGeneres gave a hard \"no.\"\n\n\"This is the last time you're going to see me. After my Netflix special, I'm done,\" she said.\n\nRelated: Ellen DeGeneres Returning to TV with a Two-Hour Special on Gorilla Conservation\n\nIn a July 2020 BuzzFeed Newsreport, anonymous former and current staffers of hers accused her of creating an unhealthy and toxic work environment on her show. Claims included being penalized for taking medical leave, instances of racial microaggressions and fear of retribution for raising complaints.\n\n\"The hate went on for a long time and I would try to avoid looking at the news,\" she said at a Los Angeles standup show in April. \"The 'be kind' girl wasn't kind. That was the headline.\"\n\nShe also said she ended each day on set by saying \"Be kind to one another,\" which she joked led people to see her as a \"one-dimensional character who gave stuff away and danced up steps.\"\n\nMost recently, DeGeneres canceled four upcoming show dates just one month after kicking off the stand-up tour.

The 66-year-old comedian told fans that she's \"done\" with show business during last week's stop on her Ellen's Last Stand... Up comedy tour.\n\nDeGeneres previously said that her upcoming Netflix stand-up special will be her \"last,\" but further clarified that she's done with performing entirely during a recent show in Santa Rosa, California.\n\nAccording to SF Gate, DeGeneres was asked whether she'll appear on Broadway or in future films during the Q&A portion of her set.\n\n\"Um, no,\" DeGeneres replied. \"This is the last time you're going to see me. After my Netflix special, I'm done.\"\n\nThe revelation came just before DeGeneres abruptly canceled a number of tour dates, with no reason given for the cancellations.\n\nDeGeneres launched her tour in June, returning to the stage after facing allegations of a toxic workplace environment on her talk show. The comic opened up about her \"cancellation\" and discussed her return to the stage -- and the public eye -- two years after she ended her daytime talk show after 19 seasons. An eyewitness in the audience during her stop in San Diego, California, in June said the former TV host chatted about her life these days and those \"mean\" allegations that she said derailed her career.\n\n\"I got kicked out of show business because I'm 'mean'... You can't be mean in show business, they'll kick you out,\" she joked, adding that at one point, she read a headline that called her the \"most hated person in America.\" Ever the comedian, DeGeneres quipped that while it didn't feel good to read front-page fodder like that, it was doubly awful because it's a title that holds no trophy or prize.\n\nA year after The Ellen DeGeneres Show came to an end, a source told ET about how the former host was keeping busy. \"Ellen is not retired.

DeGeneres, who has been married to Arrested Development star Portia de Rossi for 16 years, said the \"funk\" began to damage their relationship as she struggled to leave her home during the \"hard time\".\n\nDeGeneres said: \"She was watching it happen to me... she went through it with me.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_DeGeneres", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ellen DeGeneres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stand-up comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_Burbank_Center_for_the_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luther Burbank Center for the Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talk show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broadway theatre"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Rosa,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Rosa, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Rosa, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ellen_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Ellen Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ellen_DeGeneres_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Ellen DeGeneres Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Gosling", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Gosling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Carell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Carell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Chronicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrested_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arrested Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarnerMedia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WarnerMedia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portia_de_Rossi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portia de Rossi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_business", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Show business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Funk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/dd918b906f293dd26890bfddc027ca21", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719802", "eventUri": "eng-9719802", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

The once beloved, now embattled comedian is currently on Ellen's Last Stand...Up tour and has told fans that isn't just a title: Once she tapes her Netflix special, DeGeneres plans to leave showbiz for good.\n\nDeGeneres said as much during a Q&A with the audience after a recent show at the Luther Burbank Center for Arts in Santa Rosa, California. One audience member asked if DeGeneres was considering a grander return after her tour, potentially returning to movies or Broadway. DeGeneres answered succinctly: \"Um, no,\" she said. \"This is the last time you're going to see me. After my Netflix special, I'm done.\"\n\nWhen another fan asked if she would consider returning to voice work, reprising her role as Dory in a Finding Nemo or Finding Dory sequel, she also shot that down. \"No. I'm going bye-bye, remember?\" DeGeneres said.\n\nBut before that, DeGeneres wants to set the record straight. At previous stops on the tour, she referred to herself as \"the most hated woman in America\" and made jokes about her exile from Hollywood, saying that she had been \"kicked out of show business.\" She was referring to how the public's perception of her soured after a bombshell 2020 BuzzFeed report in which 10 former and one at the time current staffer at The Ellen DeGeneres Show accused the comedian of fostering a toxic workplace environment. The story included allegations of racism and intimidation. At the time, DeGeneres apologized to her staff and said she was committed to ensuring the issues didn't reoccur.\n\nDeGeneres also delivered an on-air apology, but it was too little too late. The allegations led to a steep decline in viewers, multiple Ellen senior staff members being dismissed, and ultimately hastened the end of DeGeneres's long-running, Emmy-winning daytime show after 19 seasons.\n\nAccording to Variety, DeGeneres said at the Santa Rosa show that she \"can be demanding and impatient and tough.\"\n\n\"I am a strong woman,\" she continued. \"I am many things, but I am not mean.\"\n\nDeGeneres recently canceled four dates of her comedy tour in Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Dallas without any explanation. Ellen's Last Stand...Up tour is scheduled to continue through August 17. Her Netflix stand-up special is set to be taped during the tour and air in late 2024.", "source": {"uri": "vanityfair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanity Fair"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@vanityfair.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_DeGeneres", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ellen DeGeneres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_Burbank", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luther Burbank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broadway theatre"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Rosa,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Rosa, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Rosa, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_business", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Show business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BuzzFeed", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BuzzFeed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ellen_DeGeneres_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Ellen DeGeneres Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stand-up comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/668ec3716e2dc694fd391a6c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/1251833855?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719802", "eventUri": "eng-9719802", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-17", "textStart": 2236, "textEnd": 2245}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

Up' show.\n\nEllen DeGeneres is ready to say goodbye to the spotlight. The 66-year-old comedian told fans she's \"done\" with show business amid last week's stop on her Ellen's Last Stand... Up comedy tour.\n\nDeGeneres has previously said that her upcoming Netflix stand-up special will be her \"last,\" but further clarified that she's done with performing entirely during a recent show in Santa Rosa, California.\n\nAccording to SF Gate, DeGeneres was asked whether she'll appear on Broadway or in future films during a Q&A portion of her set.\n\n\"Um, no,\" DeGeneres replied. \"This is the last time you're going to see me. After my Netflix special, I'm done.\"\n\nThe revelation came just before DeGeneres abruptly canceled a number of tour dates, with no reason given for the cancellations.\n\nDeGeneres launched her tour in June, returning to the stage after facing allegations of a toxic workplace environment on her talk show. The comic opened up about her \"cancellation\" and discussed her return to the stage -- and the public eye -- two years after she ended her daytime talk show after 19 seasons. An eyewitness in the audience during her San Diego, California, stop in June said the former TV host chatted about her life these days and those \"mean\" allegations that she said derailed her career.\n\n\"I got kicked out of show business because I'm 'mean'... You can't be mean in show business, they'll kick you out,\" she joked, adding that at one point, she read a headline that called her the \"most hated person in America.\" Ever the comedian, DeGeneres quipped that while it didn't feel good to read front-page fodder like that, it was doubly awful because it's a title that holds no trophy or prize.\n\nA year after The Ellen DeGeneres Show came to an end, a source told ET about how the former host was keeping busy. \"Ellen is not retired.

Ellen's departure marks the end of an era filled with laughter and challenges, leaving behind a legacy of both significant achievements and hard lessons learned.\n\nEllen DeGeneres, a beloved figure in daytime television and comedy, has had a career filled with laughter, activism, and heartfelt moments. Over the years, she built a legacy with her stand-up routines, memorable acting roles, and the widely adored The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Yet, this chapter of her life closed on a sombre note in May 2022, as the show ended amid serious allegations of a toxic work environment. Now, in a candid moment during her stand-up show in Santa Rosa, California, Ellen revealed a surprisingly quiet future. When a fan asked about her next big project, she responded honestly, saying, \"Um, no. This is the last time you're going to see me.

Her sharp wit and engaging performances quickly established her as a notable comedian. A career-defining moment arrived in 1989 when she appeared on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, a breakthrough that set the stage for her future success. Her stand-up acclaim led to the creation of her own sitcom, Ellen, which premiered in 1994. While the show was a success, it was Ellen's courageous public coming out as a queer woman in 1997 that significantly altered her career trajectory. In 2003, she launched The Ellen DeGeneres Show, a daytime talk show celebrated for its positive energy and heartfelt content. For 19 years, the show was a daytime TV favourite, winning awards and impacting many viewers. Ellen's initial TV role was on the Fox sitcom Open House, which aired from 1989 to 1990. After a short-lived role on ABC's Laurie Hill, she went on to create and star in Ellen, originally called These Friends of Mine, which marked the beginning of her prominent career on television.\n\nIn 2003, DeGeneres launched The Ellen DeGeneres Show, a daytime talk show that became a cultural phenomenon. The show was known for its feel-good vibe, with DeGeneres often engaging in playful banter with guests and promoting acts of kindness. The programme won numerous awards, including 61 Daytime Emmy Awards, and became a platform for celebrities, musicians, and ordinary people alike. DeGeneres' charm and the show's positive atmosphere resonated with audiences, making it a staple of daytime television for nearly two decades.

She married actress Portia de Rossi in 2008, and the couple's relationship has been a source of inspiration for many. DeGeneres is also a vocal advocate for various causes, including animal rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and environmental issues. Her efforts include launching the Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund and participating in numerous charity events, reflecting her commitment to making a positive impact on the world. The author of My Point... And I Do Have One publicly revealed her relationship with actress Anne Heche shortly after coming out, and later she was romantically involved with photographer Alexandra Hedison, but finally married Portia.\n\nEllen's career is not limited to television. She ventured into acting and voice work, appearing in films like Mr. Wrong (1996) and Finding Nemo (2003), where she voiced the beloved character Dory. Her role in Finding Nemo was especially celebrated, earning her praise for bringing humour and heart to the character. She reprised her role as Dory in the sequel, Finding Dory (2016), which was also a commercial and critical success.\n\nDespite her success, Ellen DeGeneres' career has not been without controversy. In 2020, The Ellen DeGeneres Show faced allegations of a toxic workplace environment. Former employees accused the show of fostering a culture of bullying, discrimination, and harassment. These accusations were a significant blow to the show's reputation, with several staff members coming forward to describe their negative experiences. In response to the allegations, DeGeneres issued a public apology, acknowledging that the show had not always lived up to its standards of kindness and respect. Despite her efforts to address the issues, the controversy continued to overshadow the programme's positive image. In May 2022, DeGeneres announced that the 19th season of The Ellen DeGeneres Show would be its last. She cited a desire for new challenges as a factor in her decision to end the show, though the timing of the announcement was undoubtedly influenced by the ongoing scrutiny of the show's workplace culture. The final episode aired on May 26, 2022, marking the end of an era for one of daytime television's most iconic programmes.\n\nEllen DeGeneres' career is marked by significant achievements and notable controversies. From her groundbreaking role on Ellen to her celebrated talk show and philanthropic work, DeGeneres has made a lasting impact on the entertainment industry. However, the allegations of a toxic work environment at The Ellen DeGeneres Show and the subsequent end of the programme highlight the complexities of her legacy. Her career offers a fascinating study of the interplay between public success and personal conduct in the world of entertainment.\n\nAt 66, Ellen reflects on how her attitude towards fame has shifted over time. \"I used to say, 'I don't care what people say about me.' Now, I realise I said that during the height of my popularity,\" she shared. She also asserts, \"I am many things, but I am not mean.\" As Ellen DeGeneres bids adieu to Hollywood and steps away from the media spotlight, her career stands as a complex blend of joy and controversy. Ellen's departure marks the end of an era filled with laughter and challenges, leaving behind a legacy of both significant achievements and hard lessons learned.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ellen_DeGeneres_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Ellen DeGeneres Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_DeGeneres", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ellen DeGeneres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stand-up comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytime_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Daytime television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sitcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tonight_Show_Starring_Johnny_Carson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Observational comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talk show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Rosa,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Rosa, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Rosa, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytime_Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daytime Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finding_Nemo_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finding Nemo (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LGBT rights in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portia_de_Rossi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portia de Rossi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ellen (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environmentalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Animal rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Hedison", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexandra Hedison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Heche", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anne Heche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://st1.latestly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/122-51-784x441.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719802", "eventUri": "eng-9719802", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

During a recent tour stop, the beloved comedian surprised her audience by announcing her plans to leave show business permanently.\n\nThis decision comes on the heels of her canceling multiple shows just a month into her tour. Previously, DeGeneres had expressed her dissatisfaction with how her talk show ended.\n\nAfter more than two decades in show business, Ellen DeGeneres is now determined to distance herself from entertainment.\n\nCalifornia became the stage for a big announcement from the comedian this week. DeGeneres, who ended her long-running talk show two years ago, was performing a standup set in Santa Rosa as part of her \"Ellen's Last Stand...Up\" tour.\n\nWhile the tour's title hinted at a farewell, fans might not have realized just how final it would be. The 66-year-old used the opportunity to open up about life after her talk show.\n\nShe spoke about the freeing feeling of no longer being defined by a brand but by herself as a whole person with various interests.\n\nHowever, when an audience member expressed hopes of seeing her on Broadway or in future films, DeGeneres surprised everyone with her response.\n\nAccording to the SFGate, she firmly stated that this tour and an upcoming Netflix special mark the end of her performing career. She emphatically stated:\n\n\"Um, no. This is the last time you're going to see me. After my Netflix special, I'm done.\"\n\nThe former talk show host refused to sugarcoat things for fans anymore, playfully shutting down a request to reprise her popular Dory voice role in a future Pixar movie.\n\nWhile there were whispers of a dark side during her talk show days, DeGeneres addressed them head-on during the California show. Before bidding farewell to her iconic talk show, the actress was embroiled in controversy and accused of various unflattering traits.\n\nDeGeneres acknowledged the \"rumors\" that she was a difficult boss, even admitting to being \"harsh\" and \"immature\" at times. There was a hint of defiance, though, as she compared these criticisms to the way strong female leaders are often perceived.\n\nDespite the past controversies, the TV personality seemed to be finding solace in her return to stand-up. She expressed gratitude to the audience, a loyal crowd that cheered her on despite the recent negativity.\n\n\"Thank you for still caring!\" DeGeneres said to the excited crowd before joking about being \"kicked out of show business,\" referencing the allegations that led to her talk show's conclusion.\n\nThe name of DeGeneres' tour, suggesting it was a farewell, now raises questions amid the sudden cancellations.\n\nThe Blast reported that Ticketmaster recently sent out a wave of \"event canceled\" messages to those who purchased tickets for her upcoming shows in Dallas, San Francisco, Seattle, and Chicago.\n\nThe cancellations, impacting shows scheduled between July 10th and August 11th, has left fans in the dark as to the reason behind the sudden change.\n\nTicketmaster's statement placed the blame squarely on DeGeneres' team, citing the \"Event Organizer\" as the source of the cancellations. The statement read:\n\n\"Unfortunately, the Event Organizer has had to cancel your event. You don't need to do a thing. We'll issue a refund to the original method of payment used at the time of purchase as soon as funds are received from the Event Organizer.\"\n\nWhile no explanation was offered, fans can expect a full refund \"within 14-21 days,\" assuming the tickets were purchased directly through Ticketmaster.\n\nDeGeneres' farewell tour, \"Ellen's Last Stand...Up,\" promised fans a final chance to see the comedy legend live.\n\nAdding to the excitement, the final two shows in Minneapolis were slated to be filmed for a Netflix comedy special, further solidifying the tour's \"last stand\" moniker.\n\nThe tour held even more significance as it marked DeGeneres' return to standup after her long-running talk show ended in 2022.\n\nRobbie Praw, Netflix's VP of Standup and Comedy Formats, underscored the significance of DeGeneres' return, labeling her as an icon and pioneer in the comedy world.\n\n\"She is a true legend and pioneer in so many ways.

This works for me.\" She's already said her upcoming Netflix special, a taped version of \"Ellen's Last Stand... Up Tour,\" would be her final one. But it's not just from stand-up comedy that she's retiring. When asked at a recent show if she'd try Broadway or movies next, DeGeneres reportedly said, \"Um, no,\" according to SFGate. \"This is the last time you're going to see me. After my Netflix special, I'm done.\"\n\nA full-on Hollywood retirement is a big departure for the woman who used to juggle hosting her talk show, a game show, and award shows. Much of DeGeneres' current set focuses on how she feels she got \"kicked out of show business,\" a sentiment not necessarily accurate given that she chose to end her eponymous talk show on her own terms and then got Netflix to release her stand-up special. At this point, every talk show on air has been exposed for similar toxic workplace allegations, but the controversy around her show and her star persona quite fairly took a \"toll on my ego and my self-esteem,\" as DeGeneres admitted at one show.\n\nPerhaps it's the numbers that have led DeGeneres to conclude she has to bow out. The Ellen DeGeneres Show faced declining ratings in its final seasons; more recently, she abruptly canceled four dates on her stand-up tour, and according to The Los Angeles Times, only eight of her 27 dates were sold out. That's probably as much a reflection of the current state of the industry as it is anything else, but if you were in the middle of a PR crisis, it would be pretty easy to take personally.\n\nIt's hard to feel bad for a ridiculously wealthy celebrity, but the last few years certainly haven't been easy on DeGeneres. 2022 saw the death of both her former girlfriend Anne Heche and her talk show sidekick Stephen \"tWitch\" Boss. In her stand-up shows, she's discussed the difficulty of caring for her mother, who has dementia. Any of these factors could reasonably contribute to someone's decision to retire.\n\nStill, in the entertainment industry, \"retirement\" rarely sticks. It's hard to imagine DeGeneres really, truly disappearing for good. Yet she's even eschewed voice-over work, which is easy money -- especially when you're working with Pixar. SFGate reports that when a fan \"begged\" her to reprise the role of Dory in the Finding Nemo franchise, DeGeneres responded, \"No, I'm going bye-bye, remember.\" Perhaps it really is curtains after all.", "source": {"uri": "avclub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The A.V.

Now, two years after her daytime talk show ended, Ellen is officially announcing her exit from Hollywood.\n\nEllen DeGeneres was a staple of talk show business, with her show, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, being loved by the critics and the audience alike. With numerous awards and praise, the series unceremoniously ended in 2022, with DeGeneres going from one of Hollywood's most-liked stars to a persona non-grata. The talk show host was known for her humor and easygoing manner, something that transcended the screen.\n\nAfter The Ellen DeGeneres Show ended, the star went back to one of her early loves: stand-up. During a recent show at Luther Burbank Center for the Arts for her Ellen's Last Stand... Up, the star also announced her exit from the spotlight.\n\nDuring one of the shows from her three-night set of Ellen's Last Stand... Up, Ellen let fans know what she's been up to since the show ended. After airing for 19 years, Ellen DeGeneres received backlash after a series of stories painted a different picture of DeGeneres' persona than the one she had on the talk show. During the stand-up, Ellen addressed the allegations again, including those who claimed she was \"mean.\"\n\n\"Let me catch you up on what's been going on with me since you last saw me,\" she said. \"I got chickens. Oh yeah, and I got kicked out of show business for being mean,\" she explained via SFGate.\n\nThe claims about the once-beloved talk show host included that she created a toxic work environment and made comments on her employees' races, fired people for taking medical leave, and she also allegedly fired someone for looking at and speaking to her. \"I used to say, 'I don't care what people say about me.' Now I realize I said that during the height of my popularity,\" DeGeneres said. She also addressed being canceled for the second time after her coming out as a lesbian in 1997.\n\n\"Next time, I'll be kicked out for being old. Old, gay, and mean, the triple crown,\" she joked. \"I can be demanding and impatient and tough. I am a strong woman,\" she said. \"I am many things, but I am not mean,\" Ellen explained, noting that it was never her intention to hurt people.\n\nDuring the Q&A part, one fan asked Ellen if she would do any shows on Broadway or more movies. \"Um, no,\" she answered. \"This is the last time you're going to see me. After my Netflix special, I'm done.\" When pushed for her to reprise her role as Dory in the Pixar hit films, she continued, \"No, I'm going bye-bye, remember.\"\n\nSince the show ended, Ellen spent more time focusing on her personal life with her wife Portia de Rossi. Considering that the public's opinion hasn't changed -- and many resurfaced videos of the talk show interviewing celebrities are coming off as cringe -- the best way for Ellen is to bow out while she is still in some fans' graces.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "monica_coman@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Monica Coman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Talk show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_DeGeneres", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ellen DeGeneres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stand-up comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ellen_DeGeneres_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Ellen DeGeneres Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_Burbank_Center_for_the_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luther Burbank Center for the Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_business", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Show business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Chronicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portia_de_Rossi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portia de Rossi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pixar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Broadway theatre"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lesbian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/8FFB8D43-E67D-4103-AD14-E76BDFEC4D27.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719802", "eventUri": "eng-9719802", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Netflix in March announced she would perform for one more comedy special on the streamer but has not shared a title or release date.\n\nDeGeneres got her start as a comedian in the 1980s and, by 1984, had been named the funniest person in America by Showtime. She had several short stints on television shows before landing her own sitcom in 1994, called \"Ellen.\" In 1997, she used an appearance on the \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" to come out as a lesbian, something her sitcom character did in tandem to a therapist played by Oprah. The show ended in 1998. In 2003, she launched her daytime talk show \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show,\" which featured celebrity interviews and skits with guests. The show was watched by millions of people per day and received dozens of Daytime Emmy Awards. In 2020, Buzzfeed published a report in which employees of \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" accused the host of toxic workplace behavior. They said they were fired after taking time off for family funerals, that DeGeneres made inappropriate comments about race and that entry-level employees were told to not speak to the host if they saw her around the office. After the report, public scrutiny of DeGeneres intensified and audience members started pointing out moments the host didn't personally live up to her \"be kind\" slogan in now-viral moments like when she pressured Mariah Carey into announcing her pregnancy on the show and Dakota Johnson called DeGeneres out for a lie she told on air. People who'd interacted with DeGeneres in real life started sharing unflattering stories online, and Variety published a report that accused the host essentially abandoning her crew members after the Covid-19 pandemic hit. \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" ended in 2022.\n\nDeGeneres was ranked No. 76 on Forbes' list of America's Self-Made Women this year with an estimated net worth of $450 million.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_DeGeneres", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ellen DeGeneres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Talk show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showtime_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Showtime (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ellen_DeGeneres_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Ellen DeGeneres Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oprah_Winfrey_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Oprah Winfrey Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sitcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytime_Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daytime Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BuzzFeed", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BuzzFeed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lesbian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dakota Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariah_Carey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mariah Carey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/668eb080b5943d2e0251fbed/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3307,1862,x0,y170,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719802", "eventUri": "eng-9719802", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

She is out on the road working on material for her upcoming Netflix special, Ellen's Last Stand ... Up, which will film over two nights in Minneapolis in August. However, there appear to be a few bumps in the road as she abruptly canceled four shows in Dallas, San Francisco, Seattle, and Chicago, last week without any explanation.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the Event Organizer has had to cancel your event,\" Ticketmaster wrote in a statement on their website. \"You don't need to do a thing. We'll issue a refund to the original method of payment used at time of purchase, as soon as funds are received from the Event Organizer. It should appear on your account within 14-21 days.\"\n\nNow, an In Touch insider is revealing some of the issues at hand from behind the scenes -- and it reportedly involves her talk-show scandal from 2020. \"Contrary to indications Ellen made a few months ago that she was ready to talk candidly about her scandal and the end of her talk show in her new stand-up tour and planned Netflix special, things have changed since then,\" the source claimed. \"The material she has now completed and written for this tour does NOT go very deep into her scandal at all.\"\n\nDeGeneres is apparently not \"comfortable with the idea of talking about that stuff night after night\" and is \"second guessing\" her original idea to talk about the controversy. She has the support of Netflix, too, because her 2018 special, Relatable, was a \"massive hit with viewers and with critics.\" The former talk show host has decided to pivot and make \"a couple of gentle, vague jokes\" about her controversy and move on. In July 2020, the 66-year-old comedian's world blew up when she found herself on the receiving end of criticism from a deep-dive article on Buzzfeed News.\n\nEmployees discussed The Ellen DeGeneres Show's \"toxic work culture\" while her fans were shocked by the allegations. They only knew DeGeneres to be a lovable daytime presence, but many people in Hollywood had heard the rumors for years. \"If [Ellen] wants to have her own show and have her name on the show title, she needs to be more involved to see what's going on,\" a former crew member said. While changes were made behind the scenes on the show, DeGeneres' reputation never really recovered by the time the series wrapped in 2022.", "source": {"uri": "sheknows.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SheKnows"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kristyn_burtt@sheknows.com", "name": "Kristyn Burtt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_DeGeneres", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ellen DeGeneres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticketmaster", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ticketmaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oprah_Winfrey_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Oprah Winfrey Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stand-up comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BuzzFeed_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BuzzFeed News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Talk show"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ellen-degeneres.png?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719802", "eventUri": "eng-9719802", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-07-", "textStart": 1775, "textEnd": 1784}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

After Netflix, is she totally disappearing from fame? As of now, it sounds like it.\n\nAll of this came about from a BuzzFeed News report several years ago from anonymous former and (at the time) current staffers who accused her of a toxic work environment and being mean. Specific issues involved penalizations for medical leave, racial topics, and if complaints were made, there was a fear of retribution.\n\nOne former staffer said, \"That 'be kind' bulls -- t only happens when the cameras are on. It's all for show.\"\n\n\"I think it is a lot of smoke and mirrors when it comes to the show's brand,\" another former employee said. \"They pull on people's heartstrings; they do know that's going to get likes and what people are going to go for, which is a positive message. But that's not always reality.\"\n\nVariety states that the Ellen Show ended in May 2022 after 20 years on the air. The cancellation was due to the allegations against her.\n\nRolling Stone reported that from onstage at the Largo at the Cornet Theater in West Hollywood, DeGeneres talked about getting booted from her show and more.\n\n\"Oh yeah, I got kicked out of show business,\" she said from the stage. \"There's no mean people in show business...I became this one-dimensional character who gave stuff away and danced up steps. Do you know how hard it is to dance up steps? Would a mean person dance up steps? Had I ended my show by saying, 'Go f -- k yourself,' people would've been pleasantly surprised.\"\n\nShe added, \"For those of you keeping score, this is the second time I've been kicked out of show business...Eventually they're going to kick me out for a third time because I'm mean, old and gay.\"\n\nWe'll see what's next for Ellen and whether she truly quits.

Last week, the 66-year-old comedian returned to the stage for a three-night stand-up show in Santa Rosa, California, at the Luther Burbank Center for the Arts during her Ellen's Last Stand...Up tour.\n\nDuring her show on Monday, July 1, Ellen discussed the cancellation of her talk show, her two-year break from the spotlight, and suggested that she might be retiring soon.According to SFGate, she informed the audience that she had acquired chickens and had been ousted from show business for being mean.\n\nEllen reflected on how this significant change impacted her after being on air for 19 years. She noted that she has now become more aware of her sensitivity. She admitted that she used to say she didn't care what people said about her but now realizes she said that during the height of her popularity.\n\nShe joked that next time she would be kicked out for being old, gay, and mean, calling it the triple crown.\n\nDuring her set, Ellen also addressed the toxic workplace allegations that had surfaced during her talk show's final years. She explained that she can be demanding, impatient, and tough, but emphasized that she is not mean. She stated that she is a strong woman and many things, but not mean. Ellen said that while her intent was never to be mean, it might have come across that way sometimes.\n\nLater in her performance, Ellen mentioned that after reflecting on her mistakes during her time away from the spotlight, she feels ready to be done with show business. She declared that this would be the last time the audience would see her and that after her Netflix special, she would be finished.\n\nEllen's comments suggest she is seriously considering retirement after her upcoming Netflix special. Her recent shows in Santa Rosa were part of a limited tour, and it seems she is using this time to reflect on her career and the future.\n\nThe cancellation of her long-running talk show was a significant moment for Ellen, who had been a fixture on daytime television for nearly two decades. The allegations of a toxic work environment brought considerable scrutiny and led to her eventual decision to step away from the show.\n\nDuring her time away from the spotlight, Ellen focused on personal interests, such as caring for her chickens, which she mentioned in her stand-up routine. Her remarks about being more sensitive and understanding the impact of her words indicate a period of introspection and personal growth.\n\nThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

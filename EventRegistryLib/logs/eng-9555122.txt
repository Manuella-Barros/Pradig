More than 60,000 Kuki refugees along with 10,000 Meiteis were driven out from Kuki strongholds.\n\nViolence continues to simmer in the state, which is governed by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Protests marking the anniversary have been largely led by the Christian community along with secular action networks.\n\nHalf a dozen bishops representing different denominations led by Delhi Archbishop Anil J. Couto, who is also the secretary-general of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of India, took part in the hourlong interreligious prayer gathering. The event took place at the gate of the Sacred Heart Cathedral in downtown New Delhi on the evening of May 3.\n\nKuki refugees, dressed in black, began the somber service by singing poignant hymns. All of the other participants followed, holding lighted candles. Church leaders then offered prayers and appeals for peace while two dozen nuns from the Missionaries of Charity drew much attention at the televised event.\n\n\"The Church, the civil society, and others are trying their best to offer consolation and relief to the affected. We pray that the displaced can go back to their [native] lands. Let the lights we hold dispel darkness and hatred from the minds and inspire all to live in peace, harmony, and brotherhood,\" Archbishop Couto said in his brief address, which was followed by those of other church leaders.\n\n\"As we join together in this solemn candlelight prayer, our hearts are heavy with the burden of suffering endured by the people of Manipur,\" said Divine Word Missionary priest Father Norbert Herman, who organized the program as the dialogue commission secretary of the Delhi Archdiocese.\n\n\"For a year now, violence has marred their lives, casting shadows of fear and uncertainty in their path. In this hour of darkness, we stand in solidarity, offering our prayers as beacons of hope to illuminate their journey toward healing and peace,\" Father Herman said.\n\n\"The irony of the tragedy afflicted on us is that all that has happened and continues to happen are taking place in our democratic country,\" lamented a Kuki woman from Manipur in her address.\n\nEarlier in the day, several well-known social activists under the banner of the National Federation of Indian Women, led by its chief, Annie Raja, organized a seminar at the Press Club of India on \"Against Forced Amnesia, Remember Manipur.\"\n\n\"After I led an investigation team to study and document the plight of the women, children, and others, Manipur police filed a criminal case charging us with stoking violence,\" Raja said.\n\nThe seminar began with the premiere of this correspondent's 23-minute investigative documentary \"Manipur -- a Blot on Indian Democracy.\"\n\nDelhi police allowed hundreds of Meiteis to hold their protest on the evening of May 3, while nearly 2,000 Kukis wearing black clothes held a two-hour protest on the morning of May 4, under the protection of over 100 security personnel who limited entrance to Kukis and media personnel.\n\nWhile several cities held processions to mark the anniversary, in the city of Shillong -- known as the Vatican of northeast India -- thousands took part in the candlelight procession organized by the Church and Christian groups.\n\nHowever, in violence-hit Manipur, the anniversary was a day of protest. In Imphal, the capital of Manipur, without a single Kuki, Meiteis observed the anniversary with half a dozen Meiteis shaving their heads before marching to the historic Kangla Fort. In the Kuki heartland of Churuchandpur, a complete shutdown was observed to protest the targeting of the Kuki minority.", "source": {"uri": "ncregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National

The misrepresentation of the situation \"as persecution of religious (Christian) minorities\" is categorically false and must be rectified by institutions like USCIRF. They must exercise utmost diligence and refrain from endorsing false propaganda perpetuated by fringe Kuki groups such as NAMTA that falsely project itself as representing the entire scheduled tribes of Manipur,\" the Meitei Alliance stated.\n\nIt said that the ongoing mayhem is orchestrated and perpetuated by cross-border Kuki armed groups, funded through various illicit means of drug cartels and Western aid authorised by the US Congress Burma Act of 2023.\n\n\"The objective is to establish a Kuki expansionist territory called Zale'n-gam, by balkansing the established territories India, Myanmar and Bangladesh, with Manipur as the epicentre,\" the Meitei Alliance stated.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that NAMTA in the congressional hearing strongly condemned the Manipur government's alleged complicity in the violence between the valley-dominant Meitei community and the Kuki-Zo tribes, who are dominant in southern Manipur's hill districts and a few other areas. However, it's not only NAMTA, the Association of Meiteis in the Americas (AMA) has also organised congressional hearings to inform US lea'ders about the situation in Manipur.", "source": {"uri":

It was also going to be the first light soon, and the sentries at that moment had just let their guards down. That was the time when Kuki militants sneaked in a commando-style attack on the headquarters of the 3rd India Reserve Battalion at Narainseina, about 40 kilometres from here. Inside the camp, which was also being shared with the CRPF, the Kuki militants opened indiscriminate fire and hurled grenades and bombs. The security forces returned the fire, but with almost zero visibility, they could not hit any of the attackers. And by the time the firing ceased, two CRPF personnel, including an officer, lay dead, and two others sustained bullet injuries.\n\nIn the now-one-year-old conflict, this was the first time that the Kukis were deliberately targeting central security forces. As a matter of fact, any of the 24 odd Kuki armed groups currently under a yet-to-be-extended suspension of operations with the Centre have fired upon a central force in the last 30 years of Kuki militants. Apart from showing their prowess and capability, it could also mean that the Kukis were sending a message to the Government of India to heed their demands for a separate administration. Apart from the attack on the CRPF, the Kukis also attacked other Meitei villages on that fateful night, but there were no casualties.\n\nThe attacks by Kuki militants continued unabated in the next two to three days; they opened fire at Koutruk and Kadangbal Village in Imphal West District. In the retaliatory fire from the Meitei, two Kukis lost their lives, including one who is the son of the chief of Bethel Kuki village in the adjoining Kangpokpi District. The normal verbal backlash from the CRPF's top brass also came when Akhilesh Prasad Singh, the Inspector General, said that the assailants would be identified and punished accordingly. He also said that the two who died belonged to the CRPF's 128th Battalion.\n\nKumbi village in Bishenpur district saw a strong standoff between women volunteers and the Assam Rifles (AR) personnel. It came following the seizure of about one dozen firearms from the Meitei Village Volunteers. The AR had earlier waylaid a vehicle carrying the village volunteers and seized the weapons, stating that they were unlicensed. The AR party was arriving at the Kumbi Police Station to deposit the seized firearms.The women then appeared on the roads and lay on the road, blocking the bullet-proof Casper vehicles ferrying the troops. The AR fired several shots in the air, but the women were not frightened. After about two hours of standoff, it was agreed that the weapons would be deposited with the SP of Bishenpur district. But the AR was made to understand what Manipuri women's \"Nari Shakti\" actually looked like.\n\nBut a full year has now passed since Kuki's war on the Meiteis began on 3 May 2023. And till now, some 200+ people have been killed on both sides. Over 60,000 people have become refugees in their home land, and a few odd thousand houses have been burned. Some 6,000 odd FIRs have been recorded in the various police stations, and some 1,00,000 lakh troops have been rushed into the state. Also, there has been a complete breakdown of the general administration. With nearly 8,000 guns floating around the state, where they have been openly carried with almost full immunity, the scene is almost akin to the post-US withdrawal from Afghanistan. It is as if the days of the guns are arriving in the state, and soon warlordism may appear on the scene.\n\nThe stage was set when the Valley went to the polls on 19 April of April. Prior to that date, a prominent leader of the Meitei militia had made a public appeal to ensure victory for the BJP candidate. His raison d'\u00eatre was simple and straight: in case the BJP candidate loses, then N. Biren Singh will lose his chief ministerial position, and his going away would mean that the 6,000 odd FIR registered would be activated, and then they would have no protection. Then, as soon as the polling began at 8:00 in the morning, massive rigging began at poll stations guarded by local police forces. Firing also occurred at one or two stations, and one elderly man was injured. The Meitei Defence Forces were soon turned into the BJP Defence Force. Repolling was ordered across 11 polling stations.\n\nThere has been no reconciliatory move from either side or any efforts towards those lines from the government. I had openly suggested that a track-2 or back door approach could be initiated, as was done in 2000 with the Nagas. We had met at Shillong and Kaziranga. The Nagas were represented by prominent Naga leaders from Nagaland, including Gandhain Niketu Iralu,Wati Aier, Rev. Shishak, and other young leaders from Manipur. The Meiteis were represented by me, author and journalist Pradip Phanjoubam, Dhanabior Laishram, Arun Irengbam, and N. Biren Singh, then an editor with a vernacular daily and currently the chief minister of Manipur.\n\nFacilitating the meeting were author Sanjoy Hazarika, Lt Gen. V.K. Naya (Retd), former Governor of Manipur, Chaman Lal, former DGP of Nagaland, and Jayant Madhab, former Chairman of the NEDFI. It was a good start, and both sides understood each other's point of view. CM Biren, having participated in the exercise, is aware of the utility of such meetings, but he has not made a single move to initiate such an exercise. Instead, he has been playing his cards close to his chest with a view towards retaining his chair, it seems.\n\nBut on this first anniversary, many of the Meiteis who have fled their homes in Moreh and Churachandpur and have taken refuge here have been asking to be permitted to return to their original place. But at Churachandpur, where about 8,000 Meiteis had earlier resided, their houses have been bulldozed and razed. There are no houses left for the Meiteis left in Churachandpur. Likewise, the Kukis, which have not been burned in Imphal, are now being occupied by Maetie families who have fled from Churachandpur or Moreh under the supervision of the Meitei Militia. So there is a physical impossibility of both sides reconciling and returning to their homes.\n\nThe government should take action to secure Moreh, as it is the inlet for consumer and agricultural produce from Myanmar to Manipur. And it is the outlet for India's Look and Act East Policy, with the Asian Highway passing through it. The Imphal-Dimapur Highway is still out of bounds for Meitei, sans the vehicles being stopped by armed Kukis manning checkposts near Kangpokpi, and the identities of the passengers are checked individually. Also, some of them blew up a bridge on the highway recently, making movement difficult.\n\nThe post-election scenario has dampened the spirit of the average Meitei and appears to make them less enthusiastic about helping the village defenders. But the cake goes to chief minister Biren Singh, for he acknowledged that a few thousand Meitei youths are now roaming around with automatic weapons in their hands. He said that although they are armed, they are not anti-nationals but have only started weidling arms to protect themselves and their villages. He did not find it necessary to delve into tricky questions like the role of the state in guaranteeing the right to life of the citizens. Three cheers for democracy!\n\nThe writer is a senior journalist at The Statesman", "source": {"uri": "thestatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Statesman"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meitei_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meitei language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuki_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kuki people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Reserve_Police_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Reserve Police Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipur", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manipur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manipur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_information_report", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First information report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grenade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishnupur_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bishnupur district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meitei_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meitei people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imphal_West_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Imphal West district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethnic conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naga_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naga people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangpokpi_district", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kangpokpi district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._Biren_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "N.

There are reported to be 230 widows and 30 orphans living in just one set of camps in the Lamka area.\n\nCandlelight processions, prayer meetings, and some protests took place in several cities across India on 3 May, the anniversary of the conflict, the Catholic News Agency reports. In Delhi, Christian leaders took part in an ecumenical prayer gathering at the Sacred Heart Cathedral, where hymns were sung by refugees dressed in black.\n\nClashes between different ethnic groups in the state date back decades. More than half (53 per cent) of the population are Meitei, a largely Hindu group living in the Imphal Valley region. The two main tribal groups are the Naga and Kuki, who are mostly Christian, live in the hills, and have \"Scheduled Tribe\" status under an affirmative-action programme that grants eligible groups access to forest lands, a guaranteed proportion of government jobs, and places in educational institutions.\n\nClashes erupted in May last year after demands by the Meitei people for access to the \"Scheduled Tribe\" status prompted protests. Last September, UN special rapporteurs raised the alarm about alleged acts of sexual violence, extrajudicial killings, home destruction, forced displacement, torture, and ill-treatment (News, 15 September 2023). The rapporteurs were critical of the Indian government, and referred to an \"apparent slow and inadequate response\". Most of those killed and subjected to gender-based violence were from the Kuki community, it said.\n\nReuters reported last month that the number of the dead, 160, reported by the UN in September had risen to 220. About 60,000 displaced people, mostly Christians, are living in camps.\n\n\"I have no house; I have no village; I have no church,\" the director of Gospel for Asia, the Revd Prim Vaiphei, told a Zoom prayer meeting last month. \"But God provided me people to take care of us and to carry out the funeral of my son.\" He described being forcefully removed from his home in New Lambulane, Imphal, by Indian forces. He had urged his fellow Christians to forgive, he said.\n\nThe meeting was organised by Kailean Khongsai, a C of E ordinand who was born on the border with Burma, and who has sought to draw attention to the religious dimensions of the violence (News, 9 June 2023).\n\nAmong those speaking from the region was the general secretary of the Kuki Organisation for Human Rights, the Revd Dr S. Chongloi, who said that the divide between the hills and the valley in the state had been \"completed\". A buffer zone is now in place, monitored by federal paramilitary forces.\n\nThe cries of Kuki Christians seemed to have fallen on \"deaf ears\" among Indian leaders, he said. More than 300 churches and 200 villages had been burned, and thousands of people had been displaced and rendered homeless. He described carrying out a mass funeral in December after the bodies of people killed had finally been handed over by the authorities. He requested prayer for \"peace and normalcy\" and the restoration of Kuki institutions, including schools and hospitals.\n\nThe general secretary of the Kuki Baptist Convention, the Revd Dr M. Thongkhosei Haokip, who chairs the Kuki Christian Leaders Fellowship, described how roads made the delivery of supplies difficult, and said that people were dying in medical emergencies because evacuation by air was unavailable.\n\nChildren living in relief camps were \"really dejected and have no future\", the Revd Stephen Zou reported. \"Imagine a family that cannot pray, that cannot have a square meal together for the last 11 months. . . I pray to church leaders all over the world, please remember us, that we really need strong leadership.\"\n\nThe Revd Dr Robert Haulemsang, a director of ministry in the Evangelical Church, said that he was concerned about the horizons of internally displaced persons (IDPs): \"Many of them would like to leave the relief camps, but they are saying 'where would we find our livelihood?'\"\n\nLast week, Christian Solidarity Worldwide reported \"discontent\" among displaced Manipuris unable to vote in elections in India. Amid ongoing clashes, the charity's president, Mervyn Thomas, condemned a \"lack of commitment by the central government to intervene in any meaningful way. . . There appears to be no clear pathway to integrating these communities, or any plans for development.\"\n\nOn Zoom, David Campanale, a media adviser to the Prime Minister's Special Envoy for Freedom of Religion or Belief, Fiona Bruce MP, and a former BBC World Service journalist, spoke of the need for a \"global appeal to the world community and the churches\" to coincide with the anniversary of the attack.\n\nLast June, he published a report, Violence in Manipur, North-east India: Investigative report to the International Religious Freedom or Belief Alliance, after an evidence-gathering session. There was a \"clear religious dimension\" to the violence, it concluded, noting that Meitei churches had not been spared in the attacks.\n\nThe report was praised as \"very good\" by the Foreign Secretary, Lord Cameron, in the House of Lords last month (News, 19 April), after the Bishop of Winchester, the Rt Revd Philip Mounstephen, raised concerns about \"disturbing reports of violations of freedom of religion or belief\" in Manipur.\n\n\"It is right to say that we should not downplay the religious aspects of some of this strife,\" Lord Cameron said. \"Sometimes it is communal, tribal, or ethnic, but, in many cases, there is a clear religious part of it. We should be clear about that.\"", "source": {"uri": "churchtimes.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Church Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

{"id": 231974836, "title": "NHL\u2019s top draft prospect Macklin Celebrini in no rush to  turn pro, with San Jose Sharks likely his landing spot", "text": "BUFFALO, N.Y. \u2014 Macklin Celebrini has a pretty good idea his NHL future rests with the San Jose Sharks, who hold the first pick in the draft. For now, the 17-year-old center \u2014 he turns 18 on Thursday \u2014 coming off a celebrated freshman season at Boston University isn\u2019t in a rush to get there, yet. \u201cThere\u2019s never really shame or there\u2019s nothing wrong with just taking your time and just improving a little bit more,\u201d Celebrini said at the NHL pre-draft scouting combine on Friday, in reiterating he\u2019s not yet determined whether he\u2019ll return to BU for a second season. \u201cSo I feel like in those ways, another year would benefit me just to get more physically ready, and just make sure I\u2019m very fit and strong when I try to make that jump.\u201d Other than who gets chosen second overall, with the consensus split between Michigan State defenseman Artyom Levshunov and Medicine Hat center Cayden Lindstrom, Celebrini\u2019s plans for next season represent the biggest question mark entering the two-day draft, which opens on June 28 at The Sphere in Las Vegas. Not only is Celebrini the projected No. 1 pick by NHL Central Scouting, San Jose general manager Mike Grier expressed his intention to select the Terriers player immediately after the Sharks won the NHL draft lottery last month. \u201cIt\u2019s a big hockey moment for the organization and the fans here to have the opportunity to draft someone like Macklin,\u201d Grier said at the time. And the second-year GM hasn\u2019t cooled on his beliefs in praising the player when asked about Celebrini earlier in the week at the combine. As college hockey\u2019s youngest player last season, the 6-foot, 190-pound Celebrini won the Hobey Baker as the nation\u2019s top player, as well as Hockey East player and rookie of the year honors. He finished second in the nation with 32 goals and third with 64 points in 38 games. Another bonus for Grier\u2019s rebuilding plans for a team that finished last in the overall standings is Celebrini\u2019s ties to the Bay Area. Though from North Vancouver, British Columbia, Celebrini\u2019s father, Rick, is vice president of player health and performance for the NBA\u2019s Golden State Warriors, and the youngster spent a year playing for the Sharks\u2019 junior team. Celebrini enjoyed his interview with the Sharks, as well as dinner with Grier, who also played at Boston University. Despite the ties and the talk, Celebrini isn\u2019t taking anything for granted. \u201cAt the end of the day, you never know what\u2019s going to happen, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m getting too ahead of myself,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, for right now, I\u2019m just going to enjoy the last couple days of the combine and enjoy this experience.\u201d The Chicago Blackhawks are scheduled to pick second, followed by Anaheim, Columbus and Montreal. In a switch from last year\u2019s top-heavy forward draft class headed by Connor Bedard going No. 1 to the Hawks, this year\u2019s crop of prospects features four defensemen among the top seven-ranked North American skaters on Central Scouting\u2019s list. The group is headed by Levshunov, who is from Belarus, and includes Zeev Buium, who is from San Diego. Buium had the distinction of helping the U.S. win gold at the world junior championships this year, and then helping Denver win an NCAA title in April. \u201cI was obviously very fortunate to be on two really good teams and meet a lot of great guys,\u201d said the 6-foot, 183-pound Buium. \u201cIt was two awesome experiences.\u201d At 6-foot-2 and 203 pounds, Levshunov was the Big Ten rookie and defensive player of the year, and finished eighth in the nation among blue liners with 35 points (nine goals, 26 assists) in 38 games. Central Scouting\u2019s top-ranked international player is also a defenseman in Russian Anton Silayev. Listed at 6-foot-7 and 211 pounds, the 18-year-old had three goals and 11 points in 63 games during his rookie season with the Novgorod Torpedo of the Kontinental Hockey League. Celebrini spent last season playing with his older brother, Aiden, who is also a defenseman and was selected by Vancouver in the sixth round of the draft last year. At BU, he\u2019s coached by former NHL forward Jay Pandolfo. Celebrini drew a laugh when discussing playing against Boston College\u2019s Will Smith last season \u2014 \u201cEvery time we went up against him, he lit us up,\u201d he said. The two will likely be teammates after the Sharks selected Smith with the No. 4 pick in the draft last year. As for the best advice he\u2019s ever received, Celebrini didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cProbably, stay present. I\u2019ve been told that time flies by,\u201d Celebrini said. \u201cBefore you know it, like, it\u2019s five years later.\u201d", "summary": "Macklin Celebrini has a pretty good idea his NHL future rests with the San Jose Sharks, who hold the first pick in the draft.", "url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/06/09/nhl-draft-macklin-celebrini/", "image": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/NHL_Combine_Celebrini_Hockey_78354.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:26:30", "author": "John Wawrow", "authors": ["John Wawrow"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.343}

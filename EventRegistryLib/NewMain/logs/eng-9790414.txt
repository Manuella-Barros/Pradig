(Korean Central News Agency/Korea News Service via AP)\n\nMr Kim said at Sunday's event in Pyongyang the new launchers would give his frontline units \"overwhelming\" firepower over South Korea and make the operation of tactical nuclear weapons more practical and efficient.\n\nState media photos showed lines of army-green launcher trucks packing a large street with seemingly thousands of spectators attending the event, which included fireworks.\n\nNorth Korea has been expanding its line-up of mobile short-range weapons designed to overwhelm missile defences in South Korea, while also pursuing intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to reach the US mainland.\n\nMr Kim's intensifying weapons tests and threats are widely seen as an attempt at pressuring the United States to accept the idea of North Korea as a nuclear power and to end US-led sanctions imposed on North Korea over its nuclear program.\n\nNorth Korea also could seek to dial up tensions in a US election year, experts say.\n\nMr Kim lately has used Russia's war on Ukraine as a distraction to further accelerate his weapons development.\n\nIn response, the United States, South Korea and Japan have been expanding their combined military exercises and sharpening their nuclear deterrence strategies built around strategic US military assets.\n\nIn his speech at Sunday's event, Mr Kim called for his country to brace for a prolonged confrontation with the United States and urged a relentless expansion of military strength.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un hands its military flag to soldiers. (Korean Central News Agency/Korea News Service via AP)\n\nHe justified his military buildup as a counter to the \"increasingly savage\" military cooperation between the United States and its regional allies, which he claimed are now showing the characteristics of a \"nuclear-based military bloc.\"\n\n\"It would be our choice to either pursue dialogue or confrontation, but our lesson and conclusion from the past 30 years ... is that confrontation is what we should be prepared more thoroughly for,\" Mr Kim said.\n\n\"The United States we are facing is not just an administration that comes and

ballistic missile launchers to its southern border, with leader Kim Jong Un describing the weapons as a 'powerful treasured sword' to defend its sovereignty, state media said Monday.\n\nThe olive green mobile launchers were displayed during a special 'transferring' ceremony in the capital Pyongyang on Sunday, the official Korean Central News Agency reported.\n\nThe missile launchers were an 'up-to-date tactical attack weapon', Kim was quoted as saying in a speech.\n\nIt was the first time North Korea had publicised the scale of an arms transfer to its border units, Han Kwon-hee of the Korea Association of Defence Industry Studies said.\n\nEach launcher was designed to hold four missiles, Han said, adding that Pyongyang's supply of arms to Moscow might have 'interfered with the North's capacity to actually produce 1,000 missiles'.\n\nNorth Korea has deployed 250 ballistic missile launchers to its southern border\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un speaking at a ceremony for

Kim\n\nRelations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with the North ramping up weapons testing and bombarding the South with balloons full of trash.\n\nSouth Korea has responded by resuming propaganda broadcasts along the border, suspending a tension-reducing military deal and restarting live-fire drills near the border.\n\nThis year, Pyongyang declared South Korea its 'principal enemy', jettisoned agencies dedicated to reunification and outreach, and threatened war over 'even 0.001 mm' of territorial infringement.\n\nKim noted that presenting the new weapons at a time when the country was reeling from flood damage was a 'manifestation of the firm will of our Party to push ahead with the bolstering of defence capabilities'.\n\nHeavy rainfall hit the nuclear-armed country's northern regions in late July, with a South Korean media report claiming up to 1,500 people could have died.\n\nKim has lashed out at the reports, dismissing them as a 'smear campaign to bring disgrace upon us and tarnish' the North's image.\n\nThe North has said there were no casualties at all in the Sinuiju area, the region Pyongyang said had suffered the 'greatest flood damage'.\n\nIt claimed North Korea's Air Force rescued over 5,000 people, with around 4,200 of them saved by helicopter 'within a few hours'.\n\nKim Jong Un attends a ceremonial event to mark the

official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) via KNS on August 5 shows a general view of a ceremony for transferring 250 new-type tactical ballistic missile launchers to the frontier military units\n\nKim said in his speech that the country was facing a 'significant and strategic shift due to the transformation of US-led alliances into nuclear-based military blocs', a trend he said required an upgrade in war deterrence, according to a KCNA transcript.\n\n'The strength of our armed forces... must continue to accelerate,' Kim said.\n\nPhotos released by KCNA showed rows of mobile launchers positioned before a podium where Kim spoke.\n\nBanners flown from a balloon painted with the North Korean flag read: 'Let's open the golden age of defence industry development under the leadership of the great comrade Kim!'\n\nWhile it was possible that Pyongyang had previously deployed ballistic missile launchers to its southern border, Han said it was the first time he had 'seen

'planned months in advance', Hong Min, a senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told AFP.\n\n'Producing 250 mobile launchers requires massive manpower and capital, which shows that the event on Sunday was not staged on a short notice,' he said.\n\n'Pyongyang appears to have judged that staging such a performance-like event would be an effective message to the United States.'\n\nAmong the event attendees was Kim's teenage daughter, Ju Ae, who Seoul's spy agency said last week was being groomed as Kim's heir.\n\nJu Ae, whose exact age has not been confirmed, was seen clapping behind her father in one KCNA photo.\n\nWhile Kim claimed that the new weapon system was designed by himself, it is likely that they copied the raw technology from overseas, Hong added.\n\n'It is possible that Kim directed the modification using the original technology.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

State media photos showed lines of army-green launcher trucks packing a large street with seemingly thousands of spectators attending the event, which included fireworks.\n\nNorth Korea has been expanding its lineup of mobile short-range weapons designed to overwhelm missile defenses in South Korea, while also pursuing intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to reach the US mainland.\n\nKim's intensifying weapons tests and threats are widely seen as an attempt at pressuring the United States to accept the idea of North Korea as a nuclear power and to end US-led sanctions imposed on North Korea over its nuclear program. North Korea also could seek to dial up tensions in a US election year, experts say.\n\nKim lately has used Russia's war on Ukraine as a distraction to further accelerate his weapons development. In response, the United States, South Korea and Japan have been expanding their combined military exercises and sharpening their nuclear deterrence strategies built around strategic US military assets. Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson of South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, said during a briefing that the South Korean and US militaries were closely analyzing North Korea's weapons development and further monitoring was needed to confirm the operational readiness of the missile systems showcased Sunday. He didn't provide a specific assessment on whether the systems could be placed.\n\nLee said the missiles are likely to be shorter in range than some of North Korea's most powerful short-range ballistic missiles, which have demonstrated an ability to travel more than 600 kilometers (372 miles).\n\nThe North in recent months has revealed a new missile called the Hwasong-11, which analysts say can travel up to 100 kilometers (62 miles). If deployed in frontline areas, the missiles would theoretically be able to cover huge swaths of South Korea's greater capital area, where about half of the country's 51 million people live.\n\nIn his speech at Sunday's event, Kim called for his country to brace for a prolonged confrontation with the United States and urged a relentless expansion of military strength. He justified his military buildup as a counter to the \"increasingly savage\" military cooperation between the United States and its regional allies, which he claimed are now showing the characteristics of a \"nuclear-based military bloc.\"\n\n\"It would be our choice to either pursue dialogue or confrontation, but our lesson and conclusion from the past 30 years ... is that confrontation is what we should be prepared more thoroughly for,\" said Kim.\n\n\"The United States we are facing is not just an administration that comes and goes after a few years, but a hostile nation that our children and grandchildren will be dealing for generations to come and that also illustrates the necessity to continuously improve our self-defense capabilities.\"\n\nKim also said the decision to hold the weapons ceremony while the country was trying to recover from disastrous flooding showed its determination to \"push ahead with the strengthening of our national defense capabilities force without stagnation under any circumstances.\"\n\nThe floods in late July submerged thousands of homes and huge swaths of farmland in regions near the border with China.\n\nRussia has offered flood aid to North Korea, in another sign of expanding relations between the two nations. Kim has made Russia his priority in recent months as he pushes a foreign policy aimed at expanding relations with countries confronting Washington, embracing the idea of a \"new Cold War\" and trying to display a united front in Putin's broader conflicts with the West.", "source": {"uri": "english.aawsat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asharq Al-Awsat English"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Lee Sung-joon, a spokesperson for Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in remarks reported by South Korea's Yonhap news agency.\n\nPlacing the missile launchers close to the border area on the divided peninsula indicates they are designed for short-range launches, the South Korean military added.\n\nAlready tense relations between the two nations on the divided Korean Peninsula have deteriorated as North Korea draws closer to Russia while pushing forward with missile testing and nuclear weapons development programs. In late December, Pyongyang put its military production on a war footing as the \"grave political and military situation\" on and around the peninsula \"reached its limit,\" Kim said at the time.\n\nEarlier this year, North Korea shifted away from an official policy of reconciliation with South Korea, declaring Seoul to be a sworn enemy. South Korea and Japan have expressed grave concerns about North Korea's military activity, calling Pyongyang's actions a severe threat to their national security and turning to the U.S. for support -- something that has angered North Korea.\n\nKim said on Sunday Pyongyang was building up \"tremendous strength\" in its armed forces because of \"the crucial change in the military security environment facing our country, and the U.S. and its followers' ever-escalating moves toward military confrontation.\n\nJoseph Dempsey, a research associate with the International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank, said in a post to social media that images appeared to show 250 Hwasong-11D launchers. Pyongyang has said the short-range ballistic missile can be armed with a tactical nuclear warhead, Dempsey told CNN, adding it is not clear if North Korea has produced the 1,000 missiles this number of launchers can fire.\n\n\"It's highly improbable at least that North Korea has anywhere near that number of tactical nuclear warheads,\" Dempsey said.\n\nNorth Korea has said it is upping weapons production and has test-fired a host of new weapons capable of carrying nuclear weapons, from an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) to an \"underwater nuclear weapons system\" supposedly capable of unleashing a nuclear tsunami on North Korea's adversaries.\n\nIn September 2023, North Korea said it had debuted its first \"tactical nuclear attack submarine\" able to carry and launch nuclear weapons, although some Western analysts doubt the sub's true capabilities.\n\nPyongyang has also launched its first military spy satellite, which it says has captured footage of sensitive political and military sites.\n\nIn early July, South Korea resumed live-fire drills close to the border for the first time in years after North Korea launched hundreds of waste-filled balloons southward.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ellie_cook@newsweek.com", "name": "Ellie Cook", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

North Korea has been supplying weapons to Moscow as the centerpiece of a strengthening economic and military relationship between the two isolated regimes, Washington and Seoul say.\n\nThe North Korean leader pointed to \"ever-escalating military confrontation moves\" by the United States and its allies as the incitement for Pyongyang to continue developing its weapons capabilities.\n\nSouth Korea's Unification Ministry, which oversees inter-Korean relations, rebutted Kim's claim Monday.\n\n\"The main reason for threatening peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula is that North Korea is illegally developing nuclear weapons and missiles and thereby directly threatening South Korea and the world,\" ministry spokesman Koo Byoung-sam said at a press briefing.\n\nIn a separate briefing, the South Korean military said it was working with the United States to \"track and confirm the performance and deployment of weapons systems that North Korea has publicly reported.\"\n\nThe weapons appear \"intended to be used for various means, both for attack and for threats against South Korea,\" Col. Lee Sung-joon, spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said.\n\nIn his address, Kim also mentioned the recent reports of flooding and damage from heavy rains that struck North Korea last week. The city of Sinuiju and Uiju County, which border China, were inundated with record-breaking rain that may have left over 1,000 people dead or missing, according to South Korean media.\n\n\"To hold a ceremony of transferring the new-type weapon system, even at a time when the whole country has turned out in a campaign for recovery from flood damage, is a manifestation of the firm will of our Party to push ahead with the bolstering of defense capabilities,\" Kim said.\n\nOver the weekend, Kim slammed South Korea's \"rubbish\" media for spreading \"false rumors\" about the flood casulaties, according to KCNA. He also thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin for his offer of assistance, saying he could \"deeply feel the special emotion towards a genuine friend in the most difficult period.\"", "source":

600 more trash-filled balloons over border\n\nIt was the first time North Korea had publicized the scale of an arms transfer to its border units, Han Kwon-hee of the Korea Association of Defense

produce 1,000 missiles.\"\n\nRelations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with the North ramping up weapons testing and bombarding the South with balloons full of trash.\n\nSouth Korea has responded by resuming propaganda broadcasts along the border, suspending a tension-reducing military deal and restarting live-fire drills near the border.\n\nREAD: North Korea scraps all economic cooperation with South Korea\n\nThis year, Pyongyang declared South Korea its \"principal enemy,\" jettisoned agencies dedicated to reunification and outreach, and threatened

spoke.\n\nBanners flown from a balloon painted with the North Korean flag read: \"Let's open the golden age of defense industry development under the leadership of the great comrade Kim!\"\n\nWhile it was possible that Pyongyang had previously deployed ballistic missile launchers to its southern border, Han said it was the first time he had \"seen such official reports detailing the scale of arms transfers\" to military units in the area.\n\nProducing such a large number of weapons and displaying them together indicates the event had been \"planned months in advance,\" Hong Min, a senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told AFP.\n\nMobile launchers\n\n\"Producing 250 mobile launchers requires massive manpower and capital, which shows that the event on Sunday

attendees was Kim's teenage daughter, Ju Ae, who Seoul's spy agency said last week was being groomed as Kim's heir.\n\nJu Ae, whose exact age has not been confirmed, was seen clapping behind her

Yonhap\n\nKim Jong-un hails new weaponry as 'deterrent to US nuclear threats'By Lee Hyo-jin\n\nNorth Korea said Monday that it is set to deploy 250 ballistic missile launchers to frontline military units, a development that experts warn could pose serious threats to South Korea's missile defense capabilities.\n\nTheoretically, if this new weapons system is used in full force, it would be capable of firing up to 1,000 short-range missiles simultaneously across the inter-Korean border, the experts said.\n\nAccording to the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), North Korean leader Kim Jong-un attended a commissioning ceremony in Pyongyang the previous day, where 250 new tactical ballistic transporter erector launchers (TELs) were unveiled.\n\nThe report stated that these launch pads will soon be transferred to frontline missile units.\n\nDuring the event, which was attended by troops and military scientists, Kim delivered what the KCNA described as a \"historic speech,\" reaffirming his belief that stockpiling nuclear weapons is the best strategy to counter perceived nuclear threats from the United States and its allies.\n\n\"The U.S.-led alliance has transformed in its essence into a military bloc based on nuclear power, using this as justification for strengthening military capabilities,\" Kim was quoted as saying by the KCNA.\n\n\"We have now improved the effectiveness of tactical nuclear weapons from a practical perspective. We have obtained a clear and overwhelming deterrent against the enemy's reckless provocations,\" he said.\n\nThe North Korean leader said this marks the \"first phase\" of the regime's goal to bolster missile power for frontline units and vowed to showcase the process of upgrading new weaponry every year.\n\nMultiple photos released by KCNA showed rows of olive-green TELs, which were suspected to be platforms for the \"Hwasong-11,\" North Korea's close-range ballistic missile (CRBM) with a range of 100 kilometers and an operational altitude of 25 kilometers. The North Korean military has conducted several tests of this missile since April 2022.\n\nGiven that each launcher appears to be designed to hold four missiles, theoretically, the new weapons system could fire 1,000 missiles at once.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un delivers a speech, during a commissioning ceremony of what he claimed to be a new tactical ballistic missile weapon system to front-line units, in Pyongyang, Sunday, in this photo released by the North's official Korean Central News Agency. Yonhap\n\nPark Won-gon, a professor of North Korean studies at Ewha Woman's University, commented that such a massive salvo could pose a serious threat to the South.\n\n\"It is rare for the North Korean regime to publicly reveal the exact number and scale of arms deployed to its border units. For the South Korean military, detecting and targeting the precise locations of these launchers could prove to be quite challenging,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Park also suggested that North Korea's claims might be exaggerated and the actual number of launchers could be lower than announced.\n\nAlso, some critics suggest that the resource-scarce country may struggle to produce the large quantity of missiles needed for these launchers, especially given ongoing international sanctions against Pyongyang that bar the procurement of necessary components.\n\n\"While more observation is needed to determine the exact threats, it is clear that the Kim regime is prioritizing military might over the welfare of its people, given that the major military event was held as the nation continues to deal with the aftermath of recent floods,\" said Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies.\n\nThis latest development comes amid escalating military tensions between the two Koreas. South Korea has been blasting anti-Pyongyang propaganda broadcasts across the border in response to the North's repeated launches of trash-carrying balloons.\n\nSouth Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) stated that the newly deployed missile launchers appear to be aimed at posing various threats to the South. However, further analysis is required to evaluate their operational status.\n\n\"The South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities are continuously tracking and monitoring North Korea's weapons development trends,\" said JCS spokesperson Col. Lee Sung-jun during a regular briefing, hours after the KCNA's announcement. \"It is necessary to track and verify the performance and operational status of the weapon systems that North Korea has publicly reported.\"\n\nKoo Byung-sam, spokesperson of the Ministry of Unification, speaks during a briefing at Government Complex Seoul, Monday. Yonhap\n\nThe North's disclosure of its missile launchers and subsequent deployment in its southern borders came just days after Seoul extended an olive branch to Pyongyang by offering humanitarian aid for flood relief.\n\nLast Thursday, the South Korean government proposed humanitarian assistance for the flood damage and offered to discuss details through the Red Cross societies, marking Seoul's first offer of flood relief to its northern neighbor since 2012.\n\nThe Ministry of Unification said Monday it has yet to receive an official response from the North.\n\n\"We will not make any premature assumptions about the situation, but we hope for a positive response, given that we have made the offer with sincerity,\" said unification ministry spokesperson Koo Byung-sam.\n\nRegarding the North's missile launchers, Koo said, \"The government is closely monitoring North Korea's weapons production process,\" emphasizing that the Pyongyang's illegal development of nuclear weapons remains the primary threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.", "source": {"uri": "koreatimes.co.kr", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Korea Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Yonhap\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un has attended a ceremony to commemorate the transfer of a new-type tactical ballistic missile weapon system, which serves as the \"pivot military hardware\" in the armed forces, state media reported Monday.\n\nKim attended the ceremony, which took place Sunday, showcasing 250 new-type tactical ballistic missile launchers, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).\n\nKim also delivered a speech, stating that an important task specified in the practical guidelines for bolstering military strength, decided at the 8th WPK Congress, has been successfully carried out.\n\nThe report did not provide further details on the new system or where the inspection took place.\n\nPhotos released by the KCNA suggest that the transferred weapon system is the \"Hwasong-11\" launcher, which is expected to be deployed in the military demarcation line area with South Korea.\n\nKim recently said the U.S.-led alliance has changed into a military bloc based on nuclear power, using it as a rationale for strengthening the country's military capabilities.\n\nThe ceremony also comes as the North appears to have suffered from recent floods. The North's border city of Sinuiju and Uiju County in North Pyongan Province were recently pummeled by heavy rains. South Korean media outlets have reported that the number of those who died or went missing could exceed 1,000.\n\nKim noted that the event comes at a time when the entire country is engaged in recovery efforts from flood damage, the KCNA said.

These launchers produced by North Korea's munitions factories, are designed for \"tactical\" ballistic missiles, suitable for lower-yield nuclear weapons, the Korean Central News Agency confirmed.\n\nDuring the event in Pyongyang, Kim emphasised the launchers would provide his units with \"overwhelming\" firepower over South Korea and improve the practicality and efficiency of tactical nuclear weapons.

Kim's recent weapons tests and threats are seen as an effort to pressure the US to acknowledge North Korea as a nuclear power and lift sanctions.\n\nUsing Russia's war in Ukraine as a cover, Kim has speed up weapons development. In response, the US, South Korea, and Japan have intensified combined military exercises and refined their nuclear deterrence strategies involving US military assets.\n\nSouth Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesperson, Lee Sung Joon, stated that the South Korean and US militaries are closely analysing North Korea's weapons development and monitoring the missile systems' readiness, noting further assessment is needed to confirm their operational status. Lee mentioned the missiles might have shorter ranges than some of North Korea's potent short-range ballistic missiles, which can exceed 600 kilometers.\n\nKim also referenced the newly revealed Hwasong-11 missile, capable of reaching up to 100 kilometers, covering significant areas of South Korea's capital region. At the event, Kim called for readiness for prolonged confrontation with the U.S. and advocated for relentless military expansion, citing increased military cooperation between the U.S. and its regional allies.\n\nRussia's offer of flood aid to North Korea signifies deepening ties between the two nations, with Kim prioritising relations with countries opposing Washington, embracing a \"new

The missile launchers were an \"up-to-date tactical attack weapon\", Kim was quoted as saying in a speech.\n\nIt was the first time North Korea had publicised the scale of an arms transfer to its border units, Han Kwon-hee of the Korea Association of Defence Industry Studies told AFP. Each launcher was designed to hold four missiles, Han said, adding that Pyongyang's supply of arms to Moscow might have \"interfered with the North's capacity to actually produce 1,000 missiles\".\n\nRelations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with the North ramping up weapons testing and bombarding the South with balloons full of trash. South Korea has responded by resuming propaganda broadcasts along the border, suspending a tension-reducing military deal and restarting live-fire drills near the border.\n\nThis year, Pyongyang declared South Korea its \"principal enemy\", jettisoned agencies dedicated to reunification and outreach, and threatened war over \"even 0.001 mm\" of territorial infringement. Kim noted that presenting the new weapons at a time when the country was reeling from flood damage was a \"manifestation of the firm will of our Party to push ahead with the bolstering of defence capabilities\".\n\nHeavy rainfall hit the nuclear-armed country's northern regions in late July, with a South Korean media report claiming up to 1,500 people could have died. Kim has lashed out at the reports, dismissing them as a \"smear campaign to bring disgrace upon us and tarnish\" the North's image.\n\nThe North has said there were no casualties at all in the Sinuiju area, the region Pyongyang said had suffered the \"greatest flood damage\". It claimed North Korea's Air Force rescued over 5,000 people, with around 4,200 of them saved by helicopter \"within a few hours\".\n\nKim said in his speech that the country was facing a \"significant and strategic shift due to the transformation of US-led alliances into nuclear-based military blocs\", a trend he said required an upgrade in war deterrence, according to a KCNA transcript. \"The strength of our armed forces... must continue to accelerate,\" Kim said.\n\nPhotos released by KCNA showed rows of mobile launchers positioned before a podium where Kim spoke. Banners flown from a balloon painted with the North Korean flag read: \"Let's open the golden age of defence industry development under the leadership of the great comrade Kim!\"\n\nWhile it was possible that Pyongyang had previously deployed ballistic missile launchers to its southern border, Han said it was the first time he had \"seen such official reports detailing the scale of arms transfers\" to military units in the area.\n\nProducing such a large number of weapons and displaying them together indicates the event had been \"planned months in advance\", Hong Min, a senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told AFP. \"Producing 250 mobile launchers requires massive manpower and capital, which shows that the event on Sunday was not staged on a short notice,\" he said.\n\n\"Pyongyang appears to have judged that staging such a performance-like event would be an effective message to the United States.\" Among the event attendees was Kim's teenage daughter, Ju Ae, who Seoul's spy agency said last week was being groomed as Kim's heir. Ju Ae, whose exact age has not been confirmed, was seen clapping behind her father in one KCNA photo.\n\nWhile Kim claimed that the new weapon system was designed by himself, it is likely that they copied the raw technology from overseas, Hong added. \"It is possible that Kim directed the modification using the original technology.\"", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

A South Korean military spokesperson, Lee Sung-joon, commented that the launchers might be used in various ways, including attacking or threatening South Korea, with their close-border deployment indicating a shorter range capability.\n\nDuring a speech, Kim Jong Un blamed the United States for establishing a 'nuclear-based military block,' driving North Korea to bolster its military strength. North Korea has consistently criticized the U.S.-South Korea joint drills as invasion rehearsals.\n\nA spokesperson for Seoul's unification ministry highlighted North Korea's illegal nuclear and missile programs as clear threats to peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. Kim further stated that Pyongyang would enhance its nuclear readiness to deter threats and ensure its protection.\n\nKim Jong Un's daughter, Kim Ju Ae, made a rare public appearance at the event, marking her first in nearly three months.

State media photos showed lines of army-green launcher trucks packing a large street with seemingly thousands of spectators attending the event, which included fireworks.\n\nNorth Korea has been expanding its lineup of mobile short-range weapons designed to overwhelm missile defenses in South Korea, while also pursuing intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to reach the US mainland.\n\nKim's intensifying weapons tests and threats are widely seen as an attempt at pressuring the United States to accept the idea of North Korea as a nuclear power and to end US-led sanctions imposed on North Korea over its nuclear program. North Korea also could seek to dial up tensions in a US election year, experts say.\n\nLee Sung Joon, spokesperson of South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, said during a briefing that the South Korean and US militaries were closely analyzing North Korea's weapons development and further monitoring was needed to confirm the operational readiness of the missile systems showcased Sunday. He didn't provide a specific assessment on whether the systems could be placed.\n\nLee said the missiles are likely to be shorter in range than some of North Korea's most powerful short-range ballistic missiles, which have demonstrated an ability to travel more than 600 kilometers.\n\nThe North in recent months has revealed a new missile called the Hwasong-11, which analysts say can travel up to 100 kilometers.

Missiles On North Korea's South Border", "body": "North Korea has deployed 250 ballistic missile launchers to its southern border, with leader Kim Jong Un describing the weapons as a \"powerful treasured sword\"\n\n\"The strength of our armed forces must continue to accelerate,\" Kim Jong Un said in his speech (File)\n\nSeoul:\n\nNorth Korea has deployed 250 ballistic missile launchers to its southern border, with leader Kim Jong Un describing the weapons as a \"powerful treasured sword\" to defend its sovereignty, state media said Monday.\n\nThe olive green mobile launchers were displayed during a special \"transferring\" ceremony in the capital Pyongyang on Sunday, the official Korean Central News Agency reported.\n\nThe missile launchers were an \"up-to-date tactical attack weapon\", Kim was quoted as saying in a speech.\n\nIt was the first time North Korea had publicised the scale of an arms transfer to its border units, Han Kwon-hee of the Korea Association of Defence Industry Studies told AFP.\n\nEach launcher was designed to hold four missiles, Han said, adding that Pyongyang's supply of arms to Moscow might have \"interfered with the North's capacity to actually produce 1,000 missiles\".\n\nRelations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with the North ramping up weapons testing and bombarding the South with balloons full of trash.\n\nSouth Korea has responded by resuming propaganda broadcasts along the border, suspending a tension-reducing military deal and restarting live-fire drills near the border.\n\nThis year, Pyongyang declared South Korea its \"principal enemy\", jettisoned agencies dedicated to reunification and outreach, and threatened war over \"even 0.001 mm\" of territorial infringement.\n\nKim noted that presenting the new weapons at a time when the country was reeling from flood damage was a \"manifestation of the firm will of our Party to push ahead with the bolstering of defence capabilities\".\n\nHeavy rainfall hit the nuclear-armed country's northern regions in late July, with a South Korean media report claiming up to 1,500 people could have died.\n\nKim has lashed out at the reports, dismissing them as a \"smear campaign to bring disgrace upon us and tarnish\" the North's image.\n\nThe North has said there were no casualties at all in the Sinuiju area, the region Pyongyang said had suffered the \"greatest flood damage\".\n\nIt claimed North Korea's Air Force rescued over 5,000 people, with around 4,200 of them saved by helicopter \"within a few hours\".\n\nEffective stage\n\nKim said in his speech that the country was facing a \"significant and strategic shift due to the transformation of US-led alliances into nuclear-based military blocs\", a trend he said required an upgrade in war deterrence, according to a KCNA transcript.\n\n\"The strength of our armed forces... must continue to accelerate,\" Kim said.\n\nPhotos released by KCNA showed rows of mobile launchers positioned before a podium where Kim spoke.\n\nBanners flown from a balloon painted with the North Korean flag read: \"Let's open the golden age of defence industry development under the leadership of the great comrade Kim!\"\n\nWhile it was possible that Pyongyang had previously deployed ballistic missile launchers to its southern border, Han said it was the first time he had \"seen such official reports detailing the scale of arms transfers\" to military units in the area.\n\nProducing such a large number of weapons and displaying them together indicates the event had been \"planned months in advance\", Hong Min, a senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told AFP.\n\n\"Producing 250 mobile launchers requires massive manpower and capital, which shows that the event on Sunday was not staged on a short notice,\" he said.\n\n\"Pyongyang appears to have judged that staging such a performance-like event would be an effective message to the United States.\"\n\nAmong the event attendees was Kim's teenage daughter, Ju Ae, who Seoul's spy agency said last week was being groomed as Kim's heir.\n\nJu Ae, whose exact age has not been confirmed, was seen clapping behind her father in one KCNA photo.\n\nWhile Kim claimed that the new weapon system was designed by himself, it is likely that they copied the raw technology from overseas, Hong added.\n\n\"It is possible that Kim directed the modification using the original technology.\"\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\n(Except for the headline,

launchers toward the South Korean border", "body": "North Korea claims it has sent 250 new tactical ballistic missile launchers toward its border with South Korea, in the latest bellicose declaration by leader Kim Jong Un against its neighbor.\n\nPhotographs published by the North Korean state newspaper Rodong Sinmun showed what appears to be vehicle-based missile launchers, with dozens of large green military trucks lined up in neat rows before Kim.\n\nIn an elaborate and orchestrated ceremony on Sunday night, a crowd of spectators cheered as vehicles rolled past and fireworks shot into the sky.\n\nKim personally oversaw the transfer of equipment to military commanders and chiefs of staff, and delivered a speech claiming the new missile launchers were built with North Korean technology, state media reported.\n\nHe added that the display is the first stage of planned missile force construction for the North's military border units.\n\n\"Dialogue or confrontation can be our choice, but what we must be more thoroughly prepared for is confrontation,\" Kim said, adding it was the \"keynote of our policy toward the US that we have consistently maintained.\"\n\nNorth Korea will make it clear that \"if the US ignores our repeated warnings and continues to attempt to undermine the security of the region, it will have dire consequences for its own security,\" the dictator added.\n\nWhat we know about North Korea's abilities\n\nThe border between North and South Korea is already one of the most militarized in the world, and Pyongyang has long claimed that it has huge amounts of artillery and military hardware pointed south.\n\nSunday's display in Pyongyang comes during a summer of heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, with North Korea entering into a new military \"strategic partnership\" with Russia in June.\n\nWhile the photos appear to show dozens of green transporter-erector launcher vehicles and trucks equipped with missile launchers positioned behind the driver's cab, it's unclear if any of the vehicles had functioning missiles during the Sunday event.\n\nJoseph Dempsey, research associate for defense and military analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said on Monday it was difficult to assess if any of the missiles were loaded at the ceremony - but \"it would seem unlikely and illogical based on practicality and safety.\"\n\nHe added that the launcher's design and terminology is \"associated with the Hwasong-11D, a short-range ballistic missile which North Korea claims can be armed with a tactical nuclear warhead.\"\n\n\"Assuming all 250 launchers are functional it's unclear if North Korea has produced the corresponding capacity of 1,000 missiles (and beyond),\" he added. \"It's highly improbable at least that North Korea has anywhere near that number of tactical nuclear warheads.\"\n\nSince conducting its first nuclear test more than a decade ago, North Korea has advanced its weapons capabilities, with the ambition of miniaturizing a warhead so that it can fit on a long-range missile.\n\nExperts say North Korea has likely already manufactured a small stockpile of nuclear warheads - but it remains unproven whether it has been able to make them small and light enough to be fitted on a missile.\n\nNorth Korea's ability to deploy a nuclear warhead on any kind of missile is unproven.\n\nRising tensions\n\nPyongyang had warned late last year that it would deploy new military hardware along the military demarcation line that separates it from the South, after Seoul partially pulled back from a 2018 agreement designed to ease tensions along the border.\n\nBut any goodwill generated by the agreement has evaporated in recent years, and both countries have now officially abandoned it.\n\nKim, who did not get the concessions he wanted from the US and South Korea during subsequent talks after 2018, has since ramped up the North's ballistic missile program, pledging to give Pyongyang a nuclear deterrent like that possessed by Washington.\n\nIn response to the North Korean buildup, the US and South Korea - along with Japan - have stepped up their military cooperation via exercises and deployments that Pyongyang sees as a threat.\n\nThere have been at least three incidents of South Korea firing warning shots since May after North Korean military personnel crossed the demarcation line, the midpoint of the Demilitarized Zone between the two countries.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri":

missile launchers to its southern border, with leader Kim Jong Un describing the weapons as a \"powerful treasured sword\" to defend its sovereignty, state media said Monday.\n\nThe olive green mobile launchers were displayed during a special \"transferring\" ceremony in the capital Pyongyang on Sunday, the official Korean Central News Agency reported.\n\nThe missile launchers were an \"up-to-date tactical attack weapon\", Kim was quoted as saying in a speech.\n\nIt was the first time North Korea had publicised the scale of an arms transfer to its border units, Han Kwon-hee of the Korea Association of Defence Industry Studies told AFP.\n\nEach launcher was designed to hold four missiles, Han said, adding that Pyongyang's supply of arms to Moscow might have \"interfered with the North's capacity to actually produce 1,000 missiles\".\n\nRelations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with the North ramping up weapons testing and bombarding the South with balloons full of trash.\n\nSouth Korea has responded by resuming propaganda broadcasts along the border, suspending a tension-reducing military deal and restarting live-fire drills near the border.\n\nThis year, Pyongyang declared South Korea its \"principal enemy\", jettisoned agencies dedicated to reunification and outreach, and threatened war over \"even 0.001 mm\" of territorial infringement.\n\nKim noted that presenting the new weapons at a time when the country was reeling from flood damage was a \"manifestation of the firm will of our Party to push ahead with the bolstering of defence capabilities\".\n\nHeavy rainfall hit the nuclear-armed country's northern regions in late July, with a South Korean media report claiming up to 1,500 people could have died.\n\nKim has lashed out at the reports, dismissing them as a \"smear campaign to bring disgrace upon us and tarnish\" the North's image.\n\nThe North has said there were no casualties at all in the Sinuiju area, the region Pyongyang said had suffered the \"greatest flood damage\".\n\nIt claimed North Korea's Air Force rescued over 5,000 people, with around 4,200 of them saved by helicopter \"within a few hours\".\n\n- Effective stage -\n\nKim said in his speech that the country was facing a \"significant and strategic shift due to the transformation of US-led alliances into nuclear-based military blocs\", a trend he said required an upgrade in war deterrence, according to a KCNA transcript.\n\n\"The strength of our armed forces... must continue to accelerate,\" Kim said.\n\nPhotos released by KCNA showed rows of mobile launchers positioned before a podium where Kim spoke.\n\nBanners flown from a balloon painted with the North Korean flag read: \"Let's open the golden age of defence industry development under the leadership of the great comrade Kim!\"\n\nWhile it was possible that Pyongyang had previously deployed ballistic missile launchers to its southern border, Han said it was the first time he had \"seen such official reports detailing the scale of arms transfers\" to military units in the area.\n\nProducing such a large number of weapons and displaying them together indicates the event had been \"planned months in advance\", Hong Min, a senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told AFP.\n\n\"Producing 250 mobile launchers requires massive manpower and capital, which shows that the event on Sunday was not staged on a short notice,\" he said.\n\n\"Pyongyang appears to have judged that staging such a performance-like event would be an effective message to the United States.\"\n\nAmong the event attendees was Kim's teenage daughter, Ju Ae, who Seoul's spy agency said last week was being groomed as Kim's heir.\n\nJu Ae, whose exact age has not been confirmed, was seen clapping behind her father in one KCNA photo.\n\nWhile Kim claimed that the new weapon system was designed by himself, it is likely that they copied the raw technology from overseas, Hong added.\n\n\"It is possible that Kim directed the modification using the original technology.\"\n\nkjk/amj", "source": {"uri":

launchers to frontline units along the southern border, calling the weapons a \"powerful treasured sword\" to defend sovereignty, state media said Monday.\n\nThe \"ceremony for transferring 250 new-type tactical ballistic missile launchers... to the frontier military units\" took place in capital Pyongyang on Sunday, the official Korean Central News Agency reported, with Kim presiding over the event.\n\nThe missile launchers were an \"up-to-date tactical attack weapon\", Kim was quoted as saying in a speech, adding he \"personally designed\" them himself.\n\nRelations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with the North ramping up weapons testing and bombarding the South with balloons full of trash.\n\nSouth Korea has responded by resuming propaganda broadcasts along the border, suspending a tension-reducing military deal and restarting live-fire drills near the border.\n\nThis year, Pyongyang declared South Korea its \"principal enemy\", jettisoned agencies dedicated to reunification and outreach, and threatened war over \"even 0.001 mm\" of territorial infringement.\n\nKim said in his speech that presenting the new weapons at a time when the country was reeling from flood damage was a \"manifestation of the firm will of our Party to push ahead with the bolstering of defence capabilities\", according to KCNA.\n\nHeavy rainfall hit the nuclear-armed country's northern regions in late July, with a South Korean media report claiming up to 1,500 people could have died.\n\nKim has lashed out at the reports, dismissing them as a \"smear campaign to bring disgrace upon us and tarnish\" the North's image.\n\nThe North has said there were no casualties at all in the Sinuiju area, the region Pyongyang said had suffered the \"greatest flood damage\".\n\nIt claimed North Korea's Air Force rescued over 5,000 people, with around 4,200 of them saved by helicopter \"within a few hours\".", "source": {"uri": "bssnews.net",

Korean leader Kim attends ceremony commemorating tactical ballistic missile weapon system | Yonhap News Agency", "body": "SEOUL, Aug. 5 (Yonhap) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has attended a ceremony to commemorate the transfer of a new-type tactical ballistic missile weapon system, which serves as the \"pivot military hardware\" in the armed forces, state media reported Monday.\n\nKim attended the ceremony, which took place Sunday, showcasing 250 new-type tactical ballistic missile launchers to front-line military units, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).\n\nKim also delivered a speech, stating that an important task specified in the practical guidelines for bolstering military strength, decided at the 8th WPK Congress, has been successfully carried out.\n\nThe report did not provide further details on the new system or where the inspection took place.\n\nPhotos released by the KCNA suggest that the transferred weapon system is the \"Hwasong-11\" launcher, which is expected to be deployed in the military demarcation line area with South Korea.\n\nKim recently said the U.S.-led alliance has changed into a military bloc based on nuclear power, using it as a rationale for strengthening the country's military capabilities.\n\nIn Sunday's speech, the North Korean leader again blamed the U.S. for creating various types of threats that forced his country to enhance its military capabilities.\n\nKim also mentioned that the U.S. will remain a hostile nation for generations, hinting at the regime's commitment to bolstering its military capabilities, regardless of the outcome of the U.S. presidential election in November.\n\nSouth Korea's Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, refuted Kim's repeated remarks about strengthening military power due to U.S. threat.\n\n\"The primary reason for the threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula is North Korea's illegal development of nuclear weapons and missiles, which directly threatens both South Korea and the world,\" Koo Byoung-sam, spokesperson at the ministry, said during a regular briefing.\n\nSouth Korea's military said intelligence authorities from the South and the United States have continuously tracked and monitored the North's weapons development, and said the new weapons will likely be used to threaten the South.\n\n\"We assess they will be utilized for various means, such as attacking or threatening the South,\" Col. Lee Sung-joon, spokesperson of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a regular press briefing, noting how the deployment of the missile launchers near the border area suggests they are intended for close-range launches.\n\nThe latest event comes as North Korea has been mostly focusing on beefing up its short- and intermediate-range missile capabilities this year with the test-launch of short-range ballistic missiles, strategic cruise missiles and hypersonic missiles.\n\nObservers say that it remains to be seen whether the North, which has been struggling with scarce resources amid international sanctions over its weapons development, can secure enough parts to manufacture missiles for the new launchers.\n\nThe ceremony also comes as the North appears to have suffered from recent floods. The North's border city of Sinuiju and Uiju County in North Pyongan Province were recently pummeled by heavy rains. South Korean media outlets have reported that the number of those who died or went missing could exceed 1,000.\n\nKim noted that the event comes at a time when the entire country is engaged in recovery efforts from flood damage, the KCNA said.\n\nOther KCNA photos also showed Kim's daughter, Ju-ae, attending the event, making her first public appearance in nearly three months.\n\nSouth Korean lawmakers earlier said the younger Kim is being groomed to succeed her father, though the selection is not final and he could ultimately choose someone else, quoting the National Intelligence Service.\n\nThe South Korean spy agency made the report to the parliamentary intelligence committee last month, saying North Korea has suggested Ju-ae is a strong candidate to succeed her father by adjusting the frequency of her public appearances to gauge public sentiment, Rep. Lee Seong-kweun of the ruling People Power Party and Rep.

Photos published by state media outlet Rodong Sinmun showed dozens of military trucks lined up in neat rows before the leader.\n\nAt the ceremony, marked by massive fireworks, Mr Kim described the new missile launchers as an \"up-to-date tactical attack weapon\" that he had \"personally designed\".\n\n\"Dialogue or confrontation can be our choice, but what we must be more thoroughly prepared for is confrontation,\" Mr Kim said, adding that it was a \"keynote of our policy towards the US that we have consistently maintained\".\n\n\"If the US ignores our repeated warnings and continues to attempt to undermine the security of the region,\" he warned, \"it will have dire consequences for its own security\".\n\nAlthough photos published by state media such as KCNA showed dozens of vehicles and trucks equipped with launchers positioned behind the driver's cab, it was unclear if any contained functioning missiles.\n\nJoseph Dempsey, a research associate for military analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said it was hard to determine if any missiles were actually loaded at the ceremony. \"It would seem unlikely and illogical based on practicality and safety,\" he was quoted as saying by American broadcaster CNN.\n\nNorth Korea is growing its arsenal of mobile short-range weapons aimed at overwhelming missile defences in neighbouring South Korea, while also advancing its development of intercontinental ballistic missiles it claims are capable of reaching the US.\n\nThe country showcased some of these new missiles during a drill in June. They included Hwasongpho 11Da tactical ballistic missile, which is capable of carrying a 4.5-tonne \"super-large warhead\".\n\nPyongyang launched two ballistic missiles during the drill, South Korea said, with one flying 600km and the other 120km.\n\nThe border between the Koreas is heavily fortified, with Pyongyang asserting it has extensive artillery and military equipment aimed at the South.\n\nLee Sung-joon, a spokesperson for South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, said they believed the missile launchers were \"intended to be used in various ways such to attack or threaten South Korea\". Their deployment near the border would mean the range was not long, he added.\n\nKoh Yu-hwan, emeritus professor of North Korean Studies at Dongguk University, noted that while Pyongyang had ramped up the rhetoric it had fallen short of strategic provocations.\n\n\"South Korea and the US are set to hold a major military exercise in August,\" he said. \"North Korea is making these remarks as a response to such military exercises.\"\n\nSeoul and Washington conduct an annual joint military exercise, known as \"Ulchi Freedom Shield\", in August.\n\nPyongyang has consistently condemned the drills as rehearsals for an invasion.\n\nNorth Korea adopted a constitutional policy last September to \"exponentially\" expand its nuclear weapons programme.\n\nThe aim was to \"ensure the country's right to existence and development, deter war and protect regional and global peace by rapidly developing nuclear weapons to a higher level\", KCNA reported.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com",

North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said the launchers were freshly produced by the county's munitions factories and designed to fire \"tactical\" ballistic missiles, a term that describes systems capable of delivering lower-yield nuclear weapons.\n\nAlso Read | US Presidential Election 2024: Kamala Harris Declines Donald Trump's Offer To Shift Presidential Debate to Fox News.\n\nKim said at Sunday's event in Pyongyang the new launchers would give his frontline units \"overwhelming\" firepower over South and make the operation of tactical nuclear weapons more practical and efficient. State media photos showed lines of army-green launcher trucks packing a large street with seemingly thousands of spectators attending the event, which included fireworks.\n\nNorth Korea has been expanding its lineup of mobile short-range weapons designed to overwhelm missile defences in South Korea, while also pursuing intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to reach the US mainland.\n\nAlso Read | Taiwan Detects 9 Chinese Military Aircraft, 9 Naval Vessels Near Its Territory: Live News Updates Today.\n\nKim's intensifying weapons tests and threats are widely seen as an attempt at pressuring the United States to accept the idea of North Korea as a nuclear power and to end US-led sanctions imposed on North Korea over its nuclear program. North Korea also could seek to dial up tensions in a US election year, experts say.\n\nKim lately has used Russia's war on Ukraine as a distraction to further accelerate his weapons development. In response, the United States, South Korea and Japan have been expanding their combined military exercises and sharpening their nuclear deterrence strategies built around strategic US military assets.\n\nIn his speech at Sunday's event, Kim called for his country to brace for a prolonged confrontation with the United States and urged a relentless expansion of military strength. He justified his military buildup as a counter to the \"increasingly savage\" military cooperation between the United States and its regional allies, which he claimed are now showing the characteristics of a \"nuclear-based military bloc.\"\n\n\"It would be our choice to either pursue dialogue or confrontation, but our lesson and conclusion from the past 30 years ... is that confrontation is what we should be prepared more thoroughly for,\" said Kim.\n\n\"The United States we are facing is not just an administration that comes and goes after a few years, but a hostile nation that our children and grandchildren will be dealing for generations to come and that also illustrates the necessity to continuously improve our self-defense capabilities.\"\n\nKim also said the decision to hold the weapons ceremony while the country was trying to recover from disastrous flooding showed its determination to \"push ahead with the strengthening of our national defense capabilities force without stagnation under any circumstances.\"\n\nThe floods in late July submerged thousands of homes and huge swaths of farmland in regions near the border with China.\n\nRussia has offered flood aid to North Korea, in another sign of expanding relations between the two nations. Kim has made Russia his priority in recent months as he pushes a foreign policy aimed at expanding relations with countries confronting Washington, embracing the idea of a \"new Cold War\" and trying to display a united front in Putin's broader conflicts with the West.

Lee Sung-joon, spokesperson of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a regular press briefing, noting how the deployment of the missile launchers near the border area suggests they are intended for close-range launches.\n\nThe latest event comes as North Korea has been mostly focusing on beefing up its short- and intermediate-range missile capabilities this year with the test launch of short-range ballistic missiles, strategic cruise missiles and hypersonic missiles.\n\nObservers say that it remains to be seen whether the North, which has been struggling with scarce resources amid international sanctions over its weapons development, can secure enough parts to manufacture missiles for the new launchers.\n\nThe ceremony also comes as the North appears to have suffered from recent floods. The North's border city of Sinuiju and Uiju County in North Pyongan Province were recently pummeled by heavy rains. South Korean media outlets have reported that the number of those who died or went missing could exceed 1,000.\n\nKim noted that the event comes at a time when the entire country is engaged in recovery efforts from flood damage, the KCNA said.\n\nOther KCNA photos also showed Kim's daughter, Ju-ae, attending the event, making her first public appearance in nearly three months.\n\nSouth Korean lawmakers earlier said the younger Kim is being groomed to succeed her father, though the selection is not final and he could ultimately choose someone else, quoting the National Intelligence Service.\n\nThe South Korean spy agency made the report to the parliamentary intelligence committee last month, saying North Korea has suggested Ju-ae is a strong candidate to succeed her father by adjusting the frequency of her public appearances to gauge public sentiment, Rep. Lee Seong-kweun of the ruling People Power Party and Rep.

of arms to Moscow might have \"interfered with the North's capacity to actually produce 1,000 missiles\".\n\nRelations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with the North

deal and restarting live-fire drills near the border.\n\nThis year, Pyongyang declared South Korea its \"principal enemy\", jettisoned agencies dedicated to reunification and outreach, and threatened war over \"even 0.001 mm\" of territorial infringement.\n\nKim noted that presenting the new weapons at a time when the country was reeling from flood damage was a \"manifestation of the firm will of our Party to push ahead with the bolstering of defence capabilities\".\n\nHeavy rainfall hit the nuclear-armed country's northern regions in late July, with a South Korean media report claiming up to 1,500 people could have died.\n\nKim has lashed out at the reports, dismissing them as a \"smear campaign to bring disgrace upon us and tarnish\" the North's image.\n\nThe North has said there were no casualties at all in the Sinuiju area, the region Pyongyang said had suffered the \"greatest flood damage\".\n\nIt claimed North Korea's Air Force rescued over 5,000 people, with around 4,200 of them saved by helicopter \"within a few hours\".\n\n- Effective stage -\n\nKim said in his speech that the country was facing a \"significant and strategic shift due to the transformation of US-led alliances into nuclear-based military blocs\", a trend he said required an upgrade in war deterrence, according to a KCNA transcript.\n\n\"The strength of our armed forces... must continue to accelerate,\" Kim said.\n\nPhotos released by KCNA showed rows of mobile launchers positioned before a podium where Kim spoke.\n\nBanners flown from a balloon painted with the North Korean flag read: \"Let's open the golden age of defence industry development under the leadership of the great comrade Kim!\"\n\nWhile it was possible that Pyongyang had previously deployed ballistic missile launchers to its southern border, Han said it was the first time he had \"seen such official reports detailing the scale of arms transfers\" to military units in the area.\n\nProducing such a large number of weapons and displaying them together indicates the event had been \"planned months in advance\", Hong Min, a senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told AFP.\n\n\"Producing 250 mobile launchers requires massive manpower and capital, which shows that the event on Sunday was not staged on a short notice,\" he said.\n\n\"Pyongyang appears to have judged that staging such a performance-like event would be an effective message to the United States.\"\n\nAmong the event attendees was Kim's teenage daughter, Ju Ae, who Seoul's spy agency said last week was being groomed as Kim's heir.\n\nJu Ae, whose exact age has not been confirmed, was seen clapping behind her father in one KCNA photo.\n\nWhile Kim claimed that the new weapon system was designed by himself, it is likely that they copied the raw technology from overseas, Hong added.\n\n\"It is possible that Kim directed the modification using the original technology.\"\n\nkjk/amj\n\nMore from this

designed to fire low-yield nuclear weapons", "body": "CAMP HUMPHREYS, South Korea -- North Korea showed off 250 new missile launchers over the weekend as the country's leader announced delivery of the weapons to frontline units facing the southern border.\n\nThe launchers, made by the North's arms industry, are designed to fire tactical ballistic missiles, according to North Korean state media, using a term for low-yield nuclear weapons.\n\nA crowd, seemingly thousands strong, was on hand Sunday in Pyongyang to hear North Korean leader Kim Jong Un praise the munitions workers who built them.\n\n\"As you can see, we are now facing 250 new tactical ballistic missile launchers produced by munitions workers with their own strength and technology,\" he said in his speech, posted online by the state-run Korean Central News Agency. \"The armed equipment lined up in a huge column in front of us will be delivered to our military and take charge of important military activities in the border areas of [North Korea].\"\n\nThe launchers, mass produced in less than a year, show the power of the North's \"self-reliant\" defense industry and are just the first stage of planned missile force construction, Kim said.\n\n\"Every year, we will show the whole world the process of generational replacement of our new armed equipment without any filtering,\" he said, adding that doing so deters war.\n\nAcross the border, U.S. efforts to foster more military cooperation between South Korea and Japan have borne fruit since President Joe Biden, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida held their first summit together last summer at Camp David, Md.\n\nSince then, the nations have held unprecedented trilateral drills involving their air forces, navies and coast guards.\n\nMeanwhile, Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed in June in Pyongyang to provide mutual military assistance if either nation is attacked.\n\nThe U.S., South Korea and others have accused North Korea of providing weapons to Russia for the war in Ukraine in exchange for military and economic assistance.\n\nThe North is facing major changes as the security environment surrounding the country evolves, Kim said in his speech.\n\n\"This highlights the fact that our country has no reason to be satisfied with the current level of war deterrence,\" he said. \"Dialogue or confrontation can be our choice, but what we should be more thoroughly prepared for is confrontation.\"\n\nSouth Korea is monitoring the North's weapons production, Unification Ministry spokesman Koo Byoungsam told reporters at a press briefing Monday.\n\nKim's speech indicated North Korea would continue to develop new weapons due to Washington and Seoul's military pressure on Pyongyang, he said.\n\n\"The main reason for the threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula is that North Korea has been illegally developing nuclear weapons and missiles and directly threatening the ROK (South Korea) and the world,\" Koo said. \"In that sense, the South Korean government has been making every effort to cooperate with its allies to suppress North Korean provocations and maintain peace on the peninsula.\"", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stars and Stripes"}, "authors": [{"uri": "seth_robson@stripes.com", "name": "Seth

southern border: KCNA", "body": "The olive green mobile launchers were displayed during a special \"transferring\" ceremony in the capital Pyongyang on Sunday, the official Korean Central News Agency reported.\n\nThe missile launchers were an \"up-to-date tactical attack weapon\", Kim was quoted as saying in a speech.\n\nIt was the first time North Korea had publicised the scale of an arms transfer to its border units, Han Kwon-hee of the Korea Association of Defence Industry Studies told AFP.\n\nEach launcher was designed to hold four missiles, Han said, adding that Pyongyang's supply of arms to Moscow might have \"interfered with the North's capacity to actually produce 1,000 missiles\".\n\nRelations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with the North ramping up weapons testing and bombarding the South with balloons full of trash.\n\nSouth Korea has responded by resuming propaganda broadcasts along the border, suspending a tension-reducing military deal and restarting live-fire drills near the border.\n\nThis year, Pyongyang declared South Korea its \"principal enemy\", jettisoned agencies dedicated to reunification and outreach, and threatened war over \"even 0.001 mm\" of territorial infringement.\n\nKim noted that presenting the new weapons at a time when the country was reeling from flood damage was a \"manifestation of the firm will of our Party to push ahead with the bolstering of defence capabilities\".\n\nHeavy rainfall hit the nuclear-armed country's northern regions in late July, with a South Korean media report claiming up to 1,500 people could have died.\n\nKim has lashed out at the reports, dismissing them as a \"smear campaign to bring disgrace upon us and tarnish\" the North's image.\n\nThe North has said there were no casualties at all in the Sinuiju area, the region Pyongyang said had suffered the \"greatest flood damage\".\n\nIt claimed North Korea's Air Force rescued over 5,000 people, with around 4,200 of them saved by helicopter \"within a few hours\".\n\n- Effective stage -\n\nKim said in his speech that the country was facing a \"significant and strategic shift due to the transformation of US-led alliances into nuclear-based military blocs\", a trend he said required an upgrade in war deterrence, according to a KCNA transcript.\n\n\"The strength of our armed forces... must continue to accelerate,\" Kim said.\n\nPhotos released by KCNA showed rows of mobile launchers positioned before a podium where Kim spoke.\n\nBanners flown from a balloon painted with the North Korean flag read: \"Let's open the golden age of defence industry development under the leadership of the great comrade Kim!\"\n\nWhile it was possible that Pyongyang had previously deployed ballistic missile launchers to its southern border, Han said it was the first time he had \"seen such official reports detailing the scale of arms transfers\" to military units in the area.\n\nProducing such a large number of weapons and displaying them together indicates the event had been \"planned months in advance\", Hong Min, a senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told AFP.\n\n\"Producing 250 mobile launchers requires massive manpower and capital, which shows that the event on Sunday was not staged on a short notice,\" he said.\n\n\"Pyongyang appears to have judged that staging such a performance-like event would be an effective message to the United States.\"\n\nAmong the event attendees was Kim's teenage daughter, Ju Ae, who Seoul's spy agency said last week was being groomed as Kim's heir.\n\nJu Ae, whose exact age has not been confirmed, was seen clapping behind her father in one KCNA photo.\n\nWhile Kim claimed that the new weapon system was designed by himself, it is likely that they copied the raw technology from overseas, Hong added.\n\n\"It is possible that Kim directed the modification using the original technology.\"", "source": {"uri": "spacewar.com",

Korean leader Kim attends ceremony commemorating tactical ballistic missile weapon system | Yonhap News Agency", "body": "SEOUL, Aug. 5 (Yonhap) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has attended a ceremony to commemorate the transfer of a new-type tactical ballistic missile weapon system, which serves as the \"pivot military hardware\" in the armed forces, state media reported Monday.\n\nKim attended the ceremony, which took place Sunday, showcasing 250 new-type tactical ballistic missile launchers, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).\n\nKim also delivered a speech, stating that an important task specified in the practical guidelines for bolstering military strength, decided at the 8th WPK Congress, has been successfully carried out.\n\nThe report did not provide further details on the new system or where the inspection took place.\n\nPhotos released by the KCNA suggest that the transferred weapon system is the \"Hwasong-11\" launcher, which is expected to be deployed in the military demarcation line area with South Korea.\n\nKim recently said the U.S.-led alliance has changed into a military bloc based on nuclear power, using it as a rationale for strengthening the country's military capabilities.\n\nSouth Korea's military said intelligence authorities from the South and the United States have continuously tracked and monitored the North's weapons development, and said the new weapons will likely be used to threaten the South.\n\n\"We assess they will be utilized for various means, such as attacking or threatening the South,\" Col. Lee Sung-joon, spokesperson of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a regular press briefing, noting how the deployment of the missile launchers near the border area suggests they are intended for close-range launches.\n\nThe latest event comes as North Korea has been mostly focusing on beefing up its short- and intermediate-range missile capabilities this year with the test-launch of short-range ballistic missiles, strategic cruise missiles and hypersonic missiles.\n\nObservers say that it remains to be seen whether the North, which has been struggling with scarce resources amid international sanctions over its weapons development, can secure enough parts to manufacture missiles for the new launchers.\n\nThe ceremony also comes as the North appears to have suffered from recent floods. The North's border city of Sinuiju and Uiju County in North Pyongan Province were recently pummeled by heavy rains. South Korean media outlets have reported that the number of those who died or went missing could exceed 1,000.\n\nKim noted that the event comes at a time when the entire country is engaged in recovery efforts from flood damage, the KCNA said.", "source": {"uri": "en.yna.co.kr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yonhap News Agency"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lee_minji@en.yna.co.kr", "name": "Lee Minji", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tactical ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Central_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Korean Central News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8th_Congress_of_the_Workers'_Party_of_Korea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "8th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_(North_Korean_title)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Leader (North Korean title)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonhap_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yonhap News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KN-02_Toksa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KN-02 Toksa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uiju_County", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uiju County"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uiju County"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transporter_erector_launcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transporter erector launcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pyongan_Province", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Pyongan Province"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-range_ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Short-range ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joint Chiefs of Staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cruise missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersonic_speed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hypersonic speed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinuiju", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sinuiju"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sinuiju"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://img4.yna.co.kr/photo/yna/YH/2024/08/05/PYH2024080502850004200_P4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790414", "eventUri": "eng-9790414", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 7, "textEnd": 13}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

North Korea\u00b4s official Korean Central News Agency said the launchers were freshly produced by the county\u00b4s munitions factories and designed to fire \"tactical\" ballistic missiles, a term that describes systems capable of delivering lower-yield nuclear weapons.\n\nKim said at Sunday's event in Pyongyang the new launchers would give his frontline units \"overwhelming\" firepower over South and make the operation of tactical nuclear weapons more practical and efficient. State media photos showed lines of army-green launcher trucks packing a large street with seemingly thousands of spectators attending the event, which included fireworks.\n\nNorth Korea has been expanding its lineup of mobile short-range weapons designed to overwhelm missile defenses in South Korea, while also pursuing intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to reach the U.S. mainland.\n\nKim\u00b4s intensifying weapons tests and threats are widely seen as an attempt at pressuring the United States to accept the idea of North Korea as a nuclear power and to end U.S.-led sanctions imposed on North Korea over its nuclear program. North Korea also could seek to dial up tensions in a U.S. election year, experts say.\n\nKim lately has used Russia\u00b4s war on Ukraine as a distraction to further accelerate his weapons development. In response, the United States, South Korea and Japan have been expanding their combined military exercises and sharpening their nuclear deterrence strategies built around strategic U.S. military assets.\n\nThis photo provided by the North Korean government shows celebrations to mark the delivery of 250 nuclear-capable missile launchers to frontline military units, during a ceremony in Pyongyang, North Korea, Sunday, Aug. 4, 2024.

(Korean Central News Agency/Korea News Service via AP)\n\nIn his speech at Sunday\u00b4s event, Kim called for his country to brace for a prolonged confrontation with the United States and urged a relentless expansion of military strength. He justified his military buildup as a counter to the \"increasingly savage\" military cooperation between the United States and its regional allies, which he claimed are now showing the characteristics of a \"nuclear-based military bloc.\"\n\n\"It would be our choice to either pursue dialogue or confrontation, but our lesson and conclusion from the past 30 years ... is that confrontation is what we should be prepared more thoroughly for,\" said Kim.\n\n\"The United States we are facing is not just an administration that comes and goes after a few years, but a hostile nation that our children and grandchildren will be dealing for generations to come and that also illustrates the necessity to continuously improve our self-defense capabilities.\"\n\nKim also said the decision to hold the weapons ceremony while the country was trying to recover from disastrous flooding showed its determination to \"push ahead with the strengthening of our national defense capabilities force without stagnation under any circumstances.\"\n\nThe floods in late July submerged thousands of homes and huge swaths of farmland in regions near the border with China.\n\nRussia has offered flood aid to North Korea, in another sign of expanding relations between the two nations. Kim has made Russia his priority in recent months as he pushes a foreign policy aimed at expanding relations with countries confronting Washington, embracing the idea of a \"new Cold War\" and trying to display a united front in Putin\u00b4s broader conflicts with the West.\n\nIn this photo provided by the North Korean government, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, center right, hands its military flag to soldiers in what they call a \"newly-created missile unit\" during a ceremony to mark the delivery of 250 nuclear-capable missile launchers to frontline military units, in Pyongyang, North Korea, Sunday, Aug. 4, 2024.

Monday.\n\nThe olive green mobile launchers were displayed during a special \"transferring\" ceremony in the capital Pyongyang on Sunday, the official Korean Central News Agency reported.\n\nThe missile launchers were an \"up-to-date tactical attack weapon\", Kim was quoted as saying in a speech.\n\nIt was the first time North Korea had publicised the scale of an arms transfer to its border units, Han Kwon-hee of the Korea Association of Defence Industry Studies told AFP.\n\nEach launcher was designed to hold four missiles, Han said, adding that Pyongyang's supply of arms to Moscow might have \"interfered with the North's capacity to actually produce 1,000 missiles\".\n\nRelations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with the North ramping up weapons

said in his speech that the country was facing a \"significant and strategic shift due to the transformation of US-led alliances into nuclear-based military blocs\", a trend he said required an upgrade in war deterrence, according to a KCNA transcript.\n\n\"The strength of our armed forces... must continue to accelerate,\" Kim said.\n\nPhotos released by KCNA showed rows of mobile launchers positioned before a podium where Kim spoke.\n\nBanners flown from a balloon painted with the North Korean flag read: \"Let's open the golden age of defence industry development under the leadership of the great comrade Kim!\"\n\nWhile it was possible that Pyongyang had previously deployed ballistic missile launchers to its southern border, Han said it was the first time he had \"seen such official reports detailing the scale of arms transfers\" to military units in the area.\n\nProducing such a large number of weapons and displaying them together indicates the event had been \"planned months in advance\", Hong Min, a senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told AFP.\n\n\"Producing 250 mobile launchers requires massive manpower and capital, which shows that the event on Sunday was not staged on a short notice,\" he said.\n\n\"Pyongyang appears to have judged that staging such a performance-like event would be an effective message to the United States.\"\n\nAmong the event attendees was Kim's teenage daughter, Ju Ae, who Seoul's spy agency said last week was being groomed as Kim's heir.\n\nJu Ae, whose exact age has not been confirmed, was seen clapping behind her father in one KCNA photo.\n\nWhile Kim claimed that the new weapon system was designed by himself, it is likely that they copied the raw technology from overseas, Hong added.\n\n\"It is possible

The North's border city of Sinuiju and Uiju County in North Pyongan Province were recently pummeled by heavy rains. South Korean media outlets have reported that the number of those who died or went missing could exceed 1,000.\n\nKim noted that the event comes at a time when the entire country is engaged in recovery efforts from flood damage, the KCNA said.

transfer to its border units, Han Kwon-hee of the Korea Association of Defence Industry Studies told AFP.\n\nEach launcher was designed to hold four missiles, Han said, adding that Pyongyang's supply of arms to Moscow might have \"interfered with the North's capacity to actually produce 1,000 missiles\".\n\nRelations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with the North ramping up weapons testing and bombarding the South with balloons full of trash.\n\nSouth Korea has responded by resuming propaganda broadcasts along the border, suspending a tension-reducing military

border, Han said it was the first time he had \"seen such official reports detailing the scale of arms transfers\" to military units in the area.\n\nProducing such a large number of weapons and displaying them together indicates the event had been \"planned months in advance\", Hong Min, a senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told AFP.\n\n\"Producing 250 mobile launchers requires massive manpower and capital, which shows that the event on Sunday was not staged on a short notice,\" he said.\n\n\"Pyongyang appears to have judged that staging such a performance-like event would be an effective message to the United States.\"\n\nAmong the event attendees was Kim's teenage daughter, Ju Ae, who Seoul's spy agency said last week was being groomed as Kim's heir.\n\nJu Ae, whose exact age has not been confirmed, was seen clapping behind her father in one KCNA photo.\n\nWhile Kim claimed that the new weapon system was designed by himself, it is likely that they copied the raw technology from overseas, Hong added.\n\n\"It is possible that Kim directed the modification using the original technology.\"\n\nkjk/amj", "source": {"uri":

large number of weapons and displaying them together indicates the event had been \"planned months in advance\", Hong Min, a senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told AFP.\n\n\"Producing 250 mobile launchers requires massive manpower and capital, which shows that the event on Sunday was not staged on a short notice,\" he said.\n\n\"Pyongyang appears to have judged that staging such a performance-like event would be an effective message to the United States.\"\n\nAmong the event attendees was Kim's teenage daughter, Ju Ae, who Seoul's spy agency said last week was being groomed as Kim's heir.\n\nJu Ae, whose exact age has not been confirmed, was seen clapping behind her father in one KCNA photo.\n\nWhile Kim claimed that the new weapon system was designed by himself, it is likely that they copied the raw technology from overseas, Hong added.\n\n\"It is possible that Kim directed the modification using the original technology.\"", "source": {"uri":

Kim's comments reflect ongoing trauma from failed North Korea-U.S. negotiations across the Obama, Trump and Biden administrations.\n\n\"Both dialogue and confrontation can be our choices, but the most thorough preparation must be for confrontation, which is the conclusion and consistent stance we have maintained over the past 30 years of DPRK-U.S. relations,\" Kim said. \"Possessing strong military capabilities is a duty and right that a sovereign state must never neglect or compromise.\"\n\nThe DPRK is the official name for North Korea.\n\nKim's statements suggest that North Korea will continue enhancing its nuclear deterrence regardless of the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. This aligns with North Korea's long-standing confrontational stance towards the U.S., highlighted by increasing anti-U.S. rhetoric as the election approaches.\n\nOn July 23, North Korea first addressed the U.S. election in a KCNA commentary, dismissing former President Donald Trump's remarks about his friendship with Kim. \"He that puts on a public gown must put off a private person,\" the commentary said, emphasizing the need to \"distinguish between state foreign policy and personal feelings.\"\n\nOn Sunday, North Korea held a ceremony in Pyongyang to transfer 250 new tactical ballistic missile launchers to frontier military units. Newly revealed pictures of the launchers appear to include launchers for the Hwasong-11Ra short-range ballistic missile.

Deploying near the border would mean that the range is not long,\u201d Lee Sung-joon, spokesperson for South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a media briefing.\n\nState media photos showed lines of army-green launcher trucks packing a large street with seemingly thousands of spectators attending the event, which included fireworks.\n\nNorth Korea has been expanding its line-up of mobile short-range weapons designed to overwhelm missile defences in South Korea, while also pursuing intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to reach the US mainland.\n\nKim\u2019s intensifying weapons tests and threats are widely seen as an attempt at pressuring the United States to accept the idea of North Korea as a nuclear power and to end US-led sanctions imposed on North Korea over its nuclear programme. North Korea also could seek to dial up tensions in a US election year, experts say.\n\nKim lately has used Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine as a distraction to further accelerate his weapons development. In response, the United States, South Korea and Japan have been expanding their combined military exercises and sharpening their nuclear deterrence strategies built around strategic US military assets.\n\nIn his speech at Sunday\u2019s event, Kim called for his country to brace for a prolonged confrontation with the United States and urged a relentless expansion of military strength.\n\nHe justified his military build-up as a counter to the \u201cincreasingly savage\u201d military cooperation between the United States and its regional allies, which he claimed are now showing the characteristics of a \u201cnuclear-based military bloc\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt would be our choice to either pursue dialogue or confrontation, but our lesson and conclusion from the past 30 years \u2026 is that confrontation is what we should be prepared more thoroughly for,\u201d said Kim.\n\n\u201cThe United States we are facing is not just an administration that comes and goes after a few years, but a hostile nation that our children and grandchildren will be dealing for generations to come and that also illustrates the necessity to continuously improve our self-defence capabilities.\u201d\n\nKim also said the decision to hold the weapons ceremony while the country was trying to recover from disastrous flooding showed its determination to \u201cpush ahead with the strengthening of our national defence capabilities force without stagnation under any circumstances\u201d.\n\nThe floods in late July submerged thousands of homes and huge swathes of farmland in regions near the border with China.\n\nRussia has offered flood aid to North Korea, in another sign of expanding relations between the two nations.\n\nKim has made Russia his priority in recent months as he pushes a foreign policy aimed at expanding relations with countries confronting Washington, embracing the idea of a \u201cnew Cold War\u201d and trying to display a united front in Putin\u2019s broader conflicts with the West.\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Leader Kim Jong Un emphasized the expansion of the nuclear program to counter perceived US threats. Kim's actions are seen as attempts to gain global acceptance of North Korea as a nuclear power and to end US-led sanctions.\n\nNorth Korea celebrated the delivery of 250 nuclear-capable missile launchers to its frontline military units at an elaborate ceremony where leader Kim Jong Un called for relentless expansion of the regime's nuclear program to counter perceived US threats, state media reported Monday.\n\nConcerns over Kim's growing nuclear program have intensified, particularly as he has expressed intentions to deploy battlefield nuclear weapons along the North-South Korea border. The official Korean Central News Agency stated that the launchers, produced by domestic munitions factories, are intended to fire tactical ballistic missiles capable of delivering lower-yield nuclear weapons.\n\nIn a speech during the Pyongyang event, Kim highlighted that the new launchers would grant his military units \"overwhelming\" firepower over South Korea, making the operation of tactical nuclear weapons more effective. State media photos showcased army-green launcher trucks and thousands of spectators attending the event, which featured a display of fireworks.\n\nNorth Korea has been diversifying its range of short-range mobile weapons designed to breach South Korea's missile defenses, while simultaneously advancing long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles aimed at reaching the US mainland.\n\nObservers view Kim's intensified weapons tests and threats as a strategy to pressure the US into recognizing North Korea as a nuclear-armed state and lifting sanctions. Analysts suggest that Kim could be escalating tensions purposefully in a US election year.\n\nUtilizing Russia's war on Ukraine as a distraction, Kim has accelerated his weapons development. In response, the US, South Korea, and Japan have broadened their combined military exercises and reinforced their nuclear deterrence strategies.\n\nAt Sunday's event, Kim urged North Korea to prepare for a prolonged conflict with the US, branding it as a hostile nation that future generations would continue to face. He framed the military buildup as a response to the intensifying military cooperation between the US and its regional allies, which he described as forming a \"nuclear-based military bloc.\"\n\nKim declared that North Korea must be ready for confrontation, stressing the need to continuously bolster defense capabilities. Despite recovering from severe flooding, North Korea remains resolute in advancing its national defense, illustrating its determination to maintain a strong stance against external threats.\n\nRecent weather-related disasters submerged thousands of homes and farmlands, yet the regime still proceeded with the weapons delivery, showcasing its resilience. Russia has extended flood relief aid to North Korea, signifying an intensifying relationship between the two nations as Kim seeks stronger ties with countries challenging US dominance.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transporter_erector_launcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transporter erector launcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear program of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tactical ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tactical nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intercontinental ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missile defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contiguous United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Central_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Korean Central News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyongyang", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pyongyang"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pyongyang"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_exercise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military exercise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterrence_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deterrence theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Korean", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Korean", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/25_07_2024_16_26_05_7943786.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790414", "eventUri": "eng-9790414", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The event, broadcast by state media, underscored Kim's commitment to expanding his country's nuclear capabilities amid rising tensions with the United States and its allies.\n\nThe launchers, which have been described as capable of firing \"tactical\" ballistic missiles, were showcased in a high-profile display in Pyongyang.These systems are designed to deliver lower-yield nuclear weapons, which North Korea views as essential for bolstering its military posture. State media reported that the new launchers were produced in domestic munitions factories, enhancing their significance in North Korea's strategic arsenal.\n\nIn his address at the ceremony, Kim emphasized the need for continuous expansion of North Korea's military strength. \"These new launchers will provide our frontline units with overwhelming firepower and make tactical nuclear operations more practical and efficient,\" Kim declared. The event, which featured a large display of army-green launcher trucks, fireworks, and thousands of spectators, was intended to showcase North Korea's resolve and military advancements.\n\nThe ceremony comes amidst growing international concern over North Korea's nuclear program. The country has demonstrated a clear intent to deploy tactical nuclear weapons near its border with South Korea and has authorized preemptive nuclear strikes in response to perceived threats. This strategic posture reflects Kim's broader goal of pressuring the United States to acknowledge North Korea as a nuclear power and to end the sanctions imposed due to its nuclear ambitions.\n\nKim's aggressive rhetoric and military expansion also appear to be influenced by global dynamics, including Russia's ongoing conflict with Ukraine. Analysts suggest that North Korea's recent actions, including intensified weapons tests and heightened threats, are designed to exploit the distraction of international conflicts and to amplify pressure on the US.\n\nIn response to North Korea's actions, the United States, South Korea, and Japan have been bolstering their combined military exercises and strengthening their nuclear deterrence strategies. Kim's speech at Sunday's event highlighted his belief in the necessity of preparing for a prolonged confrontation with the US, portraying the current administration as part of a persistent, hostile entity rather than a transient government.\n\nKim also addressed the impact of recent flooding in North Korea, which has severely affected homes and farmland near the border with China. Despite these challenges, Kim framed the ceremony as a demonstration of North Korea's unwavering commitment to strengthening its national defense capabilities, regardless of domestic hardships.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia has offered aid to North Korea in response to the flooding, reflecting the deepening relations between the two nations. Kim has increasingly aligned North Korea with Russia's broader geopolitical strategies, embracing a stance against Western influence and pursuing a \"new Cold War\" alignment.\n\nAs North Korea continues to advance its military capabilities, the international community remains vigilant, closely monitoring developments that could impact regional stability and global security.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Tactical weaponry is a term usually used to describe systems capable of delivering lower-yield nuclear weapons.\n\nIn his speech, Kim blamed Washington for creating a \"nuclear-based military block\" that had forced his country to further strengthen its military capabilities.\n\nNorth Korea has long condemned joint drills between the United States and South Korea as a rehearsal for invasion.\n\nA spokesperson for Seoul's Ministry of Unification for handling inter-Korean affairs said it was North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes, pursued in defiance of United Nations sanctions, that were the primary threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nRelations between the two Koreas are at one of their lowest points in years, with a 2018 military agreement designed to reduce tension in tatters.", "source": {"uri": "tvcnews.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "TVC News Nigeria"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tactical ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_(North_Korean_title)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Leader (North Korean title)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Central_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Korean Central News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyongyang", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pyongyang"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pyongyang"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhead", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warhead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intercontinental ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contiguous United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Unification", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Unification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Korean", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Korean", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Hapkido", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Hapkido", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790414", "eventUri": "eng-9790414", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 460560365, "relevance": 2}

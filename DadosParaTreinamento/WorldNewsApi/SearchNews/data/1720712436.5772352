{"id": 232012678, "title": "Biden allies launch new Super PAC aimed at boosting youth vote: Report", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2018s allies have launched a new Super PAC aimed at improving his standing among the younger voting demographic. The new group, Won\u2019t PAC Down, hired Gen Z and millennial writers, directors, and producers to craft content engineered to win over voters under 30, Politico reported. The PAC also includes some Biden alums, including John Della Volpe, who worked in Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign polling team.Though only revealed now, the PAC has been meeting for the past half year. The group expects to raise and spend $20 to $25 million. The Hollywood writers enlisted for the endeavor include writers of shows such as Saturday Night Live, Parks and Recreation, and Big Mouth. The leader of the writer\u2019s room, former Crooked Media head writer Travis Helwig, acknowledged the difficulty of their task and the perception of awkwardness around the Biden campaign\u2018s appeals to young voters, promising a new approach. \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between putting a celebrity on camera and having them say, \u2018if you liked me in Madame Web, then you\u2019re going to love voting,\u2019 versus what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said to the outlet. \u201cWe\u2019re taking the best young writers and directors, who are the age and demographics of the people we\u2019re targeting, using poll-tested messaging, and shaping it in a way that will resonate with young people and get them excited.\u201d Biden, though still leading with young voters, has shed significant support since 2020. An April poll from the Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School found that the president only leads former President Donald Trump by eight points among the under-30 demographic, though this gap increases to 13 points among registered voters. Biden\u2019s current standing is a far cry from the 60% support he held in the same poll in 2020. Though legally forbidden from directly coordinating with Won\u2019t PAC Down, the Biden campaign expressed hope that its effect would be decisive. \u201cGroups like Won\u2019t PAC Down, which understand the power of the youth vote, will play a key role in mobilizing and activating young people across the country,\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, told Politico. The group\u2019s first ads are expected to be released in July.", "summary": "President Joe Biden&#8216;s allies have launched a new Super PAC aimed at improving his standing among the younger voting demographic.

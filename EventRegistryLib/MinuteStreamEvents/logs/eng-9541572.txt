That, in large measure, enabled the Fever to gain revenge over the Swifts for their failure nine months ago.\n\nThe result meant Fever remained unbeaten through the first four rounds of the season and have 16 points, and Swifts dropped to fourth in the table on eight points from two wins and two losses.\n\nA few costly errors and a flurry of super shots handed Fever a 23-15 lead heading into the first break, but the defence of the Swifts sparked in the second period, and Elle Temu and Sarah Klau disrupted slick attacking flow of the Fever.\n\nCombined with strong finishing from Sophie Fawns, who ended the match with 12 from 17, including eight super shots, Swifts cut the deficit to 35-33 at half-time.\n\nFever returned from the break and were the more disciplined side in the second half, forcing errors and getting more hands to clean balls, and regained their efficiency at finding Fowler-Nembhard and compatriot Shanice Beckford (eight from nine, including six out of six super shots) to score off their centre pass.\n\nIt proved the difference, and they gained a 57-48 lead entering the final stanza, and the Fever remained in control to close out the match as the Swifts were unable to find any answers.\n\nElsewhere, Melbourne Vixens had to use all their composure to continue their unbeaten start to the season in a bruising 68-55 win against Queensland Firebirds in front of a packed crowd at John Cain Arena.", "source": {"uri": "jamaica-gleaner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jamaica Gleaner"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trinidad and Tobago"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Trinidad and Tobago"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Housby", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Helen Housby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Swifts", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New South Wales Swifts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Aryang", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunday Aryang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Coast Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suncorp_Super_Netball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suncorp Super Netball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_netball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rules of netball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cain_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Cain Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanice_Beckford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shanice Beckford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Klau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sarah Klau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Vixens", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne Vixens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Firebirds", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queensland Firebirds"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://jamaica-gleaner.com/sites/default/files/styles/250px/public/media/article_images/2024/05/06/2770944/7921521.jpg?itok=tJffgyPr", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541572", "eventUri": "eng-9541572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

The bittersweet 75 to 59 win comes after the Swifts secured a thrilling final seconds victory over the Fever in last season's Super Netball preliminary final, crushing their chances at back-to-back premierships.\n\nSwifts' cause wasn't helped by the unusually quiet form of Helen Housby, who was blanketed by MVP Sunday Aryang, and restricted to a humbling three goals and an unheard of accuracy rate of 43 percent. Aryang has well and truly stepped out of fellow Australian Diamond Courtney Bruce's shadow, in what is a stand out season for the 22 year old.\n\nIn the first 10 minutes the scoreboard ticked over with both teams sharing the lead but a few costly errors and a flurry of supershots gave Fever a handy eight goal lead heading into the first break.\n\nA quarter time rev up from coach Briony Akle sparked a defensive lift from the Swifts, as Elle Temu and Sarah Klau were able to disrupt the Fever's slick attacking unit. This combined with brilliant two point shooting from youngster Sophie Fawns - who finished with 12 from 117 including eight super shots - allowed Swifts to claw back the goal difference to two at half time.\n\nAt halftime Fawns acknowledged the comeback but noted they couldn't rest easily. \"We need more discipline. We're giving away cheap ball, and Fever will punish you when they get their hands on the ball.\"\n\nUnfortunately for the Swifts, Fever were the more disciplined side in the second half, forcing errors and getting more hands to clean ball. It proved the difference as Fever ran out big winners and maintained their position at the top of the ladder.\n\nSpeaking after the match, Swifts coach Briony Akle said her side needed to be smarter in their choices. \"Fever are too good. We fell into their trap and played across court balls which are easily read. We must control our possession of the ball. And get our centre pass conversion up. We didn't do that as well.\"\n\nSwifts co-captain Maddy Proud was best on court for the home side. The energetic midcourter contributed 34 feeds and hunted down four pickups. The much loved athlete also spent a bit of time on the floorboards in the physical encounter much to the displeasure of the vocal Sydney crowd who booed every hard knock.\n\nIn the history of Super Netball, there has never been a shooter as accurate as Jhaniele Fowler-Nembhard. While the Fever spearhead has always been the gold standard when it comes to shot volume and often accuracy, in the first three rounds this year, she has risen to new heights, slotting 177 from 179 attempts. That's an unprecedented 183 points from a possible 186 at 98% accuracy!\n\nHOUSBY'S NEXT MILESTONE\n\nAfter celebrating her 100th Super Netball match last week, Helen Housby celebrated her next major milestone at today's match: her 150th National League match. This milestone comes after playing 49 matches in the UK national league and now, 101 in Australia.\n\nVIXENS KEEP WINNING\n\nMelbourne Vixens have continued their unbeaten start to the season as they proved too strong for the Queensland Firebirds in a bruising affair in front of a packed crowd of 8,639 at John Cain Arena.\n\nThe Vixens were required to use every ounce of their composure in the 68 to 55 victory with the Firebirds attempting to ruffle the feathers of the most experienced side in the competition.\n\nThe physicality of the Firebirds defenders led to Vixens goal shooter Sophie Garbin and goal attack Kiera Austin expressing their frustrations with the umpires at half time despite holding a ten goal lead at that point.\n\nGarbin worked through the contact to be the most productive shooter and highest rated player on the court, shooting 49 of 57 attempts as she linked up beautifully with mid-courters Hannah Mundy and Kate Moloney.\n\nMoloney was dominant from each centre pass, while Mundy shone in her first full game since returning from a quad injury by coming off the bench in last week's drubbing of the Giants.\n\n\"It felt really good. Having the likes of Kip, Soph and Kate around me in attack makes it really easy,\" Mundy said.\n\n\"Slotting in there, they were really helpful, really supportive and we were really definite with our moves.\"\n\nThe Firebirds took it up to the Vixens in the second half by winning the third quarter - continuing their streak of doing so in every game this season despite only having one win from four matches - and getting within four goals in the final term.\n\nThe Vixens responded strongly however courtesy of an honest three quarter time assessment.\n\n\"I think there was a bit of perceived pressure,\" Mundy said.\n\n\"We just came together and kind of said 'it was our mistakes' and we went back to what we're good at. Basics, giving the ball and I'm really proud of us for getting out of that.\"\n\nMAGNIFICENT MUNDY\n\nMundy replaced Zara Walters (back injury) at Wing Attack and she grasped her return to the starting seven with both hands by being the highest rated player on the court in the first half.\n\nShe had the equal most goal assists on the court - alongside Firebirds wing attack Lara Dunkley - and received more centre passes than any other player.\n\nMundy's strong showing contemplates selection for Vixens coach Simone McKinnis as she is blessed with many options.\n\nVIXENS DEFENSIVE DUO SHINES\n\nIt was no coincidence that the Vixens were at their best when goal keeper Emily Mannix and goal defence Jo Weston were on court together.\n\nWeston played her best game since coming back from a calf injury that disrupted her start to the season as her and Mannix double teamed Diamonds shooter Donnell Wallam.\n\nWallam shot 37 of 40 attempts but the Vixens pairs' desperation was a highlight with them combining for nine deflections.\n\nMannix was the player of the match against the Giants last week and the Firebirds made a run of six unanswered goals when she went off the court in the third quarter.\n\nT-BIRDS' GIANT THUMPING\n\nAdelaide Thunderbirds showed no mercy on Giants Netball, handing them a 69 to 49 thrashing, their fourth from as many games.\n\nIt leaves Giants as the only team in Super Netball yet to notch up a win, as coach Julie Fitzgerald struggles to balance on court experience with x-factor and youth, and find combinations that work.\n\nFitzgerald spoke during broadcast about her team's resulting loss of confidence.\n\n\"I think mental toughness is a really big thing for us,\" she said.\n\n\"We really tried to build on our confidence (during the off-season) and now we are struggling with that.\"\n\nGiants' captain Jo Harten alluded to the issue in a team huddle during the game, as she implored her team to struggle on.\n\n\"Yes it sucks, but we fight for each other,\" she said.\n\nAfter a below par performance from the Giants' shooters last week their task was no easier this week, against the league's best defensive unit.\n\nDespite her shooting heroics last week, Matisse Letherbarrow was yet again relegated to starting on the bench in favour of Harten's experience.\n\nWhile Harten lifted her form, finishing with a respectable 16 from 24, including two super shots, she was an unfamiliar sight on the sideline midway through the second quarter when she was benched for Letherbarrow.\n\nThe change didn't have the desired effect, with the lead blowing out from six to 14 as a result.\n\nSophie Dwyer had no answers against the physicality of Matilda Garrett.\n\nVisibly frustrated, she finished with 10 turnovers as she struggled to find any space away from the defenders.\n\nThunderbirds have been frugal in taking the two point shot so far this season, scoring only three compared to Giants' 33.\n\nThey showed a renewed intent at attacking the long range shot in this game, with Georgie Horjus and Lucy Austin spending more time in the goal circle combining for four from seven super shots.\n\nMVP Tayla Williams was a standout at centre for the Thunderbirds, efficient with the ball as she delivered 20 goal assists and added pressure in defence to finish with four gains.\n\nThe Giants uphill battle continues, as they wait for Maddie Hay to return from injury.\n\nTheir lack of a solid wing attack, with neither Sam Winders nor Chelsea Pitman able to deliver for a full 60 minutes, has added immense pressure to superstars Jamie-Lee Price and Harten who are only able to do so much when those around them aren't performing.\n\nNETBALL FOR ALL\n\nAs part of celebrating Inclusion Round, as well as both teams wearing Pride bibs, Thunderbirds had an additional focus on multiculturalism given the diversity among their playing group. Across the match, four international sides were represented with Sunshine Girls Shamera Sterling, Latanya Wilson, Romelda Aiken-George and Jodi-Ann Ward, Silver Fern Sam Winders, English Roses Jo Harten and Chelsea Pitman and Australian Diamonds Matilda Garrett, Jamie-Lee Price, Sophie Dwyer and Laura Scherian.\n\nMAVS MAKE HISTORY\n\nAfter losing two players during preseason, the Melbourne Mavericks have delivered an against-the-odds inaugural win and handed the early premiership favourites, Sunshine Coast Lightning, their third consecutive loss. The 65 to 64 margin wasn't without drama, as three players went down with ankle injuries and a last-second goal secured the victory.\n\nThe visibly emotional players celebrated their first win in club history with tears, smiles and applause as delighted head coach Tracey Neville watched on.\n\nRevealing that players have struggled with Covid during the week, she said, \"The players have worked so hard for that performance.\n\n\"At the end, it was about heart and they definitely showed that on court.\"\n\nMavericks trailed for most of the match, and after losing Eleanor Cardwell for part of the final term to a rolled ankle, they were able to turn what could have been a disaster into motivation to snaffle the lead with 36 seconds on the clock.\n\nThe first quarter see-sawed, with neither side able to pull away until Lightning took a slim lead into the break. They maintained a steady grip for much of the sixty minutes, never able to extend it while also never quite relinquishing it.\n\nThe final super shot period was a nailbiter as the Mavericks drew to within one goal. For three minutes, the scores were on a knife's edge, with the threat of another overtime game looking likely. That is until youngster Ash Ervin forced a wayward pass, and Lightning was able to give themselves some breathing room.\n\nThe reprieve was short-lived as the Mavericks equalised via a Gabby Sinclair super shot, and the final nail in the coffin came from Shimona Jock who sunk an easy one-point goal off their centre pass.\n\nDespite the solid start, Mavericks made a change for the second quarter, bringing on newly signed defender, Kristiana Manu'a, who remains the only player to have been suspended from Super Netball play.\n\nFor this match, Manu'a remained mostly under the umpire's radar. However, her defensive partner, Kim Jenner continues to be the most penalised player for her side, finishing with a game high 18 offenses.\n\nMavericks' centre Molly Jovic was a standout for her side, and took MVP honours after delivering 25 goal assists, two gains, six pickups and a very tidy two turnovers.\n\nPROUD ROUND\n\nEach year Super Netball celebrates Inclusion Round. For this match, Lightning and Mavericks used the Round to celebrate Pride and highlight that netball is an inclusive sport and a welcome place for members of the LGBTQIA+ community.\n\nAs hosts, Lightning embraced the event with all the vibrancy of their rainbow bibs by having music from LGBTQIA allies playing all match, having activations in the fan zones and pride and trans flags on all assets.\n\nThe athletes were also welcomed onto the court via the rainbow guard of honour.\n\nMANU'A A MAVERICK\n\nThis week, the Maverick's announced Kristiana Manu'a as an injury replacement for Lauren Moore, who ruptured her ACL in preseason.\n\nFor the last two seasons, the former Giants' athlete has plied her trade in the New Zealand ANZ Premiership, so she will undoubtedly bring more dogged experience to the defence end.\n\nHowever, at 183cm tall, she does not bring height, which is something the Mavericks need to tackle the taller shooters of the competition.", "source": {"uri":

Aryang shackled Helen Housby and the Jamaican shooters starred as West Coast Fever maintained their unbeaten start to the Super Netball season with a 75-59 away win over the NSW Swifts.\n\nThe Swifts eliminated Fever from the finals last season and outscored them 18-12 in the second quarter on Sunday at Ken Rosewall Arena, but West Coast dominated the rest of the game.\n\nFever (4-0) shot at 94 per cent and only conceded 35 penalties.\n\nSwifts (2-2) couldn't shut down the supply to Fever shooters Jhaniele Fowler-Nembhard (60 from 62) and her Jamaican compatriot Shanice Beckford (8/9).\n\nMidcourters Alice Teague-Neeld and Kelsey Browne notched 24 and 22 goal assists respectively.\n\nBeckford proved the perfect foil to the ultra-consistent Fowler-Nembhard, making all six of her Super Shots.\n\nNormally prolific Super Shot exponent Housby (3/7) missed all four of her two-point attempts and was constantly dogged by the persistent Aryang, who logged 11 deflections and six gains.\n\nAryang is arguably in career-best form this season and appears to have flourished since her long-term defensive partner and fellow Diamond Courtney Bruce switched to the Sunshine Coast Lightning.\n\n\"I think it's just the hard work that I'm putting in during training and I've had this massive focus on trying to work on just grinding down my players and sticking on them for the whole 60 minutes and I think I did that today,\" Aryang told Fox.\n\nIn a remarkable first half, each team enjoyed a good run after it took almost eight minutes for either side to score successive goals.\n\nFever played an almost perfect first quarter apart from a couple of turnovers, converting all 16 of their centre passes as well as turning all of their interceptions into scores.\n\nDown 23-15 at quarter-time, the Swifts ratcheted up their defensive pressure and Sophie Fawns landed her first six Super Shots across the half to give the home side a three-goal lead.\n\nA couple of Beckford two-pointers helped the Fever to a 35-33 halftime advantage.\n\n\"Definitely a bit of the low in the second and coming out for the second half and just being really strong on what we wanted to do and I think the defence gave us so much ball and made our job easier in attack,\" Teague-Neeld told Fox.\n\nThe Swifts got within one In the first five minutes of the second half, but Fever then went back into overdrive, outscoring the home team 35-20 for the remainder of the game.\n\nFawns finished with eight out of 10 from two-point range and Sam Wallace-Joseph made 35 of 38 attempts.",

New to Kayo? Start your free trial today >\n\nA few costly errors and a flurry of supershots gave Fever a handy eight-goal lead heading into the first break.\n\nA quarter-time rev-up from coach Briony Akle sparked a defensive lift from the Swifts, as Elle Temu and Sarah Klau were able to disrupt Fever's slick attacking unit.\n\nCombined with brilliant shooting from youngster Sophie Fawns, who finished with 12 from 17 including eight super shots, it allowed Swifts to cut the deficit to two at halftime.\n\nFever was the more disciplined side in the second half, forcing errors and getting more hands to clean ball.\n\nIt proved the difference as it ran out a big winner to maintain its position at the top of the ladder.\n\nSwifts co-captain Maddy Proud was best on court for the home side. The energetic midcourter contributed 34 feeds and hunted down four pickups.\n\nShe also spent a bit of time on the floorboards in the physical encounter much to the displeasure of the vocal crowd who booed every hard knock.\n\nVIXENS STAY UNBEATEN\n\nMelbourne Vixens have continued their unbeaten start to the season with a bruising win over Queensland Firebirds in front of a packed crowd of 8639 at John Cain Arena.\n\nThe Vixens had to use all their composure in the 68-55 victory when the Firebirds attempted to ruffle their feathers.\n\nThe physicality of the Firebirds defenders led to Vixens goal shooter Sophie Garbin and goal attack Kiera Austin expressing their frustration with the umpires at halftime despite holding a 10-goal lead.\n\nGarbin worked through the contact to be the highest-rated player. She landed 49 of 57 attempts and linked beautifully with mid-courters Hannah Mundy and Kate Moloney.\n\nMoloney was dominant from each centre pass, while Mundy shone in her first full game since returning from a quad injury.\n\n\"It felt really good,\" Mundy said. \"Having the likes of Kip, Soph and Kate around me in attack makes it really easy.\n\n\"Slotting in there, they were really helpful, really supportive and we were really definite with our moves.\"\n\nThe Firebirds took it up to the Vixens in the second half to win the third quarter - and continue their streak of doing so in every game this season despite only having one win from four matches - and got within four goals in the final term.\n\n\"I think there was a bit of perceived pressure,\" Mundy said. \"We just came together and kind of said 'it was our mistakes' and we went back to what we're good at. Basics, giving the ball, and I'm really proud of us for getting out of that.\"\n\nMAVERICKS FINALLY ON THE BOARD\n\nAfter losing two players during pre-season, the Melbourne Mavericks have delivered an against-the-odds inaugural win and handed the early Super Netball premiership favourites Sunshine Coast Lightning their third consecutive loss.\n\nThe 65-64 margin wasn't without drama, as three players went down with ankle injuries and a last-second goal secured the victory away from home on Saturday.\n\nThe visibly emotional players celebrated their first win in club history with tears, smiles and applause.\n\n\"The players have worked so hard for that performance,\" said a delighted coach Tracey Neville, revealing players had struggled with Covid during the week.\n\n\"At the end, it was about heart and they definitely showed that on court.\"\n\nMavericks trailed for most of the match, and after losing Eleanor Cardwell for part of the final term to a rolled ankle, they were able to turn what could have been a disaster into motivation to snaffle the lead with 36 seconds on the clock.\n\nThe first quarter see-sawed, with neither side able to pull away until Lightning took a slim lead into the break.\n\nIt maintained a steady grip for much of the 60 minutes, never able to extend it while also never quite relinquishing it.\n\nThe final super-shot period was a nailbiter as the Mavericks drew to within one goal.\n\nFor three minutes, the scores were on a knife's edge, with the threat of another overtime game looking likely. That was until youngster Ash Ervin forced a wayward pass, and Lightning was able to give itself some breathing room.\n\nThe reprieve was short-lived as the Mavericks equalised via a Gabby Sinclair super shot, and the final nail in the coffin came from Shimona Jok who sunk an easy one-point goal off their centre pass.\n\nGIANTS COP YET ANOTHER LOSS\n\nThe Adelaide Thunderbirds showed no mercy on Giants Netball, handing them a 69 to 49 thrashing, their fourth from as many games.\n\nThis leaves Giants as the only team in Super Netball yet to notch up a win, as coach Julie Fitzgerald struggles to balance on court experience with X-factor and youth, and find combinations that work.\n\nFitzgerald spoke during the broadcast about her team's resulting loss of confidence, saying, \"I think mental toughness is a really big thing for us.\"\n\n\"We really tried to build on our confidence (during the off-season) and now we are struggling with that.\"\n\nGiants' captain Jo Harten alluded to the issue in a team huddle during the game, as she implored her team to struggle on.\n\nShe said, \"Yes it sucks, but we fight for each other.\"\n\nAfter a below-par performance from the Giants' shooters last week, their task was no easier this week, against the league's best defensive unit.\n\nDespite her shooting heroics last week, Matisse Letherbarrow was yet again relegated to starting on the bench in favour of Harten's experience.\n\nWhile Harten lifted her form, finishing with a respectable 16 from 24, including two super shots, she was an unfamiliar sight on the sideline midway through the second quarter when she was benched for Letherbarrow.\n\nThe change didn't have the desired effect, with the lead blowing out from six to 14 as a result. Sophie Dwyer had no answers against the physicality of Matilda Garrett. Visibly frustrated, she finished with 10 turnovers as she struggled to find any space away from the defenders.\n\nThunderbirds have been frugal in taking the two-point shot so far this season, scoring only three compared to Giants' 33.\n\nThey showed a renewed intent at attacking the long range shot in this game, with Georgie Horjus and Lucy Austin spending more time in the goal circle combining for four from seven super shots.\n\nMVP Tayla Williams was a standout at centre for the Thunderbirds, efficient with the ball as she delivered 20 goal assists and added pressure in defence to finish with four gains.\n\nThe Giants' uphill battle continues, as they wait for Maddie Hay to return from injury.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox Sports"},

Teams wore pride bibs to celebrate the LGBTQ+ community as the competition looked to send the message that netball is for all.\n\nThe Melbourne Mavericks are on the winner's list for the first time in the club's history with a nail biting win against the Sunshine Coast Lightning, while the West Coast Fever and Melbourne Vixens are sitting nicely at the top of the ladder as they both remain undefeated.\n\nESPN takes a look at the four biggest talking points from round four.\n\nSinclair steps up in Mavericks first win\n\nWhen you look at the Mavericks big game players many eyes will instantly go to Eleanor Cardwell, so when she went down with an ankle injury during the fourth quarter and was put on ice for the rest of the game, it was up to Gabby Sinclair and Shimona Jok to steer the Mavericks home.\n\nThere was a minute and a half on the clock and the Sunshine Coast Lightning were up by four, meaning the Mavericks would be forced into going for the Super Shots to win the game. Enter Sinclair, who was able to convert two Super Shots in a row to get the Mavericks to tie the game.\n\nComparing that performance to the opening game against the Vixens, the attack end was too reliant on Cardwell but to get the win without their star import on the court in the dying seconds would be a massive boost of confidence for the Mavericks.\n\nTracey Neville was overjoyed with Sinclair's performance post match.\n\n\"Gabby Sinclair, gee whiz,\" Neville said. \"Bearing in mind that Gabby has had Covid all week as well, for her to come in and put in 15 minutes. That's what I wanted from her today and she did that so perfectly.\"\n\nLightning let another close one slip\n\nIt's become somewhat of the Lightning's kryptonite as of late as they fail to play through the full 60-minutes and it's struck yet again with the side unable to close out yet another tight finish. It was the execution in the dying moments of the game that cost the Lightning this week, after having had an eight-goal lead during the third quarter.\n\nThere was no Courtney Bruce for most of the final quarter, going down with a calf injury, which was a huge loss, however, Ervin was able to step up nicely for the Lightning having three deflections in the final quarter alone.\n\nTara Hinchliffe said that she was disappointed with the performance in the game's final minutes.\n\n\"I guess it was disappointing,\" Hinchliffe said.\n\n\"It felt like it just slipped out of our hands, I looked up at the clock with probably two minutes to go and we were up by four and I thought we were looking great.\n\n\"I think with that unlucky call against Harls [Mahalia Cassidy], I feel like we let the momentum slip a bit and as much as we all tried to come together and make sure that didn't happen, it did feel frantic.\n\n\"That's something in defence we need to look at owning our player and stepping up, not giving away some penalties and how we can make it very clear to the umpires that we're trying to do everything we can to stay in play and win some ball.\"\n\nThe loss has brought back an early season question, are the Sunshine Coast Lightning a team of champions or a champion team? As of right now, the jury is still out.\n\nFuture Diamonds shine bright\n\nThe future is bright for Australian Netball with two attacking young guns standing up for their respective sides.\n\nGeorgie Horjus set the Adelaide Entertainment centre alight on Saturday night playing across wing attack and goal attack. Her connection with Lucy Austin is special with the pair almost reading off each other instinctively in the goal circle, which has come from playing together throughout the pathway system.\n\nThen in the midcourt, the combination of Tayla Williams and Horjus was incredible with the pair able to make the hard stuff look so easy. Horjus finished the match with 26 feeds, 12 goal assists, six goals and two Super Shots.\n\nThe combination of Horjus and Laura Scherian has been a huge positive for the Adelaide Thunderbirds as well. No matter which positions the pair are in they add an extra boost of speed into the Thunderbirds attack with Scherian loving every minute of playing alongside Horjus.\n\n\"She's [Horjus] definitely one of the smartest players I've ever played with and her creativity is just amazing,\" Scherian said post-match.\n\n\"So I'm still learning off her and that combination will keep growing.\"\n\nFor the Vixens Hannah Mundy slotted back into the side's starting seven. It was the first 60 minute performance for Mundy in 2024, with the 22-year-old missing the opening two rounds with a quad injury.\n\nThe combination between Mundy and Kate Moloney was strong. Mundy added a bit of flare while Moloney brought grit and toughness to the midcourt. Adding the Diamonds goalers in the circle, the attack line is looking like a recipe for success in 2024. Mundy finished the match with 34 feeds and 23 goal assists and was named player of the match.\n\nMcKinnis praised Mundy post-match.\n\n\"I thought she was brilliant,\" McKinnis said. \"I thought there were such great drives, space awareness and just some great feeds. For her first full game it was great because she hasn't played a full game for quite some time.\n\n\"I'm pleased with her and I thought she was outstanding \"\n\nFever stars in career-best form\n\nThe West Coast Fever are arguably the team to beat at this point in the season with another strong win on the road against the NSW Swifts. There have been two players for the Fever who are in career-best form in Kelsey Browne and Sunday Aryang.\n\nTo think that Browne was on the verge of not getting a Super Netball contract is crazy, she is flourishing in her new role at the Fever playing in centre as opposed to wing attack, where we've seen her for most of her time in the Super Netball. Browne finished the game with 22 goal assists, 30 feeds and three deflections in what was an almost clinical performance from the Fever attack.\n\nOne of the biggest question marks coming into 2024 was how the Fever would go without Courtney Bruce. While Bruce is still a big loss for the Fever, Sunday Aryang has stepped up immensely this season.\n\nIn Sunday night's game, her direct opponent for most of the match was Helen Housby who was limited to just three goals for the entire game. Aryang's ability to shut down her direct opponents has been a highlight of her game this season with Sunday night's performance no different. Aryang finished the game with six gains and 11 deflections and was named player of the match.\n\nSpeaking post-match, Fever coach Dan Ryan was full of praise for Aryang.\n\n\"I think she's had the freedom to really step up and be the leader of our defence,\" Ryan said.\n\n\"I think the way that the defensive team are playing together and being really open, vulnerable and collaborative about how they want to play defence is awesome. Sunday has proven to be a great ball winner for us today but so was Kadie Ann Dehaney, so was Fran and so was Jess.\n\n\"Their ability to just play team-orientated defence is awesome and Sunday has the absolute licence to grind when she needs to grind and hunt when she needs to hunt. She's playing really free netball and super confident in her ability and the way she's stepping up in her leadership capacity. New lease on life, new Sunday Aryang and really just now starting to tap into this amazing potential that she has.\n\n\"She was killer today, up against arguably the best goal attack in the world.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saracens_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saracens Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunshine Coast Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Cardwell", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eleanor Cardwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracey_Neville", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tracey Neville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Coast Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Vixens", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne Vixens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suncorp_Super_Netball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suncorp Super Netball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tara_Hinchliffe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tara Hinchliffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Scherian", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laura Scherian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtney_Bruce", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Courtney Bruce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Thunderbirds", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adelaide Thunderbirds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adelaide"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Adelaide"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Aryang", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunday Aryang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Ryan_(netball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dan Ryan (netball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Moloney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kate Moloney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Browne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Browne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Housby", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helen Housby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Swifts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New South Wales Swifts"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0506%2Fr1329101_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541572", "eventUri": "eng-9541572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

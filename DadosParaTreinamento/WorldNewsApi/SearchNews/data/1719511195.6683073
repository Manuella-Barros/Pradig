It was expected to bring heavy rain along with dangerous winds and lightning. The brunt of the storm was expected to hit about 12:45 p.m. EDT, right when the race was due to begin. There was no word on how long the delay would last, but Indianapolis Motor Speedway president J. Douglas Boles said that officials are hoping for a window after the initial band of rain that would allow enough time to dry the track and complete at least 101 laps, making the race official. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing", "url": "https://sports.yahoo.com/indianapolis-500-double-bid-whiff-221430602.html", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/KeNQLRbjFt95FgXiWti7Sw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/143dc4e160cb13b46611eb0268002c96", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:45:40", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.28}

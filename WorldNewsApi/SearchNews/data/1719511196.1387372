{"id": 223748332, "title": "Prince William 'feels Spare himself as Harry uses outcast status to become more prominent", "text": "Prince William feels as though he is being \"overshadowed\" by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, according to a royal expert. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex recently returned to America following a successful three-day tour of Nigeria, where they met with important figures and delivered powerful speeches. The trip received a lot of attention and royal author Tom Quinn suggested William now \"sees his role diminished\". Speaking exclusively to The Mirror, Quinn said: \"It's almost and if Harry is using his freedom, his outcast status, as a means to become a more prominent royal than he ever could have when he was just the spare. Harry and Meghan have realised they don't need the senior Royals' permission to organise successful overseas trips where they behave as if they are the real thing.\" For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.

Harry was also invited to inspect troops, despite being stripped of his military titles. Quinn continued: \"They know they will be welcomed and feted as Royals, even if they are not officially royals at all. They have realised that the leaders of many countries don't care who is an official royal and who isn't \u2013 they are just happy to see a young, glamorous couple who have royal titles and fit the bill. \"And after what they see as their wildly successful tour of Nigeria, they are convinced they are on a roll.\" However, with Harry being the centre of attention, it seems the Prince of Wales has been left far from happy. Quinn said: \"Back in Britain and powerless to compete or to prevent his brother taking centre stage, William sees his role diminished. And he hates it. \"He may even have started to feel a bit like a spare himself or at least that for the first time in his life he is being overshadowed by his brother and sister-in-law.\" Harry has previously referred to himself as the \"spare\" and revealed in his debut memoir he was first given the cruel nickname by his father, King Charles. Charles is said to have first used the term when the late Princess Diana gave birth to Harry. He's said to have responded: \"Wonderful! Now you've given me an heir and a spare - my work is done.\" * Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "summary": "Prince Harry has admitted he felt like the 'spare' during his time in the Royal Family, but it seems the tables have now turned with his brother Prince William", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/us-celebrity-news/prince-william-feels-spare-himself-32896725", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32896838.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Royal_MAIN_Excl.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:52:39", "author": "Jessica Gibb,Jessica-gibb,Scarlett O'Toole", "authors": ["Jessica Gibb", "Jessica-gibb", "Scarlett O'Toole"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.019}

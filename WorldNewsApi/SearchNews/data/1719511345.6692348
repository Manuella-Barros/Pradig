Boil water in a large pan, add peeled and chopped potatoes, then return the pan to a boil and cook for eight minutes. Drain the potatoes well and put them back in the dry pan. Meanwhile, preheat the air-fryer to 200C, then shake the pan of potatoes to roughen the edges, reports the Express. Toss the potatoes with rosemary, garlic, a drizzle of oil, and a sprinkle of salt. Cook them in the air fryer basket for 18-20 minutes, giving them a shake halfway through, until they're perfectly golden around the edges. These air fryer roasties are ideal for a scrumptious roast dinner, which you can whip up entirely using your air fryer.

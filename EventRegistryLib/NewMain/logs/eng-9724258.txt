They made the judicial system an integral part of the dictatorship,\" he told the court.\n\nOrlov said the passage was first delivered by Telford Taylor, a senior US prosecutor at the trials.\n\n\"These words can be uttered now by any Russian political prisoner. These words are surprisingly appropriate to characterise the current state of the Russian judicial system,\" Orlov said.\n\nRussia had ruled that Orlov discredited its armed forces in a column written for French media in which he said Russia had descended into a \"fascist\" state and pointed to the \"mass\" killing of civilians in Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin denies targeting civilians in what it calls a \"special military operation.\"\n\nSpeaking to journalists via video link to the court before the session, Orlov stood by those comments.\n\n\"I do not regret or repent anything. I am in the right place at the right time. I am helping draw attention to mass repression,\" he said, before the sound from the feed was cut.\n\nOrlov is an instrumental figure in Memorial, the Nobel Prize winning human rights organisation.\n\nUnder his guidance, Memorial established itself as a key pillar of Russian civil society by preserving the memory of victims of communist repression.\n\nIt also campaigned against

explosion in Manville Fallout continues after Alice Munro's daughter speaks out US: Beryl Causes Widespread Power Outages And Flooding, Leaves Multiple Dead In Texas 4\n\nOrlov is an instrumental figure in Memorial, the Nobel Prize winning human rights organisation.\n\nUnder his guidance, Memorial established itself as a key pillar of Russian civil society by preserving the memory of victims of communist repression.\n\nIt also campaigned against rights abuses in modern Russia, with a particular focus on the volatile North Caucasus region -- work that drew increasing scorn from the Kremlin.\n\nRussia disbanded the organisation in late 2021, amid an accelerating crackdown against dissenters, opposition group, independent media and NGOs.\n\nIn 2022 Memorial was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, alongside imprisoned Belarusian rights campaigner Ales Bialiatski and the Ukrainian Center for Civil Liberties.\n\n- 'Dark place' -\n\nSeveral prominent Russian human rights activists and campaigners were in court on Thursday to support Orlov.\n\nThey included fellow Nobel Peace Prize winner Dmitry Muratov, long-time editor-in-chief of the independent Novaya Gazeta newspaper.\n\nMost of Russia's independent civil society has been destroyed by a years-long Kremlin campaign, with almost all senior figures either in jail or exile.\n\nOrlov's arrest and sentencing triggered uproar among Russian rights advocates and internationally.\n\nUS Ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy said in February after Orlov's sentencing that she was \"alarmed and concerned,\" adding that the Kremlin was \"dragging the country back into a dark, dangerous and isolated place.\"\n\nOrlov was initially fined over the charges in 2023, but Russian prosecutors appealed the relatively lenient sentence and a second trial saw him jailed for two and a half years.\n\nRussia has imprisoned hundreds of people for speaking out against its offensive on Ukraine.\n\nbur/jm", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com",

They got it.\" But prosecutors swiftly rejected the sentencing, arguing it was not sufficiently severe before ordering a retrial which landed him in jail.\n\nMr Orlov linked the retrial to other efforts by Russian authorities that collectively were forcing the country \"deeper and deeper into this darkness\", including the crackdown on Russia's LGBT+ movement and the banning of certain books that carried any link to criticism of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMemorial, one of the oldest and the most renowned Russian rights organisations, shared the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize for its \"outstanding effort to document war crimes, human rights abuses and the abuse of power\".", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Russian_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Imperial Russian Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuremberg trials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Muratov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dmitry Muratov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svetlana_Gannushkina", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Svetlana Gannushkina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lukin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Lukin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse_of_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abuse of power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissident", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dissident"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Prize in Literature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Peace Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruble", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ruble"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human_Rights_and_Liberties", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human Rights and Liberties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/a20a4a9d74c97685090059db8e2431a6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724258", "eventUri": "eng-9724258", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

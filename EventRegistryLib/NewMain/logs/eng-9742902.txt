The precision strikes reflect the IDF's current posture on both fronts, as Israeli ground forces mostly sit on the sidelines while the air force increases pressure from the air. The IDF continues to control the Netzarim Corridor across central Gaza and the Philadelphi Corridor along the border of Gaza and Egypt.\n\nThe IDF said on July 18 that it eliminated 20 members of Hamas's Shati Battalion in a drone strike in northern Gaza. The IDF didn't provide a time frame of when this happened, but it appears to have been over the week of July 11-18. The Shati Battalion is linked to Shati camp, an urban area near the beach in northern Gaza based around a historic refugee camp. The Shati Battalion was badly damaged in fighting in November and December 2023, when the IDF first entered Gaza with ground forces. However, it has apparently reconstituted itself in some form, as other Hamas units have in northern Gaza.\n\nThe IDF said that \"Muhammed Abu Jattab, a platoon commander and sniper in the Al-Shati battalion, was eliminated in the strike. Throughout the war, he carried out numerous sniper attacks against IDF troops in the Gaza Strip, including the incident on July 9 where Sergeant First Class Tal Lahat was killed during a targeted raid to dismantle terror infrastructure at the UNRWA Center in Gaza City.\" Another Hamas member who played a role in the October 7 attack was also killed in one of the strikes.\n\nIn another incident, the IDF targeted what it said were \"Islamic Jihad's Naval Forces in Gaza City and an additional terrorist who participated in the October 7th Massacre.\" The target of one strike was Anas Murad, the head of PIJ's naval forces. After nine months of war, it's not clear what naval forces remain to Hamas and PIJ. It appears that most of them have been destroyed, and the remaining naval members have focused their efforts on land over recent months. Hamas used some frogmen and attackers in small boats during its October 7 attack. The group also tried several infiltrations from the water in October, but its naval forces appear to have been heavily damaged afterward.\n\nThe precision strikes on individuals have also extended deep inside Lebanon. An IDF airstrike killed Hamas member Muhammed Jabara. Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyya in Lebanon also claimed Jabara was a member. He was killed in an airstrike targeting a road in Qaraoun, a town that overlooks a lake with the same name, around 25 miles north of the Israeli border. The IDF accused Jabara of being involved in rocket attacks from Lebanon. Hamas has sought to increase its footprint in that country and its capabilities so that the group can launch rockets and attacks from both Lebanon and Gaza as part of a multi-front war.\n\n\"[Jabara's] elimination diminishes the capabilities of the Hamas terrorist organization to plan and carry out attacks against the State of Israel in the area of the northern border,\" the IDF said. The IDF also targeted a Hezbollah member named Hassan Muhanna in a strike on July 18, adding to the pattern of these operations carried out in recent days.\n\nSirens sounded repeatedly in the Israeli community of Nir Am on July 18. Usually, these alerts indicate rocket fire or other types of threats. However, the IDF said that three of the incidents were false alarms.\n\nThe only threat the IDF noted in Gaza on July 18 was a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) fired at IDF troops near a humanitarian route that the IDF did not specify. There are several humanitarian routes in Gaza, including Rashid Road, which runs along the coast of Gaza. Another route runs from the Kerem Shalom border crossing into Gaza.\n\nThe IDF reported that the RPG wounded an Israeli soldier. \"Following the attack, the humanitarian route was temporarily closed.

Among them was Muhammed Abu Jattab, a platoon commander and sniper. The IDF statement said that Abu Jattab conducted numerous sniper attacks against IDF troops in Gaza, including the fatal incident on July 9 during a targeted raid to dismantle terror infrastructure at the UNRWA Centre in Gaza City. Additionally, Ismael Shakshak, a Nukhba terrorist who infiltrated Israeli territory on October 7, was also eliminated in the operation.\n\nThe IDF also stated that Hamas continues to put itself in the way of aid meant for Gazans in need. IDF said that on July 17, Hamas terrorists fired an RPG missile at IDF troops stationed along the humanitarian route while aid trucks were driving by. As a result, the route was temporarily closed and reopened a few hours later, resuming aid distribution. The IDF said that it continues to operate in accordance with international law to facilitate humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza in coordination with the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories: Judea and Samaria and towards the Gaza Strip (COGAT).

A short while later, he was struck by a drone and killed, the IDF said.\n\nIt said the suspect did not cross the barrier amid the incident.\n\nThe military did not say if the suspect was armed, nor elaborate as to why he was killed while fleeing back to Gaza.\n\nThe incident came just over a month after an Israeli soldier was killed in a clash with Hamas terrorists who attempted to infiltrate Israel from southern Gaza.\n\nThese events were among the few attempted infiltrations into Israel since the war in the Gaza Strip began on October 7, when some 3,000 Hamas-led terrorists burst into southern Israel under the cover of thousands of rockets.\n\nIDF strikes UNRWA site used by Hamas\n\nEarlier Thursday, the IDF said a group of Hamas operatives gathered at a United Nations facility in Gaza City's Zeitoun neighborhood was struck by a fighter jet.\n\nAccording to the military, the UNRWA site was used by Hamas as a command center.\n\nThe IDF said it carried out \"many steps\" to mitigate harm to civilians, including using aerial surveillance and \"precision munitions.\"\n\nIn an update Friday, the IDF and Shin Bet said among those killed in the strike was the intelligence officer of Hamas's Gaza City Brigade.\n\nHamdiya served in the role of chief of intelligence in the brigade since 2019, and was responsible for collecting intelligence on Israel ahead of the October 7 onslaught, according to the IDF and Shin Bet.\n\nAmid the war, Hamdiya directed Hamas attacks against IDF troops in Gaza, and worked to collect intelligence on Israel's ground maneuver, according to the military.\n\nIn recent weeks, more than 50 airstrikes have been carried out against Hamas sites embedded within schools and other sites used as shelters for civilians, according to the IDF.\n\nIn Rafah, residents said Israeli tanks advanced deeper into the western side of the city and took position on a hilltop there. The Israeli military said forces located several tunnels and killed several gunmen.\n\nAt Al-Amal Hospital, run by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, Palestinian health officials exhumed at least 12 bodies buried inside the medical facility to rebury them at another location.\n\nReuters journalists saw medical workers digging up bodies from graves inside the facility, wrapping them in white shrouds before placing them inside vehicles for transfer to a new burial site as relatives watched, some in tears.\n\nAreej Hamouda, a mother of one of the dead, clutched some of the sandy earth from the grave of her son and kissed it before medics exhumed the body.\n\n\"They (Israel) shot him and he had a loaf of bread with him, which he had to beg for to get for his daughter, they shot him in the eye and the head -- it rained on him, he was washed with blood,\" Hamouda said, weeping.\n\n\"He was (lying) there all day long, they weren't able to move him, (then) they pulled him with a rope when they brought him to be buried here.\"\n\nThe Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says more than 38,000 people in the Strip have been killed or are presumed dead in the fighting so far, though the toll cannot be verified and does not differentiate between civilians and fighters. Israel says it has killed some 15,000 combatants in battle and some 1,000 terrorists inside Israel during the October 7 attack.\n\nIsrael's toll in the ground offensive against Hamas in Gaza and in military operations along the border with the Strip stands at 327.", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "timesofisrael.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The explosion led to chaos around the area as security forces and medical teams rushed to the site in response. Local media reported that the site of the explosion was close to the US Consulate in Tel Aviv.\n\nTimes of Israel reported that the Israel Defense Forces confirmed the blast in Tel Aviv was caused by a drone, saying an initial probe determined that \"an aerial target\" impacted the coastal city.\n\nThe IDF statement said that the issue was under \"thorough investigation,\" after the drone managed to enter Israeli airspace without setting off sirens. The IDF also said that the Israeli Air Force would increase patrols by fighter jets \"to defend Israeli skies\"\n\nAccording to the Times of Israel, the Magen David Adom ambulance service said that a man had been killed by shrapnel from the explosion of a drone in Tel Aviv. According to the ambulance service, the man was found lifeless in a nearby building. It also said eight people have been taken to local hospitals, four of whom were wounded by shrapnel or the shock wave of the blast. The other four are being treated for anxiety.\n\nEarlier on July 18, The IDF reported that 20 Hamas terrorists, including Nukhba terrorists, engineers, and snipers had been eliminated. Among them was Muhammed Abu Jattab, a platoon commander and sniper. The IDF statement said that Abu Jattab conducted numerous sniper attacks against IDF troops in Gaza, including the fatal incident on July 9 during a targeted raid to dismantle terror infrastructure at the UNRWA Centre in Gaza City. Additionally, Ismael Shakshak, a Nukhba terrorist who infiltrated Israeli territory on October 7, was also eliminated in the operation.\n\nThe IDF also stated that Hamas continues to put itself in the way of aid meant for Gazans in need. IDF said that on July 17, Hamas terrorists fired an RPG missile at IDF troops stationed along the humanitarian route while aid trucks were driving by. As a result, the route was temporarily closed and reopened a few hours later, resuming aid distribution. The IDF said that it continues to operate in accordance with international law to facilitate humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza in coordination with the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories: Judea and Samaria and towards the Gaza Strip (COGAT).

According to the IDF, the drone was detected at some point during its trajectory but was not consistently tracked due to multiple layers of radar surveillance, both on the ground and from aircraft.\n\nThe IDF explained that radar systems from different sectors track various airspaces, making it possible that the drone was detected in one industry but not continuously monitored. Although the IDF identified the drone as a potential threat, a human error led to it not being flagged as such. Consequently, no warnings were issued, and air defense systems were not activated to intercept it.\n\nWhile the IDF has not officially confirmed the drone's origin, the prevailing assumption is that it was launched by the Houthis from Yemen. However, the IDF is exploring all possibilities, including potential disinformation tactics by the Houthis. Determining the exact origin of the drone is crucial for preventing future incidents.\n\nThe IDF has assured us that the immediate threat has passed, and no additional aerial threats have been detected. Despite the human error, the IDF's tracking at some point confirms that the airspace is now secure. The IDF has deployed a full complement of aircraft and air defense systems to ensure continued safety.\n\nIn a related development, the IDF reported shooting down another threat from the east overnight. Emphasizing the frequency of such threats, the IDF highlighted its strong track record in intercepting them, though acknowledging that no defense system is infallible. The recent shoot-down incident is considered separate from reports that the United States intercepted multiple threats potentially directed toward Israel.\n\nThorough investigation underway\n\nInitial assessments indicate that the drone made a direct hit on the apartment building rather than detonating overhead. The drone was identified as a large-scale, long-range model, with preliminary footage suggesting it approached from the south, possibly over the water. The IDF is still conducting a thorough investigation to trace the drone's complete flight path.\n\nThe attack occurred at 3:10 am, and while the IDF has not definitively concluded that Yemen is responsible, there is no immediate move to declare the incident an act of war. The IDF and the Israeli government plan to take their time in determining the source of the attack, likely consulting with the United States and other allies before deciding on any response.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airspace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trajectory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casus_belli", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casus belli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_407,w_690/610598", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742902", "eventUri": "eng-9742902", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Israel says Hamas embeds itself into civilian infrastructure and booby-traps homes in the region.\n\n\"In certain cases, entire neighborhoods in the Gaza Strip are converted into combat complexes which are utilized for ambushes, housing command and control centers and weapon warehouses, combat tunnels, observation posts, firing positions, booby-trapped houses, and for setting explosives in the streets,\" the IDF said.\n\nThe IDF statement in response to Green's allegations also said: \"Defacing homes with graffiti and stealing household personal objects is against the IDF's code of conduct and values. The IDF has acted, and continues to act, to identify unusual cases that deviate from what is expected of IDF soldiers. Those cases will be arbitrated, and significant command measures will be taken against the soldiers involved.\"\n\nGreen served as a combat medic in Khan Younis, Gaza, last November and December. He said IDF soldiers were engaged in guerrilla fighting, going house to house in Gaza. But interactions with Palestinians were rare.\n\nHe said soldiers had been ordered to stop destroying houses in \"some cases,\" but it weighed on his conscience.\n\n\"You have to really think through about the amount of damage you're inflicting upon the poor person that will lose everything he has,\" Green said.\n\nBefore the war, Green had already been planning on leaving the IDF, saying he disagreed with Israel's policies in the West Bank before Oct 7.\n\nHe, however, accepted the call as a reservist when Israel was attacked. He said he believed some of the soldiers' actions in Gaza were driven by the response to the massacres committed by Hamas and other Palestinian-armed groups on Oct. 7, which killed an estimated 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials.\n\nMore than 250 people were kidnapped, but 116 remain inside Gaza held by Hamas and other armed groups, according to the prime minister's office. Forty have been declared dead. Only seven have been rescued by IDF military operations, while others were released during a temporary cease-fire in November.\n\nMore than 39,000 people have been killed in Gaza since last November, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.\n\n\"I think what happened on Oct. 7... war has created a lot of anger amongst us. And I think the horrible things that have happened have caused many Israelis to be very, very furious with the Palestinians,\" Green said. \"I wouldn't say it's bad apples. We're going inside Palestinian houses, we're using it for military purposes which if you're thinking the whole war is legitimate, I guess it is legitimate ... but you're taking souvenirs, you're doing graffiti, you're just destroying things for no reason.\"\n\nThe rules of engagement could sometimes be left to individual commanders, he said.\n\n\"You have to understand that, first of all, the military is a big system,\" he said. \"And sometimes, if there are rules, different commanders could interpret them in different ways so things could change, depending on the person that is there. Basically we have had someone who wanted to, for instance, create more destruction in a house. And he wasn't allowed because there was no reason for that. But on the other hand, we pretty much were able to do whatever we wanted inside the houses.\"\n\nThe scale of destruction he saw in Gaza, he said, was unimaginable.\n\n\"All the buildings are destroyed or at least damaged. All the roads are damaged. Everything is ruined. I can't imagine how people would go back to living there,\" Green said.\n\nAsked why he was choosing to speak out publicly, he said he was trying to advocate for a cease-fire deal to end the suffering of Palestinians and save the remaining hostages in Gaza.\n\n\"There is a concrete way to finish the war and finish the violence,\" he said. \"So I'm trying to push that.\"", "source": {"uri":

"body": "RJC's Matt Brooks Delivers Powerful Speech at the Republican National Convention; Highlights Critical Moment for American Jews\n\nThe Military Intelligence Directorate now believes that Hamas planned its invasion of Israel for seven years while it missed the signs that could have prevented the massacre of October 7th, Channel 12 reported Wednesday.\n\nThe internal report on the intelligence failure, considered the most massive in Israel's history, said that it stemmed from the department's senior echelon holding onto a specific \"concept\" despite having in hand evidence to the contrary.\n\nThey believed that Hamas was deterred from fighting after several rounds in which the terror group suffered heavy losses, and that the terror organization's leaders wanted quiet so that more Gazans could work in Israel and materially improve their lives.\n\nThis led them to ignore years of clues presented to them by intelligence analysts and eyewitness reports from IDF observers on the border of terrorists training in tactics for the takeover of kibbutzim, just as took place on October 7.\n\nA major finding was that the intelligence bosses rejected the theory put forward by certain researchers that Hamas had sat out two clashes with the IDF in Gaza because it was preparing for a much larger conflict and needed to ensure the flow of Qatari money to its coffers to that end.\n\nIn the three-day Operation Breaking Dawn in August 2022, the IDF targeted the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza, a direct Iranian proxy that is a Hamas rival although it is much smaller.\n\nWhile Hamas verbally supported its \"resistance\" its men did not join the fight nor launch rockets at Israel as the PIJ did.\n\nHamas also sat on the sidelines when the IDF clashed with the PIJ in November 2019.\n\nThe terror organization did instigate the 11-day Operation Guardian of the Walls in 2021, in which it and the PIJ launched thousands of rockets at Israel and the iDF conducted around 1,500 aerial, land, and sea strikes on the Gaza Strip.\n\nDuring the investigation, the Channel 12 reporter Nir Devori said, there was \"debate on the interpretation of the findings and the insights\" to be gained from them, to the point at times of fierce arguments breaking out in security meetings.\n\nEven after outgoing Military Intelligence head Aharon Haliva accepted the findings, Devori noted that the debates are continuing over what changes need to be made in the future.\n\n\"Still, even now, the Intelligence Division does not know how to determine with certainty how such incidents can be prevented in the future,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "tjvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jewish Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I wish, and then the war will end.\n\n(Then there is a discussion to avoid going to the beach which might be unsafe).\n\nPalestinian 4: Soon this should happen to Sinwar, god-willing.\n\nAlthough the recordings do not prove Deif's death, as they are not from high level Hamas officials, they do show the spirit of some Gazans who have lost patience with Sinwar's decision to prolong the war to try to keep Hamas in power.\n\nThey also reflect the common belief in Gaza that Deif is in fact dead, the primary view of IDF intelligence, though no Israeli official wants to say that he is definitely dead since Hamas has not confirmed it and since no body was recovered.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Deif", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Deif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Sinwar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahya Sinwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arabic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDF_Spokesperson's_Unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IDF Spokesperson's Unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_407,w_690/609632", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9742902", "eventUri": "eng-9742902", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

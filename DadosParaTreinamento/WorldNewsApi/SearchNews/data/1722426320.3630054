Nearly 20 law enforcement agencies from St. Bernard Parish to St. John the Baptist Parish participated in Operation Clean House. The 16-day operation ended with 155 arrests and the confiscation of 54 firearms, 10 firearm switches and various narcotics. Phase one, which took place from June 3 to June 14, resulted in 74 gun and drug-related arrests. Local law enforcement officers also seized 46 firearms. \u201cSome of the firearms taken during phase one included AK-47s, AR-15s, Dracos and multiple types of handguns, all used to terrorize our communities,\u201d said FBI New Orleans Special Agent in Charge Lyonel Myrthil. During Phase Two, which ended on June 26, nearly 80 warrants were cleared, resulting in the arrests of violent crime offenders and recovered firearms. Officials say special agents staked out high-crime neighborhoods while working on matching their intelligence with witness reports. \u201cSome of the feedback that we got is we want to take our children out to be able to enjoy this beautiful city,\u201d said Myrthil. \u201cWe want to feel safe. We want to enjoy all the festivities and everything that the city has to offer without having to look over our shoulders.\u201d Authorities also confirmed some of the arrests made by Troop NOLA over the past few weeks were part of Operation Clean House. The next step is prosecution. According to Duane Evans, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana, not all the cases will be pursued federally. \u201cMost of the generated cases will be handled by local district attorney\u2019s offices,\u201d explained Evans. \u201cIt is just this type of engagement between our respective offices in which differences are discussed and resolved that ensures the efficient processing of these important cases.\u201d Operation Clean House may be complete, but FBI New Orleans is already planning its next move. \u201cTo those who choose violence over contributing to our society, our message is firm,\u201d said Myrthil. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going away. We know what you\u2019re doing. We know where you are, and you will not see us coming.\u201d Stay up to date with the latest news, weather and sports by downloading the WGNO app on the Apple or Google Play stores and by subscribing to the WGNO newsletter.

The Jets managed only 3 yards of offense in the first quarter and just two first downs in the first half.\n\nJets quarterback Josh McCown sat out this game, but Hackenberg did little to impress in his absence.

New York finished the half with minus-3 net yards passing.\n\nWith Matt Forte still recovering from a hamstring injury, Bilal Powell had nine carries for 32 yards for the Jets.\n\nStafford was fairly sharp for the Lions, but they managed only one touchdown. Jones made a nice catch in the back corner of the end zone and held on amid tight coverage from Morris Claiborne to put Detroit up 10-0.\n\n\"By the sidelines, he's always got a knack for finding a way to get that last little foot in, or whatever it is,\" Stafford said.\n\nRoss Martin made field goals of 31 and 28 yards in the fourth quarter for the Jets, but he missed from 56 in the third.\n\nINJURIES\n\nJets: S Rontez Miles left with a laceration around his eye.\n\nLions: Detroit lost WR TJ Jones in the first half to a hamstring issue, but the Lions were able to avoid the type of major injury they had to deal with in their previous game.\n\nPRESSURE\n\nThe Jets had eight sacks in their previous preseason game against Tennessee. They managed three against the Lions.\n\nNICE MOMENT\n\nEastern Michigan coach Chris Creighton, whose team made it to a bowl last season, was interviewed on the big screen during a break in the action. That turned out to be one of the game's highlights, because Creighton used the opportunity to present senior wide receiver Jaron Johnson with a scholarship .\n\nOTHER QUARTERBACKS\n\nJets: Bryce Petty went 15 of 24 for 160 yards with an interception in relief of Hackenberg.\n\nLions: Jake Rudock went 8 of 13 for 84 yards with an interception, and Brad Kaaya was 4 of 7 for 38 yards.\n\nCELEBRATION\n\nJones made the most of the game's only touchdown, participating in a celebration with teammates in which he pretended to jump rope .\n\nStafford was impressed with the routine, although he didn't take part.\n\n\"I'm not a jump rope guy,\" he said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nJets: Face the New York Giants next Saturday night.\n\nLions: Host New England on Friday night.\n\nFollow

The second-year signal-caller got a surprise start, but did nothing to convince anyone he is ready to start. In fact, Josh McCown probably won the quarterback competition by default without ever taking a snap.\n\nHackenberg went 2-for-6 passing for 14 yards and a 42.4 rating. He was sacked twice, fumbled once and did not lead the Jets to any points. Four of his five drives were three-and-outs. He managed just two first downs -- one throwing and one on which he scrambled. The Jets averaged 2.2 yards per play with him in the game, netting 43 yards total and minus-three passing. Hackenberg has failed to lead the Jets to any points in 13 possessions this preseason.\n\nHackenberg exited at halftime, giving way to Bryce Petty, who went 15-for-24 for 160 yards with an interception on a desperation throw with five seconds left in the game.\n\nAfter some positive steps in the first preseason game against the Titans when he was decisive and accurate if not spectacular, Hackenberg took a big step backward against the Lions. On the third play of the game, he was drilled by defensive end Cornelius Washington, who came in unblocked. Hackenberg fumbled, but guard James Carpenter recovered for the Jets. It looked as if Hackenberg did not call the right protection to account for Washington.\n\nOn the second drive, Hackenberg was nearly intercepted by safety Glover Quin on a pass that bounced off wide receiver Charone Peake's hands, but Quin dropped the ball.\n\nHackenberg was sacked again on the Jets' third series. Defensive tackle Akeem Spence blew past guard Brian Winters to sack Hackenberg, who took a three-step drop, but failed to get rid of the ball quickly.\n\nThe Jets' initial first down came with 13:22 left in the second quarter. Hackenberg used his feet to get it, scrambling for a 12-yard gain. He followed that up with a 17-yard pass to running back Bilal Powell on a short throw that Powell turned into a first down. Both of Hackenberg's completions went to Powell, who basically was the Jets' offense in the first half. Powell also rushed nine times for 32 yards.\n\nThe Jets' defense started strong. They held the Lions to a Matt Prater 37-yard field goal on Detroit's opening drive, which began at the Jets' 43-yard line. But Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford got his team moving on its third drive. Detroit went 78 yards on 11 plays, capped by a beautiful 5-yard touchdown pass by Stafford to wide receiver Marvin Jones over Jets cornerback Morris Claiborne that gave the Lions a 10-0 lead.\n\nThe most troubling moment of the night for the Jets' defense came near the end of the first half, when backup quarterback Jake Rudock moved the Lions down the field with ease against the Jets' starting defense. Rudock took the Lions 87 yards on 16 plays. The Jets held them to a 25-yard field goal from Prater that made it 13-0 at halftime.\n\nPetty led the Jets on two field-goal drives in the second half to avoid the shutout.\n\nIt is unlikely Bowles will announce his starting quarterback this week, but it is clear McCown will start the year as No. 1. McCown likely will get the bulk of the playing time next Saturday in the third preseason game, against the Giants. Hackenberg may get some time in the final preseason game against the Eagles, but Bowles' decision likely will be made before then. It is also tough to judge anything in the fourth preseason game when backups start.\n\nThis likely was Hackenberg's last shot at winning the job for Week 1 -- and he stumbled. Now, he will have to wait for his shot, which should come sometime in the middle of the year, unless McCown gets injured.\n\nbrian", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:45:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim":

Hackenberg has still failed to produce a single point in two extended preseason appearances. After looking decent in last week's 7-3 win over the Titans, when he was 18-for-25 for 127 yards, he looked tentative and overmatched through much of his playing time against the Lions.\n\nJetsNFL preseason: Jets vs. Lions\n\nHe was just 2-for-6 in the first half against the Lions, with his two biggest plays a 12-yard scramble up the middle and a swing pass to running back Bilal Powell that went for 17 yards. By the time Hackenberg gave way to Bryce Petty after the first half, the Jets were down 13-0.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nWith Hackenberg at quarterback, the Jets have not scored a point so far; the Jets wound up losing to the Lions, 16-6.\n\nIn fairness, the Jets' second-round pick in the 2016 draft, Hackenberg wasn't the only culprit in the team's inability to put any points on the board against the Lions' starters. The Jets, still tinkering with the offensive line, rotated six different players into the mix, and both the run-blocking and pass-blocking was consistently poor.\n\n\"We're not giving [Hackenberg] a chance,\" coach Todd Bowles said at halftime during a brief interview on CBS. \"We have to block for him.\"\n\nOn Hackenberg's first dropback of the night, he was whacked from his right side by defensive end Cornelius Washington, who was unblocked on the play. It's uncertain whose fault it was that Washington broke free. Right tackle Brandon Shell took an inside angle and Powell didn't get over in time to block the Lions' defender. Hackenberg fumbled on the play, but the ball was recovered by guard James Carpenter.\n\nJetsJets juggle center and tackle spots to start the game\n\nHackenberg, who had thrown mostly short passes against the Titans, aired one out on his next drive. But his deep pass down the right sideline to Robby Anderson was overthrown and landed out of bounds. Hackenberg went three-and-out on his three drives in the first quarter.\n\nHackenberg finally produced a first down on his fourth possession, as he scrambled 12 yards up the middle after getting heavy pressure. He hit Powell in the left flat, and the veteran running back got to midfield before being pushed out of bounds. But three plays later, on third-and-8 from the Lions' 48, the ball slipped out of Hackenberg's hands as he looked to throw down the middle. The pass was called incomplete, and the Jets were forced to punt.\n\nHackenberg gave way in the third quarter to Bryce Petty, who has been running mostly with the third team through training camp and isn't expected to contend for the starting job.\n\nPetty was 15-for-24 for 160 yards and an interception Saturday night.\n\nJust how things will pan out to start the regular season remains to be seen. McCown got the start last Saturday against the Titans, and looked sharp on his one and only drive. He has rotated as the No. 1 quarterback with Hackenberg the last two weeks in practice, with Hackenberg's workload gradually increasing.\n\nIt was a mild surprise that McCown didn't even play against the Lions. Coach Todd Bowles had hinted earlier in the week that there might not be any changes to the starting lineup, but after discussing the deployment of his quarterbacks with the coaching staff, it was decided that only Hackenberg and Petty would handle those duties.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nThat means if McCown is going to be the opening day starter, his only significant work will come in Saturday's preseason game against the Giants. The third preseason game is typically the most important tuneup for most NFL teams, and the starters frequently play into the third quarter.\n\nBowles is counting on McCown's experience to carry him through the experimentation period with Hackenberg, so if the 38-year-old McCown does start the season, he'll be able to draw from his 14 NFL seasons.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:06:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8117647171020508, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374995", "time": "03:06:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374995", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 5}, {"id": "306941", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "score": 5}, {"id": "309051", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "CBS"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "score": 3}, {"id": "310749", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "score": 2}, {"id": "316239", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "score": 1}, {"id": "324224", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "score": 3}, {"id": "324226", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "score": 2}, {"id": "360558", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Todd Bowles"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Bowles", "score": 3}, {"id": "361834", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Christian Hackenberg"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Hackenberg", "score": 4}, {"id": "372336", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Josh McCown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_McCown", "score": 3}, {"id": "379060", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bilal Powell"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilal_Powell", "score": 3}, {"id": "401985", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bryce Petty"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Petty", "score": 4}, {"id": "424519", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ouvrage Hackenberg"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouvrage_Hackenberg", "score": 5}, {"id": "515963", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Cornelius Washington"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_Washington", "score": 2}], "image": "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.14077463.1503197592!/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1280/image.jpeg", "timeCrawl": "03:06:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Hackenberg gets start but struggles in loss to Lions", "originalArticle": null}

The results weren't shocking to team decision makers, who have believed all along that the second-year signal caller needs more time to evolve.\n\nOne week after the team rolled out a conservative blueprint to build Hackenberg's confidence, the young quarterback went 2 for 6 for 14 yards and 42.4 passer rating in the first half.\n\nThe Jets went three-and-out on four of Hackenberg's five drives (excluding a half-ending kneel down) and racked up a grand total of two first downs and 43 total yards. Bryce Petty played the entire second half, but he has never been a part of the starting quarterback equation.\n\nBowles' offensive line didn't exactly do Hackenberg any favors, breaking down along the edge and interior on two Lions sacks.\n\nIt was ugly from jump street for an offense devoid of playmakers.\n\nHackenberg was drilled by Lions defensive end Cornelius Washington on the third play from scrimmage, a crushing thud from a behemoth who had a free run at the signal caller. Bottom line: The right side of the offensive line and/or running back screwed up. Hackenberg fumbled, but the Jets recovered.\n\nIt didn't get much better on the Jets' next drive. Or the one after that. Or the one after that. Or the one after that. Or the one after that. Or the one... you get the picture.\n\nSomeone on One Jets drive needs to pull out a sandwich board and get an intern to walk around the city with this plea:\n\nWANTED: Playmakers.\n\nHackenberg needed someone-anyone - to help him out. Alas, it didn't happen.\n\nOn the second drive, second-year wideout Charone Peake saw a pass from Hackenberg on a quick slant sail off his hands and nearly into the waiting arms of a defender. That was a receiver problem, not a quarterback problem.\n\nBowles hoped to evaluate Hackenberg in a variety of different situations like red-zone and two-minute work, but it never materialized.\n\nMorton dialed up a draw play on 3rd and 13 from the Jets 25-yard line for Pete's sake rather than give Hackenberg a chance to pick up a first down. Perhaps the offensive coordinator was concerned for the youngster's health given the early breakdowns up front. If so, the safe approach was warranted. Otherwise, it was a curious move. (Morton called another draw play on third-and-long later in the half).\n\nThe Jets failed to pick up a first down on three first-quarter drives (three three-and-outs for a total of three yards is not good).\n\nHackenberg finally moved the chains on a third-down scramble in the first few minutes of the second quarter.\n\nHe connected with Bilal Powell, the only player to pick up any yardage in the first four drives other than the quarterback, for a 17-yard catch and run. But the drive stalled. The Jets went three-and-out on the next series before a kneel-down before halftime ended Hackenberg's misery.\n\nDespite his ghastly numbers, Hackenberg gained valuable experience that should serve him well moving forward. It's premature to pour dirt on the guy - he has talent -- but the present is a different story altogether.\n\nHackenberg, who hasn't led the Jets to any points in 13 preseason drives, is simply not ready to be the team's starter right now. It's unrealistic to expect miracles in the final few weeks before the games actually count.\n\nThe mystery surrounding winner of the Jets quarterback competition is over. Expect McCown to start in the team's final dress rehearsal against the Giants next weekend. Barring injury, McCown will start the regular season under center.\n\nIt would be the exact wrong move for Bowles to trot out an inferior player at the game's most important position. It would be an impossible sell to his locker room.\n\nHackenberg will ultimately play in the regular season, but Bowles & Co. were never going to force the issue with the former second-round pick. They gave him a chance on Saturday night.\n\nThe results weren't entirely surprising to them, but it had to be done.\n\nTags: new york jets detroit lions mlb Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:27:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 927, "textStart": 919, "imp": true, "date": "2017-09-10", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.7647058963775635, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374995", "time": "03:27:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374995", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "305439", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "score": 2}, {"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 5}, {"id": "306941", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "score": 5}, {"id": "310130", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "score": 2}, {"id": "310743", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "score": 3}, {"id": "310749", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "score": 3}, {"id": "324224", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "score": 3}, {"id": "324226", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "score": 3}, {"id": "324464", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Offensive line"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_line", "score": 4}, {"id": "325480", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Passer rating"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer_rating", "score": 3}, {"id": "326127", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Down (American and Canadian football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_(American_and_Canadian_football)", "score": 3}, {"id": "326592", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Solar eclipse"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse", "score": 4}, {"id": "360558", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Todd Bowles"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Bowles", "score": 4}, {"id": "361834", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Christian Hackenberg"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Hackenberg", "score": 3}, {"id": "372336", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Josh McCown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_McCown", "score": 3}, {"id": "379060", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bilal Powell"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilal_Powell", "score": 2}, {"id": "401985", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bryce Petty"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Petty", "score": 3}, {"id": "419561", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sandwich board"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich_board", "score": 2}, {"id": "424519", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ouvrage Hackenberg"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouvrage_Hackenberg", "score": 5}, {"id": "515963", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Cornelius Washington"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_Washington", "score": 3}, {"id": "556220", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Draw play"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draw_play", "score": 3}], "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3426299.1503197063!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/manishcolweb20s-4m7-web.jpg", "timeCrawl": "03:27:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Jets offense already reaching record lows in loss to Lions", "originalArticle": null}

It's time to put the New York Jets' quarterback competition to rest. Josh McCown should be declared the winner, albeit by default.\n\nGiven a terrific chance to state his case, Christian Hackenberg -- in a surprise start -- failed to generate any semblance of offense in the Jets' 16-6 loss to the Detroit Lions on Saturday night at Ford Field. In five possessions, the Hackenberg-led Jets crossed midfield only once (barely) and looked utterly lifeless.\n\nThis was a great learning experience for Hackenberg, who faced a starting defense, but it has become clear he's not ready to be the starting quarterback. In 13 possessions over two games, he has generated zero points. This week, he couldn't get away with his dinking and dunking. The Lions played tight coverage and pressured Hackenberg, who completed only 2 of 6 passes for 14 yards.\n\nLike it or not, McCown -- who got the night off -- gives the Jets (1-1) the best chance to win. Assuming the goal still is to win games, coach Todd Bowles should give McCown two-plus quarters next week against the New York Giants, and name him the opening-day starter. It's time to get serious.\n\nQB depth chart: Bryce Petty played the entire second half, and he looked better than Hackenberg. Playing against the Lions' backups, Petty (15-for-24, 160 yards) led the only two scoring drives and was able to push the ball downfield. He threw an interception, but it was a desperation throw in the final seconds. If there was any doubt about Petty's roster spot, it should be gone now. He did reasonably well for a guy who hasn't had many practice reps.\n\nWhen it was starters vs. starters, the Jets looked ...: Overmatched -- and that's being kind. The starting offense, which played the entire first half, managed only two first downs and 43 total yards. Running back Bilal Powell, in his preseason debut, got the ball on every play except one -- nine rushes, two catches. The defense allowed two long scoring drives, struggling with short passes. The Jets kept it vanilla from a scheme standpoint, which may have been a factor.\n\nOne reason to be concerned: The starting offensive line struggled in the running game for the second week in a row and it allowed pressure at times on Hackenberg. Maybe you can blame some of it on a lack of continuity, as they rotated at three positions -- left tackle (Kelvin Beachum and Ben Ijalana), right tackle (Brandon Shell and Brent Qvale) and center (Wesley Johnson and Jonotthan Harrison). OK, enough experimenting, it's time to settle on a starting line.\n\nRookie watch: Safety Jamal Adams has to clean up a couple of things in his game, especially his tackling technique. He missed an open-field tackle because he left his feet too soon. On another play, he was late picking up a receiver out of the flat. Hype notwithstanding, Adams isn't super human; he's experiencing growing pains like every other rookie. Wide receiver ArDarius Stewart made two catches in the second half.\n\nSecondary struggles: This looked like a replay of last season, except we can't blame it on Darrelle Revis. The Jets got picked apart by Matthew Stafford (understandable) and Jake Rudock (what?!). There were mistakes galore. Morris Claiborne allowed a few completions and used poor technique on a fade route, resulting in a 5-yard touchdown catch by Marvin Jones. Juston Burris dropped a would-be interception and missed a tackle. Cornerback will be an issue this season, count on it.\n\nLife after Lucky: Will the Jets ever find quality punt and kickoff returners? Without Lucky Whitehead (broken foot), they turned Frankie Hammond and Marcus Murphy. Let's see, Hammond muffed a punt and Murphy lost a fumble on a kickoff (he got bailed out by a Detroit penalty). General manager Mike Maccagnan needs to address this, pronto.\n\nThat guy could start: Cornerback Dexter McDougle won't crack the starting lineup, but he was one of the few bright spots and could push for playing time in sub packages.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T02:53:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7019608020782471, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374995", "time":

The New York Jets, on the other hand, are clearly on track to be one of the league's worst teams.\n\nThe Lions jumped out to a 13-0 lead in the first half and held on through a largely punch-less final two quarters, coming away with a 16-6 victory at Ford Field.\n\nWith the starting offense on the field for the first three series, the Lions scored twice. On the opening possession, quarterback Matthew Stafford completed both of his throws for 28 yards, but couldn't overcome an 11-yard loss on a sack, leading to a 37-yard Matt Prater field goal.\n\nAfter the teams traded punts, Stafford led the offense 73 yards in 11 plays, connecting with Marvin Jones for a 5-yard touchdown on a fade to the back corner of the end zone. Stafford was 6-for-7 on the drive with Jones catching three passes.\n\nStafford took a seat after the touchdown, finishing his night 8-for-10 for 84 yards and the score.\n\nBOX SCORE: Lions 16, Jets 6\n\nDetroit's top defensive unit was even more impressive in the early going, forcing the Jets to go three-and-out on their first three possessions. On the first, defensive end Cornelius Washington came unblocked off the right edge on third down, delivering a punishing hit to Jets quarterback Christian Hackerberg that jarred the ball free. The fumble was recovered by the Jets, leading to a punt.\n\nOn the next Jets possession, Lions cornerback Nevin Lawson knocked away a Hackenberg pass intended for Charone Peake. The deflection was nearly intercepted by safety Glover Quin.\n\nThe Jets finished the first half with two first downs and 43 yards of offense.\n\nThe Lions tacked on three more points before halftime when backup Jake Rudock marched the offense 87 yards on 16 plays, highlighted by a frozen rope into a tight window to rookie tight end Michael Roberts for a 22-yard gain. But the drive stalled due to blocking breakdowns on second and third down deep in Jets territory, leading to a 25-yard chip shot from Prater.\n\nWith backups taking over on both sides in the second half, the game ground to a halt.\n\nThe Lions went three-and-out to start the third quarter, but rookie tight end Robert Tonyan was able to recover a muffed punt, giving the offense the ball back at the Jets 25. The opportunity was squandered when Rudock threw an interception directly to Jets linebacker Corey Lemonier.\n\nThe teams continued to trade punts until the Jets offense finally found some success with backup quarterback Bryce Petty. He led a 74-yard drive deep into Lions territory, but a throw into the end zone was broken up by cornerback Jamal Agnew, leading to a 31-yard Ross Martin field goal.\n\nMartin would cut the lead to seven with a 28-yard field goal on the Jets' next possession, but the Lions were able to salt the game away with a 50-yard Prater boot with 4:19 remaining.\n\nThe game-sealing field goal was largely set up by a 43-yard Keshawn Martin kickoff return.\n\nLions safety Roland Milligan intercepted Petty in the end zone in the final minute to preserve the 16-6 margin.\n\njdrogers@detroitnews.com\n\ntwitter.com/justin_rogers\n\n23 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:06:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6627451181411743,

You're mighty optimistic, Noah. Here's the deal: No matter what happens over the next few months, Bowles is rebuilding and the focus will be on player development. What choice does does the Jets head coach have?\n\nExcept for the inevitable tinkering on cut-down day, the roster is set, and it screams, \"Rebuilding!\" The Jets charted their course in late February, when they started dumping veteran players. They can't turn back now. They have only four players over 30, including the long-snapper, so it's not as though they have a glut of older guys impeding the progress of young, promising players. Every young player with upside will have a role.\n\nAh, but there is one caveat: The quarterback position. That's where the issue of now versus the future likely will come up.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I asked Bowles if the quarterback decision will be based on which player gives the team the best chance to win.\n\n\"Always,\" he said matter-of-factly.\n\nThat's a slippery slope, because there probably will come a point where Bowles will have to turn to Christian Hackenberg even if he's not the \"best\" option. In other words, at what point does he look to the future at quarterback?\n\nA coach fighting for his job might wait longer than a coach with built-in security. A year ago, Bowles waited until the Jets were 3-9 before handing the keys to Bryce Petty. There's no way he can wait that long before turning to Hackenberg, assuming he doesn't win the job in the preseason.\n\nMaybe Hackenberg will make it a no-brainer by overtaking Josh McCown, who is hardly entrenched in the starting role. That would make it easier on everybody. If not, it'll be a dicey decision, because the downside to a win-first approach is the Jets might actually win a few, hurting their draft position.\n\nOwnership will evaluate Bowles after the season, deciding whether to part ways or extend him beyond 2018 (his final year) because a lame-duck situation wouldn't be good for anyone. Could Woody Johnson give him a contract extension now? It would be unusual, coming off a 5-11 season, but, hey, it's his money. It's not as though it counts against the salary cap. I suppose Johnson could make a verbal promise to retain Bowles beyond 2017, but ask Eric Mangini about Johnson's verbal promises.\n\nIn the end, if Bowles can get five to seven wins out of this team, he'll deserve a multi-year extension and a place in the Ring of Honor.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T11:19:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 327, "textStart": 312, "date": "2017-08-18", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.5333333611488342, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374995", "time": "11:19:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374995", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 3}, {"id": "306941", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "score": 4}, {"id": "310462", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Farm team"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_team", "score": 5}, {"id": "339167", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "score": 1}, {"id": "355959", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Woody Johnson"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Johnson", "score": 1}, {"id": "360558", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Todd Bowles"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Bowles", "score": 4}, {"id": "361834", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Christian Hackenberg"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Hackenberg", "score": 2}, {"id": "372336", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Josh McCown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_McCown", "score": 2}, {"id": "401985", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bryce Petty"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Petty", "score": 2}, {"id": "1294987", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "List of New York Jets head coaches"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_New_York_Jets_head_coaches", "score": 3}], "image": "http://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0818%2Fr246002_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "timeCrawl": "11:19:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Could more job security for Todd Bowles help the Jets rebuild?", "originalArticle": null}

Chris Pedota/NorthJersey.com\n\n1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nDETROIT -- When Christian Hackenberg buttoned up his chinstrap and ran into the huddle to start Saturday night's second preseason game, it was a surprise.\n\nAnyone who had been watching the Jets' quarterback competition believed that Josh McCown was the favorite to win the job. The expectation was that he'd start against the Detroit Lions. But Jets coach Todd Bowles decided to Hackenberg a real chance to win the job.\n\nAnd so we got a preview of what the Jets might look like with Hackenberg as the starting quarterback.\n\nThe results were not good.\n\nHackenberg never got the offense going and looked generally overwhelmed while playing the entire first half with the starting offense in a 16-6 loss to the Lions. He completed only 2-of-6 passes for 14 yards -- both passes were caught behind the line of scrimmage. He was sacked twice, losing 17 yards. He fumbled on one play.\n\nHackenberg was bad in every way possible. Hackenberg, the Jets' 2016 second-round pick, did not look ready.\n\nBut afterward, Bowles said it wasn't all the 22-year-old's fault. In Bowles' eyes, the offensive line wasn't good enough.\n\n\"He really didn't get a chance,\" Bowles said of Hackenberg. \"It's not a fair evaluation of the kid because he didn't get a chance on the couple pass plays he had and there was a lot of pressure on him.\"\n\nAnd though Hackenberg's lackluster performance seemed to lock up the starting job for McCown -- who did nothing more than hold a clipboard on Saturday night -- Bowles insisted that he's nowhere near ready to name a starting quarterback.\n\n\"Not at this point,\" Bowles said.\n\nHackenberg and the offensive line weren't the only ones to struggle Saturday night. The first-team defense got beaten up by the Lions and starting quarterback Matthew Stafford. The Jets fumbled a punt and missed a field goal.\n\nEverywhere you looked, bad things were happening to the Jets. But nothing was more discouraging than the offense under Hackenberg.\n\nIn the five drives led by Hackenberg, the Jets went three-and-out four times. They gained only 43 yards in the first half with Hackenberg on the field.\n\nThe big trouble started on the third play from scrimmage. There was a miscommunication at the line of scrimmage, allowing Lions defensive end Cornelius Washington a clear path at Hackenberg. Before Hackenberg could even react, Washington leveled him with a vicious tackle, forcing a fumble.\n\nThe Jets recovered, but the tone had been set.\n\n\"I don't know it happened too fast,\" Bowles said when asked who was at fault for the play. \"I just saw him getting hit.\"\n\nHackenberg didn't look comfortable for the rest of the night.\n\nOn his second drive, another three-and-out, Hackenberg was nearly intercepted after his pass went through the hands of receiver Charone Peake. The third drive was another three-and-out.\n\nThe Jets finally got a first down early in the second quarter, when Hackenberg scrambled 12 yards up the middle. It was his best play of a forgettable night. He then found running back Bilal Powell for his first completion of the game, a 17-yard gain on a screen pass that Powell caught behind the line of scrimmage.\n\nBut even that drive had a tough end for Hackenberg. The ball slipped out of his hand on third-and-8 for an ugly incompletion.\n\nFor the second straight game, the Jets didn't\" score a single point with Hackenberg on the field. But he said it wasn't all lost.\n\n\"Overall, it was a really good learning expereince,\" Hackenberg said. \"They're professionals over there and they did a great job game-planning us based on what we did last week.\"\n\nBryce Petty looked better in the second half, finishing 15-of-24 for 160 yards, but he also failed to get the Jets in the end zone for a touchdown. The Jets have not scored since their first drive of the preseason under McCown.\n\nThe offensive line didn't give the run game much room to operate, or Hackenberg much time to work. In a surprise, Jonotthan Harrison started at center instead of Wesley Johnson. Ben Ijalana and Brandon Shell started at the tackle positions alongside guards Brian Winters and James Carpenter.\n\nJohnson later worked in at center, and Kelvin Beachum and Brent Qvale later played at tackle -- a clear sign that those positions are all still up for grabs. But no matter who played, the results weren't very good.\n\nThe Jets starting defense also struggled. Stafford went 8-for-10 for 84 yards and a touchdown, leading a 78-yard scoring drive in the second quarter. But more concerning was Jake Ruddock's performance.\n\nThe 2016 sixth-round pick had no problems against the Jets' top defense, completing 6-of-8 passes for 67 yards.\n\nKicker Ross Martin missed wide left from 56 yards in the third quarter, but later made a 31-yarder and a 28-yarder to get the Lions on the board in the fourth quarter. Chandler Catanzaro, competing with Martin for the starting kicking job, missed his 55-yard attempt in Week 1 of the preseason. The battle remains tight.\n\nMeanwhile, the Jets competition for a kick/punt returner is not taking place at a high level.\n\nFrankie Hammond fumbled a punt, which the Lions recovered in the third quarter. Marcus Murphy fumbled during a kick return during the first half, but the play didn't count because of a penalty.\n\nThere is no clear favorite to win that job, but Murphy and Hammond certainly didn't help their causes.\n\nEmail: vasqueza@northjersey.com\n\n1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T04:02:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8549019694328308, "dateCrawl":

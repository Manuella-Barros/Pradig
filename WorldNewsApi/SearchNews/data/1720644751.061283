The Oilers have converted on 37.3% of their playoff power-play chances, a league best. What they\u2019re saying Oilers wing Connor Brown on the styles of play: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool to be in Edmonton where it\u2019s live-and-die hockey and then come down here where it\u2019s a little different down here in South Florida. They play an in-your-face style of game and they pressure and they play on their toes, and so do we, so it\u2019s going to make for some fun hockey.\u201d Oilers general manager Ken Holland: \u201cYou don\u2019t fluke this league. You need skill, and you need an engine and that engine of that group of players have got to drive your team on and off the ice.\u201d Panthers forward Sam Bennett: \u201cWe\u2019re ready this year. We have that bitter taste in our mouth still. Our mindset this year is completely different than last year. It was a little bit happy to be there, enjoying the experience. This year it\u2019s all business. We have one goal in mind, and we\u2019re not going to be satisfied until we accomplish that.\u201d Panthers wing Nick Cousins: \u201cYou have to find that fine line. We have to make sure that we\u2019re physical and clean and getting in on the forecheck because that\u2019s our DNA, that\u2019s our style of game.\u201d Oilers wing Evander Kane: \u201cThere\u2019s going to be some more nastiness. Both teams have some passionate players on each side. I think there\u2019s going to be some intangibles that guys have on both teams that are going to play out and maybe tip a team over in the right way and tip a team over in the wrong way.\u201d - Information from the AP was used in this post.", "summary": "The Edmonton Oilers and NHL MVP Connor McDavid will take on the Florida Panthers in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Finals tonight.

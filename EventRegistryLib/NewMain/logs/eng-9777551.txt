We know as gamers ourselves, this is an exciting way to engage through play with the GamesBeat content you have already come to love. Start playing games here.\n\nMicrosoft today released its earnings report for the fourth quarter of the 2024 fiscal year, which included details on how Xbox is performing. According to the company's financial reports, Xbox content and services revenue is up by 61%, which is largely due to the impact of the company's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The transaction completed in October 2023.\n\nIn addition to Xbox content, gaming revenue is up 44%, with 48 points of impact from the Activision acquisition; the 61% of growth also shows 58 points of impact from the same event. However, Xbox is down in areas that aren't impacted by the acquisition, namely hardware. According to Microsoft, Xbox's hardware revenue has dropped by 42% in Q4 FY24. Total revenue for the More Personal Computing segment (under which gaming and Xbox is nested) is at $15.9 billion, with operating income at $4.9 billion.\n\nThis follows a trend with the rest of Microsoft's recent earnings reports, at least with regards to Xbox -- in the previous quarter, Xbox hardware had fallen 31% while content and services revenue grew by 62% (with 61 points of net impact from Activision). Hardware saw a 3% uptick in Q2, but had also dropped by 7% in Q1 of FY24. This is likely not a Microsoft-only issue, as several of the recent Circana reports have shown overall hardware sales dropping by double digits.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella said during the company's earnings call that part of the growth was the increased visibility of Microsoft properties, citing the company's showcase during the Summer Game Fest and the debut of the Fallout TV show on Prime. CFO Amy Hood said that the 61% growth was slightly above expectations, and that the growth in first-party publishing offset slightly less impressive third-party sales. Hood also added that Microsoft expects growth in the mid-30s for gaming for the first quarter of FY2025.", "source": {"uri": "venturebeat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VentureBeat"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_kaser@venturebeat.com", "name": "Rachel Kaser", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VentureBeat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "VentureBeat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Xbox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Activision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision_Blizzard", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Activision Blizzard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Hood", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amy Hood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_call", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earnings call"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_developer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game developer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Console_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Console Platforms", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Conventions", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/xboxactivisionblizzard.png?w=1024?w=1200&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777551", "eventUri": "eng-9777551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

If you buy something through this post, the publisher may get a share of the sale.\n\nXbox hardware sales are way down again in Microsoft's Q4, while gaming content sales skyrocketed again thanks to the company's acquisition of Activision-Blizzard last year.\n\nThe company posted its earnings today, which included a report of hardware revenue down 42% year-over-year. Hardware sales saw a significant dip of 31% year-over-year last quarter as well, though sales were up slightly (3%) in Q2 thanks to a series of holiday discounts and promotions. But hardware was also down 7% prior to that in Q1, and yes, dropping steadily for several quarters prior to that too.\n\nFor what it's worth, Xbox is far from the only console maker seeing dips in hardware sales. Everyone's impacted, according to Circana's most recent report. Xbox, Sony, and Nintendo all say \"double-digit percentage declines\" in May of 2024, and the Switch saw the most significant drop. This is likely reflective of the fact that all three consoles are on the back halves of their life cycles, and is reflective of fairly normal, cyclical industry trends. Xbox has already confirmed that a \"next-gen\" console is in the works, and has expressed plans to share more information about hardware of some sort around the holiday season.\n\nGaming revenue overall appears to be doing more than fine in terms of year-on-year comparisons, even setting quarterly records. This is largely due to the boost offered by the acquisition of Activision Blizzard - it wasn't there to make money for the company last year, now it is, so the numbers have gone up. Gaming revenue was up 44% year-over-year, but with 48 points of net impact from the acquisition, this indicates that Xbox's not-Activision-Blizzard-related business isn't doing quiiiiite as well as it was last year. Xbox content and services revenue faired better, up 61% year-over-year, with 58 points of net impact from the acquisition.\n\nOverall, Microsoft's More Personal Computing division (which includes Xbox as well as other segments such as Windows) brought in $15.9 billion in revenue, up 14% year-over-year.

Credit: EconoTimes\n\nMicrosoft reported a 15% revenue increase to $64.7 billion in Q4, driven by solid cloud performance. Despite this growth, Xbox and Surface revenue continued to decline, highlighting the tech giant's mixed results.\n\nMicrosoft Q4 Revenue Hits $64.7 Billion, Driven by Cloud Growth; Xbox and Surface Sales Decline\n\nMicrosoft has recently disclosed its fiscal 2024 financial results for the fourth and final quarter. According to The Verge, during the fourth quarter, the software manufacturer generated $64.7 billion in revenue and a net income of $22 billion. Revenue has increased by 15%, while net income has increased by 10%.\n\nMicrosoft's Intelligent Cloud revenues, encompassing the company's server products and cloud services, were $28.5 billion, representing a 19 percent increase from the previous year. Nearly 45 percent of Microsoft's revenue is now from this company segment. Microsoft's consumer devices initiative continues to experience a decline even though cloud revenue is once again robust. The income of Xbox hardware has once again decreased, and Surface revenue has now declined for seven consecutive quarters.\n\nThe price manufacturers pay to license Windows for laptops and PCs, known as Windows OEM revenue, has increased by 4% yearly. Gartner reported earlier this month that PC shipments had risen for three consecutive quarters. This growth was also observed in Microsoft's Windows OEM over the same three quarters.\n\nMicrosoft also introduced its new Copilot Plus PCs after fiscal Q4, with a diverse selection of Qualcomm-powered devices available from June 18 onward. Microsoft introduced two new Surface devices in June: The Surface Laptop 7th Edition and Surface Pro 11th Edition. However, the extent of the sales' influence on device revenue will be apparent in the subsequent quarter.\n\nThis implies that Surface revenue, which Microsoft now calls \"devices revenue,\" has declined by 11 percent this quarter. Microsoft's Surface revenue experienced its most recent increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, which concluded on September 30, 2022.\n\nMicrosoft altered its hardware portfolio in early 2023 in response to reductions, and the Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 for businesses have had minimal revenue impact. All eyes are on the upcoming quarter to determine whether the new Surface Laptop and Surface Pro introductions have contributed to the recovery of device revenue.\n\nAccording to Amy Hood, Microsoft's Chief Financial Officer, the company's device revenue will continue to decline in the upcoming quarter, with a decline in the low to mid-single digits. Hood anticipates that the revenue generated by Windows OEMs will remain relatively consistent in the forthcoming quarter by the PC market.\n\nXbox Content and Services Revenue Soars 61% Driven by Activision Blizzard, Despite Hardware Decline\n\nThis quarter, Xbox content and services revenue, encompassing Xbox Game Pass, has increased by 61%. Activision Blizzard revenues have once again been the primary source of revenue in this instance, with a net impact of 58 points. Xbox content and services revenue will have increased by 3% year over year, even in the absence of Activision Blizzard revenues.\n\nIn February, Microsoft disclosed that Xbox Game Pass has expanded to 34 million subscribers, which includes Xbox Game Pass Core (previously known as Xbox Live Gold) members. Microsoft is preparing to introduce a new Xbox Game Pass Standard plan shortly. This plan is intended to supplant the Xbox Game Pass as a Console offering for new subscribers.\n\nMicrosoft recently released Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III on Xbox Game Pass and is preparing to make Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, the upcoming installment in Activision's popular franchise, available on Xbox Game Pass later this year.\n\nThe price increases for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass will take effect in September. Game Pass Ultimate will be priced at $19.99 monthly, a $3 increase from the current $16.99 monthly. In September, PC Game Pass will also increase to $11.99 monthly.\n\nDespite the significant anticipation surrounding the release of new titles on Xbox Game Pass, console sales continue to be a challenge. Xbox hardware revenue has experienced a substantial decline of 42% this quarter. Later this year, Microsoft will introduce a disc-less Xbox Series X console in white and a new Galaxy Black special edition Xbox Series X unit.\n\nIn recent months, Microsoft has also prioritized the message that \"no Xbox required\" in its cloud streaming initiatives. As Microsoft shifts its focus from solely marketing console hardware, the Xbox TV app has recently been available on select Amazon Fire TV devices.\n\nMicrosoft's gaming revenue has increased by 44% despite the subpar Xbox hardware revenue, which was once again bolstered by the additional revenue from Activision Blizzard. Indeed, that revenue increased by 48 points, resulting in a 4% decrease in Microsoft's overall gaming revenue if the company had not acquired Activision Blizzard.\n\nMicrosoft will not be providing any updates to its Xbox Game Pass subscriber statistics this quarter. However, the company did disclose a metric regarding active gaming users. During an earnings call, Satya Nadella, Microsoft's CEO, stated that the company has surpassed 500 million monthly active consumers across platforms and devices. \"Our content pipeline has never been more robust.\"\n\nMicrosoft Projects Strong Growth in Xbox Content, Cloud, and AI Revenues Despite Hardware Declines\n\nAccording to Hood, Microsoft anticipates that Xbox content and services revenue will increase in the \"low to mid-50s\" during the upcoming quarter. Activision Blizzard will contribute 40 points to the overall gaming revenue increase in the mid-30s. Hood asserts that Xbox hardware revenue will \"again experience a year-over-year decline.\"\n\nAs anticipated, Microsoft's cloud and Office revenues continued to expand in Q4 2024. The income of Office commercial products and cloud services increased by 12 percent, with Office 365 commercial revenue rising by 13 percent.\n\nOffice consumer revenue has increased by three percent year over year. Microsoft 365's consumer subscribers increased by 10 percent, reaching 82.5 million. This quarter, LinkedIn's revenue also increased by 10 percent.\n\nAzure and other cloud services revenue increased 29% this quarter, while server products and cloud services revenue increased 21%. Nevertheless, Microsoft's stock experienced a decline in after-hours trading on the NASDAQ, as analysts had anticipated a higher level of Azure revenue.\n\nAdditionally, investors persist in pursuing any indications of revenue growth in AI from Microsoft. This quarter, AI services account for eight points of the revenue growth in Azure and other cloud services, a modest increase from the previous quarter's contribution.\n\nAccording to Hood, AI growth is surpassing Azure's total revenue.

This follows the company's previous quarterly results where sales dropped 31% over last year.\n\nThese results are especially bleak considering it's only been four years since the Xbox Series X/S launched. For context, sales of the Nintendo Switch, seven years into its lifecycle, recorded a drop of only 12.6% year-over-year in Nintendo's latest financial report.\n\nElsewhere in Microsoft's financials, the acquisition of Activision Blizzard has helped to paper over the cracks. Xbox content and services revenue, which includes Game Pass, was up by 61% over the previous year, but Activision Blizzard contributed 58 points of net impact to this number, so it only went up by 3% if you remove that from the equation.\n\nIt's a similar picture in terms of gaming revenue, which went up by 44% overall. Without the acquisition of Activision Blizzard however, which contributed 48 points of net impact, Microsoft gaming revenue would have been down 4%.\n\nWhile Microsoft didn't reveal specifics in terms of Game Pass subscriber numbers, it did highlight a statistic around monthly active users across platforms - which now includes Amazon Fire TV sticks.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella, said: 'We now have over 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices. Our content pipeline has never been stronger.'\n\nAlong with highlighting the Fallout TV show, which apparently caused hours played for Fallout on Game Pass to increase 'nearly five times', Microsoft specifically mentioned Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 as a reason for optimism, which will launch on the subscription service day one on October 25, 2024.\n\nCall Of Duty: Black Ops 6 will undoubtedly be a significant boon in terms of financials, as one of the biggest franchise's on the planet, but it's another case where the acquisition of Activision Blizzard - which cost Microsoft $69 billion - is propping up shortcomings elsewhere.\n\nEarlier this month, Xbox announced plans to increase prices across all Game Pass tiers, which will come into effect from September 12. Microsoft is also launching a new white, discless version of the Xbox Series X, alongside a 2TB black version, later this year.\n\nIt's unlikely that these new consoles will have any significant impact on hardware sales numbers though, especially as Microsoft continues to push its multi-platform strategy and tease its next generation plans.\n\nLast month, Xbox boss Phil Spencer stated that the company is working on a handheld device, following the success of the Switch and Steam Deck.\n\nEmail gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, follow us on Twitter, and sign-up to our newsletter.\n\nTo submit Inbox letters and Reader's Features more easily, without the need to send an email, just use our Submit Stuff page here.", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_starkey@metro.co.uk", "name": "Adam Starkey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision_Blizzard", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Activision Blizzard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Game_Pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Game Pass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_users", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Active users"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo Switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Black_Ops", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Call of Duty: Black Ops"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Fire_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Fire TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_Deck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steam Deck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boss (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cross-platform software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Spencer_(business_executive)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Spencer (business executive)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(British_newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metro (British newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Puzzle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Puzzle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Software", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Educational", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SEI_215065354-dfe8.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C43px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777551", "eventUri": "eng-9777551", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-12", "textStart": 2500, "textEnd": 2512}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

The results for the quarter ending June 30, 2024, Microsoft reported a huge 44% increase in gaming-related revenue compared to the previous year. Out of this 44% increase, 48% is because of Activision Blizzard, which means without the acquisition, Xbox's financial results would have been sitting on a decrease in gaming revenue of 4%.\n\nComing to the hardware side of things, Xbox continues to struggle with a drop in sales by 42% year-over-year. However, revenue from Xbox content and services, which encompasses Game Pass, surged by 61% this quarter, with Activision Blizzard contributing 58% to this growth. You will start to notice a trend here.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella said during an earnings call after the release of the financial results and said that the gaming division now has over 500 million monthly active users across all platforms.\n\nThe company has made a major switch by not prioritizing hardware sales anymore and focusing on getting more people to subscribe to Xbox Game Pass. One of the solutions to this problem was introducing an Xbox app on Amazon Fire TV sticks and being able to stream games without even owning an Xbox. Apart from that, Xbox has also introduced a new Standard tier for Game Pass that does not have any day-one releases. There have also been rumors about other tiers coming to the subscription service in the near future.\n\nNadela also said that the company has 30 major titles coming this quarter and 18 of them, including Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, will be joining the Game Pass library as day-one releases.

This is expected to see growth \"in the low to mid-50s\" in the next quarter, again thanks to the Activision acquisition.\n\nIn fact, the Activision acquisition drove gaming's growth far beyond any other More Personal Computing segment, with the next largest growth being the 19% for search and news advertising.\n\nTotal revenue for More Personal Computing was up 14% year-on-year to $15.9 billion.\n\nXbox hardware revenue declined 42% year-on-year. Microsoft's chief financial officer Amy Hood told investors during the earnings call that this is expected to decline again in the next quarter (three months ended September 30, 2024).\n\nHood also added that first-party games content saw a stronger-than-expected performance, although this was partially offset by the performance of third-party content (and, again, Activision games are no longer third-party).\n\nElsewhere in the earnings call, CEO Satya Nadella said Xbox has 500 million monthly active users across all platforms and devices, and that the platform holder's upcoming release slate \"has never been stronger\" following its June showcase.\n\nXbox only had one new software during the last quarter - Ninja Theory's Hellblade 2: Senua's Saga - but Nadella highlighted successes in other fields, such as the Fallout TV show, which stands as the second most watched Amazon Prime Video series of all time and boosted the number of hours played for Fallout titles on Game Pass fivefold.\n\nMicrosoft also reported its full-year results with total revenue up 16% to $245.1 billion.

This represents a 15 percent year-over-year increase in revenue and a 10 percent rise in net income.\n\nThe Intelligent Cloud division, which comprises server products and cloud services, saw a revenue increase to $28.5 billion, a 19 percent growth from the previous year. This segment now accounts for nearly 45 percent of Microsoft's overall revenue.\n\nHowever, the company continues to face difficulties in its consumer hardware division. Xbox hardware revenue has fallen, and Surface revenue has declined for the seventh quarter in a row.\n\nWindows OEM revenue and the licensing fee from manufacturers increased by 4 percent year over year, which is in line with Gartner's report of rising PC shipments for three consecutive quarters. Microsoft unveiled new Copilot+ PCs, the Surface Laptop 7th Edition and Surface Pro 11th Edition, late in Q4, and their full impact on revenue will be more apparent next quarter.\n\nDevices revenue, formerly known as Surface revenue, dropped by 11 percent this quarter. The last uptick in Surface revenue was in Q1 FY23. Despite a hardware reorganization and introducing the Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 for businesses, revenue hasn't seen significant changes. CFO Amy Hood predicts a further decline in devices revenue next quarter but expects Windows OEM revenue to remain stable.\n\nXbox content and services revenue, which includes subscription services like Xbox Game Pass, increased by 61 percent this quarter. Activision Blizzard revenues played a major role here, accounting for 58 points of net impact. Without Activision Blizzard's contribution, Microsoft's content and services revenue would still have risen by 3 percent year over year.\n\nXbox Game Pass currently has 34 million subscribers, inclusive of Xbox Game Pass Core members. The company is set to introduce a new Xbox Game Pass Standard plan, replacing the Console version. Upcoming additions to the service include \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III\" and \"Call of Duty: Black Ops 6\". Price adjustments for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass will commence in September, with Ultimate going up to $19.99 per month and PC Game Pass to $11.99 per month.\n\nDespite new game additions, Xbox hardware revenue fell by 42 percent this quarter. Microsoft plans to release a discless model of the Xbox Series X in white and a Galaxy Black special edition later this year. The company is promoting its cloud streaming service, with no console required, and the Xbox TV app is now available on some Amazon Fire TV devices. Overall, gaming revenue rose by 44 percent due to Activision Blizzard. Without this acquisition, gaming revenue would have dropped by 4 percent.\n\nMicrosoft's Office and cloud services continue to thrive. Office commercial products and cloud services saw a 12 percent increase, and Office 365 commercial revenue rose by 13 percent. On the consumer front, Office revenue grew by 3 percent year over year, and Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers increased by 10 percent, reaching 82.5 million. LinkedIn revenue also increased by 10 percent this quarter.\n\nRevenue from server products and cloud services grew by 21 percent, with Azure and other cloud services seeing a 29 percent rise. However, stock prices fell after hours on NASDAQ as analysts had anticipated higher Azure revenue.\n\nInvestors are closely monitoring revenue growth stemming from AI. AI services contributed eight points to the growth of Azure and other cloud services, slightly up from the previous quarter. Hood mentioned that AI is growing faster than total Azure revenue and anticipates further Azure growth in the latter half of fiscal 2025, driven by infrastructure investments and increased demand. For Q1 2025, Hood projects Azure revenue to grow by 28-29 percent.\n\nMicrosoft is granting employees a one-time cash award, ranging from 10-25 percent of their usual yearly bonus, as mentioned in an internal memo.", "source": {"uri": "winbuzzer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WinBuzzer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "markus_kasanmascheff@winbuzzer.com", "name": "Markus Kasanmascheff", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Game_Pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Game Pass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Original equipment manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision_Blizzard", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Activision Blizzard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gartner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Hood", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amy Hood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Black_Ops", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Call of Duty: Black Ops"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Call of Duty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscription_business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subscription business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_365", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft 365"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Fire_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Fire TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Tax_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Tax Preparation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://winbuzzer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/microsoft-campus-building-official.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777551", "eventUri": "eng-9777551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

This is good news overall for investors, but if we look at the results of the gaming division, Xbox, the result is a bittersweet victory.\n\nBetween March and June 2024, the gaming division achieved a 44% increase in year-on-year profit, where the net impact of the Activision Blizzard King acquisition is 48 points. This means that, in the absence of the acquisition, profit would have fallen by 4%.\n\nOverall, Xbox achieved a total FY profit of 61%, where the net impact of the ABK acquisition is 58 points. Much of this momentum comes from Game Pass, which reached 500 million monthly active users, according to a Q&A with Natya Sandella following the report presentation (thank you, VGC). Next year we will no doubt see how users and markets respond to the implementation of the service's new pricing and subscription tiers.\n\nWhat worries us about these results is the alarming drop in hardware. Xbox consoles produced 42% less than in FY2023, and one possible reading for this is that Microsoft will put its future efforts into cloud gaming, and slowly but surely its position as a manufacturer will decline further. If we compare the current X Series momentum to the same period for Xbox One sales, sales are down 13%, according to Circana's US market data.\n\nDespite these figures, the company's next hardware is planned to be unveiled this year, whether it is a portable model, as rumours claim, or the unveiling of the next generation of home consoles.\n\nWhat do you think about this, and do you think Microsoft's console policy with Xbox will change any time soon?", "source": {"uri": "gamereactor.eu", "dataType": "news", "title": "GameReactor"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alberto_garrido@gamereactor.eu", "name": "Alberto Garrido", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision_Blizzard", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Activision Blizzard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamer_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gamer Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Game_Pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Game Pass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_gaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud gaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox One"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Puzzle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Puzzle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Educational", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.gamereactor.eu/media/95/perfectdark_4249573b.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777551", "eventUri": "eng-9777551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

That's down further on the 31 percent fall reported back in April this year, for the quarter before.\n\nMicrosoft's gaming revenue overall was up overall by 44 percent, thanks to a significant boost from the addition of Activision Blizzard, which Microsoft bought for $68.7bn before its latest round of layoffs. Without Activision, growth would have sat around three percent.\n\nAll of the big three consoles are seeing sales drop. Xbox Series X/S will pass its fourth anniversary this November, and it's expected Microsoft will launch refreshed models of its console range around the same time.

Nintendo, meanwhile, will unveil Switch 2 before next April.\n\nBut Microsoft suggested it knows it must do more than simply launch new consoles to continue growing its gaming sector.\n\nSpeaking to investors, Microsoft boss Satya Nadella said the company's strategy so far had been to build up content pipelines for players on Xbox consoles. Next, it wanted to ensure this content was being delivered wherever people play games, such as on PC, smartphone and cloud - such as the recent addition of Xbox to Amazon Fire TV.\n\n\"The real goal here is to take a broad set of content to more users in more places, and build something that looks more like, to us, a software annuity and subscription business with enhanced transactions and the ownership of IP which is quite valuable long-term,\" Microsoft exec Amy Hood said. \"We're encouraged by the progress and how we're making progress with Game Pass.\"\n\nOn a rosier note, Nadella painted the results as a picture of overall growth, and pointed to a strong pipeline of game launches over the next year including Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 in October.\n\nNadella also noted the impact of Amazon's Fallout TV series on Bethesda's back catalogue of Fallout RPGs, available to play on Xbox Game Pass. \"Hours played on Game Pass for the Fallout franchise increased nearly five times quarter-over-quarter,\" Nadella revealed - lining up with the boost noted by Fallout boss Todd Howard back in May.", "source": {"uri": "eurogamer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eurogamer.net"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision_Blizzard", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Activision Blizzard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Activision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo Switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xbox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boss (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Howard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Todd Howard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Black_Ops", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Call of Duty: Black Ops"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Fire_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Fire TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Game_Pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Game Pass"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Puzzle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Puzzle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Software", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Educational", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Untitled-1_4YYolkc.jpg?width=1200&height=600&fit=crop&enable=upscale&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777551", "eventUri": "eng-9777551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

This is 15% more than the $56.2 billion they made at the same time last year.\n\nAnd their net income? That went up to $22 billion, a 10% increase from the previous year's $20.1 billion. Both numbers show Microsoft's strong performance and exceed the expectations set by financial analysts.\n\nHowever, not everything was perfect. Even with these prominent figures, Microsoft's stock suddenly dropped, dropping more than 5% in after-hours trade. The reason for this downturn was pointed towards the firm's cloud services like Azure; they grew by 29% but didn't meet the 31% growth that analysts predicted. It is a reminder that even tiny misses can result in significant reactions in the severe game of tech.\n\nBut we shouldn't just focus on the downsides. According to the official announcement, the company's Productivity and Business Processes divisions, which sell office software, saw revenue rise by 11% to $20.3 billion.\n\nThe More Personal Computing division covers Windows, devices, and gaming and was not far off, increasing at 14%, up to $15.9 billion.\n\nAnother point to mention was the Xbox revenue, which saw a significant boost of 61% due to the purchase of Activision Blizzard. Nevertheless, it was not entirely positive news because device income decreased by 11%.\n\nWhat do the results of the 2024 Q4 fiscal year mean for Microsoft? The company is still experiencing strong growth, especially in cloud computing and gaming. Yet, the small cloud revenue growth miss and the subsequent drop in stock price remind us that even tech giants have difficulties keeping up their pace and meeting market expectations.\n\nIn the future, Microsoft's introduction of its consumer Surface Laptop 7 and Surface Pro 11 PCs might change the situation even more. Will these fresh gadgets help compensate for the decrease in device earnings? We can only wait and see, but one fact is particular: Microsoft continues to be an essential part of the technology business, and its actions are always interesting to observe.", "source": {"uri": "windowsreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Windows Report | Error-free Tech Life"}, "authors": [{"uri": "flavius_floare@windowsreport.com", "name": "Flavius Floare", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Productivity software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision_Blizzard", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Activision Blizzard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://cdn.windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/400-million-2024-07-31T103134.640.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777551", "eventUri": "eng-9777551", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, the figures showed that Microsoft's gaming revenue is up by 44% compared to the same period last year, while revenue from Xbox content and services is up 61% compared to the same financial quarter from the previous financial year.\n\nIn an investor's call following the report, Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood was asked how investors should think about the growth of Microsoft's gaming business. \"I do think the real goal here is to be able to take a broad set of content to more users in more places, and really build what looks like more to us, the software annuity and subscription business,\" Hood responded.\n\nThat's a long way of Hood saying that Microsoft wants Xbox to focus more on the subscription side of the business, like Xbox Game Pass, in order to get its IPs in front of more people. \"It can be monetized in multiple ways,\" Hood said of Xbox's IPs, adding \"I think we're really encouraged by some of the progress and how we're making progress with Game Pass.\"\n\nAgain, that's a long way of saying that Microsoft is broadly pleased with how Xbox Game Pass is panning out for its business. It's not really a surprise to hear that Microsoft is betting big with Xbox Game Pass growth after Xbox's decision to launch Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 via the subscription service on day one later this year on October 25.", "source": {"uri": "gamesradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "gamesradar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hirun_cryer@gamesradar.com", "name": "Hirun Cryer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamer_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gamer Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Game_Pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Game Pass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Hood", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amy Hood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_call", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earnings call"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_annuity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life annuity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panning_(camera)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Panning (camera)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Black_Ops", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Call of Duty: Black Ops"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscription_business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subscription business model"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Puzzle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Puzzle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Software", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Educational", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iiAKtDxQg74PTGwpG3RDUA-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777551", "eventUri": "eng-9777551", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-25", "textStart": 1602, "textEnd": 1612}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 460121677, "relevance": 2}

That company contributed 58 per cent of this growth. Microsoft told investors that its first-party line-up boasted a \"stronger-than-expected-performance\" that helped offset its third-party business.\n\nHardware continues to disappoint for Xbox; this was down 42 per cent year-on-year.\n\nMeanwhile, the company claims that it has over 500 million monthly active users across its games platform.\n\nSpeaking to investors, CEO Satya Nadella was asked about the company's investment in games, including its acquisition of Activision Blizzard\n\n\"For us, our investment in gaming fundamentally was to have, I would say, the right portfolio of both what we love about gaming and always have loved about gaming, which is Xbox and the content for the console and expand from there so that we have content for everywhere people play games, starting with the PC,\" Nadella said.\n\n\"So when I think about the Activision portfolio, it comes with great assets for us to cover both the PC and the console. And then, of course, assets to cover mobile markets, which we never have. So we feel that now we have both the content and the ability to access all the traditional high scale platforms where people play games, which is the console, PC and mobile.\n\n\"But we're also excited about these new markets, right? I mean the fact that even in this last quarter, we expanded X Cloud to Amazon TV, I forget the name of what it's called. But that's the type of new access that really helps us a lot, get reach new gamers or the same gamer everywhere they want to play. And that ultimately will show up in that software plus services and transaction revenue for us, which is really our long-term KPI, and that's what we're building towards. And that was strategy behind Activision as an asset.

It's been a really cool past 12 months playing international cricket. I've learned a lot and the hunger is definitely there to keep improving and giving to the BLACKCAPS,\" said Ravindra.\n\n\"It's such a special group to be in, from players to support staff - and that's been the most enjoyable part, to be honest. Playing a game you love with your mates for a living is something very special, and I hold it close to my heart,\" he added.\n\nLeft-arm spinner Ajaz Patel added to the 20-player contract list after missing out during the previous cycle.\n\nPatel, contracted previously in the 2020-21 and 2022-23 seasons, received his offer ahead of a busy red ball schedule, including upcoming overseas Tests against Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, and India, and a three match home series against England.\n\nRachin will be joined by team-mate Ben Sears, Will O'Rourke and Otago's Jacob Duffy, should they accept their offers, as new faces on a proposed annual International Playing Contract list.\n\nSears, who played alongside Ravindra at the 2016 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup, featured in 11 T20Is for the Blackcaps during the 2023-24 season, claiming 13 wickets at an average of 22.\n\nHe made his Test debut against Australia at Hagley Oval in March, claiming four for 90 in the second innings. The 26-year-old pace-bowler was also included as a travelling reserve in the New Zealand squad for the ICC T20 World Cup in the West Indies and USA.\n\nMeanwhile, O'Rourke's contract offer came after a 12-month period in which he made his international debut in all three formats.\n\nOf the players contracted in the previous year, Kane Williamson, Lockie Ferguson and Adam Milne made themselves unavailable for a contract for the coming season.\n\nWilliamson has been offered a 'casual playing contract' by NZC for the 2024-25 season after reaffirming his commitment to the BlackCaps for the coming home summer, in which he is set to feature outside the January window.\n\nNeil Wagner will not appear on the central contract list for the first time since 2013 after retiring from international cricket in February, while Central Stags bowler Blair Tickner has not been offered a central contract offer for the upcoming year.\n\nPlayers offered central contracts for 2024-25: Finn Allen, Tom Blundell, Michael Bracewell, Mark Chapman, Devon Conway, Jacob Duffy, Matt Henry, Kyle Jamieson, Tom Latham, Daryl Mitchell, Henry Nicholls, Will O'Rourke, Ajaz Patel, Glenn Phillips,

It's been a really cool past 12 months playing international cricket. I've learned a lot and the hunger is definitely there to keep improving and giving to the Black Caps,\" Ravindra said upon receiving his offer as quoted by ICC.\n\n\"It's such a special group to be in, from players to support staff - and that's been the most enjoyable part, to be honest. Playing a game you love with your mates for a living is something very special, and I hold it close to my heart,\" the opener added.\n\nSears enters the central contract group after featuring in 11 T20Is for the Black Caps in the last 12 months, claiming 13 wickets. He then made a Test debut against Australia in March, before travelling as a reserve in New Zealand's recent T20 World Cup campaign.\n\nO'Rourke made his first international appearances in all three formats across the last year, standing out in his first Test with match figures of 9/93 - the best match figures by a New Zealand man on debut. Duffy earns his contract after taking part in 20 white ball matches for his country, while Patel earns his recall ahead of a busy Test period for New Zealand, in which the Black Caps take on Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and England.\n\nNew Zealand selector Sam Wells congratulated the 20-strong group.\n\n\"It's especially exciting for Ben, Jacob, Rachin and Will to receive their first contract offers, and well deserved following their hard work and performances. These younger guys are the future of the team and it's been encouraging to see their progress on the international stage. We're producing international-ready Black Caps and we're pleased with the current depth,\" said Wells.\n\nOf the contracted players of the previous year, Kane Williamson, Lockie Ferguson and Adam Milne have made themselves unavailable for a contract for the coming season.\n\nWilliamson, who stepped down as New Zealand's white-ball skipper after their T20 World Cup campaign, has been offered a casual playing contract for the 2024-25 season after reaffirming his commitment to the team.\n\nBlair Tickner also missed out on a central contract, with the retiring Neil Wagner also off the list.\n\nOffered New Zealand contracts for 2024/2025: Finn Allen, Tom Blundell, Michael Bracewell, Mark Chapman, Devon Conway, Jacob Duffy, Matt Henry, Kyle Jamieson, Tom Latham, Daryl Mitchell, Henry Nicholls, Will O'Rourke, Ajaz Patel, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Mitchell Santner, Ben Sears, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee, Will Young.

Ravindra shone at the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 in India, finishing as the competition's fourth leading run-scorer with 578 runs, before returning home to star in the Test and T20I summer. His rise was rewarded in January when he was named the ICC Emerging Player of the Year for 2023, and in March when he became the youngest recipient of the Sir Richard Hadlee Medal at the ANZ New Zealand Cricket Awards.

Sears, who played alongside Ravindra at the 2016 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup, featured in 11 T20Is for the Blackcaps during the 2023-24 season, claiming 13 wickets at an average of 22.\n\nHe made his Test debut against Australia at Hagley Oval in March, claiming four for 90 in the second innings. The 26-year-old pace-bowler was also included as a travelling reserve in the New Zealand squad for the ICC T20 World Cup in the West Indies and USA.\n\nMeanwhile, O'Rourke's contract offer came after a 12-month period in which he made his international debut in all three formats.

It's surreal to be part of it now,' Ravindra remarked upon receiving his offer from ICC.\n\nBen Sears joins the central contract list following 11 T20I appearances for the Black Caps in the past year, wherein he claimed 13 wickets and made his Test debut against Australia in March. Will O'Rourke made his debut in all three formats with commendable figures in his first Test match. Jacob Duffy and Ajaz Patel have been rewarded for their performances in white-ball and red-ball formats, respectively.\n\nNew Zealand selector Sam Wells congratulated the 20 players on their contract offers, highlighting the promising future this young talent brings to the team. Of note, veterans like Kane Williamson, Lockie Ferguson, and Adam Milne are not on the list as they made themselves unavailable for the upcoming season.\n\nWilliamson, who stepped down as white-ball captain after the T20 World Cup, has been offered a casual playing contract for 2024/2025. Meanwhile, Blair Tickner and the retired Neil Wagner are also absent from this year's central contract list.\n\nThe confirmed 2024/2025 contract recipients include Finn Allen, Tom Blundell, Michael Bracewell, Mark Chapman, Devon Conway, Jacob Duffy, Matt Henry, Kyle Jamieson, Tom Latham, Daryl Mitchell, Henry Nicholls, Will O'Rourke, Ajaz Patel, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Mitchell Santner, Ben Sears, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee, and Will Young.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Playing a game you love with your mates for a living is something very special, and I hold it close to my heart,\" he added.\n\nLeft-arm spinner Ajaz Patel added to the 20-player contract list after missing out during the previous cycle.\n\nPatel, contracted previously in the 2020-21 and 2022-23 seasons, received his offer ahead of a busy red ball schedule, including upcoming overseas Tests against Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, and India, and a three match home series against England.\n\nRachin will be joined by team-mate Ben Sears, Will O'Rourke and Otago's Jacob Duffy, should they accept their offers, as new faces on a proposed annual International Playing Contract list.\n\nSears, who played alongside Ravindra at the 2016 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup, featured in 11 T20Is for the Blackcaps during the 2023-24 season, claiming 13 wickets at an average of 22.\n\nHe made his Test debut against Australia at Hagley Oval in March, claiming four for 90 in the second innings. The 26-year-old pace-bowler was also included as a travelling reserve in the New Zealand squad for the ICC T20 World Cup in the West Indies and USA.\n\nMeanwhile, O'Rourke's contract offer came after a 12-month period in which he made his international debut in all three formats.\n\nOf the players contracted in the previous year, Kane Williamson, Lockie Ferguson and Adam Milne made themselves unavailable for a contract for the coming season.\n\nWilliamson has been offered a 'casual playing contract' by NZC for the 2024-25 season after reaffirming his commitment to the BlackCaps for the coming home summer, in which he is set to feature outside the January window.\n\nNeil Wagner will not appear on the central contract list for the first time since 2013 after retiring from

A 20-player contract list also sees offers for Ravindra's Wellington teammate Ben Sears, Canterbury's Will O'Rourke and Otago's Jacob Duffy. Left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel was also added to the list after missing out on a contract during the previous calendar year.\n\nRavindra's inclusion was not a surprise after he emerged as the breakout star of the ODI World Cup in India, where he scored 578 runs. The 24-year-old then made his mark on the Test circuit by scoring 240 at Mount Maunganui against South Africa in February - the highest maiden Test century by a New Zealand batter. He also broke into the country's T20I squad and his rise was rewarded when he was named the ICC Emerging Player of the Year for 2023, and later became the youngest recipient of the Sir Richard Hadlee Medal at the New Zealand Cricket Awards.\n\n\"Growing up you'd see those contract lists come out each year and think it would be cool to be on that list one day - and for it to eventuate now is a pinch-myself moment,\" Ravindra was quoted as saying in an NZC release. \"It's been a really cool past 12 months playing international cricket.

Playing a game you love with your mates for a living is something very special, and I hold it close to my heart.\"\n\nMeanwhile, O'Rourke's contract offer came after a 12-month period in which he represented New Zealand in all three forms of the game. Sears, on the other hand, played 11 T20Is in the previous cycle before making his Test debut against Australia in Christchurch earlier this year.\n\nNotable absentees in the list include Kane Williamson, Lockie Ferguson and Adam Milne. While the former two had previously excused themselves from a central contract, Milne also made himself unavailable for the coming season. Neil Wagner was left out after retiring from international cricket in February.\n\nPlayers offered central contracts for 2024-25: Finn Allen, Tom Blundell, Michael Bracewell, Mark Chapman, Devon

It's such a special group to be in, from players to support staff -- and that's been the most enjoyable part, to be honest,\" he added.\n\nBesides Ravindra, three more new faces -- Ben Sears, Will O'Rourke and Jacob Duffy -- figure in the list of 20 players offered contracts by NZC.\n\n\"Playing a game you love with your mates for a living is something very special, and I hold it close to my heart,\" added Ravindra.\n\nIn seven Test matches, Ravindra has amassed 519 runs -- including a century -- while in 25 ODI matches, he has three tons of runs scored.\n\nSears participated in 11 Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is) for New Zealand in the 2023-24 season, taking 13 wickets at an average of 22, and was partnered with Ravindra at the 2016 ICC Under-19 World Cup.\n\nIn addition, the pacer traveled as a reserve for the New Zealand team that played in the USA and the West Indies for the recently finished T20 World Cup.\n\nWhile right-arm quick Duffy, 29, has represented New Zealand in 14 T20Is, 6 ODIs, and most recently, the drawn T20I series against Pakistan in April, pacer O'Rourke, who made his debut in all three formats in the last year, has played three ODIs, three T20Is, and two Tests.\n\nPlayers offered central contracts for 2024-25: Finn Allen, Tom Blundell, Michael Bracewell, Mark Chapman, Devon Conway, Jacob Duffy, Matt Henry, Kyle Jamieson, Tom Latham, Daryl

The 20-player contract list has seen Rachin's Wellington teammate Ben Sears, Canterbury's Will O'Rourke and Otago's Jacob Duffy, left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel getting added to the list after missing out on a contract during the last year. The Indian-origin Rachin finally got the reward for all the runs he has plundered across the formats for New Zealand since last year.\n\nThe all-rounder emerged as the breakout star of the ODI World Cup 2023, which was held in India. The 24-year-old scored 578 runs from 10 matches and finished off as the fourth-highest run-getter. The batter went on to make a mark on the Test circuit as well, by scoring 240 runs at Mount Maunganui against South Africa. This was the highest maiden Test century by a New Zealand batter and also broke into the team's T20I squad.\n\nHe was also named as the ICC Emerging Player of the Year for 2023 and went onto become the youngest recipient of the Sir Richard Hadlee Medal at the New Zealand Cricket Awards.\n\n\"Growing up you'd see those contract lists come out each year and think it would be cool to be on that list one day - and for it to eventuate now is a pinch-myself moment,\" Ravindra was quoted as saying in an NZC release. \"It's been a really cool past 12 months playing international cricket.

Ravindra, fresh off a breakout ODI World Cup and a Test hundred, is the youngest recipient of the prestigious Sir Richard Hadlee Medal. Sears and O'Rourke impressed on their Test debuts last summer, while Duffy brings experience from limited-overs cricket.\n\n\"It's a pinch-myself moment,\" said Ravindra. \"This is a great reward for the hard work and a chance to keep improving for the Blackcaps.\"\n\nLeft-arm spinner Ajaz Patel finds himself back on the contract list. This is likely due to New Zealand's upcoming Test-heavy schedule, featuring tours of Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, and India, followed by a home series against England.\n\nWhile top-order batsman Henry Nicholls retains his contract despite a dip in form, the absence of Kane Williamson is a notable one.\n\nWilliamson will be unavailable for a period due to his participation in the SA20 league but remains committed to the Blackcaps outside of that window. This opens up the question of a new white-ball captain for New Zealand.\n\nNZC selector Sam Wells is confident about the current crop of players. \"We're producing international-ready Blackcaps and we're pleased with the current depth,\" he said. \"The quality of some of the players who weren't offered contracts is a testament to that strength.\"\n\nWith a blend of experience and exciting young talent, New Zealand cricket seems well-positioned for the challenges ahead.\n\nFinn Allen, Tom Blundell, Michael Bracewell, Mark Chapman, Devon Conway, Jacob Duffy, Matt Henry, Kyle Jamieson, Tom

In March, he became the youngest recipient of the Sir Richard Hadlee Medal.\n\nRavindra, who has his roots in Bengaluru where his grandparents live, said receiving his first central contract was special.\n\n\"Growing up, you'd see those contract lists come out each year and think it would be cool to be on that list one day -- and for it to eventuate now is a pinch-myself moment,\" he told New Zealand Cricket (NZC).\n\n\"It's been a really cool past 12 months playing international cricket. I've learned a lot and the hunger is definitely there to keep improving and giving to the Blackcaps. It's such a special group to be in, from players to support staff -- and that's been the most enjoyable part, to be honest,\" he added.\n\nBesides Ravindra, three more new faces -- Ben Sears, Will O'Rourke and Jacob Duffy -- figure in the list of 20 players offered contracts by NZC.\n\n\"Playing a game you love with your mates for a living is something very special, and I hold it close to my heart,\" added Ravindra.\n\nRavindra has scored 519 runs in seven Tests, including a century, while he has three ODI tons in 25 games.\n\nSears, who played alongside Ravindra at the 2016 ICC Under-19 World Cup, featured in 11 T20Is for New Zealand during the 2023-24 season, claiming 13 wickets at an average of 22.\n\nThe pacer was also a travelling reserve in the New Zealand squad for the recently-concluded T20 World Cup in the West Indies and USA.\n\nPacer O'Rourke, who has made his international debut in all three formats in the past one year, has played three ODIs, three T20Is and two Tests, while 29-year-old right-arm quick Duffy has featured for New Zealand in 14 T20Is and six ODIs and was recently involved in the drawn T20I series against Pakistan in April.\n\nPlayers offered central contracts for 2024-25: Finn Allen, Tom Blundell, Michael Bracewell, Mark Chapman, Devon Conway, Jacob Duffy, Matt Henry, Kyle Jamieson, Tom Latham, Daryl Mitchell, Henry Nicholls, Will O'Rourke, Ajaz Patel, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Mitchell Santner, Ben Sears, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee, Will Young.

He is one of the four new faces to have made the contract list. Alongside Ravindra, fellow Wellington pacer Ben Sears, Canterbury's Will O'Rourke and Otago's Jacob Duffy have received contracts after showing their potential over the last 12 months.\n\nRavindra had a memorable ODI World Cup 2023 campaign, as he finished as the fourth-highest run-getter in the campaign, amassing 578 runs. He went on to feature in the other two formats of the game at home in the New Zealand summer and his performances didn't go unnoticed, as he was named the ICC Emerging Player of the Year for 2023 in January. A couple of months later, he created history as he became the youngest recipient of the Sir Richard Hadlee Medal at the ANZ New Zealand Cricket Awards.\n\nAlso Read: 'My priority still is absolutely playing for New Zealand' - Kane Williamson shares after opting for non-binding contract\n\nAfter receiving his first central contract from NZC, an elated Ravindra said that he had learned a lot over the past 12 months and has the hunger to keep improving his craft.\n\n\"Growing up, you'd see those contract lists come out each year and think it would be cool to be on that list one day - and for it to eventuate now is a pinch-myself moment.

Playing a game you love with your mates for a living is something very special, and I hold it close to my heart,\" he added.\n\nSears, meanwhile, played 11 T20Is for the Blackcaps during the 2023-24 season, claiming 13 wickets at an average of 22. He made his Test debut against Australia at the Hagley Oval and claimed a four-for in the second innings. Sears was among the travelling reserves for New Zealand in the T20 World Cup 2024.\n\nOn the other hand, O'Rourke debuted in all three formats for New Zealand last season, playing two Tests, three ODIs and as many T20Is. The 22-year-old claimed the best Test figures for New Zealand on debut, as his 9/93 helped his side register their first Test series win against South Africa.\n\nAlso Read: Lauren Down makes her

This year, he made his debut in the lucrative Indian Premier League for the Chennai Super Kings, having been acquired for a whopping Rs 1.8 crore during the IPL auction.\n\nThe top-order batsman received recognition for his ascent in January when he was named the 2023 ICC Emerging Player of the Year.

I've learned a lot and the hunger is definitely there to keep improving and giving to the Blackcaps. It's such a special group to be in, from players to support staff -- and that's been the most enjoyable part, to be honest,\" he added.\n\nIn addition to Ravindra, the list of 20 players who have been granted contracts by NZC includes three other newcomers: Ben Sears, Will O'Rourke, and Jacob Duffy.\n\n\"Playing a game you love with your mates for a living is something very special, and I hold it close to my heart,\" added Ravindra.\n\nRavindra has scored 519 runs in seven Tests, including a century, while he has three ODI tons in 25 games.\n\nSears participated in 11 Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is) for New Zealand in the 2023-24 season, taking 13 wickets at an average of 22, and was partnered with Ravindra at the 2016 ICC Under-19 World Cup.\n\nIn addition, the pacer traveled as a reserve for the New Zealand team that played in the USA and the West Indies for the recently finished T20 World Cup.\n\nWhile right-arm quick Duffy, 29, has represented New Zealand in 14 T20Is, 6 ODIs, and most recently, the drawn T20I series against Pakistan in April, pacer O'Rourke, who made his debut in all three formats in the last year, has played three ODIs, three T20Is, and two Tests.\n\nPlayers offered central contracts for 2024-25: Finn Allen, Tom Blundell, Michael Bracewell, Mark Chapman, Devon Conway, Jacob Duffy, Matt Henry, Kyle Jamieson, Tom Latham, Daryl Mitchell, Henry Nicholls, Will O'Rourke, Ajaz Patel, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Mitchell Santner, Ben Sears, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee, Will Young\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

Now that it's on there, it's a pinch-my-own moment,\" he said.\n\n\"It's been a really cool last 12 months playing international cricket. I've learnt a lot and the hunger is definitely there to keep improving and giving to the Black Caps.\"\n\nSears played 11 T20 internationals in the 2023-24 season, taking 13 wickets at an average of 22.\n\nThe 26-year-old made his Test debut against Australia at Hagley Oval in March, where he made four of the 90 runs in the second innings.\n\nO'Rourke's contract offer concludes a 12-month period for the Canterbury seamer, during which he made his international debuts across all three formats.\n\nThe 22-year-old has played in three ODIs, three T20s and two Tests, the first of which saw him record New Zealand's best Test match figures on debut with nine for 93, helping the Black Caps secure their first ever Test series win against South Africa.\n\nDuffy receives his first offer of an international playing contract 12 years after making his professional debut for the Otago Volts as a 17-year-old.\n\nThe 29-year-old, who recently overtook Stephen Boock as Otago's all-time leading wicket-taker, has played for New Zealand in 14 T20s and six ODIs and was most recently involved in the drawn T20 series against Pakistan in April.\n\nPatel, who was previously contracted for the 2020-21 and 2022-23 seasons, receives his offer ahead of a busy red-ball schedule including upcoming overseas Tests against Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and India, and a three-match home series against England.\n\nBlack Caps selector Sam Wells acknowledged the cricket landscape was evolving rapidly but said the performances of New Zealand players and the demand for them around the world indicated the system was largely working.\n\n\"We produce Black Caps that can be deployed internationally and we are happy with the current size,\" he said.\n\n\"The strength of the list can perhaps best be measured by the quality of a number of players who were not offered a contract.\"\n\nPlayers offered Black Caps central contracts for 2024-25:\n\nFinn Allen (Auckland), Tom Blundell (Wellington),

I've learned a lot and the hunger is definitely there to keep improving and giving to the Black Caps.\"\n\nSears featured in 11 T20 internationals during the 2023-24 season, claiming 13 wickets at an average of 22.\n\nThe 26-year-old made his test debut against Australia at Hagley Oval in March, claiming four for 90 in the second innings.\n\nO'Rourke's contract offer caps off a 12-month period for the Canterbury seamer in which he made his international debut in all three formats.\n\nThe 22-year-old featured in three ODIs, three T20s and two Tests, the first of which saw him claim New Zealand's best Test match-figures on debut with nine for 93, helping the Black Caps claim their first-ever Test series victory against South Africa.\n\nDuffy receives his first International Playing Contract offer 12 years on from his professional debut for the Otago Volts as a 17-year-old.\n\nThe 29-year-old, who recently surpassed Stephen Boock as Otago's all-time leading wicket-taker, has featured for New Zealand in 14 T20s and six ODIs and was most recently involved in the drawn T20 series against Pakistan in April.\n\nPatel, contracted previously in the 2020-21 and 2022-23 seasons, receives his offer ahead of a busy red ball schedule, including upcoming overseas tests against Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, and India, and a three-match home series against England.\n\nBlack Caps selector Sam Wells acknowledged the cricket landscape was evolving quickly but said the performance of, and the demand for New Zealand players around the world, suggested much of the system was working.\n\n\"We're producing international-ready Black Caps and we're pleased with the current depth,\" he said.\n\n\"The strength of the list is perhaps best measured by the quality of some of the players who weren't offered contracts.\"\n\nPlayers offered Black Caps central contracts for 2024-25:\n\nFinn Allen (Auckland), Tom Blundell (Wellington), Michael Bracewell (Wellington), Mark Chapman (Auckland), Devon

The 20-player list features a mix of established stars and rising talents, reflecting the depth and diversity of New Zealand's cricket landscape.\n\nRachin Ravindra earns maiden contract\n\nThe standout inclusion is all-rounder Rachin Ravindra, who has been offered his first NZC central contract. Ravindra's breakthrough year with the national team has been recognised after he emerged as the breakout star of the 2023 ODI World Cup in India, scoring 578 runs.\n\nThe 24-year-old then made his mark on the Test circuit, scoring a maiden century of 240 against South Africa in February -- the highest by a New Zealand batter on debut. Ravindra's rise was further rewarded when he was named the ICC Emerging Player of the Year for 2023 and became the youngest recipient of the Sir Richard Hadlee Medal.\n\nRavindra, in a press release from NZC, stated, \"Growing up, you'd see those contract lists come out each year and think it would be cool to be on that list one day -- and for it to eventuate now is a pinch-myself moment. It's been a really cool past 12 months playing international cricket. I've learned a lot, and the hunger is definitely there to keep improving and giving to the Blackcaps.\"\n\nNew faces and returning players\n\nJoining Ravindra as new faces on the contract list are Wellington's Ben Sears, Canterbury's Will O'Rourke, and Otago's Jacob Duffy. Sears, who played 11 T20Is for New Zealand last season, earned his first central contract after making his Test debut against Australia earlier this year. O'Rourke's contract offer comes after he represented New Zealand in all three formats over the past 12 months, including a nine-wicket haul on Test debut against South Africa.\n\nDuffy receives his first international contract 12 years after making his domestic debut. Ajaz Patel, the left-arm spinner, has also been added to the list after missing out during the previous cycle.\n\nAlso READ: Kane Williamson steps down from New Zealand captaincy and declines central contract for 2024-25\n\nContracted players and salaries\n\nThe 20 players offered central contracts for the 2024-25 season are:\n\nWhile the specific salaries for each player have not been disclosed, NZC's central contracts typically range from NZ$ 200,000 to NZ$ 600,000 per year, depending on the player's experience, performance, and role within the national team.", "source": {"uri": "crickettimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketTimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachin_Ravindra", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rachin Ravindra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_Emerging_Cricketer_of_the_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's Emerging Cricketer of the Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hadlee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Hadlee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_cricket_team_in_Pakistan_in_2021\u201322", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian cricket team in Pakistan in 2021\u201322"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Sears", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Sears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Duffy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Duffy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajaz_Patel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ajaz Patel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-arm_orthodox_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-arm orthodox spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kane_Williamson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kane Williamson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Government_Contracting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Government Contracting", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://crickettimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/New-Zealand-Cricket-announces-20-players-central-contract-list-Image-source-X.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720163", "eventUri": "eng-9720163", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 458366463, "relevance": 2}

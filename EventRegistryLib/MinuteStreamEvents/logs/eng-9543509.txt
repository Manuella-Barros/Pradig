But the Nigerian news outlet was only informed about Ojukwu's arrest two days after police detained him.\n\nThe privately owned Foundation for Investigative Journalism said the reporter's arrest was linked to a November story about government corruption.\n\nThat story alleged that Adejoke Orelope-Adefulire, senior special assistant to the president on sustainable development goals, put $106,154 of government money for school construction into a restaurant's bank account.\n\nInternational press freedom groups have called for the journalist's immediate release.\n\n\"Nigerian authorities must promptly and unconditionally release journalist Daniel Ojukwu and stop harassing and detaining journalists who publish investigative reports into corruption,\" Angela Quintal, head of the Africa program at the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, said in a statement. \"This is no way to treat journalists who are performing a public service.\"\n\nOjukwu had first been detained in Lagos but was later transferred to the capital, Abuja.\n\nNigeria's Washington Embassy did not immediately reply to VOA's email requesting comment.\n\nOjukwu's arrest comes not long after more than a dozen armed military men took another journalist, Segun Olatunji, from his home without any explanation in mid-March, according to press freedom groups. The Defense Intelligence Agency released Olatunji after two weeks.\n\nReporters Without Borders, or RSF, considers Nigeria among the most dangerous environments for journalists in West Africa.

He was later discovered to be in police custody, accused of violating Nigeria's cybercrimes law.\n\nThe authorities have since moved Ojukwu between various police units, including the National Cyber Crimes Center and the Force Criminal Investigations Department in Abuja, the nation's capital. Nigeria's constitution requires that anyone suspected of a crime be charged before a court within 48 hours of arrest. Ojukwu has been in detention without charge for more than nine days.\n\nThe Foundation for Investigative Journalism said thatOjukwu was arrested over an online report he authored in November, alleging that Adejoke Orelope-Adefulire, a former senior special assistant to the president on sustainable development goals, transferred 147 million naira (about US$106,000) of government funds marked for school construction into a restaurant's bank account.\n\nNigeria's cybercrimes law makes a broad range of online interactions a criminal offense. Several activists and journalists have been arrested and charged under the law. The Economic Community of West African States' (ECOWAS) Court of Justice in 2022 ruled that certain provisions of the law should be amended, citing violations of the rights to freedom of expression and information.\n\nIn February, the government amended the law, but the Committee to Protect Journalists and others contend that the amendments are not extensive enough to prevent the law from being used for censorship and intimidation. In particular, section 24 of the law vaguely criminalizes messages sent with the intention of \"causing a breakdown of law and order [or] posing a threat to life.\"\n\nNigeria's constitution, along with international and African human rights conventions, protects press freedom and the right to free expression. Nigerian authorities are obligated to respect such rights by allowing criticism of the government without fear of retaliation, censorship, or legal sanctions.\n\nThe detention of a journalist for doing his job is a violation of these rights. The authorities should immediately and unconditionally release Ojukwu if he has not been charged with a criminal offense.", "source": {"uri": "hrw.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Human Rights Watch"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybercrime", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cybercrime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adejoke_Orelope-Adefulire", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adejoke Orelope-Adefulire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Community_of_West_African_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic Community of West African States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable Development Goals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_naira", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian naira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_to_Protect_Journalists", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Committee to Protect Journalists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimidation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intimidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of the press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2024/05/202405afr_nigeria_daniel_ojukwu.jpg?h=722d240a&itok=TPknv_Y0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543509", "eventUri": "eng-9543509", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 196, "textEnd": 201}], "sentiment": -0.388235294117647, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

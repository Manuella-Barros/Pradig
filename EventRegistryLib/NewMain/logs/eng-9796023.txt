But the drop was not justified by the data that was out there, which is why you then have a day like today.\"\n\nFor everyday people, what are the best ways to handle market volatility? The top advice is to do nothing, but ultimately your response depends in part on your circumstances and financial goals.\n\n\"It's important to remember that investing in the stock market is a long game. There's going to be volatility, so be wary of having a knee-jerk reaction and pulling your money out at the first sign of a drop,\" said Courtney Alev, consumer advocate for CreditKarma. \"Selling stocks frequently or incrementally can come with fees for each transaction and those can add up fast.\"\n\nCaleb Silver, editor in chief of Investopedia, echoed this, cautioning that sellers may also end up owing taxes on any gains.\n\n\"For everyday investors, volatility is the price you pay to be invested in the stock market,\" Silver said. \"But it's very unsettling when we see big market drops of two to three percent... It's a little unnerving for people who have their money in 401(k)'s or IRA's or retirement funds to watch this magnitude of volatility.\"\n\nSilver urged investors to remember that \"a market falls into a correction, ten percent or more, once a year on average,\" and that \"usually the market reverts to the mean, and the mean is an average annual return of eight to ten percent a year going all the way back to the 1950s.\"\n\nFor younger people just beginning to invest, declines in the stock market are an opportunity to add to your portfolio at cheaper prices, by buying in when the market is falling or has fallen a lot, according to Silver.\n\n\"You're reducing the average price you pay for the securities, stocks, mutual funds, or index funds that you own (when you buy in a down market),\" he said. \"So when the market itself reverts to the mean and rises again, you take advantage of having bought at cheaper prices, and that adds to the value of your portfolio.\"\n\nIn terms of selling, though, he said the best advice for most investors is to do nothing and wait for the volatility to cool down.\n\n\"Whenever you invest in stocks it's important to be mindful of your time horizon,\" said Alev. \"For instance, do you expect you'll need to liquidate in the near future? In that case, you're likely better off opting for a less volatile and more risk-averse mode of growing your money, such as a high-yield savings account.\"\n\nSilver agreed.\n\n\"I don't believe it when people say, 'Don't look at your 401(k),'\" he said. \"You should absolutely look and see what you own and see that it matches your risk appetite.\"\n\nIf it doesn't, you can move your investments to products that can shield you from the ups and downs of the market or unforeseen events. Silver said that High Yield Savings Accounts, Certificates of Deposit, and money market accounts are all currently seeing returns of about 4% to 5% for the more cautious or conservative investor.\n\nNationwide's Hackett said it makes sense to periodically rebalance the exposure one has in their portfolio in general - whether quarterly or annually - to make sure there isn't more risk than one would want related to, say, technology stocks or another sector.\n\n\"If your exposures get out of line with your long-term plan, get them back in line,\" he said. Even so, Hackett added that he sees the trend of tech stocks outperforming as one that may extend further into the future.\n\nExperts agree that, for investors with debt, it's important to focus on paying off loans, especially high-interest ones, before making major investments. That said, \"if you are able to simultaneously pay off your loans and invest a little bit at the same time, you are effectively paying your future self for being responsible about your debt while growing your investments over time,\" Silver said.\n\n__\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

Over a three day losing streak, the S&P 500 dipped more than 6% before rallying again Tuesday.\n\n\"This is what an emotion-driven market looks like,\" said Mark Hackett, head of investment research for Nationwide. \"You had a three day period that was really very challenging. But the drop was not justified by the data that was out there, which is why you then have a day like today.\"\n\nFor everyday people, what are the best ways to handle market volatility? The top advice is to do nothing, but ultimately your response depends in part on your circumstances and financial goals.\n\nWhat to do in general\n\n\"It's important to remember that investing in the stock market is a long game. There's going to be volatility, so be wary of having a knee-jerk reaction and pulling your money out at the first sign of a drop,\" said Courtney Alev, consumer advocate for CreditKarma. \"Selling stocks frequently or incrementally can come with fees for each transaction and those can add up fast.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nLincoln cookie shop closes as owner loses possession of downtown building Demolition of north Lincoln grain elevator could begin as early as October Lincoln works to clean up trees, restore power after storms; governor declares emergency Nebraska education board passes statewide dress code policy to protect student beliefs Pedestrian hit, killed near Lincoln casino Former small-town Nebraska bank president sentenced to federal prison for bank fraud Teddy Prochazka is 'playing free' as he finally enters training camp at full strength Take an inside look at the soon-to-open WarHorse Casino in Omaha Lincoln police identify man who died in Sunday morning crash near casino Nebraska lawmaker's proposed Taxpayer's Bill of Rights draws opponents from Colorado VP pick Tim Walz is a native Nebraskan who spent most of the first half of his life here Who is Italian boxer Angela Carini and why did she quit her fight against Imane Khelif? Severe thunderstorm hits Lincoln area; tens of thousands without power New Lincoln high schools continue to see rapid growth 7 killed after plane departing Nebraska City crashes in Wyoming, including members of gospel group\n\nCaleb Silver, editor in chief of Investopedia, echoed this, cautioning that sellers may also end up owing taxes on any gains.\n\n\"For everyday investors, volatility is the price you pay to be invested in the stock market,\" Silver said. \"But it's very unsettling when we see big market drops of two to three percent... It's a little unnerving for people who have their money in 401(k)'s or IRA's or retirement funds to watch this magnitude of volatility.\"\n\nSilver urged investors to remember that \"a market falls into a correction, ten percent or more, once a year on average,\" and that \"usually the market reverts to the mean, and the mean is an average annual return of eight to ten percent a year going all the way back to the 1950s.\"\n\nHome & Garden\n\nNew homes are getting smaller. That could be big news for first-time buyers\n\nBy Samantha Delouya, CNN\n\nWhat to do if you're a young or new investor\n\nFor younger people just beginning to invest, declines in the stock market are an opportunity to add to your portfolio at cheaper prices, by buying in when the market is falling or has fallen a lot, according to Silver.\n\n\"You're reducing the average price you pay for the securities, stocks, mutual funds, or index funds that you own (when you buy in a down market),\" he said. \"So when the market itself reverts to the mean and rises again, you take advantage of having bought at cheaper prices, and that adds to the value of your portfolio.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIn terms of selling, though, he said the best advice for most investors is to do nothing and wait for the volatility to cool down.\n\nPersonal-finance\n\nWealth that lasts: Crafting your family's financial legacy | PennyWise podcast\n\nLee Media Studio\n\nWhat to do if you're near retirement\n\n\"Whenever you invest in stocks it's important to be mindful of your time horizon,\" said Alev. \"For instance, do you expect you'll need to liquidate in the near future? In that case, you're likely better off opting for a less volatile and more risk-averse mode of growing your money, such as a high-yield savings account.\"\n\nSilver agreed.\n\n\"I don't believe it when people say, 'Don't look at your 401(k),'\" he said. \"You should absolutely look and see what you own and see that it matches your risk appetite.\"\n\nIf it doesn't, you can move your investments to products that can shield you from the ups and downs of the market or unforeseen events. Silver said that High Yield Savings Accounts, Certificates of Deposit, and money market accounts are all currently seeing returns of about 4% to 5% for the more cautious or conservative investor.\n\nNationwide's Hackett said it makes sense to periodically rebalance the exposure one has in their portfolio in general - whether quarterly or annually - to make sure there isn't more risk than one would want related to, say, technology stocks or another sector.\n\n\"If your exposures get out of line with your long-term plan, get them back in line,\" he said. Even so, Hackett added that he sees the trend of tech stocks outperforming as one that may extend further into the future.\n\nWhat to do if you have debt\n\nExperts agree that, for investors with debt, it's important to focus on paying off loans, especially high-interest ones, before making major investments. That said, \"if you are able to simultaneously pay off your loans and invest a little bit at the same time, you are effectively paying your future self for being responsible about your debt while growing your investments over time,\" Silver said.\n\n__\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

It's a little unnerving for people who have their money in 401(k)'s or IRA's or retirement funds to watch this magnitude of volatility.\"\n\nSilver urged investors to remember that \"a market falls into a correction, ten percent or more, once a year on average,\" and that \"usually the market reverts to the mean, and the mean is an average annual return of eight to ten percent a year going all the way back to the 1950s.\"\n\nHome & Garden New homes are getting smaller. That could be big news for first-time buyers By Samantha Delouya, CNN What to do if you're a young or new investor\n\nFor younger people just beginning to invest, declines in the stock market are an opportunity to add to your portfolio at cheaper prices, by buying in when the market is falling or has fallen a lot, according to Silver.\n\n\"You're reducing the average price you pay for the securities, stocks, mutual funds, or index funds that you own (when you buy in a down market),\" he said. \"So when the market itself reverts to the mean and rises again, you take advantage of having bought at cheaper prices, and that adds to the value of your portfolio.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIn terms of selling, though, he said the best advice for most investors is to do nothing and wait for the volatility to cool down.\n\nPersonal-finance Wealth that lasts: Crafting your family's financial legacy | PennyWise podcast Lee Media Studio What to do if you're near retirement\n\n\"Whenever you invest in stocks it's important to be mindful of your time horizon,\" said Alev. \"For instance, do you expect you'll need to liquidate in the near future? In that case, you're likely better off opting for a less volatile and more risk-averse mode of growing your money, such as a high-yield savings account.\"\n\nSilver agreed.\n\n\"I don't believe it when people say, 'Don't look at your 401(k),'\" he said. \"You should absolutely look and see what you own and see that it matches your risk appetite.\"\n\nIf it doesn't, you can move your investments to products that can shield you from the ups and downs of the market or unforeseen events. Silver said that High Yield Savings Accounts, Certificates of Deposit, and money market accounts are all currently seeing returns of about 4% to 5% for the more cautious or conservative investor.\n\nNationwide's Hackett said it makes sense to periodically rebalance the exposure one has in their portfolio in general - whether quarterly or annually - to make sure there isn't more risk than one would want related to, say, technology stocks or another sector.\n\n\"If your exposures get out of line with your long-term plan, get them back in line,\" he said. Even so, Hackett added that he sees the trend of tech stocks outperforming as one that may extend further into the future.\n\nWhat to do if you have debt\n\nExperts agree that, for investors with debt, it's important to focus on paying off loans, especially high-interest ones, before making major investments. That said, \"if you are able to simultaneously pay off your loans and invest a little bit at the same time, you are effectively paying your future self for being responsible about your debt while growing your investments over time,\" Silver said.\n\n__\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

The top advice is to do nothing, but ultimately your response depends in part on your circumstances and financial goals.\n\nWhat to do in general\n\n\"It's important to remember that investing in the stock market is a long game. There's going to be volatility, so be wary of having a knee-jerk reaction and pulling your money out at the first sign of a drop,\" said Courtney Alev, consumer advocate for CreditKarma. \"Selling stocks frequently or incrementally can come with fees for each transaction and those can add up fast.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

It's a little unnerving for people who have their money in 401(k)'s or IRA's or retirement funds to watch this magnitude of volatility.\"\n\nSilver urged investors to remember that \"a market falls into a correction, ten percent or more, once a year on average,\" and that \"usually the market reverts to the mean, and the mean is an average annual return of eight to ten percent a year going all the way back to the 1950s.\"\n\nHome & Garden New homes are getting smaller. That could be big news for first-time buyers By Samantha Delouya, CNN What to do if you're a young or new investor\n\nFor younger people just beginning to invest, declines in the stock market are an opportunity to add to your portfolio at cheaper prices, by buying in when the market is falling or has fallen a lot, according to Silver.\n\n\"You're reducing the average price you pay for the securities, stocks, mutual funds, or index funds that you own (when you buy in a down market),\" he said. \"So when the market itself reverts to the mean and rises again, you take advantage of having bought at cheaper prices, and that adds to the value of your portfolio.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIn terms of selling, though, he said the best advice for most investors is to do nothing and wait for the volatility to cool down.\n\nPersonal-finance Wealth that lasts: Crafting your family's financial legacy | PennyWise podcast Lee Media Studio What to do if you're near retirement\n\n\"Whenever you invest in stocks it's important to be mindful of your time horizon,\" said Alev. \"For instance, do you expect you'll need to liquidate in the near future? In that case, you're likely better off opting for a less volatile and more risk-averse mode of growing your money, such as a high-yield savings account.\"\n\nSilver agreed.\n\n\"I don't believe it when people say, 'Don't look at your 401(k),'\" he said. \"You should absolutely look and see what you own and see that it matches your risk appetite.\"\n\nIf it doesn't, you can move your investments to products that can shield you from the ups and downs of the market or unforeseen events. Silver said that High Yield Savings Accounts, Certificates of Deposit, and money market accounts are all currently seeing returns of about 4% to 5% for the more cautious or conservative investor.\n\nNationwide's Hackett said it makes sense to periodically rebalance the exposure one has in their portfolio in general - whether quarterly or annually - to make sure there isn't more risk than one would want related to, say, technology stocks or another sector.\n\n\"If your exposures get out of line with your long-term plan, get them back in line,\" he said. Even so, Hackett added that he sees the trend of tech stocks outperforming as one that may extend further into the future.\n\nWhat to do if you have debt\n\nExperts agree that, for investors with debt, it's important to focus on paying off loans, especially high-interest ones, before making major investments. That said, \"if you are able to simultaneously pay off your loans and invest a little bit at the same time, you are effectively paying your future self for being responsible about your debt while growing your investments over time,\" Silver said.\n\n__\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

It's a little unnerving for people who have their money in 401(k)'s or IRA's or retirement funds to watch this magnitude of volatility.\"\n\nSilver urged investors to remember that \"a market falls into a correction, ten percent or more, once a year on average,\" and that \"usually the market reverts to the mean, and the mean is an average annual return of eight to ten percent a year going all the way back to the 1950s.\"\n\nHome & Garden New homes are getting smaller. That could be big news for first-time buyers By Samantha Delouya, CNN What to do if you're a young or new investor\n\nFor younger people just beginning to invest, declines in the stock market are an opportunity to add to your portfolio at cheaper prices, by buying in when the market is falling or has fallen a lot, according to Silver.\n\n\"You're reducing the average price you pay for the securities, stocks, mutual funds, or index funds that you own (when you buy in a down market),\" he said. \"So when the market itself reverts to the mean and rises again, you take advantage of having bought at cheaper prices, and that adds to the value of your portfolio.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIn terms of selling, though, he said the best advice for most investors is to do nothing and wait for the volatility to cool down.\n\nPersonal-finance Wealth that lasts: Crafting your family's financial legacy | PennyWise podcast Lee Media Studio What to do if you're near retirement\n\n\"Whenever you invest in stocks it's important to be mindful of your time horizon,\" said Alev. \"For instance, do you expect you'll need to liquidate in the near future? In that case, you're likely better off opting for a less volatile and more risk-averse mode of growing your money, such as a high-yield savings account.\"\n\nSilver agreed.\n\n\"I don't believe it when people say, 'Don't look at your 401(k),'\" he said. \"You should absolutely look and see what you own and see that it matches your risk appetite.\"\n\nIf it doesn't, you can move your investments to products that can shield you from the ups and downs of the market or unforeseen events. Silver said that High Yield Savings Accounts, Certificates of Deposit, and money market accounts are all currently seeing returns of about 4% to 5% for the more cautious or conservative investor.\n\nNationwide's Hackett said it makes sense to periodically rebalance the exposure one has in their portfolio in general - whether quarterly or annually - to make sure there isn't more risk than one would want related to, say, technology stocks or another sector.\n\n\"If your exposures get out of line with your long-term plan, get them back in line,\" he said. Even so, Hackett added that he sees the trend of tech stocks outperforming as one that may extend further into the future.\n\nWhat to do if you have debt\n\nExperts agree that, for investors with debt, it's important to focus on paying off loans, especially high-interest ones, before making major investments. That said, \"if you are able to simultaneously pay off your loans and invest a little bit at the same time, you are effectively paying your future self for being responsible about your debt while growing your investments over time,\" Silver said.\n\n__\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

Over a three day losing streak, the S&P 500 dipped more than 6% before rallying again Tuesday.\n\n\"This is what an emotion-driven market looks like,\" said Mark Hackett, head of investment research for Nationwide. \"You had a three day period that was really very challenging. But the drop was not justified by the data that was out there, which is why you then have a day like today.\"\n\nFor everyday people, what are the best ways to handle market volatility? The top advice is to do nothing, but ultimately your response depends in part on your circumstances and financial goals.\n\nWhat to do in general\n\n\"It's important to remember that investing in the stock market is a long game. There's going to be volatility, so be wary of having a knee-jerk reaction and pulling your money out at the first sign of a drop,\" said Courtney Alev, consumer advocate for CreditKarma. \"Selling stocks frequently or incrementally can come with fees for each transaction and those can add up fast.\"\n\nCaleb Silver, editor in chief of Investopedia, echoed this, cautioning that sellers may also end up owing taxes on any gains.\n\n\"For everyday investors, volatility is the price you pay to be invested in the stock market,\" Silver said. \"But it's very unsettling when we see big market drops of two to three percent...

Over a three day losing streak, the S&P 500 dipped more than 6% before rallying again Tuesday.\n\n\"This is what an emotion-driven market looks like,\" said Mark Hackett, head of investment research for Nationwide. \"You had a three day period that was really very challenging. But the drop was not justified by the data that was out there, which is why you then have a day like today.\"\n\nFor everyday people, what are the best ways to handle market volatility? The top advice is to do nothing, but ultimately your response depends in part on your circumstances and financial goals.\n\nWhat to do in general\n\n\"It's important to remember that investing in the stock market is a long game. There's going to be volatility, so be wary of having a knee-jerk reaction and pulling your money out at the first sign of a drop,\" said Courtney Alev, consumer advocate for CreditKarma. \"Selling stocks frequently or incrementally can come with fees for each transaction and those can add up fast.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

It's a little unnerving for people who have their money in 401(k)'s or IRA's or retirement funds to watch this magnitude of volatility.\"\n\nSilver urged investors to remember that \"a market falls into a correction, ten percent or more, once a year on average,\" and that \"usually the market reverts to the mean, and the mean is an average annual return of eight to ten percent a year going all the way back to the 1950s.\"\n\nHome & Gardening New homes are getting smaller. That could be big news for first-time buyers By Samantha Delouya, CNN What to do if you're a young or new investor\n\nFor younger people just beginning to invest, declines in the stock market are an opportunity to add to your portfolio at cheaper prices, by buying in when the market is falling or has fallen a lot, according to Silver.\n\n\"You're reducing the average price you pay for the securities, stocks, mutual funds, or index funds that you own (when you buy in a down market),\" he said. \"So when the market itself reverts to the mean and rises again, you take advantage of having bought at cheaper prices, and that adds to the value of your portfolio.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIn terms of selling, though, he said the best advice for most investors is to do nothing and wait for the volatility to cool down.\n\nPersonal-finance Wealth that lasts: Crafting your family's financial legacy | PennyWise podcast Lee Media Studio What to do if you're near retirement\n\n\"Whenever you invest in stocks it's important to be mindful of your time horizon,\" said Alev. \"For instance, do you expect you'll need to liquidate in the near future? In that case, you're likely better off opting for a less volatile and more risk-averse mode of growing your money, such as a high-yield savings account.\"\n\nSilver agreed.\n\n\"I don't believe it when people say, 'Don't look at your 401(k),'\" he said. \"You should absolutely look and see what you own and see that it matches your risk appetite.\"\n\nIf it doesn't, you can move your investments to products that can shield you from the ups and downs of the market or unforeseen events. Silver said that High Yield Savings Accounts, Certificates of Deposit, and money market accounts are all currently seeing returns of about 4% to 5% for the more cautious or conservative investor.\n\nNationwide's Hackett said it makes sense to periodically rebalance the exposure one has in their portfolio in general - whether quarterly or annually - to make sure there isn't more risk than one would want related to, say, technology stocks or another sector.\n\n\"If your exposures get out of line with your long-term plan, get them back in line,\" he said. Even so, Hackett added that he sees the trend of tech stocks outperforming as one that may extend further into the future.\n\nWhat to do if you have debt\n\nExperts agree that, for investors with debt, it's important to focus on paying off loans, especially high-interest ones, before making major investments. That said, \"if you are able to simultaneously pay off your loans and invest a little bit at the same time, you are effectively paying your future self for being responsible about your debt while growing your investments over time,\" Silver said.\n\n__\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

It's a little unnerving for people who have their money in 401(k)'s or IRA's or retirement funds to watch this magnitude of volatility.\"\n\nSilver urged investors to remember that \"a market falls into a correction, ten percent or more, once a year on average,\" and that \"usually the market reverts to the mean, and the mean is an average annual return of eight to ten percent a year going all the way back to the 1950s.\"\n\nHome & Garden New homes are getting smaller. That could be big news for first-time buyers By Samantha Delouya, CNN What to do if you're a young or new investor\n\nFor younger people just beginning to invest, declines in the stock market are an opportunity to add to your portfolio at cheaper prices, by buying in when the market is falling or has fallen a lot, according to Silver.\n\n\"You're reducing the average price you pay for the securities, stocks, mutual funds, or index funds that you own (when you buy in a down market),\" he said. \"So when the market itself reverts to the mean and rises again, you take advantage of having bought at cheaper prices, and that adds to the value of your portfolio.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIn terms of selling, though, he said the best advice for most investors is to do nothing and wait for the volatility to cool down.\n\nPersonal-finance Wealth that lasts: Crafting your family's financial legacy | PennyWise podcast Lee Media Studio What to do if you're near retirement\n\n\"Whenever you invest in stocks it's important to be mindful of your time horizon,\" said Alev. \"For instance, do you expect you'll need to liquidate in the near future? In that case, you're likely better off opting for a less volatile and more risk-averse mode of growing your money, such as a high-yield savings account.\"\n\nSilver agreed.\n\n\"I don't believe it when people say, 'Don't look at your 401(k),'\" he said. \"You should absolutely look and see what you own and see that it matches your risk appetite.\"\n\nIf it doesn't, you can move your investments to products that can shield you from the ups and downs of the market or unforeseen events. Silver said that High Yield Savings Accounts, Certificates of Deposit, and money market accounts are all currently seeing returns of about 4% to 5% for the more cautious or conservative investor.\n\nNationwide's Hackett said it makes sense to periodically rebalance the exposure one has in their portfolio in general - whether quarterly or annually - to make sure there isn't more risk than one would want related to, say, technology stocks or another sector.\n\n\"If your exposures get out of line with your long-term plan, get them back in line,\" he said. Even so, Hackett added that he sees the trend of tech stocks outperforming as one that may extend further into the future.\n\nWhat to do if you have debt\n\nExperts agree that, for investors with debt, it's important to focus on paying off loans, especially high-interest ones, before making major investments. That said, \"if you are able to simultaneously pay off your loans and invest a little bit at the same time, you are effectively paying your future self for being responsible about your debt while growing your investments over time,\" Silver said.\n\n__\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

That could be big news for first-time buyers By Samantha Delouya, CNN What to do if you're a young or new investor\n\nFor younger people just beginning to invest, declines in the stock market are an opportunity to add to your portfolio at cheaper prices, by buying in when the market is falling or has fallen a lot, according to Silver.\n\n\"You're reducing the average price you pay for the securities, stocks, mutual funds, or index funds that you own (when you buy in a down market),\" he said. \"So when the market itself reverts to the mean and rises again, you take advantage of having bought at cheaper prices, and that adds to the value of your portfolio.\"\n\nIn terms of selling, though, he said the best advice for most investors is to do nothing and wait for the volatility to cool down.\n\nBusiness Wealth that lasts: Crafting your family's financial legacy | PennyWise podcast Lee Media Studio What to do if you're near retirement\n\n\"Whenever you invest in stocks it's important to be mindful of your time horizon,\" said Alev. \"For instance, do you expect you'll need to liquidate in the near future? In that case, you're likely better off opting for a less volatile and more risk-averse mode of growing your money, such as a high-yield savings account.\"\n\nSilver agreed.\n\n\"I don't believe it when people say, 'Don't look at your 401(k),'\" he said. \"You should absolutely look and see what you own and see that it matches your risk appetite.\"\n\nIf it doesn't, you can move your investments to products that can shield you from the ups and downs of the market or unforeseen events. Silver said that High Yield Savings Accounts, Certificates of Deposit, and money market accounts are all currently seeing returns of about 4% to 5% for the more cautious or conservative investor.\n\nNationwide's Hackett said it makes sense to periodically rebalance the exposure one has in their portfolio in general - whether quarterly or annually - to make sure there isn't more risk than one would want related to, say, technology stocks or another sector.\n\n\"If your exposures get out of line with your long-term plan, get them back in line,\" he said. Even so, Hackett added that he sees the trend of tech stocks outperforming as one that may extend further into the future.\n\nWhat to do if you have debt\n\nExperts agree that, for investors with debt, it's important to focus on paying off loans, especially high-interest ones, before making major investments. That said, \"if you are able to simultaneously pay off your loans and invest a little bit at the same time, you are effectively paying your future self for being responsible about your debt while growing your investments over time,\" Silver said.\n\n__\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

Over a three day losing streak, the S&P 500 dipped more than 6% before rallying again Tuesday.\n\n\"This is what an emotion-driven market looks like,\" said Mark Hackett, head of investment research for Nationwide. \"You had a three day period that was really very challenging. But the drop was not justified by the data that was out there, which is why you then have a day like today.\"\n\nFor everyday people, what are the best ways to handle market volatility? The top advice is to do nothing, but ultimately your response depends in part on your circumstances and financial goals.\n\nWhat to do in general\n\n\"It's important to remember that investing in the stock market is a long game. There's going to be volatility, so be wary of having a knee-jerk reaction and pulling your money out at the first sign of a drop,\" said Courtney Alev, consumer advocate for CreditKarma. \"Selling stocks frequently or incrementally can come with fees for each transaction and those can add up fast.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

That could be big news for first-time buyers By Samantha Delouya, CNN What to do if you're a young or new investor\n\nFor younger people just beginning to invest, declines in the stock market are an opportunity to add to your portfolio at cheaper prices, by buying in when the market is falling or has fallen a lot, according to Silver.\n\n\"You're reducing the average price you pay for the securities, stocks, mutual funds, or index funds that you own (when you buy in a down market),\" he said. \"So when the market itself reverts to the mean and rises again, you take advantage of having bought at cheaper prices, and that adds to the value of your portfolio.\"\n\nIn terms of selling, though, he said the best advice for most investors is to do nothing and wait for the volatility to cool down.\n\nBusiness Wealth that lasts: Crafting your family's financial legacy | PennyWise podcast Lee Media Studio What to do if you're near retirement\n\n\"Whenever you invest in stocks it's important to be mindful of your time horizon,\" said Alev. \"For instance, do you expect you'll need to liquidate in the near future? In that case, you're likely better off opting for a less volatile and more risk-averse mode of growing your money, such as a high-yield savings account.\"\n\nSilver agreed.\n\n\"I don't believe it when people say, 'Don't look at your 401(k),'\" he said. \"You should absolutely look and see what you own and see that it matches your risk appetite.\"\n\nIf it doesn't, you can move your investments to products that can shield you from the ups and downs of the market or unforeseen events. Silver said that High Yield Savings Accounts, Certificates of Deposit, and money market accounts are all currently seeing returns of about 4% to 5% for the more cautious or conservative investor.\n\nNationwide's Hackett said it makes sense to periodically rebalance the exposure one has in their portfolio in general - whether quarterly or annually - to make sure there isn't more risk than one would want related to, say, technology stocks or another sector.\n\n\"If your exposures get out of line with your long-term plan, get them back in line,\" he said. Even so, Hackett added that he sees the trend of tech stocks outperforming as one that may extend further into the future.\n\nWhat to do if you have debt\n\nExperts agree that, for investors with debt, it's important to focus on paying off loans, especially high-interest ones, before making major investments. That said, \"if you are able to simultaneously pay off your loans and invest a little bit at the same time, you are effectively paying your future self for being responsible about your debt while growing your investments over time,\" Silver said.\n\n__\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

The top advice is to do nothing, but ultimately your response depends in part on your circumstances and financial goals.\n\nWhat to do in general\n\n\"It's important to remember that investing in the stock market is a long game. There's going to be volatility, so be wary of having a knee-jerk reaction and pulling your money out at the first sign of a drop,\" said Courtney Alev, consumer advocate for CreditKarma. \"Selling stocks frequently or incrementally can come with fees for each transaction and those can add up fast.\"\n\nCaleb Silver, editor in chief of Investopedia, echoed this, cautioning that sellers may also end up owing taxes on any gains.\n\n\"For everyday investors, volatility is the price you pay to be invested in the stock market,\" Silver said. \"But it's very unsettling when we see big market drops of two to three percent... It's a little unnerving for people who have their money in 401(k)'s or IRA's or retirement funds to watch this magnitude of volatility.\"\n\nSilver urged investors to remember that \"a market falls into a correction, ten percent or more, once a year on average,\" and that \"usually the market reverts to the mean, and the mean is an average annual return of eight to ten percent a year going all the way back to the 1950s.\"\n\nShareable Stories\n\nNew homes are getting smaller. That could be big news for first-time buyers\n\nBy Samantha Delouya, CNN\n\nWhat to do if you're a young or new investor\n\nFor younger people just beginning to invest, declines in the stock market are an opportunity to add to your portfolio at cheaper prices, by buying in when the market is falling or has fallen a lot, according to Silver.\n\n\"You're reducing the average price you pay for the securities, stocks, mutual funds, or index funds that you own (when you buy in a down market),\" he said. \"So when the market itself reverts to the mean and rises again, you take advantage of having bought at cheaper prices, and that adds to the value of your portfolio.\"\n\nIn terms of selling, though, he said the best advice for most investors is to do nothing and wait for the volatility to cool down.\n\nShareable Stories\n\nWealth that lasts: Crafting your family's financial legacy | PennyWise podcast\n\nLee Media Studio\n\nWhat to do if you're near retirement\n\n\"Whenever you invest in stocks it's important to be mindful of your time horizon,\" said Alev. \"For instance, do you expect you'll need to liquidate in the near future? In that case, you're likely better off opting for a less volatile and more risk-averse mode of growing your money, such as a high-yield savings account.\"\n\nSilver agreed.\n\n\"I don't believe it when people say, 'Don't look at your 401(k),'\" he said. \"You should absolutely look and see what you own and see that it matches your risk appetite.\"\n\nIf it doesn't, you can move your investments to products that can shield you from the ups and downs of the market or unforeseen events. Silver said that High Yield Savings Accounts, Certificates of Deposit, and money market accounts are all currently seeing returns of about 4% to 5% for the more cautious or conservative investor.\n\nNationwide's Hackett said it makes sense to periodically rebalance the exposure one has in their portfolio in general - whether quarterly or annually - to make sure there isn't more risk than one would want related to, say, technology stocks or another sector.\n\n\"If your exposures get out of line with your long-term plan, get them back in line,\" he said. Even so, Hackett added that he sees the trend of tech stocks outperforming as one that may extend further into the future.\n\nWhat to do if you have debt\n\nExperts agree that, for investors with debt, it's important to focus on paying off loans, especially high-interest ones, before making major investments. That said, \"if you are able to simultaneously pay off your loans and invest a little bit at the same time, you are effectively paying your future self for being responsible about your debt while growing your investments over time,\" Silver said.\n\n__\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

{"id": 225021890, "title": "Is Israel acting like the ICC is \u2018only for Africa and thugs like Putin\u2019?", "text": "Israel\u2019s isolation appears to be growing amid rising criticism following the deadly strike on a camp for displaced people in Rafah on Sunday, and a subsequent attack on Tuesday. Two international legal developments in the last week have also divided the international community. On Friday, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued a ruling ordering Israel to halt its ongoing assault and withdraw its troops from Rafah. On May 20, the International Criminal Court\u2019s (ICC) chief prosecutor applied for warrants for the arrests of senior members of both the Israeli and Hamas leadership. The ICC warrant application triggered angry protestations, not only in Tel Aviv and from Hamas spokespeople, but also in Washington and London \u2013 two capitals that had fully supported the ICC when it requested arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russia\u2019s commissioner for children\u2019s rights Maria Lvova-Belova following the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. For those in Gaza, whether the rules-based international order eventually comes to their aid or not means little in the face of the deadly consequences of Israel\u2019s daily assaults. Is the ICC \u2018built for Africa and thugs like Putin\u2019? In an English language video, posted presumably for consumption in the United States, Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the ICC\u2019s Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan of being one of the \u201cgreat anti-Semites in modern times\u201d, comparing him with the judges in Nazi Germany. Hamas were equally vitriolic, saying Khan\u2019s requests were an attempt to \u201cequate the victim with the executioner by issuing arrest warrants against a number of Palestinian resistance leaders\u201d. The US is understood to be considering sanctions against ICC officials, much in the way it previously imposed them in 2020, before the present administration lifted them. The ICC\u2019s mission is meant to be impartial, however, Khan told CNN that an unnamed official had told him the ICC was \u201cbuilt for Africa and for thugs like Putin\u201d. \u201cThe broader attacks against the ICC emanating from the US and the UK over the past week \u2026 only lend further support to the damaging narrative that the ICC is an exercise in selective justice dictated entirely by politics, carries out its mandate with an \u2018Africa bias\u2019, or is simply a new incarnation of \u2018victors\u2019 justice\u2019,\u201d Michael Becker, professor of international human rights law at Trinity College, Dublin, who previously worked at the ICJ, said. \u201cThe values that underlie the ICC do not allow for one set of rules for democratically elected leaders and another set of rules for everyone else\u201d. Under the terms of the Rome Statute, which established the ICC in 1998, all 124 signatories have a duty to arrest any of those wanted by the court if they are present on their territory. Neither the US nor Israel are parties to the statute, while Palestine was recognised in 2015 as falling under ICC jurisdiction, allowing it to investigate violations perpetrated on Palestinian territory. Justice stalled Some states may consider applying Article 98 of the Rome Statute used to establish the ICC, which cites the precedence of international norms and law, thereby appearing to allow immunity for heads of state, to avoid having to arrest Netanyahu. However, in 2019, the ICC Appeals Chamber appeared to interpret Article 98 to mean that states cannot invoke immunity rules under international law to avoid enforcing such warrants in relation to the outstanding arrest warrant for Sudan\u2019s former President Omar al-Bashir. This suggests that Article 98 should provide no refuge for Netanyahu if he travels to an ICC member country. \u201cIn some ways, the ICC\u2019s decision to call for an arrest warrant in relation to Netanyahu and [defence minister Yoav] Gallant would suggest that the old complaint that the ICC is a Western instrument no longer quite holds,\u201d Gerry Simpson, a professor of international law at the London School of Economics said. Simpson added that, for a long time, the view in the West has been: \u201cThis is a court for other people.\u201d Whether the warrants will be granted or enforced remains to be seen. However, with the US repeatedly showing itself willing to use its UN Security Council veto to stop any binding measures against Israel, Gaza\u2019s best hope may remain the \u201crules-based order\u201d previously espoused by many of the world leaders now at pains to clear legal hurdles from Israel\u2019s path. The International Court of Justice After Friday\u2019s ICJ order spread some optimism in Gaza and among countries working to end the assault on the enclave, Israel\u2019s continued bombardment of Rafah was a shock. According to the order, \u201cIsrael must immediately halt its military offensive, and any other action in the Rafah Governorate\u201d which may bring about \u201cthe physical destruction\u201d of the Palestinians \u2013 alluding to what constitutes genocide under international law. However, Israel described it as \u201cambiguous\u201d, contrasting sharply with the views expressed by much of the rest of the world. Asked if the US supports Israel\u2019s interpretation of the ICJ ruling and whether it would enforce possible ICC arrest warrants, a US Department of State spokesperson told Al Jazeera that US policy \u2013 including several mentions of \u201cred lines\u201d over Rafah that have not stopped any attacks \u2013 has \u201cremained clear and consistent\u201d. The ICJ\u2019s finding also said that \u201cthe current situation arising from Israel\u2019s military offensive in Rafah\u201d creates a risk of harm that might compromise the rights of Palestinians in Gaza under the Genocide Convention \u2013 language that could be interpreted as ordering a complete halt to the offensive in Rafah. However, the inclusion of \u201cmay\u201d and the intent to \u201cbring about physical destruction in whole or part\u201d did much of the heavy lifting in Israel\u2019s reading of the order, according to Geoffrey Nice, who was the lead prosecutor in the war crimes trial of former Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic in The Hague. \u201cIt clearly does not order a complete cessation of military activity,\u201d he wrote to Al Jazeera, \u201cIt does not say that Israel cannot defend itself or attempt to recover the hostages. What it says needs to be read with precision and without wishing to see a particular conclusion one way or the other. \u201cThe court has focused on what can be genocidal outcome rather than \u2013 and without necessarily being driven by \u2013 genocidal intent,\u201d he said, explaining the different interpretations of the text.", "summary": "Two recent legal judgements from international courts could potentially undermine support for Israel.", "url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/29/is-israel-acting-like-the-icc-is-only-for-africa-and-thugs-like-putin?traffic_source=rss", "image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24141738762460-1-1716979450.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:04:08", "author": "Apps Support,Simon Speakman Cordall", "authors": ["Apps Support", "Simon Speakman Cordall"], "language": "en", "source_country": "qa", "sentiment": 0.025}

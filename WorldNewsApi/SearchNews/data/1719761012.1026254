During an episode that aired on Monday, May 27, the longtime game show host tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to get the competition back on track after one contestant guessed the wrong answer, prompting the other contestants to mistakenly congratulate him. As seen in a video shared to YouTube, the moment happened during a toss-up puzzle, when the letters \u201c_ _ N \u2018 _ LO _ K AW _ _!\u201d popped up on the board. After a failed attempt from contestant Cynthia King, Rufus Cumberlander buzzed in to guess. \u201cDon\u2019t look away!,\u201d he shouted. As his fellow contestants, King and Luidgi Altidor, turned and congratulated him, Sajak, 77, could be heard repeating, \u201cNo, no, no! It\u2019s not correct!\u201d However, by the time the contestants finally understood what he was saying, the puzzle\u2019s buzzer rang signaling that time had run out, which prompted shocked reactions from all three contestants. The audience could also be heard letting out surprised gasps during the end of the puzzle as well. \u201cEverybody\u2019s congratulating everybody... And we get to keep the money!,\u201d Sajak said enthusiastically with a big smile, pumping his arm into the air.

The flub prompted several comments from fans, including one who jokingly responded, \u201cIt was at this moment...they [realized] they really messed up. ROYALLY. On National TV. AND...it's gone viral.\u201d Another wrote, \u201cIt's hilarious because they all looked away celebrating lmao.\u201d Others noted that they likely wouldn\u2019t have guessed it right either, with one person commenting, \u201cI had the wrong answer too, so I can\u2019t quite blame \u2018em.\u201d This wasn\u2019t the only error on Wheel of Fortune that has gone viral. During the previous week, a contestant hilariously threw out a NSFW guess in response to a puzzle with the missing letters \u201c_ _ _ _ I_ T_E B_ _T!\u201d \u201cRight in the butt?\u201d a contestant named Tavaris guessed. While the audience and his fellow contestants laughed, Sajak simply responded, \u201cNo.\u201d After another constant revealed the correct answer was, \u201cThis is the best!,\u201d Sajak replied, \"Yeah, that's it I think! Much better answer.\" He then added, \"How you doing Tavaris? You've already made an impression on us.\" The episodes come as Sajak gets closer to closing out his time on the show after more than 40 years of hosting it. It was reported that he is scheduled to bid farewell during the season 41 finale on June 7, according to TVLine. The episode will be aptly titled \u201cThanks for the Memories,\u201d per Rotten Tomatoes, and will air one year after Sajak announced his departure.

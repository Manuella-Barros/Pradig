They appeared again in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris that same year defying the state of emergency ban placed on protesters around the Cop21 and then in the heart of Melbourne throughout Extinction Rebellion\u2019s recent autumn activism. Like empathetic apparitions of an imperilled future \u2013 the Climate Guardians\u2019 blend of performance art and peaceful protest aims to elevate climate issues into the hearts and minds of those who bear witness. They provide a powerful example of how art can be a potent tool in educating and inspiring environmental action, as well as helping viewers grieve the loss and damage already inflicted. Raising awareness Allana Beltran, a self described \u201cartivist\u201d, inspired the formation of the Climate Guardians from an anti-logging protest she performed in 2007, titled Weld Angel, dressed as an angel 10 metres high on a tripod in the Tasmanian forest. \u201cI hope the angels continue to inspire viewers to recognise that human creativity can go a long way in finding solutions to problems that are too big for the mind to work out,\u201d says Beltran. \u201cAn angel represents protection and higher human potential. Combined with environment and climate change issues, viewers possibly recognise their own human role in solving this collective life-threatening problem.\u201d According to Deborah Hart, the chair of Climarte in Melbourne, art is an effective tool in tackling the environmental breakdown by providing a deep reflection of a culture in crisis. \u201cArt informs, inspires and engages. It gets under people\u2019s ideological guards, opens hearts and minds to new ideas, new ways of perceiving and experiencing the world,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause motivating humans to take effective action on anything requires emotional engagement at a deep level, [art] helps people feel, with support and compassion, the full gravity of what is at stake from climate breakdown and shift into effective action.\u201d Climarte was founded in 2010 and is dedicated to addressing the climate emergency through art. \u201cThe depth of care that so many artists have for climate, environment and social justice issues was very much reinforced through the Climarte gallery. As the greatest existential threat in human history, there appears no end to the creative approaches that artists can bring to the climate emergency,\u201d she says. Inspiring activism For the visual ecologist Aviva Reed, art has the power to activate the ecological imagination and portray concepts that \u201cembody both beauty and grief in the same moment \u2013 creating new teachings outside of language\u201d. Reed runs a gallery and artists residency in Iluka NSW called Esk Studio, with fellow visual artist Al Stark, that seeks to create an inclusive community gathering space to elevate ecological awareness and its relation to social wellbeing. Reed says the Esk gallery (which takes its name from the nearby Esk River in the Clarence River catchment in Northern NSW) is aiming to create an inclusive gathering space that \u201ccreates a culture of beauty, inquiry, play and awareness whilst enabling a duty of care to the natural ecosystems that sustain our lives\u201d. \u201cArt has the power to activate the ecological imagination, heart and spirit and portray concepts that embody both beauty and grief in the same moment. Creating new teachings outside of language,\u201d she says. Art can hold up a mirror to colonial environmental injustice Tahlia Palmer is an interdisciplinary artist of Murri and European descent in Narrm/Melbourne whose work focuses on colonial impacts on the environment and climate change. One of her video works, Ngunmal, focuses on the link between climate change and colonialism. \u201cI make work that speaks to my experience as the descendant of dispossessed Indigenous peoples,\u201d she says. \u201cCommunicating the grief and frustration that comes with understanding how Indigenous land and water management practices were \u2013 and often continue to be \u2013 dismissed for the sake of colonial profit.", "summary": "<p>Artists can open hearts and minds to inspire environmental action, and help grieve the loss and damage already inflicted</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/change-by-degrees\">Change by Degrees</a> offers life hacks and sustainable living tips each Saturday to help reduce your household\u2019s carbon footprint</li><li>Got a question or tip for reducing household emissions?

China has accused the United States of unfair economic coercion.\n\nUnusually, Trump has distanced himself from a TikTok ban. He has otherwise championed a tough line on China, with vows to raise tariffs drastically if he returns to office.\n\nUS officials also say that Blinken will encourage China to act with restraint as Taiwan inaugurates a new president next month.\n\nChina claims the self-governing democracy as its own and has not ruled out using force to seize it.\n\nPrivately, US officials were relieved by China's approach during Taiwan's election, believing that easing US-China tensions helped. They assessed that Beijing's assertive military moves did not go beyond past precedent.\n\nA senior US official previewing Blinken's trip said that the United States and China were at a \"different place than we were a year ago, when the bilateral relationship was at an historic low point\".\n\n\"We also believe, and we have also clearly demonstrated, that responsibly managing competition does not mean we will pull back from measures to protect US national interests,\" he said.\n\nThe Biden administration's eagerness to engage China stands in stark contrast to its efforts to isolate Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nAfter initially being pleased that Beijing has not directly supplied weapons to Russia, the United States in recent weeks has accused China of lavishing industrial material and technology on Moscow.", "source": {"uri": "asianlite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Local News for British Asian and Indian Community in London"}, "authors": [],

China has accused the United States of unfair economic coercion.\n\nUnusually, Trump has distanced himself from a TikTok ban. He has otherwise championed a tough line on China, with vows to raise tariffs drastically if he returns to office.\n\nsct/reb/sn\n\nMore from this section\n\nImagine IT Launches Redesigned Website and

China has accused the United\n\nStates of unfair economic coercion.\n\nUnusually, Trump has distanced himself from a TikTok ban. He has otherwise\n\nchampioned a tough line on China, with vows to raise tariffs drastically if\n\nhe returns to office.\n\nUS officials also say that Blinken will encourage China to act with restraint\n\nas Taiwan inaugurates a new president next month.\n\nChina claims the self-governing democracy as its own and has not ruled out\n\nusing force to seize it.\n\nPrivately, US officials were relieved by China's approach during Taiwan's\n\nelection, believing that easing US-China tensions helped.\n\nThey assessed that Beijing's assertive military moves did not go beyond past\n\nprecedent.", "source": {"uri": "bssnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS)"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai",

China has accused the United States of unfair economic coercion.\n\nUnusually, Trump has distanced himself from a TikTok ban. He has otherwise championed a tough line on China, with vows to raise tariffs drastically if he returns to office.\n\nUS officials also say that Blinken will encourage China to act with restraint as Taiwan inaugurates a new president next month.\n\nChina claims the self-governing democracy as its own and has not ruled out using force to seize it.\n\nPrivately, US officials were relieved by

Nicholas Burns on his arrival in Shanghai, China, April 24, 2024. Blinken is starting three days of talks with senior Chinese officials in Shanghai and Beijing this week with U.S.-China ties at a critical point over numerous global disputes. Mark Schiefelbein/Pool via REUTERS\n\nBy Simon Lewis\n\nSHANGHAI (Reuters) -U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday called on China to provide a level playing field for American businesses as he began a visit aimed at resolving a raft of contentious issues that could jeopardise the newly repaired relationship.\n\nBlinken's trip is the latest high-level contact between the two nations that, along with working groups on issues from global trade to military communication, have tempered the public acrimony that drove relations to historic lows early last year.\n\nBut Washington and Beijing have been increasingly at odds over how American companies operate in China, Chinese exports and manufacturing capacity, and strains are also growing over Beijing's backing of Russia in its war in Ukraine.\n\nState Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said that at a meeting with China's top official in Shanghai, Chen Jining, Blinken raised concerns about China's \"trade policies and non-market economic practices.\"\n\nBlinken also \"stressed that the United States seeks a healthy economic competition with the PRC and a level playing field for U.S. workers and firms operating in China.\"\n\nThe PRC, or People's Republic of China, is the country's official name.\n\nChina has dismissed as groundless criticism that its manufacturing capacity is excessive, adding that its industries, ranging from electric vehicles to solar panels, are competitive and innovative.\n\nChen said through translators that the recent call between the leaders of both countries had helped the \"stable and healthy development of our two countries' relationship\", adding: \"Whether we choose cooperation or confrontation affects the well-being of both peoples, both countries, and the future of humanity.\"\n\nWhile in Shanghai, Blinken also spoke with American and Chinese students at New York University's local campus, where he said intercultural interactions were \"the best way to make sure that we start by hopefully understanding one another\".\n\nSUPPORT FOR RUSSIA\n\nBlinken will head to Beijing on Friday for talks with his counterpart, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, and possibly President Xi Jinping. Those meetings could be fraught.\n\nJust as Blinken landed in Shanghai, President Joe Biden signed a rare bipartisan bill that included $8 billion to counter China's military might, as well as billions in defence aid for Taiwan and $61 billion in aid to Ukraine.\n\nBiden also signed a separate bill tied to the aid legislation that bans TikTok in the U.S. if its owner, the Chinese tech firm ByteDance, fails to divest the popular short video app over the next nine months to a year.\n\nBlinken will press China to stop its firms from retooling and resupplying Russia's defence industrial base. Moscow invaded Ukraine days after agreeing a \"no limits\" partnership with Beijing, and while China has steered clear of providing arms, U.S. officials warn Chinese companies are sending dual-use technology that helps Russia's war effort.\n\nWithout providing details, a senior State Department official told reporters that Washington was prepared to \"take steps\" against Chinese firms it believes are damaging U.S. and European security.\n\nState-run China Daily said in an editorial that there was \"a huge question mark over what the discussions between Blinken and his hosts can yield\" and that both sides \"have been largely talking past each other.\"\n\n\"On the conflict in Ukraine, the world can see it clearly that the Ukraine issue is not an issue between China and the U.S., and the U.S. side should not turn it into one,\" it said.\n\nOther state media also highlighted the tensions over the differences. \"Plenty of animosity remains, primarily fuelled by Washington's adherence to a zero-sum mindset and framing China as a threat,\" a commentary in state-run Xinhua news agency said.\n\n(Reporting by Simon Lewis; Writing by Antoni Slodkowski; Editing by Christopher Cushing and Miral Fahmy)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

China has accused the United States of unfair economic coercion.\n\nUnusually, Mr. Trump has distanced himself from a TikTok ban. He has otherwise championed a tough line on China, with vows to raise tariffs drastically if he returns to office.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He plans to meet with students and business leaders before traveling to Beijing for contentious discussions with Chinese officials. Blinken's visit comes after Biden signed a foreign aid package that includes funds to counter China's influence in Taiwan and the South China Sea, and seeks to force TikTok's sale. Despite tensions, both sides acknowledge the importance of direct engagement and responsible management of the relationship. Blinken also attended a basketball game in Shanghai, where the home team lost in a close match.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken opened his first full day of meetings in China on Thursday by talking with local government officials in Shanghai.\n\nBlinken discussed local and regional issues with Chen Jining, the Chinese Communist Party Secretary of Shanghai. He also planned to speak to students and business leaders before heading to Beijing by train for what are expected to be contentious talks with national officials, including Foreign Minister Wang Yi.\n\nBlinken arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday shortly before President Joe Biden signed a $95 billion foreign aid package that has several elements likely to anger the Chinese, including $8 billion to counter China's growing aggressiveness toward Taiwan and in the South China Sea. It also seeks to force TikTok's China-based parent company to sell the social media platform.\n\nChina has railed against U.S. assistance to Taiwan, the self-governing island that it regards as a renegade province, and immediately condemned the move as a dangerous provocation. It also strongly opposes efforts to force TikTok's sale.\n\nStill, the fact that Blinken made the trip -- shortly after a conversation between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, a similar visit to China by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and a call between the U.S. and Chinese defense chiefs -- is a sign the two sides are at least willing to discuss their differences.\n\n\"I think it's important to underscore the value -- in fact, the necessity -- of direct engagement, of speaking to each other, laying out our differences, which are real, seeking to work through them,\" Blinken told Chen.\n\n\"We have an obligation for our people, indeed an obligation to the world, to manage the relationship between our two countries responsibly,\" he said. \"That is the obligation we have, and one that we take very seriously.\" Chen agreed with that sentiment and said the recent Biden-Xi call had helped the \"stable and healthy development of our two countries' relationship.\" \"Whether we choose cooperation or confrontation affects the well-being of both peoples, both countries, and the future of humanity\" he said.\n\nChen added that he hoped Blinken was able to get a \"deep impression and understanding\" of Shanghai.\n\nShortly after arriving, Blinken attended a Chinese basketball playoff game between the local Shanghai Sharks and the Zhejiang Golden Bulls, with the home team losing in the last seconds in 121-120 nailbiter.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com",

Those meetings could be fraught.\n\nJust as Blinken landed in Shanghai, President Joe Biden signed a rare bipartisan bill that included US$8 billion (S$11 billion) to counter China's military might, as well as billions in defence aid for Taiwan and US$61 billion in aid to Ukraine.\n\nBiden also signed a separate bill tied to the aid legislation that bans TikTok in the US if its owner, the Chinese tech firm ByteDance, fails to divest the popular short video app over the next nine months to a year.\n\nBlinken will press China to stop its firms from retooling and resupplying Russia's defence industrial base. Moscow invaded Ukraine days after agreeing a \"no limits\" partnership with Beijing, and while China has steered clear of providing arms, US officials warn Chinese companies are sending dual-use technology that helps Russia's war effort.\n\nWithout providing details, a senior State Department official told reporters that Washington was prepared to \"take steps\" against Chinese firms it believes are damaging US and European security.\n\nState-run China Daily said in an editorial that there was \"a huge question mark over what the discussions between Blinken and his hosts can yield\" and that both sides \"have been largely talking past each other.\"\n\n\"On the conflict in Ukraine, the world can see it clearly that the Ukraine issue is not an issue between China and the US, and the US side should not turn it into one,\" it said.\n\nOther state media also highlighted the tensions over the differences. \"Plenty of animosity remains, primarily fuelled by Washington's adherence to a zero-sum mindset and framing China as a threat,\" a commentary in state-run Xinhua news agency said.", "source": {"uri": "asiaone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AsiaOne"}, "authors": [],

China has accused the United States of unfair economic coercion.\n\nUnusually, Trump has distanced himself from a TikTok ban. He has otherwise championed a tough line on China, with vows to raise tariffs drastically if he returns to office.\n\nUS officials also say that Blinken will encourage China to act with restraint as Taiwan inaugurates a new president next month.\n\nChina claims the self-governing democracy as its own and has not ruled out using force to seize it.\n\nPrivately, US officials were relieved by China's approach during Taiwan's election, believing that easing US-China tensions helped.\n\nThey assessed that Beijing's assertive military moves did not go beyond past precedent.\n\nsct/reb/cwl\n\nMore from this section\n\nDark Matter and Total Expert partner to boost lender revenue through best-in-class mortgage automation and customer engagement California IVF

He also planned to speak to students and business leaders before heading to Beijing by train for what are expected to be contentious talks with national officials, including Foreign Minister Wang Yi.\n\nBlinken arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday shortly before President Joe Biden signed a $95 billion foreign aid package that has several elements likely to anger the Chinese, including $8 billion to counter China's growing aggressiveness toward Taiwan and in the South China Sea. It also seeks to force TikTok's China-based parent company to sell the social media platform.\n\nChina has railed against U.S. assistance to Taiwan, the self-governing island that it regards as a renegade province, and immediately condemned the move as a dangerous provocation. It also strongly opposes efforts to force TikTok's sale.\n\nStill, the fact that Blinken made the trip -- shortly after a conversation between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, a similar visit to China by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and a call between the U.S. and Chinese defense chiefs -- is a sign the two sides are at least willing to discuss their differences.\n\n''I think it's important to underscore the value -- in fact, the necessity -- of direct engagement, of speaking to each other, laying out our differences, which are real, seeking to work through them,'' Blinken told Chen.\n\n''We have an obligation for our people, indeed an obligation to the world, to manage the relationship between our two countries responsibly,'' he said. ''That is the obligation we have, and one that we take very seriously.''\n\nChen agreed with that sentiment and said the recent Biden-Xi call had helped the ''stable and healthy development of our two countries' relationship.''\n\n''Whether we choose cooperation or confrontation affects the well-being of both peoples, both countries, and the future of humanity'' he said.\n\nChen added that he hoped Blinken was able to get a ''deep impression and understanding'' of Shanghai.\n\nShortly after arriving, Blinken attended a Chinese basketball playoff game between the local Shanghai Sharks and the Zhejiang Golden Bulls, with the home team losing in the last seconds in 121-120 nailbiter.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It also strongly opposes efforts to force TikTok's sale.\n\nStill, the fact that Blinken made the trip -- shortly after a conversation between Biden and Xi, a visit to China by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and a call between the US and Chinese defense chiefs -- is a sign the two sides are at least willing to discuss their differences.\n\n\"I think it's important to underscore the value -- in fact, the necessity -- of direct engagement, of speaking to each other, laying out our differences, which are real, seeking to work through them,\" Blinken told Chen.\n\n\"We have an obligation for our people, indeed an obligation to the world, to manage the relationship between our two countries responsibly,\" he said. \"That is the obligation we have, and one that we take very seriously.\"\n\nChen agreed with that sentiment and said the recent Biden-Xi call had helped the \"stable and healthy development of our two countries' relationship.\"\n\n\"Whether we choose cooperation or confrontation affects the well-being of both peoples, both countries, and the future of humanity,\" he said.\n\nChen added that he hoped Blinken was able to get a \"deep impression and understanding\" of Shanghai, a city of skyscrapers, ports and more than 25 million people that is a magnet for commercially ambitious young people from China and abroad.\n\nMost recently, the US has raised concerns that potential overcapacity in Chinese industries -- such as electric vehicles, steel and solar panels -- might crowd out US and other foreign manufacturers.\n\nShortly after arriving, Blinken attended a Chinese basketball playoff game between the local Shanghai Sharks and the Zhejiang Golden Bulls, with the home team losing in the last seconds in a 121-120 nailbiter.\n\nWith the US presidential race heating up, it's unclear what ramifications a victory for either Biden or former President Donald Trump might have for relations. But Trump could deepen a trade war he started during his first term. His tough rhetoric on China and isolationist approach to foreign policy could ramp up uncertainties.", "source": {"uri": "businessmirror.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessMirror"},

Moscow invaded Ukraine days after agreeing a \"no limits\" partnership with Beijing, and while China has steered clear of providing arms, U.S. officials warn Chinese companies are sending dual-use technology that helps Russia's war effort.\n\nWithout providing details, a senior State Department official told reporters that Washington was prepared to \"take steps\" against Chinese firms it believes are damaging U.S. and European security.\n\nState-run China Daily said in an editorial that there was \"a huge question mark over what the discussions between Blinken and his hosts can yield\" and that both sides \"have been largely talking past each other.\"\n\n\"On the conflict in Ukraine, the world can see it clearly that the Ukraine issue is not an issue between China and the U.S., and the U.S. side should not turn it into one,\" it said.\n\nOther state media also highlighted the tensions over unresolved issues.\n\n\"Plenty of animosity remains, primarily fuelled by Washington's adherence to a zero-sum mindset and framing China as a threat,\" a commentary in state-run Xinhua news agency said.", "source": {"uri": "thestandard.com.hk", "dataType": "news", "title":

China has accused the United States of unfair economic coercion.\n\nUnusually, Trump has distanced himself from a TikTok ban. He has otherwise championed a tough line on China with vows to raise tariffs drastically if he returns to office.\n\nUS officials also say that Blinken will encourage China to act with restraint as Taiwan inaugurates a new president next month.\n\nChina claims the self-governing democracy as its own and has not ruled out using force to seize Taiwan.\n\nPrivately, US officials were relieved by China's approach during Taiwan's election, believing that easing US-China tensions helped.\n\nTheir assessment was that Beijing's assertive military moves did not go beyond past precedent.", "source":

calls on the US and China to manage their differences \"responsibly\"", "body": "US Chief of State Antony Blinken on Thursday defended the need to manage differences between the United States and China \"responsibly\" as he arrived in Beijing to discuss those differences with the Chinese authorities.\n\n\"We have an obligation to our people - and indeed to the world - to manage relations between our two countries in a responsible way,\" Blinken said on his second trip to China in less than a year.\n\nBlinken is expected to address a number of complex issues, including China's support for Russia and its relationship with Taiwan, while Beijing could raise trade concerns, including measures against the popular video app TikTok.\n\nUpon arriving in Beijing, the secretary of state immediately went to a private meeting with leading Chinese academics.\n\nOn Friday, he will have meetings all day with Chinese political leaders, including a possible meeting with President Xi Jinping, which has not been announced by local officials.\n\n\"I think it's important to stress the value - rather the necessity - of talking to each other, exposing our differences, which are real, seeking to resolve them,\" Blinken said in Shanghai, where he began his visit to China on Wednesday.\n\nThere he met with the local head of the Chinese Communist Party, Chen Jining, and attended a basketball game between two teams with American players on their squads.\n\nChen welcomed Blinken, speaking at times in English, and noted the importance of US companies in the city, China's financial capital.\n\n\"Whether we choose cooperation or confrontation affects the welfare of both peoples, both countries and the future of humanity,\" Chen said.\n\nBlinken also met in Shanghai with students at the local campus of New York University and with business leaders, to whom he said the two countries must ensure that \"the economic relationship works in a way that is mutually beneficial\".\n\nBut the more complex issues could arise in Beijing, where Blinken must call for restraint toward Taiwan, which is preparing to inaugurate a new president in May, and raise US concerns about Chinese trade practices, a key issue for President Joe Biden in an election year.\n\nThe secretary of state hopes to further defuse tensions between the world's two largest economies, which have clearly been on a downward trend since his June visit and the meeting between Presidents Biden and Xi in November.\n\nUS officials have indicated that China appears more open to Western concerns.\n\nHowever, China has expressed anger at a number of actions by the Biden administration that it believes are hurting the Chinese economy.\n\nCongress recently passed a bill that would force the Chinese owners of TikTok to sell the platform to avoid being banned in the US.\n\nBiden supported the bill on the grounds that TikTok, which is popular among young people, poses security and privacy risks, but China claims it is unfair economic coercion.\n\nThe US leader has also advocated steep tariff increases against China if he is re-elected in November.", "source": {"uri":

Biden mocks Trump's hair in personal barb Brazil judge drops case on Bolsonaro stay in Hungarian embassy\n\nBlinken's aides hope his smiling persona at public events draws an implicit contrast to his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov and his gruffer approach when he visited China earlier this month.\n\nBlinken is expected to raise concerns about China's relationship with Russia when he meets the leadership in Beijing.\n\nAlthough US officials were initially pleased that Beijing has not shipped weapons to Russia for its war in Ukraine, they now say that China's alarm at Moscow's setbacks on the battlefield has prompted it to export vast quantities of industrial supplies to Russia.\n\nUS officials believe that China is more receptive to Western concerns as it seeks to focus on managing economic headwinds at home and wants to avoid friction with the West.\n\nBut China is also furious about a series of moves by Biden -- who is facing a tough re-election fight in November against Donald Trump -- that could constrain the Chinese economy.\n\nMost recently, the US Congress approved legislation that would force the divestment of blockbuster social media app TikTok from its Chinese owners or face a ban in the world's largest economy.\n\nBiden supports the legislation, arguing that TikTok, popular among young people, poses security and privacy concerns. China has accused the United States of unfair economic coercion.\n\nUnusually, Trump has distanced himself from a TikTok ban. He has otherwise championed a tough line on China with vows to raise tariffs drastically if he returns to office.\n\nUS officials also say that Blinken will encourage China to act with restraint as Taiwan inaugurates a new president next month.\n\nChina claims the self-governing democracy as its own and has not ruled out using force to seize Taiwan.\n\nPrivately, US officials were relieved by China's approach during Taiwan's election, believing that easing US-China tensions helped.\n\nTheir assessment was that Beijing's assertive military moves did not go beyond past precedent.\n\nsct/reb/tym", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shaun_tandon@reformer.com", "name": "Shaun Tandon", "type":

China has dismissed as groundless criticism that its manufacturing capacity is excessive, adding that its industries, ranging from electric vehicles to solar panels, are competitive and innovative.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday called on China to provide a level playing field for American businesses as he began a visit aimed at resolving a raft of contentious issues that could jeopardise the newly repaired relationship. Blinken's trip is the latest high-level contact between the two nations that, along with working groups on issues from global trade to military communication, have tempered the public acrimony that drove relations to historic lows early last year.\n\nBut Washington and Beijing have been increasingly at odds over how American companies operate in China, Chinese exports and manufacturing capacity, and strains are also growing over Beijing's backing of Russia in its war in Ukraine. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said that at a meeting with China's top official in Shanghai, Chen Jining, Blinken raised concerns about China's \"trade policies and non-market economic practices.\"\n\nBlinken also \"stressed that the United States seeks a healthy economic competition with the PRC and a level playing field for U.S. workers and firms operating in China.\" The PRC, or People's Republic of China, is the country's official name.\n\nChina has dismissed as groundless criticism that its manufacturing capacity is excessive, adding that its industries, ranging from electric vehicles to solar panels, are competitive and innovative. Chen said through translators that the recent call between the leaders of both countries had helped the \"stable and healthy development of our two countries' relationship\", adding: \"Whether we choose cooperation or confrontation affects the well-being of both peoples, both countries, and the future of humanity.\"\n\nWhile in Shanghai, Blinken also spoke with American and Chinese students at New York University's local campus, where he said intercultural interactions were \"the best way to make sure that we start by hopefully understanding one another\". SUPPORT FOR RUSSIA\n\nBlinken will head to Beijing on Friday for talks with his counterpart, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, and possibly President Xi Jinping. Those meetings could be fraught. Just as Blinken landed in Shanghai, President Joe Biden signed a rare bipartisan bill that included $8 billion to counter China's military might, as well as billions in defence aid for Taiwan and $61 billion in aid to Ukraine.\n\nBiden also signed a separate bill tied to the aid legislation that bans TikTok in the U.S. if its owner, the Chinese tech firm ByteDance, fails to divest the popular short video app over the next nine months to a year. Blinken will press China to stop its firms from retooling and resupplying Russia's defence industrial base. Moscow invaded Ukraine days after agreeing a \"no limits\" partnership with Beijing, and while China has steered clear of providing arms, U.S. officials warn Chinese companies are sending dual-use technology that helps Russia's war effort.\n\nWithout providing details, a senior State Department official told reporters that Washington was prepared to \"take steps\" against Chinese firms it believes are damaging U.S. and European security. State-run China Daily said in an editorial that there was \"a huge question mark over what the discussions between Blinken and his hosts can yield\" and that both sides \"have been largely talking past each other.\"\n\n\"On the conflict in Ukraine, the world can see it clearly that the Ukraine issue is not an issue between China and the U.S., and the U.S. side should not turn it into one,\" it said. Other state media also highlighted the tensions over the differences. \"Plenty of animosity remains, primarily fuelled by Washington's adherence to a zero-sum mindset and framing China as a threat,\" a commentary in state-run Xinhua news agency said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com",

China has accused the United States of unfair economic coercion.\n\nUnusually, Trump has distanced himself from a TikTok ban. He has otherwise championed a tough line on China with vows to raise tariffs drastically if he returns to office.\n\nUS officials also say that Blinken will encourage China to act with restraint as Taiwan inaugurates a new president next month.\n\nChina claims the self-governing democracy as its own and has not ruled out using force to seize Taiwan.\n\nPrivately, US officials were relieved by China's approach during Taiwan's election, believing that easing US-China tensions helped.\n\nTheir assessment was that Beijing's assertive military moves did not go beyond past precedent.\n\nsct/reb/tym\n\nMore from this section\n\nTabloid publisher says he pledged to be Trump campaign's 'eyes and ears' during 2016 race Concordia Announces Strategic Partnership with the Fund

Biden also signed a separate bill tied to the aid legislation that bans TikTok in the U.S. if its owner, the Chinese tech firm ByteDance, fails to divest the popular short video app over the next nine months to a year.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met China's top official in Shanghai on Thursday as ties between Washington and Beijing stabilise, hoping to resolve on his trip a raft of issues that could jeopardise the newly repaired relationship. Blinken's visit is the latest high-level contact between the two nations that, along with working groups on issues from global trade to military communication, have tempered the public acrimony that drove relations to historic lows early last year.\n\nBut Washington and Beijing have made little headway on curbing China's supply of chemicals used to make fentanyl, the South China Sea remains a flashpoint, and strains are growing over Beijing's backing of Russia in its war in Ukraine. \"I think it's important to underscore the value - in fact, the necessity - of direct engagement, of speaking to each other, laying out our differences, which are real, seeking to work through them,\" Blinken told Chen Jining, the Chinese Communist Party Secretary of Shanghai, as they started their meeting.\n\nChen said through translators that the recent call between the leaders of both countries helped the \"stable and healthy development of our two countries' relationship\", adding: \"Whether we choose cooperation or confrontation affects the well-being of both peoples, both countries, and the future of humanity.\" In addition to local officials, Blinken will meet with business leaders and students before heading to Beijing for talks on Friday with his counterpart, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, and a likely meeting with President Xi Jinping.\n\nThese meetings could be fraught. Just as Blinken landed in Shanghai, President Joe Biden signed a rare bipartisan bill that included $8 billion to counter China's military might, as well as billions in defence aid for Taiwan and $61 billion in aid to Ukraine.\n\nBiden also signed a separate bill tied to the aid legislation that bans TikTok in the U.S. if its owner, the Chinese tech firm ByteDance, fails to divest the popular short video app over the next nine months to a year. SUPPORT FOR RUSSIA\n\nBlinken will press China to stop its firms from retooling and resupplying Russia's defence industrial base. Moscow invaded Ukraine days after agreeing a \"no limits\" partnership with Beijing, and while China has steered clear of providing arms, U.S. officials warn Chinese companies are sending dual-use technology that helps Russia's war effort. Without providing details, a senior State Department official told reporters that Washington was prepared to \"take steps\" against Chinese firms it believes are damaging U.S. and European security.\n\nState-run China Daily said in an editorial that there was \"a huge question mark over what the discussions between Blinken and his hosts can yield\" and that both sides \"have been largely talking past each other.\" \"On the conflict in Ukraine, the world can see it clearly that the Ukraine issue is not an issue between China and the U.S., and the U.S. side should not turn it into one,\" it said.\n\nOther state media also highlighted the tensions over unresolved issues. \"Plenty of animosity remains, primarily fuelled by Washington's adherence to a zero-sum mindset and framing China as a threat,\" a commentary in state-run Xinhua news agency said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source":

He also planned to speak to students and business leaders before heading to Beijing by train for what are expected to be contentious talks with national officials, including Foreign Minister Wang Yi.\n\nBlinken arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday shortly before President Joe Biden signed a $95 billion foreign aid package that has several elements likely to anger the Chinese, including $8 billion to counter China's growing aggressiveness toward Taiwan and in the South China Sea. It also seeks to force TikTok's China-based parent company to sell the social media platform.\n\nChina has railed against U.S. assistance to Taiwan, the self-governing island that it regards as a renegade province, and immediately condemned the move as a dangerous provocation. It also strongly opposes efforts to force TikTok's sale.\n\nStill, the fact that Blinken made the trip -- shortly after a conversation between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, a similar visit to China by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and a call between the U.S. and Chinese defense chiefs -- is a sign the two sides are at least willing to discuss their differences.\n\n\"I think it's important to underscore the value -- in fact, the necessity -- of direct engagement, of speaking to each other, laying out our differences, which are real, seeking to work through them,\" Blinken told Chen.\n\n\"We have an obligation for our people, indeed an obligation to the world, to manage the relationship between our two countries responsibly,\" he said. \"That is the obligation we have, and one that we take very seriously.\"\n\nChen agreed with that sentiment and said the recent Biden-Xi call had helped the \"stable and healthy development of our two countries' relationship.\"\n\n\"Whether we choose cooperation or confrontation affects the well-being of both peoples, both countries, and the future of humanity\" he said.\n\nChen added that he hoped Blinken was able to get a \"deep impression and understanding\" of Shanghai.\n\nShortly after arriving, Blinken attended a Chinese basketball playoff game between the local Shanghai Sharks and the Zhejiang Golden Bulls, with the home team losing in the last seconds in 121-120 nailbiter.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

State Department said.\n\nBlinken, on a three-day visit to China, raised his concerns in a meeting with Shanghai Party Secretary Chen Jining in Shanghai before leaving for the capital Beijing, said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.\n\nDemanding a \"level playing\" field for US workers and firms operating in China, Blinken said US President Joe Biden is committed to \"direct and sustained\" dialogue between the world's two largest economies after years of mounting tension.\n\nThe two sides, according to the statement, reaffirmed the importance of ties between the people of the two countries, including an expansion of exchanges between students, scholars, and business.\n\n\"We have an obligation for our people and, indeed, an obligation for the world to manage the relationship between our two countries responsibly,\" Blinken was \"ed as saying.\n\n\"And I think the direction from President Biden and President Xi was to continue to build those lines of

the stable relations\" between China and the US have not only advanced bilateral cooperation and exchange in all different aspects but also help address global challenges and promote world peace and development.\n\n\"So whether China and the U.S. choose cooperation or confrontation, it affects the well-being of both peoples of nations and also the future of humanity \u00e2\u20ac\" it is a major impact on the choice,\" he added.\n\nEarlier, Blinken also met students at the Shanghai campus of New York University, saying Washington is committed to welcoming Chinese students.\n\nBlinken is

Nicholas Burns and U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai Scott Walker, upon his arrival in Shanghai, China, April 24, 2024. Reuters-Yonhap\n\nTop US diplomat starts his China visit by attending a basketball match in Shanghai before meetings with China's top brass in Beijing\n\nSHANGHAI (AFP) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken returned Wednesday to China on his second visit in a year, as the United States ramps up pressure on its rival over its support for Russia while also seeking to manage tensions with Beijing.\n\nThe U.S. diplomat will meet China's top brass on Friday in Beijing, where he is also expected to plead for restraint as Taiwan inaugurates a new leader, and to raise U.S. concerns on Chinese trade practices -- a vital issue for President Joe Biden in an election year.\n\nBut Blinken is also seeking to stabilise ties, with tensions between the world's two largest economies palpably easing since his last visit in June.\n\nAt the time, he was the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit China in five years, and the trip was followed by a meeting between the countries' presidents in November.\n\nAt that summit in California, Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a U.S. wish list including restoring contact between militaries and cracking down on precursor chemicals to fentanyl, the powerful painkiller behind an addiction epidemic in the United States.\n\nBlinken arrived in Shanghai, where he will kick off his visit by attending a Chinese basketball play-off match between two teams with American players on their rosters.\n\nThe friendly side trip -- the first visit by a U.S. secretary of state to the bustling metropolis since Hillary Clinton in 2010 -- would have been unthinkable until recently, with hawks on both sides previously speaking of a new Cold War between the two powers.\n\nA senior U.S. official previewing Blinken's trip said the relationship between the countries was at a \"different place\" to a year ago, when it was at \"an historic low point.\"\n\nHowever, \"responsibly managing competition does not mean we will pull back from measures to protect U.S. national interests,\" he added.\n\nThe Biden administration's eagerness to engage China stands in stark contrast to its efforts to isolate Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nThe United States has accused China in recent weeks of lavishing industrial material and technology on Moscow.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns walk through the Yu Gardens in Shanghai, China, Wednesday, April 24, 2024. AP-Yonhap\n\nWashington has encouraged European leaders to stand firm on China not backing Russia, believing Beijing wants stable ties with the West as it focuses on addressing economic headwinds at home.\n\n\"If China purports on the one hand to want good relations with Europe and other countries, it can't on the other hand be fuelling what is the biggest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War,\" Blinken said Friday.\n\nThe Biden administration has trumpeted the agreement with Xi on fentanyl as a success.\n\nA State Department official said that since the November summit, China appears to have taken its first law enforcement measures on the matter since 2017, and that Blinken would be asking for further implementation.\n\nMore regular law enforcement action from Beijing against China-based companies involved in fentanyl supply chains \"would send a strong signal of China's commitment to address this issue\", the official said.\n\nOther issues likely to come up will be more fraught.\n\nThe U.S. Congress gave final approval on Tuesday night to a $95 billion package of assistance to allies including self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of its territory.\n\nIn response, China said Wednesday that U.S. military support for the island only increased the \"risk of conflict,\" and warned it would take \"resolute and effective measures to safeguard its sovereignty, security and territorial integrity.\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken dines at the Nanxiang Steamed Bun Restaurant at the Yu Gardens in Shanghai, China, April 24, 2024. Reuters-Yonhap\n\nThe U.S. Congress also approved legislation on Tuesday requiring the wildly popular social media app TikTok to be divested from its Chinese parent company ByteDance, or be shut out of the American market.\n\nAsked about the development, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry declined to respond, referring journalists to China's \"previously explained...principled position.\"\n\nBeijing has furiously denounced the plans, urging Washington to \"truly respect the principles of market economy and fair competition.\"\n\nBiden faces a rematch in November against former president Donald Trump, who has vowed a more confrontational approach against China.\n\nYun Sun, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Stimson Center, said that China's leaders, eager to focus on their economy, were in a wait-and-see mode ahead of the U.S. election.\n\n\"The Chinese understand that the Biden administration is unlikely to deliver any good news on trade because that simply does not support the election agenda,\" she said.\n\nFor Chinese leaders this year, \"their priority is to keep the relationship stable.\"\n\n\"Until there is clarity on who the next administration will be, I don't think they see a better strategy,\" she said.

Those meetings could be fraught.\n\nJust as Blinken landed in Shanghai, President Joe Biden signed a rare bipartisan bill that included $8 billion to counter China's military might, as well as billions in defence aid for Taiwan and $61 billion in aid to Ukraine.\n\nBiden also signed a separate bill tied to the aid legislation that bans TikTok in the U.S. if its owner, the Chinese tech firm ByteDance, fails to divest the popular short video app over the next nine months to a year.\n\nBlinken will press China to stop its firms from retooling and resupplying Russia's defence industrial base. Moscow invaded Ukraine days after agreeing a \"no limits\" partnership with Beijing, and while China has steered clear of providing arms, U.S. officials warn Chinese companies are sending dual-use technology that helps Russia's war effort.\n\nWithout providing details, a senior State Department official told reporters that Washington was prepared to \"take steps\" against Chinese firms it believes are damaging U.S. and European security.\n\nState-run China Daily said in an editorial that there was \"a huge question mark over what the discussions between Blinken and his hosts can yield\" and that both sides \"have been largely talking past each other.\"\n\n\"On the conflict in Ukraine, the world can see it clearly that the Ukraine issue is not an issue between China and the U.S., and the U.S. side should not turn it into one,\" it said.\n\nOther state media also highlighted the tensions over the differences. \"Plenty of animosity remains, primarily fuelled by Washington's adherence to a zero-sum mindset and framing China as a threat,\" a commentary in state-run Xinhua news agency said.\n\n(Reporting by Simon Lewis and Beijing newsroom; Writing by Antoni Slodkowski; Editing by Christopher Cushing and Miral Fahmy)", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

offensive ahead of expected tough talks.\n\nA day before meeting Beijing's top brass, Blinken visited the bustling metropolis of Shanghai where he sampled local food, watched a basketball game and strolled along the city's famous Bund promenade on the busy Huangpu River.\n\nFor all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app.\n\nVisiting the local Communist Party leader in a reception room with sweeping views of the Shanghai skyline, Blinken said President Joe Biden was committed to \"direct and sustained\" dialogue between the world's two largest economies after years of mounting tension.\n\n\"I think it's important to underscore the value -- in fact, the necessity -- of direct engagement, of speaking to each other, laying out our differences, which are real, seeking to work through them,\" Blinken said.\n\n\"We have an obligation for our people -- indeed an obligation to the world -- to manage the relationship between our two countries responsibly,\" Blinken said.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party secretary for Shanghai, Chen Jining, welcomed Blinken partly in English and spoke of the importance of US businesses to the city.\n\n\"Whether we choose cooperation or confrontation affects the well-being of both peoples, both countries and the future of humanity,\" Chen told him.\n\nShanghai, the country's financial capital, is often a stepping stone to power in China, with President Xi Jinping previously serving in the city.\n\nChina has not announced plans for Blinken to meet Xi, although on Blinken's last visit in June they saw each other in a meeting announced at the last minute.\n\nBlinken, the first US secretary of state in 14 years to visit Shanghai, opened his trip Wednesday evening at a restaurant serving steamed buns.\n\nSporting a tieless suit, he ate with his senior staff outside on wooden chairs in a shopping arcade as curious onlookers snapped pictures.\n\nBlinken then went to a basketball stadium, watching a nail-biting playoff game between the Shanghai Sharks and Zhejiang Golden Bulls until the end.\n\nRead more:\n\nTop US diplomat back in China seeking pressure but also

These include trade practices, regional security and Chinese exports benefitting Russia's war machine.\n\nAs Blinken began the trip, his second to the country in less than a year, events put to the test the relative stability of U.S.-China ties since the November summit between President Joe Biden and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.\n\nOn Wednesday, Biden signed a $95 billion aid package pledging military assistance to Ukraine, Israel and China-claimed but self-ruled Taiwan -- a bill Beijing said \"sends the wrong signal.\" The legislation will also ban TikTok if its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, fails to divest from the video-sharing app.\n\nIn Shanghai, Blinken's first stop, he met with the city's Communist Party chief, Chen Jining, raising concerns about China's trade policies and economic practices. Blinken emphasized that Washington \"seeks positive economic competition with Beijing and a level playing field for U.S. workers and firms operating in China,\" according to a State Department statement.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., with a written request for comment.\n\nThe U.S.'s $279 billion goods trade deficit with China and accusations of widespread Chinese intellectual property theft continue to be concerns for the U.S.\n\nFollowing up on U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's efforts earlier this month, Blinken is pressing China to avoid saturating global markets with low-cost goods, a practice the U.S., European Union and others fear will hurt local manufacturers.\n\nChina has refuted this, saying that Washington seeks to contain China's economic growth.\n\nBlinken is also expected to press China to halt shipments of machinery, chips and other dual civilian-military use products the U.S. says are helping Russia rebuild its military industrial base as Moscow presses its advantage in Ukraine.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Tuesday said it was \"hypocritical and highly irresponsible\" of Washington to criticize \"normal trade and economic exchanges\" between Beijing and Moscow in light of the new $61 billion in U.S. aid for Ukraine.\n\nThe diplomat is also expected to ask China not to act provocatively in the lead-up to the May 20 inauguration of Taiwanese President-elect Lai Ching-te.\n\nWhile in Shanghai, Blinken met with American business leaders and students from New York University Shanghai. He also attended a local basketball game between Shanghai and Zhejiang.\n\nDiscussions about stemming the flow of chemicals used to manufacture fentanyl, which killed more than 100,000 Americans last year, is also on the agenda, Blinken said in a video posted to social media.\n\nBlinken arrived in Beijing later on Thursday. On Friday, he will meet with Wang and possibly with Xi.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "micah_mccartney@newsweek.com", "name": "Micah

Chen is the highest-ranking local official and is a member of the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nBlinken said he would lay out \"our differences, which are real\" but seek to \"work through them\" as well as to \"build cooperation where we can.\"\n\nWelcoming the Secretary to Shanghai at the city's Grand Halls, Chen said through a translator that since the establishment of diplomatic ties, the relationship between the two nations has not always been smooth, there's always been \"twists and turns,\" \"but overall, it has progressed with historical development and progressed forward.\"\n\nBlinken was last in Shanghai in 2015 when he was deputy secretary of state.\n\n\"In a constructive and candid exchange, the secretary raised concerns about PRC trade policies and non-market economic practices and stressed that the United States seeks a healthy economic competition with the PRC and a level playing field for U.S. workers and firms operating in China,\" said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller. He was referring to People's Republic of China.\n\nDuring a discussion with American and Chinese students from New York University Shanghai, Blinken underscored the importance of expanding exchanges between students, scholars, and business.\n\n\"We need to make sure that we are talking to each other, hearing each other, understanding each other,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the State Department, the NYU Shanghai student body currently consists of nearly 2,000 undergraduate and graduate students, half of whom are from China. Students from the United States and some 70 other countries represent the other half. There are approximately 500 U.S. students.\n\nLater Thursday, Blinken met with business leaders at the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, advocating for the resolution of a range of trade issues facing the world's two largest economies.\n\nIn a brief video, Blinken said late Wednesday he is in China \"to make progress on issues that matter most to the American people, including curbing fentanyl trafficking,\" against the backdrop of Shanghai's skyline. He added that officials from the U.S. and China will also discuss other areas where the two countries have \"significant disagreements.\"\n\nWhile Washington and Beijing are divided over a range of thorny issues, Blinken began his visit to China this week focusing first on the importance of direct engagement. It is something, he says, is essential for addressing key issues affecting people from both countries and the world.\n\nAnalysts told VOA Blinken's visit will surface a range of contentious issues but also maintain \"the tactical thaw\" that gained momentum following U.S. President Joe Biden's face-to-face talks with PRC President Xi Jinping last November.\n\n\"The relationship continues to grow more competitive militarily, technologically, and diplomatically, but the increase is occurring in a more predictable, controlled manner than it was a year earlier due to both countries' continued investment in high-level diplomacy,\" Ali Wyne, a senior research and advocacy adviser for International Crisis Group, told VOA Mandarin in an email.\n\nIntensive diplomacy between Washington and Beijing has yielded little progress in curtailing China's supply of precursor chemicals used to manufacture illicit fentanyl that affects the United States. Strains are escalating due to China's support for Russia in its war on Ukraine, prompting the U.S. to warn further actions against China.\n\n\"I'm very pessimistic about this visit. Xi Jinping is committed to helping his close friend Putin and will not be very responsive to America's requests,\" Dennis Wilder, senior fellow for the Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues at Georgetown University, told VOA Mandarin.\n\nA day before Blinken departed for Shanghai, he unveiled the State Department's annual report on human rights practices, which said that the PRC government continues to commit genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. Blinken told reporters that he would raise the issue of human rights with the Beijing government.\n\nBlinken is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing Friday afternoon.\n\nThe State Department said Blinken will hold a press conference in Beijing before returning to Washington.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of America"},

He was referring to People's Republic of China.\n\nResponding later in the day, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters that Beijing \"has always been carrying out economic and trade cooperation in accordance with the principles of the market.'\n\nChina's multi-billion-dollar trade surplus with the United States, along with accusations of intellectual property theft and other practices seen as discriminating against U.S. businesses in China, have long been a source of friction in relations.\n\nDuring a discussion with U.S. and Chinese students from New York University Shanghai, Blinken underscored the importance of expanding exchanges between students, scholars, and business.\n\n'We need to make sure that we are talking to each other, hearing each other, understanding each other,' he said.\n\nAccording to the State Department, the NYU Shanghai student body currently consists of nearly 2,000 undergraduate and graduate students, half of whom are from China. Students from the United States and some 70 other countries represent the other half. There are approximately 500 U.S. students.\n\nLater Thursday, Blinken met with business leaders at the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, advocating for the resolution of a range of trade issues facing the world's two largest economies.\n\nIn a brief video, Blinken said late Wednesday he is in China \"to make progress on issues that matter most to the American people, including curbing fentanyl trafficking,\" against the backdrop of Shanghai's skyline. He added that officials from the U.S. and China will also discuss other areas where the two countries have 'significant disagreements.'\n\nWhile Washington and Beijing are divided over a range of thorny issues, Blinken began his visit to China this week focusing first on the importance of direct engagement. It is something, he said, which is essential for addressing key issues affecting people from both countries and the world.\n\nAnalysts told VOA Blinken's visit would bring up a range of contentious issues but also maintain \"the tactical thaw\" that gained momentum following U.S. President Joe Biden's face-to-face talks with PRC President Xi Jinping last November.\n\n\"The relationship continues to grow more competitive militarily, technologically, and diplomatically, but the increase is occurring in a more predictable, controlled manner than it was a year earlier due to both countries' continued investment in high-level diplomacy,\" Ali Wyne, a senior research and advocacy adviser for International Crisis Group, told VOA Mandarin in an email.\n\nIntensive diplomacy between Washington and Beijing has yielded little progress in curtailing China's supply of precursor chemicals used to manufacture illicit fentanyl that affects the United States. Tensions are escalating due to China's support for Russia in its war on Ukraine, prompting the U.S. to warn of further actions against China.\n\n\"I'm very pessimistic about this visit. Xi Jinping is committed to helping his close friend (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and will not be very responsive to America's requests,\" Dennis Wilder, senior fellow for the Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues at Georgetown University, told VOA Mandarin.\n\nA day before Blinken departed for Shanghai, he unveiled the State Department's annual report on human rights practices, which said that the PRC government continues to commit genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. Blinken told reporters that he would raise the issue of human rights with the Beijing government.\n\nBlinken is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing Friday afternoon.\n\nThe State Department said Blinken will hold a press conference in Beijing before returning to Washington.", "source": {"uri": "europesun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "europesun.com"}, "authors": [],

Read more \"We have an obligation for our people - indeed an obligation to the world - to manage the relationship between our two countries responsibly.\"\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party secretary for Shanghai, Chen Jining, welcomed Blinken partly in English and spoke of the importance of US businesses to the city.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Whether we choose cooperation or confrontation affects the well-being of both peoples, both countries and the future of humanity,\" Chen told him.\n\nThe country's financial capital, Shanghai is often a stepping stone to power in China, with President Xi Jinping previously serving briefly in the city.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nChina has not announced plans for Blinken to meet Xi, although on Blinken's last visit in June, they saw each other in a meeting announced at the last minute.\n\nBlinken, the first US secretary of state in 14 years to visit Shanghai, opened his visit yesterday evening at a restaurant serving steamed buns.\n\nSporting a suit without a tie, he ate with his senior staff outside on wooden chairs in a shopping arcade as curious onlookers snapped pictures.\n\nBlinken then went to a basketball stadium, watching a nail-biting playoff game between the Shanghai Sharks and Zhejiang Golden Bulls until the end.\n\nPressing on Russia\n\nSuch softer diplomacy, once a staple of US-China relations, would have been unimaginable until recently, with hawks in both countries previously speaking of an emerging new Cold War.\n\nBlinken's aides hope his smiling persona at public events draws an implicit contrast to his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov and his gruffer approach when he visited China earlier this month.\n\nBlinken is expected to raise concerns about China's relationship with Russia when he meets the leadership in Beijing.\n\nAlthough US officials were initially pleased that Beijing has not shipped weapons to Russia for its war in Ukraine, they now say that China's alarm at Moscow's setbacks on the battlefield has prompted it to export vast quantities of industrial supplies to Russia.\n\nUS officials believe that China is more receptive to western concerns as it seeks to focus on managing economic headwinds at home and wants to avoid friction with the west.\n\nBut China is also furious about a series of moves by Biden - who is facing a tough re-election fight in November against Donald Trump - that could constrain the Chinese economy.\n\nMost recently, the US Congress approved legislation that would force the divestment of blockbuster social media app TikTok from its Chinese owners or face a ban in the world's largest economy.\n\nBiden supports the legislation, arguing that TikTok, popular among young people, poses security and privacy concerns. China has accused the US of unfair economic coercion.\n\nUnusually, Trump has distanced himself from a TikTok ban.\n\nHe has otherwise championed a tough line on China with vows to raise tariffs drastically if he returns to office.\n\nUS officials also say that Blinken will encourage China to act with restraint as Taiwan inaugurates a new president next month.\n\nChina claims the self-governing democracy as its own and has not ruled out using force to seize Taiwan.\n\nPrivately, US officials were relieved by China's approach during Taiwan's election, believing that easing US-China tensions helped.\n\nTheir assessment was that Beijing's assertive military moves did not go beyond past precedent.\n\nStay up-to-date by following Daily Express's Telegram channel.\n\nDaily Express Malaysia\n\n* Follow us on Instagram and join our Telegram and/or WhatsApp channel(s) for the latest news you don't want to miss.\n\n* Do you have access to the Daily Express e-paper and online exclusive news?

He also planned to speak to students and business leaders before heading to Beijing by train for what are expected to be contentious talks with national officials, including Foreign Minister Wang Yi.\n\nAlso Read | Cylinder Blast in Mumbai's Antop Hill Area Injures Two: Live News Updates Today.\n\nBlinken arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday shortly before President Joe Biden signed a $95 billion foreign aid package that has several elements likely to anger the Chinese, including $8 billion to counter China's growing aggressiveness toward Taiwan and in the South China Sea. It also seeks to force TikTok's China-based parent company to sell the social media platform.\n\nChina has railed against U.S. assistance to Taiwan, the self-governing island that it regards as a renegade province, and immediately condemned the move as a dangerous provocation. It also strongly opposes efforts to force TikTok's sale.\n\nAlso Read | Stadium Ban for Women To Be Reintroduced in Iran.\n\nStill, the fact that Blinken made the trip -- shortly after a conversation between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, a similar visit to China by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and a call between the U.S. and Chinese defense chiefs -- is a sign the two sides are at least willing to discuss their differences.\n\n\"I think it's important to underscore the value -- in fact, the necessity -- of direct engagement, of speaking to each other, laying out our differences, which are real, seeking to work through them,\" Blinken told Chen.\n\n\"We have an obligation for our people, indeed an obligation to the world, to manage the relationship between our two countries responsibly,\" he said. \"That is the obligation we have, and one that we take very seriously.\"\n\nChen agreed with that sentiment and said the recent Biden-Xi call had helped the \"stable and healthy development of our two countries' relationship.\"\n\n\"Whether we choose cooperation or confrontation affects the well-being of both peoples, both countries, and the future of humanity\" he said.\n\nChen added that he hoped Blinken was able to get a \"deep impression and understanding\" of Shanghai.\n\nShortly after arriving, Blinken attended a Chinese basketball playoff game between the local Shanghai Sharks and the Zhejiang Golden Bulls, with the home team losing in the last seconds in 121-120 nailbiter.

It urged Washington to cooperate in developing steady US-China business ties, according to Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin at a regular press briefing in Beijing.\n\nThe top American diplomat's trip comes amid heightened bilateral tensions, as the hawkish US election season tests a stabilization in ties brokered by Xi and President Joe Biden last year. The US leader last week blasted Beijing as \"xenophobic,\" vowed more tariffs on China and opened a probe into the Asian nation's ship industry.\n\nBlinken will try to convince Chinese officials to halt trade that has enabled Russia's defense industrial base to rebuild despite Western curbs imposed after its invasion of Ukraine. Also on the agenda are Beijing's territorial claims over the self-ruled island of Taiwan and its aggression in the South China Sea, a senior US official said.\n\nThe Communist Party's response to the prospect of sanctions and a recent barrage of trade salvos has been limited to tough talk and symbolic tit-for-tat tariffs. Xi is trying to woo foreign investors back to China and reinvigorate the world's No. 2 economy, as it battles a property crisis and a trade probes from the European Union.\n\n\"You often see the most activist Chinese response at times when they're feeling empowered and strong,\" said Jude Blanchette, an expert on China and foreign investment at Washington's Center for International and Strategic Studies. \"Right now, the leadership in Beijing is having to put out a lot of fires.\"\n\nAdding to those concerns is the threat of new sanctions. Earlier this month, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told officials in Beijing that Chinese banks helping Russia's war effort could face fresh US sanctions, as she raised concerns to top leaders about China's overcapacity. Ahead of Blinken's visit, Chinese state media called out the contradiction in trying to stabilize ties while ramping up trade rivalry.\n\n\"Why does the US side turn a normal visit into what seems like an ultimatum?\" the Communist Party's Global Times newspaper wrote in an editorial. \"If this issue is not resolved, it is like walking at night blindfolded and it will easily lead to mistakes and even danger.\"\n\nBlinken landed in China just hours after the Senate passed a $95 billion emergency aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, which could also lead to the ban of popular video-sharing app TikTok unless it divests from its Chinese parent company ByteDance Ltd. Biden signed the package into law on Wednesday.\n\nThe US delegation will seek to clearly communicate policies to Beijing in order to prevent any escalation of tensions. In recent weeks, the US met with European and Asian allies to discuss China. Blinken's trip also coincides with the US and Philippines conducting military exercises near the disputed South China Sea and Taiwan.\n\nUS officials are unlikely to walk away from meetings this week with many concrete breakthroughs or deliverables. While there are signs the relationship has stabilized, the two countries have continued to dispute over issues spanning trade, technology, human rights, Ukraine, North Korea and the Middle East, where Blinken has sought to enlist Beijing's help to pressure Iran.\n\nCalling US-China ties \"consequential\" for the whole world, Blinken stressed the importance of sending more Americans to study in the Asian nation, during a talk at New York University Shanghai. The US has gone from 15,000 students a decade ago to just 800, he added.\n\n\"That's a really important way to make sure that we avoid miscommunications and misperceptions,\" Blinken said, of academic exchanges, \"even where we have profound differences.\"", "source": {"uri": "ajot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Journal of Transportation | AJOT | 1-800-599-6358"}, "authors": [],

It also strongly opposes efforts to force TikTok's sale.\n\nStill, the fact that Mr Blinken made the trip -- shortly after a conversation between Mr Biden and Mr Xi, a visit to China by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and a call between the US and Chinese defence chiefs -- is a sign the two sides are at least willing to discuss their differences.\n\n\"I think it's important to underscore the value -- in fact, the necessity -- of direct engagement, of speaking to each other, laying out our differences, which are real, seeking to work through them,\" Mr Blinken told Mr Chen.\n\n\"We have an obligation for our people, indeed an obligation to the world, to manage the relationship between our two countries responsibly,\" he said. \"That is the obligation we have, and one that we take very seriously.\"\n\nMr Chen agreed with that sentiment and said the recent Biden-Xi call had helped the \"stable and healthy development of our two countries' relationship\".\n\n\"Whether we choose co-operation or confrontation affects the well-being of both peoples, both countries, and the future of humanity,\" he said.\n\nMr Chen added that he hoped Mr Blinken was able to get a \"deep impression and understanding\" of Shanghai, a city of skyscrapers, ports and more than 25 million people that is a magnet for commercially ambitious young people from China and abroad.\n\nMost recently, the US has raised concerns that potential overcapacity in Chinese industries -- such as electric vehicles, steel and solar panels -- might crowd out US and other foreign manufacturers.\n\nShortly after arriving, Mr Blinken attended a Chinese basketball play-off game between the local Shanghai Sharks and the Zhejiang Golden Bulls, with the home team losing in the last seconds in a 121-120 nailbiter.\n\nWith the US presidential race heating up, it is unclear what ramifications a victory for either Mr Biden or former president Donald Trump might have for relations.\n\nBut Mr Trump could deepen a trade war he started during his first term. His tough rhetoric on China and isolationist approach to foreign policy could ramp up uncertainties.", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Telegraph"},

the two sides is a \u2018necessity\u2019\n\nWashington has floated the possibility of placing more tariffs on Chinese goods such as electric vehicles to prevent them \u2018flooding\u2019 the market and undercutting US firms\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken raised concerns about China\u2019s \u201cnon-market practices\u201d on the second day of his visit to the country.\n\nIn a meeting with Shanghai party chief Chen Jining on Thursday morning, Blinken opened by saying: \u201cIt\u2019s important to underscore the value \u2013 in fact, the necessity \u2013 of direct engagement, of sustained engagement, of speaking to each other, laying out our differences which are real, seeking to work through them, and also looking for ways to build cooperation where we can.\n\n\u201cWe have an obligation for our people and, indeed, an obligation for the world to manage the relationship between our two countries responsibly.\u201d\n\nBlinken\u2019s visit, his second to the country in the space of 12 months, comes as the United States and China are stepping up official contacts in an effort to stop relations deteriorating further due to their ongoing disputes over issues such as trade and Taiwan.\n\nUS State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said after the meeting that Blinken called for a level playing field for American companies while also raising concerns about China\u2019s \u201cnon-market economic practices\u201d, according to Reuters.US trade report keeps China on priority watch list as Blinken visit begins\n\nThe US has accused China of undermining the interests of American firms through unfair competition and manufacturing \u201covercapacity\u201d, floating the possibility of placing further tariffs on Chinese goods such as electric vehicles and metals to stop them \u201cflooding\u201d the market.\n\nThe Chinese commerce ministry said on Thursday that accusations about overcapacity are \u201cunreasonable\u201d, and warned they may damage business confidence and global green development.\n\nChen, who is also a member of the Chinese Politburo, told Blinken in the meeting that Shanghai is home to more than 8,000 American companies.\n\nChen said that stable relations between the two countries \u201chave not only advanced our cooperation and exchange in all different aspects\u201d but also \u201chelp address global challenges and help promote world peace and development\u201d, according to a transcript of his opening remarks by the State Department.\n\n\u201cSo whether China and the US choose cooperation or confrontation, it affects the well-being of both peoples of nations and also the future of humanity,\u201d he added.\n\nIn a separate statement released by the Shanghai government, Chen said the city will continue to help foreign investors and support cooperation.\n\n\u201cWe will always adhere to the direction of marketisation, rule of law and internationalisation, continue to optimise the business environment, provide efficient and convenient services, and support all types of enterprises to continue to develop in Shanghai and achieve win-win development.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to students at New York University\u2019s campus in Shanghai later in the day, Blinken said the relationship between the two countries is one of the world\u2019s most \u201cconsequential\u201d and \u201ccomplicated\u201d but emphasised the importance of communication.\n\nHe said more than 100,000 new visas had been granted to Chinese students last year, adding that both countries are working to ensure students feel welcome to study in the other country.\n\nChinese ambassador to the US Xie Feng said in January that more than a dozen Chinese students with valid visas were being denied entry to the US every month after interrogation by immigration officials.\n\nBlinken also met members of the American business community at the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai on Thursday afternoon, including Shanghai chamber chairman Allan Gabor and president Eric Zheng.\n\n\u201cUS companies in China appreciate the US government\u2019s efforts to continue engaging with China, which will be of great benefit to both sides,\u201d Gabor said in a statement.\n\nFollowing that meeting Blinken travelled on to Beijing, where he was due to meet academics later in the day.\n\nOn Friday he is expected to meet his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, and possibly President Xi Jinping as well.US is \u2018stubbornly\u2019 trying to contain China, Beijing says ahead of Blinken visit\n\nThe talks are expected to cover some of the most challenging issues in their bilateral relations, including trade, Taiwan, Ukraine,and the Middle East.\n\nOn Wednesday President Joe Biden approved a US$95 billion aid package for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan on Wednesday and signed a bill into law that requires app TikTok to be divested from its Chinese parent company Bytedance or be banned in the US.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington has warned that the move \u201cputs the US on the wrong side of the principles of fair competition and international trade rules\u201d.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com",

also stability", "body": "SHANGHAI -- US Secretary of State Antony Blinken returned Wednesday to China on his second visit in a year, as the United States ramps up pressure on its rival over its support for Russia while also seeking to manage tensions with Beijing.\n\nThe US diplomat will meet China's top brass on Friday in Beijing, where he is also expected to plead for restraint as Taiwan inaugurates a new leader, and to raise US concerns on Chinese trade practices -- a vital issue for President Joe Biden in an election year.\n\nBut Blinken is also seeking to stabilize ties, with tensions between the world's two largest economies palpably easing since his last visit in June.\n\nAt the time, he was the highest-ranking US official to visit China in five years, and the trip was followed by a meeting between the countries' presidents in November.\n\nREAD: Xi, Blinken agree to stabilize US-China relations in Beijing talks\n\nAt that summit in California, Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a US wish list including restoring contact between militaries and cracking down on precursor chemicals to fentanyl, the powerful painkiller behind an addiction epidemic in the United States.\n\nBlinken arrived in Shanghai, where he will kick off his visit by attending a Chinese basketball play-off match between two teams with American players on their rosters.\n\nThe friendly side trip -- the first visit by a US secretary of state to the bustling metropolis since Hillary Clinton in 2010 -- would have been unthinkable until recently, with hawks on both sides previously speaking of a new Cold War between the two powers.\n\nPressing on Russia\n\nA senior US official previewing Blinken's trip said that the United States and China were at a \"different place than we were a year ago, when the bilateral relationship was at an historic low point\".\n\n\"We also believe, and we have also clearly demonstrated, that responsibly managing competition does not mean we will pull back from measures to protect US national interests,\" he said.\n\nREAD: Chinese embassy in PH blames US anew for South China Sea tension\n\nThe Biden administration's eagerness to engage China stands in stark contrast to its efforts to isolate Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nAfter initially being pleased that Beijing has not directly supplied weapons to Russia, the United States has accused China in recent weeks of lavishing industrial material and technology on Moscow.\n\nWashington has encouraged European leaders, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who recently visited Beijing, to stand firm on China not backing Russia, believing that it wants stable ties with the West as it focuses on addressing economic headwinds at home.\n\n\"If China purports on the one hand to want good relations with Europe and other countries, it can't on the other hand be fuelling what is the biggest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War,\" Blinken said Friday after Group of Seven talks in Capri, Italy.\n\nProgress on fentanyl\n\nThe Biden administration has trumpeted the agreement with Xi on fentanyl as a success.\n\nA State Department official said that since the November summit, China appears to have taken its first law enforcement measures on the matter since 2017.\n\nBlinken will ask for further implementation, the official said.\n\n\"More regular PRC law enforcement action against PRC-based chemical companies and pill press manufacturers involved in illicit fentanyl supply chains would send a strong signal of China's commitment to address this issue,\" the official said, referring to the People's Republic of China.\n\nAnother source of friction between the two countries is legislation that cleared the US Congress on Tuesday -- and which Biden intends to sign -- requiring the wildly popular social media app TikTok to be divested from its Chinese parent company ByteDance, or be shut out of the American market.\n\nBiden faces a rematch in November against former president Donald Trump, who has vowed a more confrontational approach against China.\n\nYun Sun, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Stimson Center, said that China's leaders, eager to focus on their economy, were in a wait-and-see mode ahead of the US election.\n\n\"The Chinese understand that the Biden administration is unlikely to deliver any good news on trade because that simply does not support the election agenda,\" she said.\n\nFor Chinese leaders this year, \"their priority is to keep the relationship stable\".\n\n\"Until there is clarity on who the next administration will be, I don't think they see a better strategy,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "globalnation.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

President Joe Biden has called to triple tariffs on steel and aluminum from China.\n\nAmid a property crisis and weak consumption, China is seeking to boost its underperforming economy by pouring money into the manufacturing sector. By shifting policy focus toward what it calls the \"new three\" growth areas of electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, and photovoltaics, it has flooded the global market with low-priced Chinese products in these sectors.\n\nEarlier this month, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen confronted senior Chinese officials about the country's overproduction, saying it is \"too large for the rest of the world to absorb this enormous capacity.\"\n\n\"When the global market is flooded by artificially cheap Chinese products, the viability of American and other foreign firms is put into question,\" Ms. Yellen said as she wrapped up her trip to China.\n\nDespite the growing backlash over its trade practices, the Chinese regime appeared undeterred. At a regular briefing later on Thursday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin contended that the regime conducted economic and trade cooperation \"in accordance with market principles.\"\n\nHe called Washington to work with the regime to \"create favorable conditions for the sound and stable development of China-U.S. economic and trade relations.\"\n\nFollowing the meeting with Mr. Chen, Mr. Blinken held talks with business leaders at the American Chamber of Commerce's Shanghai branch.\n\nBefore heading to Beijing later Thursday, Mr. Blinken also spoke with students at New York University's campus in Shanghai, where he highlighted the importance of intercultural exchange between the two countries.\n\nMr. Blinken's second trip to China as secretary of state took place as the United States and communist China remained at odds on a series of issues ranging from the crisis in Ukraine and the Middle East to the status of Taiwan.\n\nJust hours before Mr. Bliken's arrival, the U.S. Congress gave final approval to a defense package that includes roughly $8 billion for Taiwan and other partners in the Indo-Pacific region to confront Chinese aggression. The legislation could also bar TikTok from operating in the United States, unless its China-based parent company, ByteDance, sells the stakes within a year. Later on Wednesday, President Biden signed it into law.\n\nChina has voiced objections to U.S. aid to Taiwan, a self-ruled island that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) viewed as a breakaway province, warning that it \"will not bring security\" to Taipei.\n\nMr. Blinken is set to meet Wang Yi, the CCP's top diplomat, on Friday. China hasn't confirmed whether Mr. Blinken will sit down with Xi Jinping, the Party's boss. Mr. Xi received the visiting secretary of state in Beijing last July, but their talk wasn't publicly confirmed until shortly before it took place.\n\nThe top U.S. diplomat is likely to have tough talks in Beijing, where he will press the CCP leaders to curtail its support for Russia's defense industrial base amid the Ukraine war.\n\nFollowing meetings with G7 foreign ministers in Italy earlier this month, Mr. Blinken called China a \"primary contributor\" to Russia's defense, saying it sent \"machine tools, semi-conductors, other dual-use items\" to keep Moscow's defense sector afloat.\n\nThe secretary of state will also raise U.S. concerns about human rights in China, according to the State Department. A day before his trip, the State Department released a report that Mr. Blinken said documented the \"ongoing grave human rights abuses\" in China. The groups targeted by the Chinese communist regime include persecuted minority groups, dissidents, foreign journalists, and adherents of spiritual faiths.\n\nRobert Gilchrist, a senior official for the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Affairs, told reporters that Mr. Bliken will \"raise human rights at the highest levels and in the clearest way\" while in China.",

Chen is the highest-ranking local official and is a member of the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nBlinken said he would lay out \"our differences, which are real\" but seek to \"work through them\" as well as to \"build cooperation where we can.\"\n\nWelcoming the Secretary to Shanghai at the city's Grand Halls, Chen said through a translator that since the establishment of diplomatic ties, the relationship between the two nations has not always been smooth, there's always been \"twists and turns,\" \"but overall, it has progressed with historical development and progressed forward.\"\n\nBlinken was last in Shanghai in 2015 when he was deputy secretary of state.\n\n\"In a constructive and candid exchange, the secretary raised concerns about PRC trade policies and non-market economic practices and stressed that the United States seeks a healthy economic competition with the PRC and a level playing field for U.S. workers and firms operating in China,\" said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller. He was referring to People's Republic of China.\n\nDuring a discussion with American and Chinese students from New York University Shanghai, Blinken underscored the importance of expanding exchanges between students, scholars, and business.\n\n\"We need to make sure that we are talking to each other, hearing each other, understanding each other,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the State Department, the NYU Shanghai student body currently consists of nearly 2,000 undergraduate and graduate students, half of whom are from China. Students from the United States and some 70 other countries represent the other half. There are approximately 500 U.S. students.\n\nLater Thursday, Blinken met with business leaders at the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, advocating for the resolution of a range of trade issues facing the world's two largest economies.\n\nIn a brief video, Blinken said late Wednesday he is in China \"to make progress on issues that matter most to the American people, including curbing fentanyl trafficking,\" against the backdrop of Shanghai's skyline. He added that officials from the U.S. and China will also discuss other areas where the two countries have \"significant disagreements.\"\n\nCredit : Voice of America (VOA), Photo Credit : Associated Press (AP)", "source": {"uri": "newdelhitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Delhi Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Jining", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chen Jining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University_Shanghai", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York University Shanghai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Deputy_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Deputy Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voice of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Chamber_of_Commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Chamber of Commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Postgraduate education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergraduate_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Undergraduate education"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Taoism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Taoism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://jetpack.com/redirect/?source=sigenerate&query=t%3DeyJpbWciOiJodHRwczpcL1wvd3d3Lm5ld2RlbGhpdGltZXMuY29tXC93cC1jb250ZW50XC91cGxvYWRzXC8yMDI0XC8wNFwvMDEwMDAwMDAtMGFmZi0wMjQyLWM1NTUtMDhkYzY0ZTk0ZDk2X3cxMDIzX3IxX3MuYXZpZiIsInR4dCI6IkJsaW5rZW4ga2lja3Mgb2ZmIGRpcmVjdCBlbmdhZ2VtZW50IHdpdGggQ2hpbmEgYWhlYWQgb2YgdG91Z2ggdGFsa3MiLCJ0ZW1wbGF0ZSI6ImZ1bGxzY3JlZW4iLCJibG9nX2lkIjozNzU2MDYzM30.KGe5x9SjSe_Rz6a8CO7dt1mlhZAt_rBTWVlzmYVDmE8MQ", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508500", "eventUri": "eng-9508500", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

pressure but also stability", "body": "U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken returned on April 24 to China on his second visit in a year, as the United States ramps up pressure on its rival over its support for Russia while also seeking to manage tensions with Beijing.\n\nThe U.S. diplomat will meet China's top brass on Friday in Beijing, where he is also expected to plead for restraint as Taiwan inaugurates a new leader, and to raise U.S. concerns on Chinese trade practices -- a vital issue for President Joe Biden in an election year.\n\nAlso Read | China is boosting Russia's war machine in Ukraine, says U.S.\n\nBut Mr. Blinken is also seeking to stabilise ties, with tensions between the world's two largest economies palpably easing since his last visit in June.\n\nAt the time, he was the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit China in five years, and the trip was followed by a meeting between the countries' presidents in November.\n\nAt that summit in California, Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a U.S. wish list including restoring contact between militaries and cracking down on precursor chemicals to fentanyl, the powerful painkiller behind an addiction epidemic in the United States.\n\nG7 slams Chinese firms' military help for Russia\n\nMr. Blinken arrived in Shanghai, where he will kick off his visit by attending a Chinese basketball play-off match between two teams with American players on their rosters.\n\nThe friendly side trip -- the first visit by a U.S. secretary of state to the bustling metropolis since Hillary Clinton in 2010 -- would have been unthinkable until recently, with hawks on both sides previously speaking of a new Cold War between the two powers.\n\nPressing on Russia\n\nA senior U.S. official previewing Mr. Blinken's trip said the relationship between the countries was at a \"different place\" to a year ago, when it was at \"an historic low point\".\n\nHowever, \"responsibly managing competition does not mean we will pull back from measures to protect U.S. national interests\", he added.\n\nThe Biden administration's eagerness to engage China stands in stark contrast to its efforts to isolate Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nThe United States has accused China in recent weeks of lavishing industrial material and technology on Moscow.\n\nWashington has encouraged European leaders to stand firm on China not backing Russia, believing Beijing wants stable ties with the West as it focuses on addressing economic headwinds at home.\n\n\"If China purports on the one hand to want good relations with Europe and other countries, it can't on the other hand be fuelling what is the biggest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War,\" Mr. Blinken said Friday.\n\nProgress on fentanyl\n\nThe Biden administration has trumpeted the agreement with Mr. Xi on fentanyl as a success.\n\nA State Department official said that since the November summit, China appears to have taken its first law enforcement measures on the matter since 2017, and that Mr. Blinken would be asking for further implementation.\n\nMore regular law enforcement action from Beijing against China-based companies involved in fentanyl supply chains \"would send a strong signal of China's commitment to address this issue\", the official said.\n\nRaisina Dialogue | West pushing Russia closer to China: Jaishankar\n\nOther issues likely to come up will be more fraught.\n\nThe U.S. Congress gave final approval on Tuesday night to a $95 billion package of assistance to allies including self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of its territory.\n\nIn response, China said Wednesday that U.S. military support for the island only increased the \"risk of conflict\", and warned it would take \"resolute and effective measures to safeguard its sovereignty, security and territorial integrity\".\n\nThe U.S. Congress also approved legislation on Tuesday requiring the wildly popular social media app TikTok to be divested from its Chinese parent company ByteDance, or be shut out of the American market.\n\nAsked about the development, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry declined to respond, referring journalists to China's \"previously explained... principled position\".\n\nBeijing has furiously denounced the plans, urging Washington to \"truly respect the principles of market economy and fair competition\".\n\nAlso Read | Xi Jinping says Putin's re-election 'fully reflects' support of Russian people\n\nMr. Biden faces a rematch in November against former president Donald Trump, who has vowed a more confrontational approach against China.\n\nYun Sun, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Stimson Center, said that China's leaders, eager to focus on their economy, were in a wait-and-see mode ahead of the U.S. election.\n\n\"The Chinese understand that the Biden administration is unlikely to deliver any good news on trade because that simply does not support the election agenda,\" she said.\n\nFor Chinese leaders this year, \"their priority is to keep the relationship stable\".\n\n\"Until there is clarity on who the next administration will be, I don't think they see a better strategy,\" she said.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This was \"a false narrative\" whose \"evil intention\" was to curb China's industrial development, it said.\n\nThe ministry also lashed back at US accusations on Ukraine, saying \"China is not the creator or party to the Ukraine crisis\", while also charging the US with interfering in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in the contested South China Sea, which Beijing claims almost in its entirety.\n\nThe Biden administration has expressed particular concern that clashes in recent weeks between Chinese vessels and the Philippine navy in the South China Sea could trigger its mutual defence treaty with Manila.\n\nAnalysts said the increased US-China dialogue in recent months reflected an interest from both sides in stabilising relations before the US presidential election campaign gets into full swing this year.\n\nChina needs the relationship to be on a more stable footing to support its economic recovery, while the Biden administration wants to show it can responsibly manage ties while still being seen to be firm with Beijing, said Zhao Minghao, professor and deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University.\n\n\"Both sides have the willingness to maintain the openness of communication but so far, I think the practical results are still limited,\" said Zhao.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed concerns about unfair trade practices as he arrived for his second state visit to China in a year in a bid to strengthen diplomacy and contain emerging flashpoints from getting out of hand.\n\nMr Blinken sought a \"level playing field for US workers and firms operating in China\" during his meeting with Chen Jining, leader of the financial hub of Shanghai, on Thursday.\n\nThee diplomat's visit comes after US president Joe Biden spoke with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on 2 April amid a potential rift over US Senate's approval of a military aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan as well as the American government move to ban TikTok if its Chinese owner ByteDance not sell the sell within nine months to a year.\n\n\"We have an obligation for our people -- indeed an obligation to the world -- to manage the relationship between our two countries responsibly,\" Mr Blinken told Mr Chen, according to the US State Department.\n\nMr Blinken also \"raised concerns about trade policies and non-market economic practices\" of China.\n\nAhead of the talks, Mr Blinken watched a basketball match, took a walk in Yu Garden and spoke to students of New York University's Shanghai campus before meeting American business owners.\n\nMr Blinken will tackle the most challenging part of the trip on Friday when he visits Beijing to meet foreign minister Wang Yi, and possibly president Xi Jinping.\n\nThe meetings are expected to be fraught as Mr Blinken is expected to call on China to stop its companies from retooling and resupplying Russia's defence industrial base amid its war in Ukraine.\n\nResponding to Mr Blinken's remarks, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin defended Beijing's trade practices.\n\n\"China has always been carrying out economic and trade cooperation in accordance with the principles of the market,\" Mr Wang said at a press conference.\n\n\"We hope that the US side will respect the principle of fair competition, abide by WTO rules and work with China to create favourable conditions for the sound and steady development of China-US economic and trade relations,\" he added.\n\nMr Blinken's visit comes in the backdrop of rising tensions, fuelled in part by campaign rhetoric as the US approaches presidential election later this year.\n\nJust last week, Mr Biden criticised Beijing as \"xenophobic\", pledged to levy more tariffs on China, and initiated an investigation into the Asian nation's ship industry.\n\nJust as Mr Blinken landed in Shanghai, the US president signed a bill that includes $8bn for countering China in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nMr Biden also signed a bill to ban TikTok in the US if its Chinese owner fails to divest the popular app over the next nine months to a year.\n\nThe Biden administration is frustrated with Beijing over its support to Russia's defence industrial base which US officials claim is allowing Moscow to subvert western sanctions.\n\nIn this context, Russia's foreign ministry on Thursday accused the US of driving a wedge between Russia and China.\n\nThe ministry's spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Moscow's relationship with China, with which it signed a \"no limits\" cooperation agreement less than three weeks before the start of the Ukraine war, wasn't directed against any other country.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5,

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday to be whisked to a basketball game and a dinner of steamed buns atop a balcony overlooking the city's Ming Dynasty Yu Garden. America's top diplomat even took time to post on Instagram from Shanghai's neo-classical Bund, where he lauded the students and business leaders \"building bridges and ties between our countries\" as the neon lights of the Lujiazui business district twinkled in the background. \"Face to face diplomacy matters,\" Blinken said, collar gaping.\n\nThe tenor was markedly different from Blinken's last visit to China in June, when bilateral relations between the world's top two economies had reached a nadir. Although Blinken was granted an audience with Chinese President Xi Jinping, the two sides entrenched their positions over every contention, from the status of Taiwan and American efforts to stymie China's technology to human-rights and Xi's support for Russia's war in Ukraine. It was only in November that a slight thaw emerged after U.S. President Joe Biden and Xi agreed to resume high-level military communication after a 16-month hiatus. (A video conference last week between both nations' top defense officials was their first significant engagement since late 2022.)\n\nYet substantively, the relationship remains broken. The same day as Blinken touched down for his three-day China visit his boss in the White House signed two pieces of legislation specifically designed to rile his host: one banning TikTok unless Beijing-based parent ByteDance divest the streaming app within nine months; and a $95 billion aid package containing $8.1 billion for the Indo-Pacific, including self-ruling Taiwan, which China sees as its sovereign territory. Both serve as \"another reminder just how much separates our two systems and governments,\" says Sean King, senior vice president focusing on Asia for consulting firm Park Strategies.\n\nSo, what can Blinken achieve? On Friday, he will meet top officials in Beijing including China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi and, likely but unconfirmed, Xi himself. Blinken will try to push China to stop providing chips and weapons-related materials to Russia's defense industry. He will also likely rebuke China for aggression against the Philippines, Taiwan, and others in the contested South China Sea. And he is expected to urge Chinese officials to use their burgeoning ties with Iran to calm tensions in the Middle East. Yet it's unlikely he will make progress on any of these fronts. \"Beijing sees just about any U.S. security headache as serving its own interests,\" says King, \"so don't expect Xi to do us any favors anytime soon.\"\n\nThat said, China's slowing economy does present an opportunity, prompting Beijing to lower its diplomatic pitch amid the dire need to attract foreign investment. China is battling deflation, record youth unemployment, local-government debt equivalent to 76% of GDP, a festering real estate crisis, and a stock market that has lost $5 trillion in value. Washington's efforts to undermine China's tech industry through exports controls is particularly damaging when the nation is looking to recalibrate its $17.52 trillion economy toward emerging technologies to drive a new era of growth.\n\n\"In a way, China overestimated itself in terms of the strength of its science and technology,\" says Xu Bin, a professor of economics and finance at the China Europe International Business School. \"Maybe you cannot hide anymore but you should not be too aggressive either. I don't know whether the government has learned their lesson.\"\n\nAnother question is whether Washington is willing to lessen its measures impeding China's economy in exchange for progress on less strategic issues. Blinken has repeatedly raised the topic of fentanyl and synthetic opioids -- whose precursors are predominantly sourced from China -- and which he pointedly flagged in his social media post from Shanghai as the leading cause of death amongst Americans aged 18 to 49. Both sides also appear aligned on the need to tackle Chinese shadow banks, which facilitate capital flight in China as well as money laundering for transnational criminal syndicates including narcotics smugglers into the U.S.\n\n\"Whether China and the U.S. choose cooperation or confrontation, it affects the well-being of both peoples, nations and also the future of humanity,\" Chen Jining, the Chinese Communist Party secretary for Shanghai, told Blinken on Thursday.\n\nWhether Washington is willing to compromise to make headway on these issues is unclear. But regardless, progress won't go far toward resetting a relationship set on divergent courses. And there is still the very real risk that things deteriorate further, with possible sanctions on major Chinese banks the \"nuclear option\" given the cascading effects across the global economy. Campaigning in Pennsylvania last week, Biden called for hiked tariffs on Chinese steel imports, with Chinese EVs also in the spotlight. With reigning in Beijing one of the few points of bilateral consensus, anti-China rhetoric will no doubt intensify from both camps as the U.S. presidential election approaches in November.\n\nStill, in Shanghai Blinken played nice, lamenting to students at the city's NYU campus on Thursday how educational exchanges between the two countries had fallen precipitously due to \"COVID and other reasons,\" with only 800 Americans studying in China today from a peak of 15,000 a decade ago. \"We'd like to build that back up,\" he said. \"It's so important to make these connections.\" For many in that room, Blinken's words will ring hollow. But like two divorcing parents, it never hurts to look friendly.", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He will meet students and business leaders in what an aide called a bid to highlight warm ties between the American and Chinese peoples.\n\nThe friendly side trip -- the first visit by a US secretary of state to the bustling metropolis since Hillary Clinton in 2010 -- would have been unthinkable until recently, with hawks on both sides previously speaking of a new Cold War between the two powers.\n\n- Pressing on Russia -\n\nA senior US official previewing Blinken's trip said that the United States and China were at a \"different place than we were a year ago, when the bilateral relationship was at an historic low point\".\n\n\"We also believe, and we have also clearly demonstrated, that responsibly managing competition does not mean we will pull back from measures to protect US national interests,\" he said.\n\nThe Biden administration's eagerness to engage China stands in stark contrast to its efforts to isolate Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nAfter initially being pleased that Beijing has not directly supplied weapons to Russia, the United States in recent weeks has accused China of lavishing industrial material and technology on Moscow.\n\nWashington has encouraged European leaders, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who recently visited Beijing, to stand firm on China not backing Russia, believing that it wants stable ties with the West as it focuses on addressing economic headwinds at home.\n\n\"If China purports on the one hand to want good relations with Europe and other countries, it can't on the other hand be fuelling what is the biggest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War,\" Blinken said Friday after Group of Seven talks in Capri, Italy.\n\n- Progress on fentanyl -\n\nThe Biden administration has trumpeted the agreement with Xi on fentanyl as a success.\n\nA State Department official said that since the November summit, China appears to have taken its first law enforcement measures on the matter since 2017.\n\nBlinken will ask for further implementation, the official said.\n\n\"More regular PRC law enforcement action against PRC-based chemical companies and pill press manufacturers involved in illicit fentanyl supply chains would send a strong signal of China's commitment to address this issue,\" the official said, referring to the People's Republic of China.\n\nAnother source of friction between the two countries is legislation that cleared the US Congress on Tuesday -- and which Biden intends to sign -- requiring the wildly popular social media app TikTok to be divested from its Chinese parent company ByteDance, or be shut out of the American market.\n\nBiden faces a rematch in November against former president Donald Trump, who has vowed a more confrontational approach against China.\n\nYun Sun, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Stimson Center, said that China's leaders, eager to focus on their economy, were in a wait-and-see mode ahead of the US election.\n\n\"The Chinese understand that the Biden administration is unlikely to deliver any good news on trade because that simply does not support the election agenda,\" she said.\n\nFor Chinese leaders this year, \"their priority is to keep the relationship stable\".\n\n\"Until there is clarity on who the next administration will be, I don't think they see a better strategy,\" she said.\n\nsct/reb/ssy\n\nMore from this section\n\nImagine IT Launches Redesigned Website and Brand Identity to empower Midwest Businesses with Next Generation IT support Kelly Auto

Beijing hoped that the US would respect the principle of fair competition, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said in Beijing on Thursday.\n\n\"We have an obligation for our people and, indeed, an obligation for the world to manage the relationship between our two countries responsibly,\" Blinken told Chen as reporters looked on. \"That is the obligation that we have and one that we take very seriously.\"\n\nThe direction from US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping was \"to deal directly with our differences as we also seek to build cooperation,\" Blinken said, referring to the meeting between the two leaders in San Francisco in November.\n\nChen responded that since diplomatic ties were launched 45 years ago, the relationship had not always been smooth but also had progressed.\n\n\"The constructive interactions and the stable relation between China and the US have not only advanced our cooperation and exchange in all different aspects, and also help address global challenges, and helps promote world peace and development,\" he said, according to the US State Department.\n\nBlinken later landed in Beijing, where further talks were to be held.\n\nEconomic ties have been under strain for some time, with the two countries trading allegations of unfair trading practices.\n\nWashington has imposed sanctions on Chinese companies for supplying goods to Russia that could find use in its war in Ukraine, and a new US law forcing China's ByteDance to sell its stake in the TikTok video platform has caused irritation in Beijing.", "source": {"uri":

that summit in San Francisco, California, Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a US wish list, including restoring contact between militaries and cracking down on precursor chemicals to fentanyl, the powerful painkiller behind an addiction epidemic in the US.\n\nBlinken opened his visit on Wednesday in Shanghai, where he was to meet students and business leaders in what an aide called a bid to highlight warm ties between the American and Chinese peoples.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe friendly side trip -- the first visit by a US secretary of state to the bustling metropolis since Hillary Clinton in 2010 -- would have been unthinkable until recently, with hawks on both sides previously speaking of a new Cold War between the two powers.\n\nPressing on Russia\n\nA senior US official previewing Blinken's trip said the US and China were at a \"different place than we were a year ago, when the bilateral relationship was at an historic low point.\"\n\n\"We also believe, and we have also clearly demonstrated, that responsibly managing competition does not mean we will pull back from measures to protect US national interests,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Biden administration's eagerness to engage China stands in stark contrast to its efforts to isolate Russia since it invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nAfter initially being pleased that Beijing has not directly supplied weapons to Russia, the US in recent weeks has accused China of lavishing industrial material and technology on Moscow.\n\nWashington has encouraged European leaders, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who recently visited Beijing, to stand firm on China not backing Russia, believing that it wants stable ties with the West as it focuses on addressing economic headwinds at home.\n\n\"If China purports on the one hand to want good relations with Europe and other countries, it can't, on the other hand, be fueling what is the biggest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War,\" Blinken said on Friday after a Group of Seven foreign minister's summit on Italy's western Capri island.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProgress on fentanyl\n\nThe Biden administration has trumpeted the agreement with Xi on fentanyl as a success.\n\nA State Department official said that since the November summit, China appeared to have taken its first law enforcement measures on the matter since 2017.\n\nBlinken will ask for further implementation, the official added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"More regular PRC law enforcement action against PRC-based chemical companies and pill press manufacturers involved in illicit fentanyl supply chains would send a strong signal of China's commitment to address this issue,\" the official said, referring to the People's Republic of China.\n\nAnother source of friction between the two countries is legislation that cleared the US Congress on Tuesday -- and which Biden intends to sign -- requiring the wildly popular social media app TikTok to be divested from its Chinese parent company ByteDance, or be shut out of the American market.", "source": {"uri": "manilatimes.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Manila times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

leader, and to raise US concerns on Chinese trade practices -- a vital issue for President Joe Biden in an election year.\n\nBut Blinken is also seeking to stabilise ties, with tensions between the

Blinken is also set to hold talks with American business leaders in Shanghai, amid complaints of unfair treatment of foreign firms, before heading to Beijing for meetings on Friday, including a possible face-to-face with President Xi Jinping.\n\nThe top American diplomat's trip comes amid heightened bilateral tensions, as the hawkish US election season tests a stabilisation in ties brokered by Xi and President Joe Biden last year. The US leader last week blasted Beijing as \"xenophobic\", vowed more tariffs on China and opened a probe into the Asian nation's ship industry.\n\nBlinken will try to convince Chinese officials to halt trade that has enabled Russia's defence industrial base to rebuild despite Western curbs imposed after its invasion of Ukraine. Also on the agenda are Beijing's territorial claims over the self-ruled island of Taiwan and its aggression in the South China Sea, a senior US official said.\n\nIn Shanghai today with @SecBlinken. He's meeting the Shanghai Communist Party boss Chen Jining now, before speaking to some American businesses. We're set to depart for Beijing later today. pic.twitter.com/dyTGes1Sl6\n\n-- Iain Marlow (@iainmarlow) April 25, 2024\n\nThe Communist Party's response to the prospect of sanctions and a recent barrage of trade salvoes has been limited to tough talk and symbolic tit-for-tat tariffs. Xi is trying to woo foreign investors back to China and reinvigorate the world's No. 2 economy, as it battles a property crisis and a trade probe from the European Union.\n\n\"You often see the most activist Chinese response at times when they're feeling empowered and strong,\" said Jude Blanchette, an expert on China and foreign investment at Washington's Center for International and Strategic Studies. \"Right now, the leadership in Beijing is having to put out a lot of fires.\"\n\nAdding to those concerns is the threat of new sanctions. Earlier this month, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told officials in Beijing that Chinese banks helping Russia's war effort could face fresh US sanctions, as she raised concerns to top leaders about China's overcapacity. Ahead of Blinken's visit, Chinese state media called out the contradiction in trying to stabilise ties while ramping up trade rivalry.\n\n\"Why does the US side turn a normal visit into what seems like an ultimatum?\" the Communist Party's Global Times newspaper wrote in an editorial. \"If this issue is not resolved, it is like walking at night blindfolded and it will easily lead to mistakes and even danger.\"\n\nBlinken landed in China just hours after the Senate passed a $95-billion emergency aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, which could also lead to the ban of popular video-sharing app TikTok unless it divests from its Chinese parent company ByteDance Ltd. Biden signed the package into law on Wednesday.\n\nThe US delegation will seek to clearly communicate policies to Beijing in order to prevent any escalation of tensions. In recent weeks, the US met with European and Asian allies to discuss China. Blinken's trip also coincides with the US and Philippines conducting military exercises near the disputed South China Sea and Taiwan.\n\nUS officials are unlikely to walk away from meetings this week with many concrete breakthroughs or deliverables. While there are signs the relationship has stabilised, the two countries have continued to dispute over issues spanning trade, technology, human rights, Ukraine, North Korea and the Middle East, where Blinken has sought to enlist Beijing's help to pressure Iran.\n\nThe large delegation travelling with Blinken underscores the varied topics for discussion in Shanghai and Beijing this week.\n\nHe is accompanied by Daniel Kritenbrink, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs; Sarah Beran, National Security Council senior director for China and Taiwan affairs; Elizabeth Allen, under secretary for public diplomacy and public affairs; Todd Robinson, assistant secretary of state for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs; as well as Nathan Fick, ambassador-at-large for cyberspace and digital policy.", "source": {"uri": "dailymaverick.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Maverick"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Blinken will start his visit on Wednesday in Shanghai.\n\nWhile in the city, he will meet students and business leaders in what an aide called a bid to highlight warm ties between the American and Chinese peoples.\n\nThe friendly side trip -- the first visit by a US secretary of state to the bustling metropolis since Hillary Clinton in 2010 -- would have been unthinkable until recently, with hawks on both sides previously speaking of a new Cold War between the two powers.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen similarly toured the manufacturing hub of Guangzhou before visiting Beijing earlier this month.\n\nPressing on Russia\n\nA senior US official previewing Blinken's trip said that the United States and China were at a \"different place than we were a year ago, when the bilateral relationship was at an historic low point\".\n\n\"We also believe, and we have also clearly demonstrated, that responsibly managing competition does not mean we will pull back from measures to protect US national interests,\" he said.\n\nThe Biden administration's eagerness to engage China stands in stark contrast to its efforts to isolate Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nAfter initially being pleased that Beijing has not directly supplied weapons to Russia, the United States in recent weeks has accused China of lavishing industrial material and technology on Moscow.\n\nWashington has encouraged European leaders, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who recently visited Beijing, to stand firm on China not backing Russia, believing that it wants stable ties with the West as it focuses on addressing economic headwinds at home.\n\n\"If China purports on the one hand to want good relations with Europe and other countries, it can't on the other hand be fuelling what is the biggest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War,\" Blinken said Friday after Group of Seven talks in Capri, Italy.\n\nProgress on fentanyl\n\nThe Biden administration has trumpeted the agreement with Xi on fentanyl as a success. A State Department official said that since the November summit, China appears to have taken its first law enforcement measures on the matter since 2017.\n\nBlinken will ask for further implementation, the official said.\n\n\"More regular PRC law enforcement action against PRC-based chemical companies and pill press manufacturers involved in illicit fentanyl supply chains would send a strong signal of China's commitment to address this issue,\" the official said, referring to the People's Republic of China.\n\nOne source of friction between the two countries is new legislation that cleared the US Congress on Tuesday -- and which Biden intends to sign -- requiring the wildly popular social media app TikTok to be divested from its Chinese parent company ByteDance, or be shut out of the American market.\n\nBiden faces a rematch in November against former president Donald Trump, who has vowed a more confrontational approach against China.\n\nYun Sun, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Stimson Center, said that China's leaders, eager to focus on their economy, were in a wait-and-see mode ahead of the US election.\n\n\"The Chinese understand that the Biden administration is unlikely to deliver any good news on trade because that simply does not support the election agenda,\" she said. For Chinese leaders this year, \"their priority is to keep the relationship stable\".\n\n\"Until there is clarity on who the next administration will be, I don't think they see a better strategy,\"

There, he indulged in local cuisine, enjoyed a basketball match, and leisurely walked along the renowned Bund promenade, overlooking the bustling Huangpu River.\n\nIn a reception room with panoramic views of the Shanghai skyline, Blinken met with the local Communist Party leader.He conveyed US President Joe Biden's dedication to fostering \"direct and sustained\" dialogue between the world's two largest economies, following years of escalating tensions.\n\n\"I think it's important to underscore the value -- in fact, the necessity -- of direct engagement, of speaking to each other, laying out our differences, which are real, seeking to work through them,\" Blinken said.\n\n\"We have an obligation for our people -- indeed an obligation to the world -- to manage the relationship between our two countries responsibly,\" he said.\n\nChen Jining, the Chinese Communist Party secretary for Shanghai, extended a warm welcome to Blinken, partially in English, emphasizing the significance of US businesses to the city.\n\n\"Whether we choose cooperation or confrontation affects the well-being of both peoples, both countries and the future of humanity,\" Chen told Blinken.\n\nShanghai, known as the country's financial capital, often serves as a launching pad for political careers in China, as evidenced by President Xi Jinping's prior service in the city.\n\nAlthough China has not yet disclosed plans for Blinken to meet with Xi, it's worth noting that during Blinken's previous visit in June, they had an impromptu meeting, announced at the last minute.\n\nBlinken, marking the first visit by a US Secretary of State to Shanghai in 14 years, commenced his trip on Wednesday evening at a restaurant famous for its steamed buns. Opting for a tieless suit, he dined with his senior staff outdoors, seated on wooden chairs in a bustling shopping arcade, while curious onlookers snapped pictures.\n\nAfter dinner, Blinken attended a thrilling playoff game between the Shanghai Sharks and Zhejiang Golden Bulls, staying until the end.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

stability", "body": "The US diplomat will meet China's top brass on Friday in Beijing, where he is also expected to plead for restraint as Taiwan inaugurates a new leader, and to raise US concerns on Chinese trade practices -- a vital issue for President Joe Biden in an election year.\n\nBut Blinken is also seeking to stabilise ties, with tensions between the world's two largest economies palpably easing since his last visit in June.\n\nAt the time, he was the highest-ranking US official to visit China in five years, and the trip was followed by a meeting between the countries' presidents in November.\n\nAt that summit in California, Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a US wish list including restoring contact between militaries and cracking down on precursor chemicals to fentanyl, the powerful painkiller behind an addiction epidemic in the United States.\n\nBlinken arrived in Shanghai, where he will kick off his visit by attending a Chinese basketball play-off match between two teams with American players on their rosters.\n\nThe friendly side trip -- the first visit by a US secretary of state to the bustling metropolis since Hillary Clinton in 2010 -- would have been unthinkable until recently, with hawks on both sides previously speaking of a new Cold War between the two powers.\n\n- Pressing on Russia -\n\nA senior US official previewing Blinken's trip said the relationship between the countries was at a \"different place\" to a year ago, when it was at \"an historic low point\".\n\nHowever, \"responsibly managing competition does not mean we will pull back from measures to protect US national interests\", he added.\n\nThe Biden administration's eagerness to engage China stands in stark contrast to its efforts to isolate Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nThe United States has accused China in recent weeks of lavishing industrial material and technology on Moscow.\n\nWashington has encouraged European leaders to stand firm on China not backing Russia, believing Beijing wants stable ties with the West as it focuses on addressing economic headwinds at home.\n\n\"If China purports on the one hand to want good relations with Europe and other countries, it can't on the other hand be fuelling what is the biggest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War,\" Blinken said Friday.\n\n- Progress on fentanyl -\n\nThe Biden administration has trumpeted the agreement with Xi on fentanyl as a success.\n\nA State Department official said that since the November summit, China appears to have taken its first law enforcement measures on the matter since 2017, and that Blinken would be asking for further implementation.\n\nMore regular law enforcement action from Beijing against China-based companies involved in fentanyl supply chains \"would send a strong signal of China's commitment to address this issue\", the official said.\n\nOther issues likely to come up will be more fraught.\n\nThe US Congress gave final approval on Tuesday night to a $95 billion package of assistance to allies including self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of its territory.\n\nIn response, China said Wednesday that US military support for the island only increased the \"risk of conflict\", and warned it would take \"resolute and effective measures to safeguard its sovereignty, security and territorial integrity\".\n\nThe US Congress also approved legislation on Tuesday requiring the wildly popular social media app TikTok to be divested from its Chinese parent company ByteDance, or be shut out of the American market.\n\nAsked about the development, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry declined to respond, referring journalists to China's \"previously explained... principled position\".\n\nBeijing has furiously denounced the plans, urging Washington to \"truly respect the principles of market economy and fair competition\".\n\nBiden faces a rematch in November against former president Donald Trump, who has vowed a more confrontational approach against China.\n\nYun Sun, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Stimson Center, said that China's leaders, eager to focus on their economy, were in a wait-and-see mode ahead of the US election.\n\n\"The Chinese understand that the Biden administration is unlikely to deliver any good news on trade because that simply does not support the election agenda,\" she said.\n\nFor Chinese leaders this year, \"their priority is to keep the relationship stable\".\n\n\"Until there is clarity on who the next administration will be, I don't think they see a better strategy,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "terradaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Terra Daily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

At a regular briefing later on Thursday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin contended that the regime conducted economic and trade cooperation \"in accordance with market principles.\"\n\nHe called Washington to work with the regime to \"create favorable conditions for the sound and stable development of China-U.S. economic and trade relations.\"\n\nChina has voiced objections to U.S. aid to Taiwan, a self-ruled island that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) viewed as a breakaway province, warning that it \"will not bring security\" to Taipei.\n\nMr. Blinken is set to meet Wang Yi, the CCP's top diplomat, on Friday.

stability", "body": "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken yesterday returned to China on his second visit in a year, as the United States ramps up pressure on its rival over its support for Russia while also seeking to manage tensions with Beijing.\n\nThe US diplomat will meet China's top brass on Friday in Beijing, where he is also expected to plead for restraint as Taiwan inaugurates a new leader, and to raise US concerns on Chinese trade practices -- a vital issue for President Joe Biden in an election year.\n\nBut Blinken is also seeking to stabilise ties, with tensions between the world's two largest economies palpably easing since his last visit in June.\n\nAt the time, he was the highest-ranking US official to visit China in five years, and the trip was followed by a meeting between the countries' presidents in November.\n\nAt that summit in California, Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a US wish list including restoring contact between militaries and cracking down on precursor chemicals to fentanyl, the powerful painkiller behind an addiction epidemic in the United States.\n\nBlinken arrived in Shanghai, where he will kick off his visit by attending a Chinese basketball play-off match between two teams with American players on their rosters.\n\nThe friendly side trip -- the first visit by a US secretary of state to the bustling metropolis since Hillary Clinton in 2010 -- would have been unthinkable until recently, with hawks on both sides previously speaking of a new Cold War between the two powers.\n\nA senior US official previewing Blinken's trip said the relationship between the countries was at a \"different place\" to a year ago, when it was at \"an historic low point\".\n\nHowever, \"responsibly managing competition does not mean we will pull back from measures to protect US national interests\", he added.\n\nThe Biden administration's eagerness to engage China stands in stark contrast to its efforts to isolate Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nThe United States has accused China in recent weeks of lavishing industrial material and technology on Moscow.\n\nWashington has encouraged European leaders to stand firm on China not backing Russia, believing Beijing wants stable ties with the West as it focuses on addressing economic headwinds at home.", "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net", "dataType":

The trip, his second to the country in less than a year, is the latest in a series of high-level engagements that culminated with a summit meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in California in November after a period of immense tension.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen visited the country just a few weeks ago, and Biden and Xi spoke on the phone earlier this month.\n\n\"We are in a different situation than a year ago, when bilateral relations were at a historic low,\" a senior State Department official said.\n\nAlthough officials from both countries have suggested that Blinken's agenda will focus on managing relations and communicating concerns, there are still sharp divisions and conversations are not expected to be easy, particularly on the issue of support from China to Russia's industrial base as war breaks out in Russia. Ukraine continues.\n\nThe Biden administration is increasingly sounding the alarm over China's support as Russia accelerates the pace of its weapons manufacturing efforts, which the United States says has allowed Moscow to continue its war against Ukraine.\n\nWe see China sharing machine tools, semiconductors and other dual-use goods that have helped Russia rebuild its defense industrial base that sanctions and export controls had done so much to degrade, Blinken said at a news conference in Italy last week.\n\nChina has not provided direct military support to Russia, but the industrial and logistical assistance it provides is having a significant impact, at a time when the Ukrainian army is plagued by a shortage of equipment and supplies. weapons.\n\nAs Russia has begun to rebuild its defense capabilities, the United States has sought to rally its allies to pressure Beijing through diplomatic means or, if that fails, through punitive measures to stop provide support, and Blinken is expected to deliver a strong message on the issue. during her visit.\n\nRussia is no longer on the sidelines, a second senior State Department official said. They are skyrocketing. They have a substantial heritage, they have reconstituted themselves. They pose a threat not only to Ukraine but also to the region as a whole.\n\nBlinken will argue that supporting Russia harms not just Ukraine, but all of European security.\n\nChina cannot have it both ways, Blinken said. He cannot claim to want to maintain positive relations with Europe while fueling the greatest threat to Europe since the end of the Cold War.\n\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Monday that we believe China can do more, and we have always made clear that we are willing and able to take our own steps if appropriate, and I think I'll leave it there.\n\nDespite the threat of U.S. action, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official signaled Tuesday that Beijing was unlikely to reverse its support for Moscow, warning the United States against undermining normal state-to-state relations. and calling on the United States to lift sanctions against China. entities, during a state press briefing.\n\nThe Ukraine issue is not a China-US issue, and the United States should not make it a China-US issue, the official said.\n\nChinese officials are also expected to raise areas of concern with Blinken.\n\nGrievances are growing in Beijing over what it sees as an intensification of US efforts to contain and suppress China, despite increased communications between the two countries following last November's Biden-Xi summit. .\n\nAlthough U.S.-China relations have stabilized since the summit, negative factors in the relationship are also very significant, the Chinese Foreign Ministry official said at a press briefing on Tuesday.\n\nThe United States stubbornly pursues its strategy of containing China and continues to use wrong words and deeds that interfere in China's internal affairs, smear China's image and harm China's interests. We strongly oppose it and oppose it, the official said.\n\nNonetheless, the Biden administration is keen to keep the lines of communication open and believes that China is currently on the same page. China has realized that its aggressive diplomacy has failed profoundly because it has alienated more than it attracted, the second senior State Department official said, explaining why China is now open to commitment.\n\nThe Chinese want a more stable global environment, their economy has slowed significantly, they want more investment, the official explained, adding that China wants engagement specifically from American companies.\n\nOther issues related to the Indo-Pacific region are also expected to feature prominently in Blinkens' meetings.\n\nThe Biden administration has sought to strengthen its alliances in the region in the face of provocations from Beijing in the South China Sea. In recent weeks, Biden hosted his Philippine and Japanese counterparts for an inaugural summit in Washington, where he reaffirmed the United States' commitment to the defense of the Philippines. The United States deployed a powerful land-attack missile system to the Philippines and conducted a series of joint exercises with the treaty ally.\n\nAt a Tuesday press briefing, China's Foreign Ministry official accused the United States of being obsessed with coercing its allies into forming an anti-China clique and interfering in the China Sea South and sow discord between China and ASEAN, referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\n\nBlinkens' visit also comes at a sensitive time in the Taiwan Strait, less than a month before the self-ruled island of Taiwan is due to swear in a new president that Beijing openly hates.\n\nThe first senior State Department official said the secretary of state can be expected to emphasize, both privately and publicly, the continuing U.S. interest in maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\n\nWe believe this is of vital importance for the region and the world. And we particularly hope, during this important and sensitive period leading up to the May 20 inauguration, that all countries will contribute to peace and stability, avoid taking provocative measures that could increase tensions, and exercise restraint. . This will be our message going forward, the official said.\n\nThe ruling Chinese Communist Party considers Taiwan part of its territory, even though it has never controlled it. While successive Chinese communist leaders have pledged to ultimately achieve reunification, Xi has repeatedly stated that the Taiwan issue should not be passed down from generation to generation and has significantly stepped up economic, military and diplomatic pressure against its democratic neighbor in recent years.\n\nThe Taiwan Relations Act requires Washington to provide weapons for the island's defense, and Biden has repeatedly suggested he would use U.S. military personnel to defend it in the event of a Chinese invasion (although House officials Blanche stated that the US policy of leaving this issue ambiguous was not taken into account). amended).\n\nThe two sides are also expected to discuss the situation in the Middle East. U.S. officials believe China has influence, especially given the amount of oil it imports from Iran. Blinken will argue that China should intervene more directly with Iran in order to be less provocative in the region, the second senior State Department official said.\n\nI'll let China talk about whatever steps they've taken, Miller said Monday. But we will continue to make the case to China that it is not only in the interest of the region, it is not only in the interest of the United States, it is not only in the interest individual countries involved, but it is in the interest of the interests of China and the whole world to avoid further escalation of the conflict.\n\nBlinken is expected to discuss the flow of fentanyl precursor chemicals to the United States and military-to-military dialogue, which are two areas Xi made commitments in during his meeting with Biden.\n\nIn both cases, the Chinese have taken some first steps, the second senior State Department official said, adding that much remains to be done on both fronts.\n\nBlinken is also expected to raise concerns about China's efforts to bolster its nuclear arsenal as well as the cases of Americans who have been prevented from leaving China due to exit bans or those the State Department has deemed detained wrongly, notably Mark Swidan, Kai Li., and David Lin.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type":

(Mark Schiefelbein/Pool/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken will raise American concerns about the Chinese regime's handling of human rights during his three-day visit to China, the state department confirmed.\n\n\"In every engagement that we have had with the People's Republic of China since the onset of this administration, human rights have always been on the agenda, and they will continue to be so,\" State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel said in response to a question from NTD, the Epoch Times's sister media outlet, at a regular briefing on Wednesday.\n\n\"I have no doubt that human rights will be discussed this week while the Secretary is there.\"\n\nMr. Blinken arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday afternoon, kicking off his second visit to China as secretary of state. The top U.S. diplomat will press the regime on issues ranging from Chinese aid to Russia, industrial overcapacity, to human rights, according to the State Department.\n\nA day before his trip, the State Department released a report that Mr. Bliken said documented the \"ongoing grave human rights abuses\" in China. The groups targeted by the communist regime include persecuted minority groups, dissidents, foreign journalists, and adherents of spiritual faiths.\n\nPointing to the Uyghurs in China's Xinjiang, whom he called \"victims of genocide and crimes against humanity,\" Mr. Blinken said the 2023 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices \"documents atrocities reminiscent of humanity's darkest moments.\"\n\nThe State Department report also cited an Epoch Times interview with a former Chinese doctor who participated in the harvesting of organs inside a van guarded by armed soldiers.\n\nThe doctor, Zheng Zhi, has testified of hearing a Chinese military officer telling a Chinese military official they would pick a \"top quality\" kidney from a Falun Gong practitioner to replace the official's ailing kidney.\n\nRobert Gilchrist, a senior official for the State Department's Democracy, Human Rights and Labour Bureau, told reporters that Mr. Bliken will \"raise human rights at the highest levels and in the clearest way\" while in China.\n\nThe top U.S. diplomat will start his mission by meeting with senior officials, business leaders, and students in the financial hub. He will travel to Beijing on Friday to have talks with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi.\n\nHe is expected to have additional talks with Xi Jinping, the leader of the communist regime. Xi received the visiting secretary of state in Beijing last July, but their talk wasn't publicly confirmed until shortly before it took place.\n\nJust hours before Mr. Bliken's arrival, the U.S. Congress gave final approval to a defense package that includes roughly $8 billion for Taiwan and other partners in the Indo-Pacific region to confront Chinese aggression. The bill, which may lead to a potential ban on the Chinese-controlled video-sharing app TikTok, was signed into law by President Joe Biden later on Wednesday.\n\nMr. Bliken's trip follows a similar visit by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who issued a blunt warning about Beijing's aid to Moscow. She threatened that any companies, including those in China, would face \"significant consequences\" if they provided aid to support Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThere are growing concerns that Beijing provided Moscow with critical materials and weapon components for its war with Ukraine. Ahead of his trip, a senior State Department said Mr. Blinken will press the Chinese side to curtail its support for Russia's defense industrial base.\n\n\"We're prepared to take steps when we believe necessary against firms that are taking steps in contravention to our interests and in ways that ... severely undermine security in both Ukraine and Europe,\" the official said.\n\nChina observers cautioned that diplomacy won't avert Beijing's actions, given that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leaders have their own calculations in supporting Moscow.\n\n\"Russia will reciprocate with technology or other stuff that China has its eye on for some time, such as the warplane engines,\" Chen Shih-min, an associate professor of politics at the National Taiwan University in Taipei, told The Epoch Times ahead of Mr. Bliken's visit.\n\nFor China's part, \"Xi Jinping also doesn't want the war in Ukraine to end quickly,\" Mr. Chen said. One day the war drags on, \"the United States is tied up with it. Xi Jinping can use the opportunity to go ahead with his plans in the Taiwan Strait, or the South China Sea.\"\n\nMr. Chen cited an assessment by U.S. officials that found China was the source of 70 percent of machine tools -- which can be used to produce ballistic missiles -- imported by Russia in the last quarter of 2023.\n\nChina is by far the foremost supplier of chips to Russia. According to a recent report by the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington-based think tank, over 80 percent of the chips purchased by Russia since the onset of the Ukraine war have come directly from China.\n\nThere are signals that Beijing will not change its behaviors. At a regular briefing on Wednesday, China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, said its \"right to conduct normal trade and economic exchanges\" with Russia and others \"should not be interfered with or disrupted.\"\n\nChina and Russia have forged closer ties in recent years. Xi held talks with visiting Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov earlier this month in a show of solidarity between the two neighbors. Weeks before Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Xi upgraded bilateral ties to a \"no limits\" partnership. Media reports indicated that the Kremlin chief would visit China in May. If confirmed, this will be Mr. Putin's first international trip since he secured his fifth term in office in March.\n\nIt's not just the CCP and the Kremlin. \"I believe that Iran may be colluding with Russia and China behind the scenes\" amid tensions in the Middle East, Mr. Chen said, adding that North Korea is also coordinating with the three countries.\n\nAuthoritarian regimes in Beijing, Moscow, Pyongyang, and Tehran have formed a new \"axis of evil,\" Mr. Chen cautioned, posing a growing threat to the United States and other Western democracies.\n\nAnalysts expect Washington will ratchet up pressure on Beijing over Russia, especially in the run-up to the presidential election.\n\n\"If the CCP continues to provide Russian military resources, the [Biden] administration will take a tough stance toward China, whether it's to safeguard the rule-based international order or for the upcoming [presidential] election,\" Su Tzu-yun, a senior analyst from Taiwan's Institute for National Defense and Security Research in Taipei, told The Epoch Times.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Epoch Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Republic_of_Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Socialist Republic of Romania"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diplomat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ambassadors_of_the_United_States_to_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of ambassadors of the United States to China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Nicholas_Burns", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "R.

Also on the agenda are Beijing's territorial claims over the self-ruled island of Taiwan and its aggression in the South China Sea, a senior U.S. official said.\n\nThe hawkish U.S. election season is testing a stabilization in ties brokered by Xi and President Joe Biden last year. The U.S. leader last week blasted Beijing as \"xenophobic,\" vowed more tariffs on China and opened an investigation into the Asian nation's ship industry.\n\nThe ruling Communist Party's response to the latest trade salvos has, so far, been limited to tough talk and symbolic tit-for-tat tariffs. Xi is trying to woo foreign investors back to China and reinvigorate the world's No. 2 economy, as it battles a protracted property crisis and a slew of trade probes from the European Union.\n\n\"You often see the most activist Chinese response at times when they're feeling empowered and strong,\" said Jude Blanchette, an expert on China and foreign investment at Washington's Center for International and Strategic Studies. \"Right now, the leadership in Beijing is having to put out a lot of fires.\"\n\nAdding to those concerns is the threat of new sanctions. Earlier this month, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told officials in Beijing that Chinese banks helping Russia's war effort could face fresh U.S. sanctions, as she raised concerns to top leaders about China's overcapacity. Ahead of Blinken's visit, Chinese state media called out the contradiction in trying to stabilize ties while ramping up trade rivalry.\n\n\"Why does the U.S. side turn a normal visit into what seems like an ultimatum?\" the Communist Party's Global Times newspaper wrote in an editorial. \"If this issue is not resolved, it is like walking at night blindfolded and it will easily lead to mistakes and even danger.\"\n\nBlinken landed in China just hours after the Senate passed a $95 billion emergency aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, which could also lead to the ban of popular video-sharing app TikTok unless it divests from its Chinese parent company ByteDance Ltd. Biden signed the package into law on Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S. delegation will seek to clearly communicate policies to Beijing in order to prevent any escalation of tensions. In recent weeks, the U.S. met with European and Asian allies to discuss China. Blinken's trip also coincides with the U.S. and Philippines conducting military exercises near the disputed South China Sea and Taiwan.\n\nU.S. officials are unlikely to walk away from meetings this week with many concrete breakthroughs or deliverables. While there are signs the relationship has stabilized, the two countries have continued to dispute over issues spanning trade, technology, human rights, Ukraine, North Korea and the Middle East, where Blinken has sought to enlist Beijing's help to pressure Iran.\n\nThe large delegation traveling with Blinken underscores the varied topics for discussion in Shanghai and Beijing this week.\n\nHe is accompanied by Daniel Kritenbrink, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs; Sarah Beran, National Security Council senior director for China and Taiwan affairs; Elizabeth Allen, under secretary for public diplomacy and public affairs; Todd Robinson, assistant secretary of state for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs; as well as Nathan Fick,

The journey is his second behind the country in less than a year is the latest in a series of high-level engagements that have resulted in a summit meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in California in November after a period of immense tension.\n\n\"We are in a different situation than a year ago, when bilateral relations were at a historic low,\" a senior State Department official said.\n\nAlthough officials from both countries have suggested that Blinken's agenda will focus on managing relations and communicating concerns, there are still sharp divisions and conversations are not expected to be easy, particularly on the issue of support from China to Russia's industrial base as war breaks out in Russia. Ukraine continues.\n\nThe Biden administration has increasingly sounded the alarm on China's support as Russia accelerates the pace of its weapons manufacturing efforts, which the United States says has allowed Moscow to continue its war against Ukraine.\n\nWe see China sharing machine tools, semiconductors and other dual-use goods that have helped Russia rebuild its defense industrial base that sanctions and export controls had done so much to degrade, Blinken said at a news conference in Italy last week.\n\nChina has not provided direct military support to Russia, but the industrial and logistical assistance it provides is having a significant impact, at a time when the Ukrainian army is plagued by a shortage of equipment and supplies. weapons.\n\nAs Russia has begun to rebuild its defense capabilities, the United States has sought to rally its allies to pressure Beijing through diplomatic means or, if that fails, through punitive measures to stop provide support, and Blinken is expected to deliver a strong message on the issue. during her visit.\n\nRussia is no longer on the sidelines, a second senior State Department official said. They are skyrocketing. They have a substantial heritage, they have reconstituted themselves. They pose a threat not only to Ukraine but also to the region as a whole.\n\nBlinken will argue that supporting Russia harms not just Ukraine, but all of European security.\n\nChina cannot have it both ways, Blinken said. He cannot claim to want to maintain positive relations with Europe while fueling the greatest threat to Europe since the end of the Cold War.\n\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Monday that we believe China can do more, and we have always made clear that we are willing and able to take our own steps if appropriate, and I think I'll leave it there.\n\nDespite the threat of U.S. action, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official signaled Tuesday that Beijing was unlikely to reverse its support for Moscow, warning the United States against undermining normal state-to-state relations. and calling on the United States to lift sanctions against China. entities, during a state press briefing.\n\nThe Ukraine issue is not a China-US issue, and the United States should not make it a China-US issue, the official said.\n\nChinese officials are also expected to raise areas of concern with Blinken.\n\nGrievances are growing in Beijing over what it sees as an intensification of US efforts to contain and suppress China, despite increased communications between the two countries following last November's Biden-Xi summit. .\n\nAlthough U.S.-China relations have stabilized since the summit, negative factors in the relationship are also very significant, the Chinese Foreign Ministry official said at a press briefing on Tuesday.\n\nThe United States stubbornly pursues its strategy of containing China and continues to use wrong words and deeds that interfere in China's internal affairs, smear China's image and harm China's interests. We strongly oppose it and oppose it, the official said.\n\nNonetheless, the Biden administration is keen to keep the lines of communication open and believes that China is currently on the same page. China has realized that its aggressive diplomacy has failed profoundly because it has alienated more than it attracted, the second senior State Department official said, explaining why China is now open to commitment.\n\nThe Chinese want a more stable global environment, their economy has slowed significantly, they want more investment, the official explained, adding that China wants engagement specifically from American companies.\n\nOther issues related to the Indo-Pacific region are also expected to feature prominently in Blinkens' meetings.\n\nThe Biden administration has sought to strengthen its alliances in the region in the face of provocations from Beijing in the South China Sea. In recent weeks, Biden has hosted his Filipino and Japanese counterparts to an inaugural summit in Washington, where he reaffirmed the United States' commitment to the defense of the Philippines. The United States deployed a powerful land attack missile system in the Philippines and conducted a series of joint exercises with the treaty ally.\n\nAt a Tuesday press briefing, China's Foreign Ministry official accused the United States of being obsessed with coercing its allies into forming an anti-China clique and interfering in the China Sea South and sow discord between China and ASEAN, referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\n\nBlinkens' visit also comes at a sensitive time in the Taiwan Strait, less than a month before the self-ruled island of Taiwan is sworn in. a new president that Beijing openly hates.\n\nThe first senior State Department official said the secretary of state can be expected to emphasize, both privately and publicly, the continuing U.S. interest in maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\n\nWe believe this is of vital importance for the region and the world. And we particularly hope, during this important and sensitive period leading up to the May 20 inauguration, that all countries will contribute to peace and stability, avoid taking provocative measures that could increase tensions, and exercise restraint. . This will be our message going forward, the official said.\n\nThe ruling Chinese Communist Party considers Taiwan part of its territory, even though it has never controlled it. While successive Chinese communist leaders have pledged to ultimately achieve reunification, Xi has repeatedly stated that the Taiwan issue should not be passed down from generation to generation and has significantly stepped up economic, military and diplomatic pressure against its democratic neighbor in recent years.\n\nThe Taiwan Relations Act requires Washington to provide weapons for the island's defense, and Biden has has repeatedly suggested that it would use U.S. military personnel to defend itself in the event of a Chinese invasion (although White House officials have said that U.S. policy to leave this issue ambiguous has not changed).\n\nThe two sides are also expected to discuss the situation in the Middle East. American officials I believe China has influence especially considering the amount of oil it imports from Iran. Blinken will argue that China should intervene more directly with Iran in order to be less provocative in the region, the second senior State Department official said.\n\nI'll let China talk about whatever steps they've taken, Miller said Monday. But we will continue to make the case to China that it is not only in the interest of the region, it is not only in the interest of the United States, it is not only in the interest individual countries involved, but it is in the interest of the interests of China and the whole world to avoid further escalation of the conflict.\n\nBlinken is expected to discuss the flow of fentanyl precursor chemicals to the United States and military-to-military dialogue, which are two areas Xi made commitments in during his meeting with Biden.\n\nIn both cases, the Chinese have taken some first steps, the second senior State Department official said, adding that much remains to be done on both fronts.\n\nBlinken is also expected to raise concerns about China's efforts to bolster its nuclear arsenal as well as the cases of Americans who have been prevented from leaving China due to exit bans or those the State Department has deemed detained wrongly, notably Mark Swidan, Kai Li., and David Lin.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type":

Also on the agenda are Beijing's territorial claims over the self-ruled island of Taiwan and its aggression in the South China Sea, a senior US official said.\n\nThe hawkish US election season is testing a stabilization in ties brokered by Xi and President Joe Biden last year. The US leader last week blasted Beijing as \"xenophobic,\" vowed more tariffs on China and opened a probe into the Asian nation's ship industry.\n\nThe ruling Communist Party's response to the latest trade salvos has, so far, been limited to tough talk and symbolic tit-for-tat tariffs. Xi is trying to woo foreign investors back to China and reinvigorate the world's No. 2 economy, as it battles a protracted property crisis and a slew of trade probes from the European Union.\n\n\"You often see the most activist Chinese response at times when they're feeling empowered and strong,\" said Jude Blanchette, an expert on China and foreign investment at Washington's Center for International and Strategic Studies. \"Right now, the leadership in Beijing is having to put out a lot of fires.\"\n\nAdding to those concerns is the threat of new sanctions. Earlier this month, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told officials in Beijing that Chinese banks helping Russia's war effort could face fresh US sanctions, as she raised concerns to top leaders about China's overcapacity. Ahead of Blinken's visit, Chinese state media called out the contradiction in trying to stabilize ties while ramping up trade rivalry.\n\n\"Why does the US side turn a normal visit into what seems like an ultimatum?\" the Communist Party's Global Times newspaper wrote in an editorial. \"If this issue is not resolved, it is like walking at night blindfolded and it will easily lead to mistakes and even danger.\"\n\nBlinken landed in China just hours after the Senate passed a $95 billion emergency aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, which could also lead to the ban of popular video-sharing app TikTok unless it divests from its Chinese parent company ByteDance Ltd. Biden signed the package into law on Wednesday.\n\nThe US delegation will seek to clearly communicate policies to Beijing in order to prevent any escalation of tensions. In recent weeks, the US met with European and Asian allies to discuss China. Blinken's trip also coincides with the US and Philippines conducting military exercises near the disputed South China Sea and Taiwan.\n\nUS officials are unlikely to walk away from meetings this week with many concrete breakthroughs or deliverables. While there are signs the relationship has stabilized, the two countries have continued to dispute over issues spanning trade, technology, human rights, Ukraine, North Korea and the Middle East, where Blinken has sought to enlist Beijing's help to pressure Iran.\n\nThe large delegation traveling with Blinken underscores the varied topics for discussion in Shanghai and Beijing this week.\n\nHe is accompanied by Daniel Kritenbrink, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs; Sarah Beran, National Security Council senior director for China and Taiwan affairs; Elizabeth Allen, under secretary for public diplomacy and public affairs; Todd Robinson, assistant secretary of state for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs; as well as Nathan Fick, ambassador-at-large for cyberspace and digital policy.\n\n(Updates with details, including Biden signing TikTok bill into law.)", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

They will hold deliberations on the ongoing works which President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping discussed at a summit in California last year.\n\nBlinken and his counterpart Wang Yi will review the work done on \"resuming counter-narcotics cooperation, military-to-military communication, artificial intelligence, and strengthening people-to-people ties\", the US State Department said.\n\nThey will also reiterate the importance of the US and China partnership to \"responsibly manage competition even in areas where our countries disagree\".\n\nBlinken is reportedly carrying a message for Beijing that the US and its European allies are accepting China's sale of weapon components and dual-use products to Russia, which are helping Moscow modernise its arms factories. The US believes that China is helping Russia in its fight against Ukraine.\n\nThe visit comes at a time when the US Senate has approved a whopping $60 billion aid to Ukraine.

He landed just hours after the U.S. Senate passed a bill, which President Joe Biden is expected to quickly sign into law, that provides $8 billion to Taiwan and the Indo-Pacific region, and could also lead to a nationwide ban on the Chinese-owned app TikTok.\n\nThe political season in the United States also looms as a complication. With the presidential election nearing, Democrats and Republicans are vying to appear tougher on China. And if former President Donald Trump is reelected, he could reverse Beijing's and Washington's efforts to steady the relationship.\n\nDuring Blinken's three-day trip, which will also include a visit to Beijing, he plans to press Chinese officials on a wide range of issues, including its support for Russia, cheap Chinese exports that U.S. officials say threaten American jobs, and Chinese ships' aggressive maneuvers in the South China Sea, a senior State Department official told reporters in a telephone briefing.\n\nChinese officials are likely to bring up U.S. support for Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims, and trade restrictions that Beijing calls discriminatory.\n\nBlinken is expected to meet with China's foreign minister, Wang Yi. It is not clear whether he will meet with China's leader, Xi Jinping, as he did during his last visit, in June.\n\nThat visit -- the first by an American secretary of state to China since 2018 -- came at perhaps the worst moment in U.S.-China relations in recent years. High-level military communications were cut off, and neighboring countries worried that the two powers might stumble into a war.\n\nSince then, relations have thawed somewhat. China's economy is slowing, and Beijing has adopted a softer diplomatic tone to attract more foreign investment. Washington, though continuing to warn that China poses a global security threat, has said it wants to keep communication open.\n\nIn November, Biden and Xi met for four hours near San Francisco. Afterward, China agreed to resume cooperation with the U.S. on fighting the global production of fentanyl, and both countries affirmed the importance of restoring cultural exchanges. The two leaders also spoke by phone this month.\n\nLast week, the countries' top defense officials held a video conference, their first substantive engagement since late 2022.\n\nBut new sources of tension are rising. Western officials have grown increasingly vocal about concerns that China is backing Russia in its war in Ukraine. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, during her own visit to China this month, warned of \"significant consequences\" if Beijing provides material support. China has maintained that it is not, while deepening ties with Moscow. Xi hosted Russia's foreign minister this month, and Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to visit China soon.\n\nU.S. officials have also said China is dumping cheap electric vehicles and solar panels in overseas markets, hurting American companies. China has rejected the accusations as smacking of protectionism.\n\nChinese ships' aggressive behavior in waters disputed with the Philippines and Japan has also raised concerns about a possible clash that could draw in the United States, a treaty ally of those countries.\n\nOn Taiwan, perhaps the most sensitive issue in the U.S.-China relationship, the island is set to inaugurate its new president, Lai Ching-te -- whom Beijing reviles as an advocate of Taiwanese independence -- next month.\n\nAsked at a regular news briefing Wednesday about Congress' new aid for Taiwan, Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry, said that stronger military cooperation between the United States and Taiwan would \"not bring about security for Taiwan\" and would \"only escalate tensions across the Taiwan Strait.\"\n\nChina's defense minister, Dong Jun, had told U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin during their call that China would \"brook no compromise\" on Taiwan, according to the Chinese readout.\n\nWang declined to answer repeated questions about TikTok on Wednesday. He referred reporters to previous statements from China's Ministry of Commerce, which has said it would \"firmly oppose\" a sale of the app.\n\nWithin the United States, anti-China rhetoric is likely to intensify as the Democrats and Republicans compete to outdo each other on one of the few areas of bipartisan agreement. Campaigning last week in Pennsylvania, a steelworking stronghold, Biden called for raising tariffs on steel imports from China.\n\n\"We had high hopes after the San Francisco summit, but recent developments are putting a lot of stress on the relationship,\" said Xie Tao, the dean of the School of International Relations and Diplomacy at Beijing Foreign Studies University. \"When you add all these negative developments together, you have a pretty depressing picture of the U.S.-China relationship right now.\"\n\nBoth countries have reason to try to prevent escalating tensions. The U.S. has asked China to help restrain Iran, with which it has good relations, from pushing its hostilities with Israel into full-blown war. And China is eager to stave off further tariffs from the U.S., as strong exports have helped it counterbalance its housing crisis and weak consumer spending.\n\nBut both countries may also have little room for diplomatic maneuvering, because of hardening public opinion on both sides.\n\n\"There are already so many irritants and issues of mistrust within the relationship,\" said Allen Carlson, a professor of international relations at Cornell University.\n\n\"If you have a pot which is already close to boiling, it only takes adding a degree or two to push things over the edge.\"", "source":

For example, the US Congress passed an ultimatum for TikTok to sell its assets before it is banned in the country.\n\nCurrently, Russia's defence industrial base is underpinned by supplies from Chinese companies. This is part of Blinken's agenda to pressure Moscow to end Chinese support for the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"If China wants to maintain good relations with Europe and other countries, it cannot afford to pose the greatest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War,\" Blinken said.\n\nChina is not sending weapons to Russia, but it signed an \"unlimited\" cooperation agreement with Moscow just days before the war, and US officials assumed that Asian companies could use the technology to support Russian hostilities without repercussions in European countries.\n\nThe US has begun to consider sanctions against the Bank of China, but rewards said the government source was not planned. From the point of view of the People's Republic, the state protects the right to work with Russia and accuses the United States of active involvement in Ukraine by providing weapons and money.\n\nThe US has accused China of overproducing in the new energy sector, exceeding China's domestic demand and distorting global markets as Beijing's \"overcapacity\" produces more than US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen can \"sustain\".\n\nWang Wenbin, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, deputy director of the Foreign Ministry's Information Department and a member of the Chinese Communist Party, expressed \"strong opposition\" and noted that \"there is no solid basis for criticising excessive industrial potential\". The spokesman defended China's energy production as \"necessary\" to \"promote advanced green development\".\n\nThe US Congress approved 8 billion dollars in aid to Taiwan to defend against threats of Chinese aggression.\n\nBefore Blinken arrived in Shanghai, China's Taiwan Affairs Office said the US decision was a \"serious violation\" of the country's commitments to China and \"sends the wrong message to those who support Taiwan independence\", which it strongly condemns.\n\nBoth sides should avoid provocative actions that could increase tensions and exercise restraint ahead of the inauguration of Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te. The US has strongly condemned China's military exercises aimed at threatening Taiwan, despite the mainland power's anger.\n\nChina-US relations are marked by a complex interplay of economic, political and security interests. Antony Blinken's trip to China amid tensions over issues such as Taiwan and China's relationship with Russia highlights the urgency of maintaining a constructive dialogue between the two powers.\n\nHowever, divergences over issues such as trade, security and human rights may hamper the stability of these relations. The consequences of a deterioration in Sino-American relations could have a significant global impact. It is crucial that both sides seek ways to resolve their differences diplomatically and constructively to avoid an escalation that could have adverse ramifications for the entire world.", "source":

Will it help?", "body": "\"Three, two, one - hut!\" shouts quarterback Mu Yang, as he throws the ball across the field.\n\nHis Beijing Cyclones teammate Henry Mu sprints to the corner for the catch, his studs thudding off the AstroTurf as he jumps for the ball.\n\n\"I was so surprised to find American football here,\" says Henry as he catches his breath. \"It's very tough, physically and mentally, you must defeat your fear.\"\n\nHere, men and women play together in a team sport that you'd associate more with Baltimore than Beijing.\n\nFor many Americans, this is more than just a game - it is an expression of their national identity. For this Chinese team, it is something new - there are only a few thousand players in China, but millions of fans.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of \"people to people\" exchanges and cultural connection that Beijing wants with the US, as the two rival superpowers try to calm their tumultuous relationship.\n\nSince President Xi Jinping visited San Francisco last November, China has been keen on emphasising what it has in common with the US rather than differences.\n\nBeijing also appears to have adopted a softer diplomatic tone in recent months as it tries to attract foreign businesses to spur its slowing economy.\n\nOn its part, the US has dispatched envoys more frequently to China and signalled cooperation. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Shanghai in his second visit to China in less than a year, on the heels of two recent visits by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.\n\nThe US calls it \"responsibly managing competition\" to avert the chances for \"miscalculation or conflict\", according to a senior State Department official speaking in the run up to Mr Blinken's trip.\n\nThat doesn't mean the conversations will be easy. There is no doubt the US-China relationship has improved in recent years, but it is a relationship that still crackles with tension and suspicion.\n\nOn Wednesday Mr Blinken's plane carrying officials and reporters, including the BBC, wound its way from Anchorage over the Pacific and Russia, heading to the Chinese coastline north of Taiwan and the South China Sea - a route-map reminder of flashpoints.\n\nEarly last year a suspected Chinese spy balloon was floating in the same airspace above the frozen lakes of Alaska, triggering a full-blown international crisis and a nadir in US-China relations.\n\nJust hours before Mr Blinken stepped on the tarmac in Shanghai, the US Senate passed a bill package giving a further $8bn of military aid to Taiwan, which President Biden has said the US would defend if attacked by China. The self-governed island, which counts the US as its biggest ally, is claimed by China.\n\nThe package also saw the senate voting to ban popular social media app TikTok if its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, did not divest it within nine months.\n\nDuring her trip earlier this month, Ms Yellen had castigated China for its overcapacity issues resulting in cheap Chinese goods flooding the US market.\n\nChina has bristled at all these developments. It sees them as part of Washington's attempts to contain it economically and encircle it geo-politically. US officials counter that if China wants the threat of sanctions and tariffs lifted or US bilateral pacts eased with its regional adversaries, then Beijing should change its behaviour.\n\nOn Thursday Mr Blinken will warn foreign minister Wang Yi that China needs to curb the exports of machine tools and microchips to Russia. It says Moscow uses these for weapons in its war in Ukraine. Beijing has called that a \"groundless accusation\", seeing it as American hypocrisy days after Washington backed billions of dollars more lethal assistance for Kyiv.\n\nBeijing also has its own warnings for Washington. Prior to Mr Blinken's arrival, it issued a long and robustly worded statement setting out what they expected from the talks.\n\nWhile relations have started to stabilise, \"the United States continues pushing forward the strategy of containing China, keeps adopting erroneous words and actions that interfere in China's internal affairs, smear China's image and undermine China's interests. China resolutely opposes such moves and has taken strong countermeasures\", it said.\n\nState media and Chinese academics have also echoed this message. \"It seems like Blinken is here to issue an ultimatum to China. We will not give in to him and will not compromise on our core issues.\",\" Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times.\n\nWang Yong from the School of International Relations at Peking University said that a \"win-win situation\" could be achieved in the relationship, but added that the US has the \"wrong perception\" of China and Washington needs to show more \"goodwill\".\n\nOne of the most pressing issues for Beijing going into talks this week would be Taiwan, according to Singapore-based expert Alfred Wu.\n\nMr Blinken is visiting China less than a month before the inauguration of William Lai, the pro-sovereignty president of Taiwan reviled by Beijing, and there are concerns it would lead to a spike in tensions in the Taiwan Strait as well as the larger South China Sea.\n\n\"China would want to emphasise the red lines. The two sides would want to lay out the groundwork to ensure there would not be any escalation especially in the lead-up to the 20 May inauguration,\" said Mr Wu, an associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.\n\nEven beyond that date, their fragile relationship will be further tested as the US heads towards another presidential election where both candidates are vying to be tough on China.\n\nBack on the football field with the Beijing Cyclones, the thoughts are on both sports and politics.\n\nQuarterback Mu Yang once commentated for Chinese fans during a Superbowl game in Los Angeles - which he described as a \"huge honour\" - and hopes for more exchanges between China and the US in the future.\n\n\"This is the biggest game in the world. I hope superstars can come from the National Football League and teach us how to play elite football - that would be good for us.\"\n\nHenry Mu, meanwhile, appreciates how he is able to \"culturally communicate through this game.\"\n\n\"Chinese people can play American sports and American people are very welcome to come here . It is great to know each other and to make friends.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing",

Some Chinese experts said whether this visit, which shows Washington's eagerness to cooperate with China, can achieve a breakthrough depends on the US' mind-set and attitude.\n\nBut given that the US continues to send signals of \"pressuring for demands,\" experts hold low expectations for a positive outcome from Blinken's ongoing China visit.\n\nBlinken is scheduled to travel to China from Wednesday to Friday where he will meet with senior Chinese officials in both Shanghai and Beijing to talk about a range of bilateral, regional and global issues, according to a statement issued by the US State Department earlier.\n\nSome Western media also hold a cautious view of this visit. The New York Times said \"Blinken goes to China with potential trouble on horizon\" as the visit comes as Democrats and Republicans are vying to appear tougher on China. Reuters said Blinken arrived with bilateral ties \"on a steadier footing,\" but with a daunting array of unresolved issues threatening the stability of relations between the two countries.\n\nThe Associated Press also listed the major divisions between China and the US and key issues that Blinken is going to bring up on the trip including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, tensions in the Middle East, the Taiwan question and the South China Sea issue.\n\nJust before Blinken boarded his plane, the North America and Oceania department of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs briefed the media on Monday, providing a 3,000-plus-word statement about the details of the visit.\n\nIt not only reiterated a welcoming attitude but also elaborately outlined the five main objectives of the visit, including establishing correct perceptions, enhancing dialogue, effectively managing differences, advancing mutually beneficial cooperation, and jointly undertaking the responsibilities of a major country.\n\nThe briefing is also considered a negotiating memorandum provided to Blinken, experts said.\n\n\"There is a gap in attitudes between China and the US, which relates to the ways and ideas both sides take to handle bilateral relations,\" Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Wednesday.\n\nThe fundamental approach of the US is to view China as its most significant strategic competitor and its most severe geopolitical challenge, so the US adopts measures to contain and suppress China under the guise of containment, while simultaneously it needs China to cooperate as well as make concessions on a range of issues important to the US, Wu noted.\n\n\"On one hand, the US wants to suppress and guard against China, and on the other, it expects China to dance to its tune,\" Wu said.\n\nDespite this gap in attitudes between the two countries, for the Biden administration, with the continuing increase in uncertainties in Ukraine and the Middle East, the US can no longer afford to divert attention to potential frictions and conflicts in the Asia-Pacific region, which might consume even more energy and resources, some experts said.\n\nUnder the Biden administration's strategy of maintaining communication channels through normalized and routine high-level exchanges to reduce miscalculations and prevent uncontrolled competition leading to conflicts, Blinken has taken the baton from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to make a routine visit to China, Sun Taiyi, assistant professor of Political Science at Christopher Newport University, told the Global Times on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, although a number of US high-ranking officials have been making frequent visits to China, the US continues to signal its strategy of \"applying pressure for its demands\" and seeking more favorable \"bargaining chips\" for discussions, experts said.\n\nFor instance, US Trade Representative announced a new round of Section 301 investigations into China's maritime, logistics and shipbuilding sectors, and some US officials reportedly suggested that some Chinese banks could be cut off from the global financial system. It also rallied Japan and Australia to back the Philippines in provoking confrontations in the South China Sea, and published the 2023 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, spreading lies about China's Xinjiang and Hong Kong regions.\n\nThe US is drafting sanctions that threaten to cut some Chinese banks off from the global financial system, arming Washington's top envoy with diplomatic leverage that officials hope will stop Beijing's commercial support of Russia's military production, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMost lately, the US Senate passed a TikTok divestment-or-ban bill late on Tuesday and also passed a sweeping foreign aid package which includes arms support for the island of Taiwan.\n\n\"I think there are some risk factors in the future US-China relations. One is the Taiwan question, especially around May 20 when the island's regional leader-elect is set to assume office,\" Sun Chenghao, head of the US-EU program at the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times on Wednesday.\n\n\"If the US acts too excessively or provocatively, I believe it could impact cross-Straits relations as well as US-China relations,\" Sun said.\n\nThere was a brief period of optimism and positive atmosphere following the meeting between the heads of state of the two countries in November 2023, which has now vanished given a series of negative moves by Washington lately, some experts said.\n\n\"Under these circumstances, it is difficult to expect any positive progress from Blinken's visit to China. The actions of the US have made China feel that it is not a credible partner, seeking only to secure what it wants while presenting unreasonable concerns and demands for interest,\" Wu said.",

You may opt out at any time.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday for a three-day diplomatic mission -- mere hours after U.S. President Joe Biden signed into law a $95 billion emergency spending package that contains tough-on-China policies. This is Blinken's second visit to the mainland, where he will meet with business leaders and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. It is unclear whether Blinken will also speak with President Xi Jinping, as he did during his last trip in June 2023.\n\nExperts predict the foreign aid package to be a prime talking point between the U.S. and Chinese delegations, as part of it provides $8 billion in funding for the Indo-Pacific region, including military assistance to Taiwan. Beijing does not recognize Taipei's sovereignty and has repeatedly threatened to take back the island. Next month, Taiwan is set to inaugurate Lai Ching-te, whom China accuses of being an advocate for Taiwanese independence, as its new president.\n\nThe new U.S. law also requires ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok, to sell the social media app. Otherwise, it will be banned in the United States. Under Chinese law, companies are required to hand over to the government any personal data relevant to the country's national security. The FBI and U.S. Federal Communications Commission have warned that this opens up U.S. TikTok users to the risk of ByteDance sharing their personal data -- such as browsing history, location, and biometric identifiers -- with the Chinese government. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson declined to answer reporters' questions about TikTok at a news briefing on Wednesday, instead pointing to past Commerce Ministry statements that say China will \"firmly oppose\" selling the app. TikTok vowed to challenge the ruling in court.\n\nBlinken is also expected to urge Beijing to stop sending military-related technology to Russia amid its war in Ukraine. Blinken accused China last week of being the \"primary contributor\" to Russia's defense industrial base, citing evidence of Beijing providing the Kremlin with machine tools, semiconductors, and other items to rebuild Russia's military. \"If China purports on the one hand to want good relations with Europe and other countries, it can't on the other hand be fueling what is the biggest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War,\" Blinken said.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen went a step further during a meeting in Beijing earlier this month, when she warned Chinese banks that they could face fresh U.S. sanctions if they help Russia's war effort. But a senior Chinese Foreign Ministry official said on Tuesday that Ukraine is not an issue between the United States and China, adding that \"the U.S. side should not turn it into one.\"\n\nBlinken also plans to address human rights concerns in Hong Kong and China's Xinjiang province, cheap Chinese exports that Yellen said threatens U.S. jobs, the flow of Chinese-subsidized fentanyl and synthetic opioid substances to the United States, and Beijing's broad claims over the disputed South China Sea. Biden met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in Washington earlier this month to collaborate against Chinese activity in the region.\n\nFor its part, Beijing hopes to ease U.S. export controls on advanced technologies, with Xi warning Biden in San Francisco last November that more restrictions could \"deprive the Chinese people of their right to development.\" Biden called for raising tariffs on steel imports from China last week during a campaign rally.\n\nEvacuation prep. Israel is \"moving ahead\" with a ground operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, a spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday, though no timeline for when that might occur was provided. Top Israeli security officials said they visited Egypt on Wednesday to coordinate with Cairo on the operation, and Israel's Defense Ministry has purchased 40,000 tents with the capacity to hold 10 to 12 people each to house Palestinians forced to evacuate Rafah. A military official said on Tuesday that relocated civilians would go to a safe zone elsewhere in Gaza, a few miles along the Mediterranean coast.\n\nIsrael insists that a Rafah offensive is vital to eliminating Hamas militants believed to be sheltering in the city; however, humanitarian groups and foreign leaders have warned Israel against such an assault, arguing that it would inflict mass civilian causalities. Israel's war cabinet is expected to discuss the offensive on Thursday.\n\nAlong Israel's northern border, the Israeli military announced on Wednesday that it struck around 40 sites linked to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the Israeli military has already killed around half of Hezbollah's brigade-level commanders. The group has denied Gallant's claim. Israel's latest assault came one day after the Iranian-backed militant group said it launched its deepest attack inside Israel since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\nEconomic talks in Tehran. North Korea sent a high-level economic delegation to Iran this week, Pyongyang state media reported on Wednesday. These are North Korea's first known talks with Tehran in almost five years and will be led by North Korean External Economic Relations Minister Yun Jung Ho. State media did not provide additional details on what topics would be discussed, but experts say trade and military collaboration are likely to be on the agenda.\n\n\"North Korea is sending an economic delegation now but it will be the beginning of a wider military cooperation to follow between the two,\" Ban Kil Joo, a research professor at Korea University, told Bloomberg.\n\nExperts have long suspected Pyongyang and Tehran of cooperating on ballistic missile programs and exchanging technical expertise. Both North Korea and Iran are also among a small number of nations that outwardly support Russia in its war against Ukraine. Pyongyang has been accused of providing Russia with missiles and other munitions, and Tehran stands accused of sending drones to the Kremlin.\n\nRed notice. Argentina asked Interpol on Wednesday to issue a \"red notice\" for Iranian Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi, accusing him of being one of the people responsible for the 1994 attack on a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires that killed 85 people and injured 300 others. A red notice alerts police in Interpol member countries about internationally wanted fugitives, but it does not constitute an arrest warrant. That responsibility is up to each member nation.\n\nEarlier this month, Argentina's highest criminal court ruled that Iran planned the 1994 attack and helped one of its proxy groups, Hezbollah, carry it out. This was a \"crime against humanity,\" the court said. Tehran dismissed the ruling as having political motivations and denied any involvement. Iran did not comment on the red notice against Vahidi.\n\nSpanish authorities accidentally released notorious alleged cartel boss Karim Bouyakhrichan less than 60 days after he was arrested in January.

With the presidential election nearing, Democrats and Republicans are vying to appear tougher on China. And if former president Donald Trump is reelected, he could reverse Beijing's and Washington's efforts to steady the relationship.\n\nDuring Blinken's three-day trip, which will also include a visit to Beijing, he plans to press Chinese officials on a wide range of issues, including its support for Russia, cheap Chinese exports that US officials say threaten American jobs, and Chinese ships' aggressive maneuvers in the South China Sea, a senior State Department official told reporters in a telephone briefing.\n\nChinese officials are likely to bring up US support for Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims, and trade restrictions that Beijing calls discriminatory.\n\nBlinken is expected to meet with China's foreign minister, Wang Yi. It is not clear whether he will meet with China's leader, Xi Jinping, as he did during his last visit, in June.\n\nThat visit -- the first by an American secretary of state to China since 2018 -- came at perhaps the worst moment in US-China relations in recent years. High-level military communications were cut off, and neighboring countries worried that the two powers might stumble into a war.\n\nSince then, relations have thawed somewhat. China's economy is slowing, and Beijing has adopted a softer diplomatic tone to attract more foreign investment. Washington, though continuing to warn that China poses a global security threat, has said it wants to keep communication open.\n\nIn November, Biden and Xi met for four hours near San Francisco. Afterward, China agreed to resume cooperation with the United States on fighting the global production of fentanyl, and both countries affirmed the importance of restoring cultural exchanges. The two leaders also spoke by phone this month.\n\nLast week, the countries' top defense officials held a video conference, their first substantive engagement since late 2022.\n\nBut new sources of tension are rising. Western officials have grown increasingly vocal about concerns that China is backing Russia in its war in Ukraine. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, during her visit to China this month, warned of \"significant consequences\" if Beijing provides material support. China has maintained that it is not, while deepening ties with Moscow. Xi hosted Russia's foreign minister this month, and Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to visit China soon.\n\nUS officials have also said China is dumping cheap electric vehicles and solar panels in overseas markets, hurting American companies. China has rejected the accusations as smacking of protectionism.\n\nChinese ships' aggressive behavior in waters disputed with the Philippines and Japan has also raised concerns about a possible clash that could draw in the United States, a treaty ally of those countries.\n\nOn Taiwan, perhaps the most sensitive issue in the US-China relationship, the island is set to inaugurate its new president, Lai Ching-te -- whom Beijing reviles as an advocate of Taiwanese independence -- next month.\n\nAsked at a regular news briefing Wednesday about Congress' new aid for Taiwan, Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry, said that stronger military cooperation between the United States and Taiwan would \"not bring about security for Taiwan\" and would \"only escalate tensions across the Taiwan Strait.\"\n\nChina's defense minister, Dong Jun, had told US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin during their call that China would \"brook no compromise\" on Taiwan, according to the Chinese readout.\n\nWang declined to answer repeated questions about TikTok on Wednesday. He referred reporters to previous statements from China's Ministry of Commerce, which has said it would \"firmly oppose\" a sale of the app.\n\nWithin the United States, anti-China rhetoric is likely to intensify as the Democrats and Republicans compete to outdo each other on one of the few areas of bipartisan agreement. Campaigning last week in Pennsylvania, a steelworking stronghold, Biden called for raising tariffs on steel imports from China.\n\n\"We had high hopes after the San Francisco summit, but recent developments are putting a lot of stress on the relationship,\" said Xie Tao, the dean of the School of International Relations and Diplomacy at Beijing Foreign Studies University. \"When you add all these negative developments together, you have a pretty depressing picture of the US-China relationship right now.\"\n\nBoth countries have reason to try to prevent escalating tensions. The United States has asked China to help restrain Iran, with which it has good relations, from pushing its hostilities with Israel into full-blown war. And China is eager to stave off further tariffs from the United States, as strong exports have helped it counterbalance its housing crisis and weak consumer spending.\n\nBut both countries may also have little room for diplomatic maneuvering, because of hardening public opinion on both sides.\n\n\"There are already so many irritants and issues of mistrust within the relationship,\" said Allen Carlson, a professor of international relations at Cornell University.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But there is a huge question mark over what the discussions between the top US diplomat and his hosts can yield. It is generally assumed that given the current state of relations between the two sides, the chances are slim that the visit will culminate in any meaningful deliverables.\n\nBeijing and Washington seem to have been largely talking past each other on very important issues of mutual concern in recent years, and the likelihood of that pattern changing during Blinken's visit appears remote. This is because, as distrust accumulates between the two governments, the gap between them keeps widening.\n\nSecretary Blinken revealed prior to the trip a long list of subjects that he wanted to discuss with his Chinese hosts. It encompasses topics from China's alleged overcapacity to support for Russia's military industrial base to the East and South China seas to the Taiwan question to human rights to synthetic opioids to the Middle East.\n\nAt a news briefing by an official with the Foreign Ministry's Department of North American and Oceanian Affairs, Beijing categorically rejected Washington's narrative on every topic on Blinken's list.\n\nOn the conflict in Ukraine, the world can see it clearly that the Ukraine issue is not an issue between China and the US, and the US side should not turn it into one. On the Taiwan question, it's China's domestic affair that brooks no interference by outsiders. On the South China Sea issue, the US is not a party to the disputes there, and thus it should not intervene, not to mention mess things up. On human rights, matters involving Xinjiang, Xizang and Hong Kong are all China's internal affairs, which have nothing to do with human rights, and the US must not interfere with Chinese domestic affairs in the name of human rights. On the latest US accusation concerning \"overcapacity\", it is Washington that resorts to \"naked economic coercion and bullying\", targeting China's advantages in electric vehicles, power batteries and solar panels as results of the international division of labor and market demand.\n\nBeijing also presented its own list of priorities for the discussions, which are establishing the right perception of ties, strengthening dialogue, effectively managing differences, promoting mutually beneficial cooperation, and jointly shouldering responsibilities as major countries.\n\nBut these fundamental building blocks for better relations have been laid on shaky ground as contrary to Beijing's expressed hope for a constructive atmosphere for the face-to-face communication, Blinken struck a harsh note before he departed for China.\n\nHe accused China of \"supporting\" Russia's special military operation in Ukraine, and attempted to enlist the European Union's support to mount pressure on Beijing. \"If China purports on the one hand to want good relations with Europe and other countries, it can't on the other hand be fueling what is the biggest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War,\" he said last week.\n\nMoreover, coinciding with Blinken's trip to China, media reports reveal that the US is planning to kick some Chinese banks out of the international financial system for allegedly financing Russia.\n\nIn a clear response to the US allegation of it assisting Russia's invasion, the Chinese government published a white paper titled \"The Hypocrisy and Facts of the United States Foreign Aid\" on Friday. The document turned out to be a fitting answer to the US Senate passing a high-profile package of foreign aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan island on Tuesday night local time.\n\nIndeed, on each and every subject Blinken is expected to raise during his talks with his hosts, he will present a diametrically opposite opinion to theirs, meaning there is little room for compromise unless there is some give and take.\n\nWhile that has been found wanting up to now, the fact that Blinken is in Beijing for talks offers a glimmer of the hope that still lingers in Pandora's box, as it suggests that both sides still view the possibility of finding some firm common ground as a case of never say never.", "source": {"uri": "chinadaily.com.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "China Daily"}, "authors": [],

Chief among those demands is that China halt the export of so-called dual-use items to Russia, which the US claims are helping Moscow prosecute the war against the US-NATO backed regime in Ukraine.\n\nHaving goaded Russia into invading Ukraine, the US and its European allies are desperate to reverse the deteriorating position of the Ukrainian military amid its loss of territory to Russian forces. While funnelling ever-more quantities of sophisticated arms to Ukraine, Washington is now demanding that China assist in crippling Russia's industrial capacity and thus the Russian military.\n\n\"When it comes to Russia's defence industrial base, the primary contributor in this moment to that is China,\" Blinken told reporters last week after a G7 meeting in Italy. \"If China purports on the one hand to want good relations with Europe and other countries, it can't on the other hand be fueling what is the biggest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War,\" he said.\n\nThe US is not only demanding that China halt the sale of so-called dual-use items, including computer chips and machine tools. It is also threatening to cut Chinese banks facilitating such trade from the global financial system based on the US dollar. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned during her visit to China earlier this month: \"Any banks that facilitate significant transactions that channel military or dual-use goods to Russia's defence industrial base expose themselves to the risk of US sanctions.\"\n\nWashington's demand is completely hypocritical. The Biden administration acknowledges China has not sold weapons to Moscow, yet it is pushing through Congress a huge $95 billion-package of military funding of which $61 billion is to go to Ukraine and the US-NATO war against Russia. Now the US is insisting that the sale of dual-use items -- a broad, undefined category to which almost anything could be added -- be stopped.\n\nA spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington told the Wall Street Journal (WSJ): \"China's right to conduct normal trade and economic exchanges with Russia and other countries in the world on the basis of equality and mutual benefit should not be interfered with or disrupted. The United States should immediately stop imposing unilateral sanctions on Chinese companies and individuals.\"\n\nBlinken's remarks about the Ukraine war were also aimed at driving a wedge between China and Europe and pressuring the European powers to impose tougher sanctions on Beijing. The WSJ noted: \"Washington's European allies have shown even more reticence to apply punitive measures against a major trade partner and financier, sanctioning only a fraction of the scores of [Chinese] firms put on US rosters... Germany and some other key European allies had been satisfied with that no-arms policy as enough.\"\n\nA former senior US national security official told the newspaper: \"Now there's an effort to adjust that in part because of the scale of Chinese support. The hope is that we get the Europeans to read China the riot act.\"\n\nThe funding package that passed the US House of Representatives last Saturday was aimed not only at shoring up the Ukrainian military. It will also provide $26 billion to Israel for its genocidal war in Gaza and escalating conflict with Iran, which the US has accused of providing arms to Russia. Significantly, from Beijing's standpoint, the legislation includes $8 billion in military funding for Taiwan. Biden has pledged to sign the bill into law as soon as it hits his table.\n\nFar from being separate conflicts, the legislation passed with bi-partisan support makes clear that the US regards its confrontation with China as a prelude to it becoming the third front in a war to maintain American imperialism's global hegemony. In a similar fashion to its provocative inclusion of Eastern European countries in NATO, Washington is goading China to take military action over Taiwan. Biden has ramped up ties with Taiwan and boosted arms sales to Taipei effectively undermining the One China policy under which the US de facto acknowledges that Beijing is the legitimate government of all China, including Taiwan.\n\nAsked about US military aid to Taiwan at press conference on Wednesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin warned that closer military ties between the US and Taiwan would \"not bring about security for Taiwan\" and would \"only escalate tensions across the Taiwan Strait.\" Beijing has long warned that it would take military measures in the event that Taipei declared formal independence from China, yet US actions are actively encouraging the Taiwanese government to move in that direction.\n\nWhile deliberately provoking tensions with China over Taiwan, Blinken is also slated to raise the issue of \"aggressive manoeuvres\" by Chinese ships in the South China Sea. Over the past decade, the US has deliberately inflamed longstanding territorial disputes in the South China Sea between China and neighbouring countries as a means of isolating Beijing and strengthening military ties in South East Asia. Biden this month hosted a summit with the leaders of Japan and the Philippines that pledged closer military collaboration directed against China.\n\nChinese trade with Russia is not Blinken's only target. The US is also threatening trade penalties over what it alleges to be China's \"dumping\" of cheap goods on the American markets, particularly electric vehicles and solar panels. Since Yellen's visit, the Biden administration is also considering increased tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminium and is carrying out an investigation into alleged Chinese subsidies in shipbuilding and other industries.\n\nThe Biden administration not only maintained the heavy trade penalties imposed on China by the Trump administration but has ramped up efforts to hobble Chinese hi-tech industries by banning the export of the most advanced computer chips and chip-making equipment to Beijing and has prevailed on allies to do the same.\n\nAt a briefing on Tuesday, a Chinese foreign ministry official hit back at US claims of Chinese overcapacity and dumping as \"outright economic coercion and bullying,\" adding: \"Behind it is the evil intention of curbing and suppressing China's industrial development, aiming to seek a more favourable competitive position and market advantage for the country.\"\n\nIn an utterly cynical move, Blinken is also preparing to trot out the litany of \"human rights\" allegations against China, including the outright lie that Beijing is engaged in \"genocide\" against Muslim Uyghurs in western Xinjiang province. He does so even as the US arms, bankrolls and politically defends the fascistic Israeli regime as it wages a genocidal war in Gaza that has already claimed more than 34,000 Palestinian lives, a majority women and children, and has plunged the entire population into hunger and destitution.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, suggestions by the Biden administration and the American media that Blinken is going to China to improve relations are absurd. He has gone to bully Beijing into making further concessions even as US imperialism builds up its military forces and strengthen its military alliances in the Indo-Pacific in preparation for war.\n\nRead moreThe bipartisan politics of imperialism: Democratic liberals and Republican fascists unite in funding Gaza genocide and Ukraine proxy war21 April 2024The working class, the fight

Blinken cheered on the sidelines at a basketball game in Shanghai on Wednesday night, and spent Thursday chatting with students at New York University's Shanghai campus and meeting American business owners. It all went to emphasize the kind of economic, educational and cultural ties that the United States is pointedly holding up as beneficial for both countries.\n\nBut hanging over those pleasantries during his visit to China this week are several steps the U.S. is taking to sever economic ties in areas where the Biden administration says they threaten American interests. And those will be the focus of greater attention from Chinese officials, as well.\n\nEven as the Biden administration tries to stabilize the relationship with China, it is advancing several economic measures that would curb China's access to the U.S. economy and technology. It is poised to raise tariffs on Chinese steel, solar panels and other crucial products to try to protect American factories from cheap imports. It is weighing further restrictions on China's access to advanced semiconductors to try to keep Beijing from developing sophisticated artificial intelligence that could be used on the battlefield.\n\nThis week, Congress also passed legislation that would force ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok, to sell its stake in the app within nine to 12 months or leave the United States altogether. The president signed it on Wednesday, though the measure is likely to be challenged in court.\n\nMr. Blinken's visit, which was expected to take him to Beijing on Friday for high-level government meetings, had a much more cordial tone than the trip he made to China last year.

But who would Beijing prefer to deal with?", "body": "No matter who wins the U.S. election in November, for China it's lose-lose.\n\nWith mistrust between the two nations deepening, both President Biden and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump have sought to cast themselves as hard-line negotiators who will stand tough against China's rise.\n\nAnd with both candidates vying to prove their mettle on dealing with China, experts are divided on which would ultimately harm Beijing's interests more.\n\nYun Sun, China expert\n\n\"There's no best-case scenario. There's only the bad scenario and worse scenario,\" said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center, a Washington-based think tank.\n\nBiden has proved himself to be the more predictable president, which appeals to China's penchant for stability. But steadier leadership in Washington could bolster its partnerships in the Asia-Pacific, at a time when Beijing feels increasingly penned in by U.S. allies such as Japan, Australia and the Philippines.\n\nAs the more capricious politician, Trump might undermine such alliances, providing a vacuum for Beijing to step in and strengthen ties with U.S.-friendly nations. However, his impulsive tendencies could trigger a rapid deterioration of the relationship between China and the United States.\n\n\"With the Biden administration, the Chinese side is concerned with the long-term power play,\" said Minghao Zhao, deputy director for the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. \"If we have a Trump presidency, we have to be worried about more turbulence.\"\n\nThe Biden administration has made some efforts to improve frayed ties with China. In November, Biden and President Xi Jinping met in Silicon Valley and agreed to restart military-to-military communications, which China suspended in retaliation for then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in 2022. Analysts said the pact was critical in preventing flare-ups from becoming broader conflicts.\n\n\"For two large countries like China and the United States, turning their back on each other is not an option,\" Xi said.\n\nRead more: China's highflying EV industry is going global. Why that has Tesla and other carmakers worried\n\nThe current administration's focus on Chinese \"overcapacity\" in metals and electric cars signals more sparring over technology and trade and China's impact on U.S. industries.\n\nLast week, Biden called for the tripling of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from China to combat what he described as \"unfair trade practices,\" and a flood of cheap, low-quality products that have distorted the U.S. market.\n\nThe latest initiative builds upon the trade war that Trump launched in 2018, implementing 25% duties on billions of dollars of imports from China, such as cars, metals and machinery. In February, Trump threatened to raise tariffs on Chinese imports to 60% or more if he became president again.\n\nU.S. officials also have become more wary of Chinese software and the security risks it poses for U.S. users. On Wednesday, Biden signed into law a measure that would either ban or force a sale of the Chinese-owned short video app TikTok.\n\nRead more: Biden signs $95-billion military aid measure that includes path to ban TikTok\n\nThat same bill included about $8 billion in security assistance for Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory. The sovereignty of the self-ruled island is a particularly contentious impasse in U.S.-China relations, as Washington has strengthened ties with Taiwanese officials and China has increased military aggression.\n\nChina said it opposed the aid allocated for Taiwan and has accused the U.S. of enabling the island democracy to pursue formal independence. Biden has said publicly that the U.S. would send military assistance to Taiwan if China attacked, but the administration has clarified that U.S. policy has not changed -- that the United States acknowledges Beijing's claim to the island but does not endorse it.\n\nThe U.S. has warned China against providing aid to Russia in its war with Ukraine, and has considered sanctioning Chinese banks to deter support, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken is expected to discuss Ukraine among other disputes during a visit to China this week, and issued a warning ahead of his arrival.\n\n\"If China purports on the one hand to want good relations with Europe and other countries, it can't on the other hand be fueling what is the biggest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War,\" Blinken said Friday.\n\nChina said the U.S. was making \"groundless accusations.\" It also objected in a formal complaint to the World Trade Organization to recent U.S. legislation offering subsidies to incentivize domestic manufacturing of electric vehicles.\n\nDuring the last election, some analysts had predicted that Biden would be softer on China compared with Trump. This time, it's clear that neither candidate is likely to reverse a decade-long hardening against China, said Ho-fung Hung, a professor of political economy at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nThat shift began with President Obama's efforts to establish stronger economic and diplomatic ties in Asia, spurred by growing unease with Beijing's military assertiveness, as well as complaints that Chinese competitors were unfairly squeezing out U.S. companies, Hung said.\n\nNow, \"the only difference between different presidents would be the details and approaches of how they implement the toughening policy,\" he said.\n\nBoth candidates have a history of angering China with public remarks. After their November meeting, Biden again referred to Xi as a dictator. And while Trump has been quicker to praise Xi, he maligned China during the outbreak of COVID-19, which he insistently referred to as the \"Chinese virus.\"\n\nMinxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College, said that stronger anti-China rhetoric among Republicans may inevitably beget harsher China policies under Trump.\n\n\"They're being so tough on China, it might be difficult for them to climb down,\" he said.\n\nBut Ja Ian Chong, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, said that since Trump doesn't adhere to political conventions, Beijing may see more opportunity to negotiate with the former real estate mogul.\n\n\"Since Biden is tough anyway, it may be worth the risk to roll the dice and see what Trump might bring,\" Chong said.\n\nRead more: Questions swirl over the future of TikTok. Who could own it? How will the platform operate?\n\nSome reports on Chinese disinformation campaigns also indicate a potential preference for a Trump presidency.\n\nAn April report from the London-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a research organization, identified a network of Chinese government-linked social media accounts impersonating Trump supporters and propagating criticisms of Biden.\n\nHowever, academics said attempts to spread information by Chinese actors are probably more geared toward sowing doubt in democracy and America rather than directly targeting Trump or Biden.\n\n\"I think they are more interested in showing that democratic elections are not an effective system,\" Sun from the Stimson Center said. \"In that sense, undermining credibility is more important for China than undermining a specific candidate.\"\n\nCommentators from Chinese state and social media have criticized both candidates as indicative of the flaws of democracy and America's decline. An April commentary from China's official state news agency said money, rather than voters, would ultimately decide the next U.S. president.\n\nSima Nan, a Chinese television pundit, said in a video on Chinese social media last year that a race between Biden and Trump would be a difficult choice -- like picking between spoiled Coke or spoiled Pepsi.\n\nSpecial correspondent Xin-yun Wu in Taipei

He will travel to Beijing on Friday to have talks with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi.\n\n\"We're prepared to take steps when we believe necessary against firms that are taking steps in contravention to our interests and in ways that ... severely undermine security in both Ukraine and Europe,\" the official said.\n\nChina observers cautioned that diplomacy won't avert Beijing's actions, given that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leaders have their own calculations in supporting Moscow.\n\n\"Russia will reciprocate with technology or other stuff that China has its eye on for some time, such as the warplane engines,\" Chen Shih-min, an associate professor of politics at the National Taiwan University in Taipei, told The Epoch Times ahead of Mr. Bliken's visit.\n\nFor China's part, \"Xi Jinping also doesn't want the war in Ukraine to end quickly,\" Mr. Chen said.

During his visit, he is set to engage with business leaders before proceeding to Beijing for discussions with Foreign Minister Wang Yi, with a potential meeting with President Xi Jinping on the agenda.\n\nBlinken's visit underscores the ongoing efforts to stabilise the often tumultuous relationship between the two global powers. This visit follows a series of high-level engagements and working groups addressing various issues ranging from global trade to military communication.\n\nIn a brief video statement against the backdrop of Shanghai's iconic skyline, Blinken highlighted one of the key focal points of his visit - the need to address the flow of fentanyl and synthetic opioid substances from China to the US.\n\n\"Just arrived in Shanghai in the People's Republic of China to work on issues that matter to the American people. One of those is fentanyl, synthetic opioids, the leading killer of Americans between the ages of 18 and 49. President Biden, President Xi when they met in San Francisco at the end of last year, agreed to cooperate to help prevent fentanyl and the ingredients that make it from getting the US. We'll be working on that. Besides my counterparts in the Chinese government, I'll be talking to students, to academics, to business leaders...We'll be dealing with areas where we have real differences with China...face to face diplomacy matters,\" he said in the video.\n\nNotably, despite ongoing discussions, little progress has been made in curtailing China's supply of chemicals essential for producing fentanyl.\n\nBlinken's visit comes at a time when the Taiwan issue continues to simmer, serving as a potential flashpoint in US-China relations. Additionally, tensions have escalated over China's support for Russia in its conflict with Ukraine, further straining the already complex dynamics between the two nations.\n\nAlthough specific details were not disclosed, a senior State Department official, briefing reporters, hinted at Washington mulling to \"take steps\" against Chinese firms deemed to pose threats to US and European security

But who would Beijing prefer to deal with?", "body": "No matter who wins the U.S. election in November, for China it's lose-lose.\n\nWith mistrust between the two nations deepening, both President Biden and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump have sought to cast themselves as hard-line negotiators who will stand tough against China's rise.\n\nAnd with both candidates vying to prove their mettle on dealing with China, experts are divided on which would ultimately harm Beijing's interests more.\n\n\"There's no best-case scenario. There's only the bad scenario and worse scenario,\" said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center, a Washington-based think tank.\n\nBiden has proved himself to be the more predictable president, which appeals to China's penchant for stability. But steadier leadership in Washington could bolster its partnerships in the Asia-Pacific, at a time when Beijing feels increasingly penned in by U.S. allies such as Japan, Australia and the Philippines.\n\nAs the more capricious politician, Trump might undermine such alliances, providing a vacuum for Beijing to step in and strengthen ties with U.S.-friendly nations. However, his impulsive tendencies could trigger a rapid deterioration of the relationship between China and the United States.\n\n\"With the Biden administration, the Chinese side is concerned with the long-term power play,\" said Minghao Zhao, deputy director for the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. \"If we have a Trump presidency, we have to be worried about more turbulence.\"\n\nThe Biden administration has made some efforts to improve frayed ties with China. In November, Biden and President Xi Jinping met in Silicon Valley and agreed to restart military-to-military communications, which China suspended in retaliation for then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in 2022. Analysts said the pact was critical in preventing flare-ups from becoming broader conflicts.\n\n\"For two large countries like China and the United States, turning their back on each other is not an option,\" Xi said.\n\nStill, sticking points remain.\n\nWhen Biden was asked if he trusted Xi, he invoked an old Russian adage popularized by President Reagan during the Cold War: \"Trust but verify.\"\n\nThe current administration's focus on Chinese \"overcapacity\" in metals and electric cars signals more sparring over technology and trade and China's impact on U.S. industries.\n\nLast week, Biden called for the tripling of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from China to combat what he described as \"unfair trade practices,\" and a flood of cheap, low-quality products that have distorted the U.S. market.\n\nThe latest initiative builds upon the trade war that Trump launched in 2018, implementing 25% duties on billions of dollars of imports from China, such as cars, metals and machinery. In February, Trump threatened to raise tariffs on Chinese imports to 60% or more if he became president again.\n\nU.S. officials also have become more wary of Chinese software and the security risks it poses for U.S. users. On Wednesday, Biden signed into law a measure that would either ban or force a sale of the Chinese-owned short video app TikTok.\n\nThat same bill included about $8 billion in security assistance for Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory. The sovereignty of the self-ruled island is a particularly contentious impasse in U.S.-China relations, as Washington has strengthened ties with Taiwanese officials and China has increased military aggression.\n\nChina said it opposed the aid allocated for Taiwan and has accused the U.S. of enabling the island democracy to pursue formal independence. Biden has said publicly that the U.S. would send military assistance to Taiwan if China attacked, but the administration has clarified that U.S. policy has not changed -- that the United States acknowledges Beijing's claim to the island but does not endorse it.\n\nThe U.S. has warned China against providing aid to Russia in its war with Ukraine, and has considered sanctioning Chinese banks to deter support, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken is expected to discuss Ukraine among other disputes during a visit to China this week, and issued a warning ahead of his arrival.\n\n\"If China purports on the one hand to want good relations with Europe and other countries, it can't on the other hand be fueling what is the biggest threat to European security since the end of the Cold War,\" Blinken said Friday.\n\nChina said the U.S. was making \"groundless accusations.\" It also objected in a formal complaint to the World Trade Organization to recent U.S. legislation offering subsidies to incentivize domestic manufacturing of electric vehicles.\n\nDuring the last election, some analysts had predicted that Biden would be softer on China compared with Trump. This time, it's clear that neither candidate is likely to reverse a decade-long hardening against China, said Ho-feng Hung, a professor of political economy at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nThat shift began with President Obama's efforts to establish stronger economic and diplomatic ties in Asia, spurred by growing unease with Beijing's military assertiveness, as well as complaints that Chinese competitors were unfairly squeezing out U.S. companies, Hung said.\n\nNow, \"the only difference between different presidents would be the details and approaches of how they implement the toughening policy,\" he said.\n\nBoth candidates have a history of angering China with public remarks. After their November meeting, Biden again referred to Xi as a dictator. And while Trump has been quicker to praise Xi, he maligned China during the outbreak of COVID-19, which he insistently referred to as the \"Chinese virus.\"\n\nMinxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College, said that stronger anti-China rhetoric among Republicans may inevitably beget harsher China policies under Trump.\n\n\"They're being so tough on China, it might be difficult for them to climb down,\" he said.\n\nBut Ja Ian Chong, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, said that since Trump doesn't adhere to political conventions, Beijing may see more opportunity to negotiate with the former real estate mogul.\n\n\"Since Biden is tough anyway, it may be worth the risk to roll the dice and see what Trump might bring,\" Chong said.\n\nSome reports on Chinese disinformation campaigns also indicate a potential preference for a Trump presidency.\n\nAn April report from the London-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a research organization, identified a network of Chinese government-linked social media accounts impersonating Trump supporters and propagating criticisms of Biden.\n\nHowever, academics said attempts to spread information by Chinese actors are probably more geared toward sowing doubt in democracy and America rather than directly targeting Trump or Biden.\n\n\"I think they are more interested in showing that democratic elections are not an effective system,\" Sun from the Stimson Center said. \"In that sense, undermining credibility is more important for China than undermining a specific candidate.\"\n\nCommentators from Chinese state and social media have criticized both candidates as indicative of the flaws of democracy and America's decline. An April commentary from China's official state news agency said money, rather than voters, would ultimately decide the next U.S. president.\n\nSima Nan, a Chinese television pundit, said in a video on Chinese social media last year that a race between Biden and Trump would be a difficult choice -- like picking between spoiled Coke or spoiled Pepsi.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType":

David Pierson covers China's foreign policy and its influence in the world.\n\nSecretary of State Antony J. Blinken is meeting officials in China this week as disputes over wars, trade, technology and security are testing the two countries' efforts to stabilize the relationship.\n\nThe United States is heading into an election year in which President Biden will face intense pressure to confront China's authoritarian government and offer new protections for American businesses and workers from low-priced Chinese imports.\n\nChina is courting foreign investment to help its sluggish economy. At the same time, its leader, Xi Jinping, has been bolstering national security and expanding China's military footprint around Taiwan and the South China Sea in ways that have alarmed its neighbors.\n\nMr. Biden and Mr. Xi have held talks to prevent their countries' disputes from spiraling into conflict, after relations sank to their lowest point in decades last year. But an array of challenges could make steadying the relationship difficult.\n\nShowdowns Over China's Territory Claims\n\nThe United States has been pushing back against China's increasingly assertive claims over swaths of the South China Sea and the self-governed island of Taiwan by building security alliances in Asia.\n\nThat effort has prompted more concerns in Beijing that the United States is leading a campaign to encircle China and contain its rise.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South China Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_direct_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign direct investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geography of Taiwan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/04/24/multimedia/00china-blinken-explainer-qpgz/00china-blinken-explainer-qpgz-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508500", "eventUri": "eng-9508500", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

China consumes some 14 million barrels a day of oil in peacetime.\n\nWhat does seem clear, however, is that China is deliberately stockpiling at speed, part of a much wider national effort to accumulate essential raw materials and resource.\n\nWhen it comes to energy, much of the new inflows now come primarily from Russia, whose energy exports to China rose by roughly one quarter last year to a record 2.14 million barrels per day.\n\nThat makes the Kremlin Beijing's largest energy supplier for the second year running, overtaking Saudi Arabia - and allowing China to benefit from substantially discounted Russian oil as U.S. and Western sanctions have turned away multiple other buyers since Vladimir Putin\u00b4s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBeijing\u00b4s stockpiling of oil is just one example of what appears a broad national effort to significantly increase the holdings of key raw materials. It is a move that some increasingly suspect is intended to help insulate Beijing against any future war or international sanctions, such as those that might be sparked by a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan.\n\nIn a piece for international affairs and conflict blogging site \"War on the Rocks\" published April 17, Mike Studeman, former commander of the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence and intelligence and director of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, argued that this was part of a much wider process.\n\n\"Xi Jinping is preparing his country for a showdown,\" he wrote, describing the Chinese leader as \"militarising Chinese society and steeling his country for a potential high-intensity war.\"\n\nPart of that, he suggested, included building up strategic stockpiles of essential goods and resources, protecting China against the kind of sanctions imposed on Russia after its Ukraine invasion - or, indeed, a militarily enforced blockade as part of a regional or global war.\n\nOther examples of heightened preparedness, he said, included the much higher tempo of Chinese military operations around Taiwan - designed to both exercise China\u00b4s military and implicitly threaten the government in Taipei with the consequences of its own total military blockade.\n\nU.S. officials say they believe Xi has given his armed forces until 2027 to be prepared to invade Taiwan, although those inside and outside the U.S. government remain divided on whether a decision to actually attack has genuinely been made.\n\nThis week, the outgoing head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said Beijing was continuing to plough resources into its military despite economic turmoil caused by a real estate crisis and a slump in U.S.-China trade.\n\n\"Despite a failing economy, there is a conscious decision to fund military capability,\" Admiral John Aquilino told a naval conference in Japan. \"That's concerning to me.\"\n\nWhat is clear, Western experts and officials say, is that the government in Beijing has learned multiple lessons from Russia\u00b4s troubled experience in Ukraine.\n\nThese include the desirability of managing any military takeover extremely quickly, presenting the outside world - and particularly the U.S. - with a lightning change of government in Taiwan\u00b4s capital Taipei before anyone can truly react.\n\nCOMMUNICATIONS\n\nOver the last year, U.S. President Joe Biden and counterpart Xi have held one relatively cordial meeting in California in November and at least one follow-on bilateral telephone call, while military officials have held direct meetings aimed at finding ways to ensure communication and reduce tensions in any future crisis.\n\nSo far, neither Washington nor other Western states have moved to significantly cut China off from raw materials, although the U.S. has increasingly worked to strip Beijing of access to high-tech microchips, particularly those that could be used for weapons.\n\nEuropean states remain publicly divided over their approaches to Beijing, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visiting China this month in what appeared to be an effort to maintain ongoing trade links.\n\nGerman officials say Scholz pressed Chinese counterparts including Xi on multiple issues including human rights and Beijing's support for Russia in Ukraine.\n\nMore broadly, however, Western-Chinese relations continue to deteriorate - and not just over Taiwan, which Beijing views as a rogue province with which it vows to pursue \"reunification\" either peaceably or by force.\n\nThis month, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken told fellow NATO foreign ministers that ever more Chinese components were being found inside Russian weapons in Ukraine. Beijing\u00b4s support for Moscow, Blinken said, was approaching the threshold of delivering lethal weapons systems.\n\nThis week also saw two rounds of arrests in Europe linked to alleged espionage by China, including two parliamentary researchers in Britain and three Germans working on defense programs. China\u00b4s embassies in both countries denied involvement in spying.\n\nHaving initially recovered following the COVID pandemic, U.S.-Chinese trade nosedived in 2023 and so far shows little signs of recovering.\n\nOfficials in both the U.S. and Europe also say they are considering introducing trade tariffs on Chinese production of electric vehicles in particular, accusing Beijing of deliberate overproduction in a way that threatens U.S. and European rivals.\n\nShould such tariffs be introduced, relations would almost certainly deteriorate still further.\n\nChina\u00b4s government buyers have never been ones to turn down a bargain, frequently building up their national stockpiles when short-term prices fall. Newly imposed Western sanctions on Russian nickel, aluminium and copper that entered force this month are seen as likely to spur further Chinese buying.\n\nWhen it comes to lithium, a vital component in many types of battery, Beijing has bought up not just stock but also processing facilities and mines, including overseas.\n\nIn March, investment bank UBS estimated that China might control a third of all global lithium supply as soon as 2025, again exploiting a price crash to further build its holdings.\n\nA U.S. Geological Survey report from 2016 showed China's mineral deposits containing aluminium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, gallium, germanium, iridium, tantalum, tin, tungsten, zinc and zirconium as well as other rare earth elements.\n\nSince then, China has sometimes sold off elements of its strategic reserves when prices have been particularly high, thereby reducing the costs for Chinese industry. More broadly, however, those stockpiles have continued to grow.\n\nWhen it comes to one particular commodity, those purchases appear to go well beyond the government. Chinese consumers and companies, as well as state institutions, have been on a particular buying spree this year for gold, pushing its global price to a record high above $2,400 an ounce.\n\nThat has prompted speculation that China is about to make a concerted effort to wean itself and other major emerging economies off their long-term dependence on the U.S. dollar.\n\nBut it may also be a reflection that China\u00b4s elite expect a more dangerous-feeling world over the rest of the 2020s and beyond, and would rather consolidate their wealth within Chinese borders well before that situation worsens.\n\n(Editing by Mark Heinrich)", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Discussions are expected to center around China's sale of weapon components and dual-use products to Russia, which fuel Vladimir Putin's military ambitions in Ukraine. The looming threat of US sanctions against Chinese firms involved adds a layer of complexity to the talks.\n\nThe United States is bolstered by a united front with European allies, who share concerns over Russia's aggressive stance and its implications for global security. Joint pressure from the G7 emphasizes the urgency for China to cease its support for Moscow. However, convincing Beijing to alter its strategic partnership with Russia presents a formidable challenge.\n\nChina's response to pressure over its ties with Russia could impact other facets of the bilateral relationship. Blinken seeks to maintain momentum on issues like fentanyl trade, emphasizing the importance of disrupting financing networks and enhancing law enforcement cooperation. Yet, the risk of Beijing scaling back cooperation looms large amidst heightened tensions.\n\nChina's steadfast support for Russia is intertwined with its perceptions of US encirclement through alliances in the Indo-Pacific region. Trilateral summits with Japan and the Philippines, as well as the Aukus security pact, highlight US efforts to bolster regional security. Such developments contribute to Beijing's cautious approach in diplomatic engagements.\n\nRead More: Iranian strikes on Israel represent 'spillover' of Gaza conflict - China\n\nDespite the challenges, Blinken's interactions with Chinese counterparts offer opportunities for dialogue on pressing regional issues.

The relationship between the two countries has worsened significantly. Beijing's peaceful overtures have been met with nothing but hostility in Washington DC. The United States is simply terrified of the prospect that China will overtake it. However, this has already happened in many ways.\n\nWhen not murdering millions around the world, America is still trying to figure out whether public toilets should be \"mixed-gender\", while China is busy building not just itself, but the world, too.\n\nMost of the planet is perfectly aware of this disparity and is making it clear that cooperation with Beijing is a matter of choice, while having anything to do with Washington DC mostly boils down to coercion, as the political elites there are simply incapable of conducting \"diplomacy\" without resorting to arm-twisting.\n\nBlinken is going to China precisely with such bearing, pompously announcing that he \"arrives with a warning that the US and its European allies are no longer prepared to tolerate China's sale of weapon components and dual-use products to Russia\". The political West insists that this is \"helping Vladimir Putin rebuild and modernize his arms factories, enabling him to intensify his onslaught on Ukraine\". Caught in the web of its own endless stream of lies, the belligerent power pole is trying to blame anyone but itself. However, this is all futile, particularly when it comes to superpowers such as China. Beijing will certainly decide whether or not to do business with someone and the political West has no say in it whatsoever. Blinken will have three days to relay the US position and if that time will be used to make toothless threats and attempt blackmail, he should've certainly picked another country.\n\nThe mainstream propaganda machine thinks that the relations between the US and China are improving, citing Blinken's planned attendance at a basketball game as the indicator of this.\n\nHowever, the simple fact that none of the top-ranking officials greeted him when he flew in indicates something completely different. Blinken is supposed to meet Beijing's veteran Foreign Minister Wang Yi tomorrow. The encounter is expected to last at least six hours and might even include President Xi Jinping. This will certainly depend on Blinken's command of actual diplomacy, as the aforementioned threats he pompously announced are only for domestic consumption and are entirely void in China. The US might threaten with sanctions, but this is a two-way street and any reciprocal measures would certainly hurt America's economic and maybe even national security interests. It's entirely up to the US whether things will take such an unpleasant turn.\n\nThe troubled Biden administration reportedly raised the issue of the supposed \"support\" for Russia directly with President Xi Jinping, while US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen did the same during her recent visit to China. However, Beijing seems completely unconcerned, as it has repeatedly stated that Washington DC's threats regarding its close ties with Moscow mean nothing, particularly as the US and its vassals and satellite states keep escalating their aggression in the Asia-Pacific. It seems that simply maintaining normal economic and financial relations with Russia now boils down to \"helping\" its efforts to push back against NATO aggression in Europe. After all, even if countries like China, Iran and North Korea are building closer ties with their northern neighbor, it can only be expected that everyone the political West keeps threatening will find ways to unite their forces and push back together.\n\n\"Let me stress again that China's right to conduct normal trade and economic exchanges with Russia and other countries in the world on the basis of equality and mutual benefit should not be interfered with or disrupted,\" Wang Wenbin, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, stated just before Blinken's arrival, adding: \"China's legitimate and lawful rights and interests should not be infringed on.\"\n\nUS officials insist that Beijing supposedly \"gave up on the idea of sending weapons directly to Moscow thanks to their threats\". However, the entire claim is essentially a multilayered lie, as there's no evidence whatsoever that China ever planned on arming Russia, let alone that it stopped doing so because of the political West's pressure. On top of that, Washington DC is trying to disrupt the rapidly growing trade between the two (Eur)Asian giants, particularly through claims that Beijing is supplying so-called \"dual-use\" industrial goods. This is where the endless hypocrisy and mental gymnastics of the political West become most evident. While the US just decided to send dozens of billions worth of weapons to directly undermine Russia's and China's basic national security interests, it's accusing the latter of \"helping\" the former by simply trading with it, as the so-called \"dual-use\" industrial goods can be pretty much anything.\n\nWorse yet, the US and its vassals and satellite states are surrounding both Beijing and Moscow with long-range missiles and deploying troops not only in their vicinity, but directly on their borders. Still, according to their own admission, \"the Blinken team is worried that China's response to pressure over Russia could be to slow down progress in other areas of the bilateral relationship\". This also includes the (Eur)Asian giant's close ties with North Korea, as the US wants it to put pressure on Pyongyang. Washington DC is particularly terrified of the prospect that Russia, China and North Korea are forming a more monolithic alliance that the political West will be simply hopeless to match. However, they have nobody else to blame but themselves. Constant threats and attempts to undermine all three of these countries left them with no other choice but to work together. After all, that's one of the reasons why BRICS itself exists.\n\n*\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share button above. Follow us on Instagram and Twitter and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

European states remain publicly divided over their approaches to Beijing, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visiting China this month in what appeared to be an effort to maintain ongoing trade links.\n\nIn the eastern Chinese port of Dongying, the start of 2024 has often seen several tankers docked simultaneously discharging Russian crude oil into a new 31.5 million barrel storage facility completed late last year.\n\nIt is, traders say, all part of a concerted and deliberate Chinese effort to build up strategic stockpiles for a perhaps uncertain future. Estimates of China's total strategic energy reserve vary from 280 to 400 million barrels, the upper amount exceeding the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve at roughly 364 million. China consumes some 14 million barrels a day of oil in peacetime.\n\nWhat does seem clear, however, is that China is deliberately stockpiling at speed, part of a much wider national effort to accumulate essential raw materials and resource. When it comes to energy, much of the new inflows now come primarily from Russia, whose energy exports to China rose by roughly one quarter last year to a record 2.14 million barrels per day.\n\nThat makes the Kremlin Beijing's largest energy supplier for the second year running, overtaking Saudi Arabia - and allowing China to benefit from substantially discounted Russian oil as U.S. and Western sanctions have turned away multiple other buyers since Vladimir Putin's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Beijing's stockpiling of oil is just one example of what appears a broad national effort to significantly increase the holdings of key raw materials. It is a move that some increasingly suspect is intended to help insulate Beijing against any future war or international sanctions, such as those that might be sparked by a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan.\n\nIn a piece for international affairs and conflict blogging site \"War on the Rocks\" published April 17, Mike Studeman, former commander of the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence and intelligence and director of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, argued that this was part of a much wider process. \"Xi Jinping is preparing his country for a showdown,\" he wrote, describing the Chinese leader as \"militarising Chinese society and steeling his country for a potential high-intensity war.\"\n\nPart of that, he suggested, included building up strategic stockpiles of essential goods and resources, protecting China against the kind of sanctions imposed on Russia after its Ukraine invasion - or, indeed, a militarily enforced blockade as part of a regional or global war. Other examples of heightened preparedness, he said, included the much higher tempo of Chinese military operations around Taiwan - designed to both exercise China's military and implicitly threaten the government in Taipei with the consequences of its own total military blockade.\n\nU.S. officials say they believe Xi has given his armed forces until 2027 to be prepared to invade Taiwan, although those inside and outside the U.S. government remain divided on whether a decision to actually attack has genuinely been made. This week, the outgoing head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said Beijing was continuing to plough resources into its military despite economic turmoil caused by a real estate crisis and a slump in U.S.-China trade.\n\n\"Despite a failing economy, there is a conscious decision to fund military capability,\" Admiral John Aquilino told a naval conference in Japan. \"That's concerning to me.\" What is clear, Western experts and officials say, is that the government in Beijing has learned multiple lessons from Russia's troubled experience in Ukraine.\n\nThese include the desirability of managing any military takeover extremely quickly, presenting the outside world - and particularly the U.S. - with a lightning change of government in Taiwan's capital Taipei before anyone can truly react. COMMUNICATIONS\n\nOver the last year, U.S. President Joe Biden and counterpart Xi have held one relatively cordial meeting in California in November and at least one follow-on bilateral telephone call, while military officials have held direct meetings aimed at finding ways to ensure communication and reduce tensions in any future crisis. So far, neither Washington nor other Western states have moved to significantly cut China off from raw materials, although the U.S. has increasingly worked to strip Beijing of access to high-tech microchips, particularly those that could be used for weapons.\n\nEuropean states remain publicly divided over their approaches to Beijing, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visiting China this month in what appeared to be an effort to maintain ongoing trade links. German officials say Scholz pressed Chinese counterparts including Xi on multiple issues including human rights and Beijing's support for Russia in Ukraine.\n\nMore broadly, however, Western-Chinese relations continue to deteriorate - and not just over Taiwan, which Beijing views as a rogue province with which it vows to pursue \"reunification\" either peaceably or by force. This month, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken told fellow NATO foreign ministers that ever more Chinese components were being found inside Russian weapons in Ukraine. Beijing's support for Moscow, Blinken said, was approaching the threshold of delivering lethal weapons systems.\n\nThis week also saw two rounds of arrests in Europe linked to alleged espionage by China, including two parliamentary researchers in Britain and three Germans working on defense programs. China's embassies in both countries denied involvement in spying. Having initially recovered following the COVID pandemic, U.S.-Chinese trade nosedived in 2023 and so far shows little signs of recovering.\n\nOfficials in both the U.S. and Europe also say they are considering introducing trade tariffs on Chinese production of electric vehicles in particular, accusing Beijing of deliberate overproduction in a way that threatens U.S. and European rivals. Should such tariffs be introduced, relations would almost certainly deteriorate still further.\n\nChina's government buyers have never been ones to turn down a bargain, frequently building up their national stockpiles when short-term prices fall. Newly imposed Western sanctions on Russian nickel, aluminium and copper that entered force this month are seen as likely to spur further Chinese buying. When it comes to lithium, a vital component in many types of battery, Beijing has bought up not just stock but also processing facilities and mines, including overseas.\n\nIn March, investment bank UBS estimated that China might control a third of all global lithium supply as soon as 2025, again exploiting a price crash to further build its holdings. A U.S. Geological Survey report from 2016 showed China's mineral deposits containing aluminium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, gallium, germanium, iridium, tantalum, tin, tungsten, zinc and zirconium as well as other rare earth elements.\n\nSince then, China has sometimes sold off elements of its strategic reserves when prices have been particularly high, thereby reducing the costs for Chinese industry. More broadly, however, those stockpiles have continued to grow. When it comes to one particular commodity, those purchases appear to go well beyond the government. Chinese consumers and companies, as well as state institutions, have been on a particular buying spree this year for gold, pushing its global price to a record high above $2,400 an ounce.\n\nThat has prompted speculation that China is about to make a concerted effort to wean itself and other major emerging economies off their long-term dependence on the U.S. dollar. But it may also be a reflection that China's elite expect a more dangerous-feeling world over the rest of the 2020s and beyond, and would rather consolidate their wealth within Chinese borders well before that situation worsens.\n\n(Editing by Mark Heinrich)\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri":

China consumes some 14 million barrels a day of oil in peacetime.\n\nWhat does seem clear, however, is that China is deliberately stockpiling at speed, part of a much wider national effort to accumulate essential raw materials and resource.\n\nWhen it comes to energy, much of the new inflows now come primarily from Russia, whose energy exports to China rose by roughly one quarter last year to a record 2.14 million barrels per day.\n\nThat makes the Kremlin Beijing's largest energy supplier for the second year running, overtaking Saudi Arabia - and allowing China to benefit from substantially discounted Russian oil as U.S. and Western sanctions have turned away multiple other buyers since Vladimir Putin's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBeijing's stockpiling of oil is just one example of what appears a broad national effort to significantly increase the holdings of key raw materials. It is a move that some increasingly suspect is intended to help insulate Beijing against any future war or international sanctions, such as those that might be sparked by a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan.\n\nIn a piece for international affairs and conflict blogging site \"War on the Rocks\" published April 17, Mike Studeman, former commander of the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence and intelligence and director of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, argued that this was part of a much wider process.\n\n\"Xi Jinping is preparing his country for a showdown,\" he wrote, describing the Chinese leader as \"militarising Chinese society and steeling his country for a potential high-intensity war.\"\n\nPart of that, he suggested, included building up strategic stockpiles of essential goods and resources, protecting China against the kind of sanctions imposed on Russia after its Ukraine invasion - or, indeed, a militarily enforced blockade as part of a regional or global war.\n\nOther examples of heightened preparedness, he said, included the much higher tempo of Chinese military operations around Taiwan - designed to both exercise China's military and implicitly threaten the government in Taipei with the consequences of its own total military blockade.\n\nU.S. officials say they believe Xi has given his armed forces until 2027 to be prepared to invade Taiwan, although those inside and outside the U.S. government remain divided on whether a decision to actually attack has genuinely been made.\n\nThis week, the outgoing head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said Beijing was continuing to plough resources into its military despite economic turmoil caused by a real estate crisis and a slump in U.S.-China trade.\n\n\"Despite a failing economy, there is a conscious decision to fund military capability,\" Admiral John Aquilino told a naval conference in Japan. \"That's concerning to me.\"\n\nWhat is clear, Western experts and officials say, is that the government in Beijing has learned multiple lessons from Russia's troubled experience in Ukraine.\n\nThese include the desirability of managing any military takeover extremely quickly, presenting the outside world - and particularly the U.S. - with a lightning change of government in Taiwan's capital Taipei before anyone can truly react.\n\nCOMMUNICATIONS\n\nOver the last year, U.S. President Joe Biden and counterpart Xi have held one relatively cordial meeting in California in November and at least one follow-on bilateral telephone call, while military officials have held direct meetings aimed at finding ways to ensure communication and reduce tensions in any future crisis.\n\nSo far, neither Washington nor other Western states have moved to significantly cut China off from raw materials, although the U.S. has increasingly worked to strip Beijing of access to high-tech microchips, particularly those that could be used for weapons.\n\nEuropean states remain publicly divided over their approaches to Beijing, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visiting China this month in what appeared to be an effort to maintain ongoing trade links.\n\nGerman officials say Scholz pressed Chinese counterparts including Xi on multiple issues including human rights and Beijing's support for Russia in Ukraine.\n\nMore broadly, however, Western-Chinese relations continue to deteriorate - and not just over Taiwan, which Beijing views as a rogue province with which it vows to pursue \"reunification\" either peaceably or by force.\n\nThis month, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken told fellow NATO foreign ministers that ever more Chinese components were being found inside Russian weapons in Ukraine. Beijing's support for Moscow, Blinken said, was approaching the threshold of delivering lethal weapons systems.\n\nThis week also saw two rounds of arrests in Europe linked to alleged espionage by China, including two parliamentary researchers in Britain and three Germans working on defense programs. China's embassies in both countries denied involvement in spying.\n\nHaving initially recovered following the COVID pandemic, U.S.-Chinese trade nosedived in 2023 and so far shows little signs of recovering.\n\nOfficials in both the U.S. and Europe also say they are considering introducing trade tariffs on Chinese production of electric vehicles in particular, accusing Beijing of deliberate overproduction in a way that threatens U.S. and European rivals.\n\nShould such tariffs be introduced, relations would almost certainly deteriorate still further.\n\nChina's government buyers have never been ones to turn down a bargain, frequently building up their national stockpiles when short-term prices fall. Newly imposed Western sanctions on Russian nickel, aluminium and copper that entered force this month are seen as likely to spur further Chinese buying.\n\nWhen it comes to lithium, a vital component in many types of battery, Beijing has bought up not just stock but also processing facilities and mines, including overseas.\n\nIn March, investment bank UBS estimated that China might control a third of all global lithium supply as soon as 2025, again exploiting a price crash to further build its holdings.\n\nA U.S. Geological Survey report from 2016 showed China's mineral deposits containing aluminium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, gallium, germanium, iridium, tantalum, tin, tungsten, zinc and zirconium as well as other rare earth elements.\n\nSince then, China has sometimes sold off elements of its strategic reserves when prices have been particularly high, thereby reducing the costs for Chinese industry. More broadly, however, those stockpiles have continued to grow.\n\nWhen it comes to one particular commodity, those purchases appear to go well beyond the government. Chinese consumers and companies, as well as state institutions, have been on a particular buying spree this year for gold, pushing its global price to a record high above $2,400 an ounce.\n\nThat has prompted speculation that China is about to make a concerted effort to wean itself and other major emerging economies off their long-term dependence on the U.S. dollar.\n\nBut it may also be a reflection that China's elite expect a more dangerous-feeling world over the rest of the 2020s and beyond, and would rather consolidate their wealth within Chinese borders well before that situation worsens.", "source": {"uri": "boereport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BOE Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@boereport.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

The article continued: some question whether the [hiring] choices are what America\u2019s democracy needs. \u201cEverybody\u2019s screaming about how we have a crisis in local news,\u201d said Jeff Jarvis, a journalism professor at CUNY. \u201cI say we have a crisis in national news too, at this time when fascism is at the door.\u201d \u201cRight-wing Brits running the Washington Post? Stuff of nightmares,\u201d said a tweet from Dan Froomkin, at PressWatchers.org. The Brit arrivals include Will Lewis, the new CEO of Jeff Bezos\u2019 Washington Post. \u201cIt feels very much like a dive headlong into the abyss,\u201d responded Drew Magary, a columnist for SFGate.com. \u201cLewis is British. NEVER trust a British media executive,\u201d Magary wrote. \u201cIf Lewis is going to be successful \u2026 he\u2019ll need to have the journalists with him all the way,\u201d wrote Guardian columnist Margaret Sullivan. \u201cRight now, they\u2019re not. And that means a course correction [by Lewis] is in order,\u201d said Sullivan, who formerly worked at the Washington Post and the New York Times as a media critic. \u201cThey\u2019re reaping what they sowed,\u201d responded John Miano, a lawyer who has defended American professionals as their jobs have been transferred to imported contract workers. \u201cWe\u2019ve had presidents importing workers [via the H-1B program], and we get silence from the media on that,\u201d he told Breitbart News, adding: The H-1B, any way you look at it, this is a program that\u2019s designed to replace Americans with cheap foreign workers. You look at the [legal] code \u2014 that\u2019s this program\u2019s entire purpose \u2026 [but] you won\u2019t find any description like that in the American media. No [establishment journalist] would dare say that this program is designed to replace American support workers. The economic impact of migration is huge, especially on white-collar Americans, but it gets little media coverage, Miano said: If you look at the numbers, there\u2019s a direct correlation between wages in the U.S. and immigration. Immigration used to be about 250,000 a year and at that level, wages grew with productivity. Starting about 1970, we had this huge increase from the Immigration Act of 1965 \u2026 and ever since then, U.S. workers have barely seen a raise. Immigration is one of the causes \u2014 there are a lot of other causes to blame it all on immigration! \u2014 but immigration levels should be a fraction of what they are. Breitbart News has covered the visa-worker programs, including their direct impact on media jobs. The government visa programs for mid-skill foreign graduates include the H-1B, L-1, J-1, OPT, H4EAD, CPT, TN, O-1, and E-2 programs. The government-delivered foreign managers and their ethnic-networked workers take a huge share of starter jobs and middle-management jobs in science, academia, computers, software, accounting, healthcare, fashion, architecture, engineering, marketing, recruitment, media, and much else. The nation\u2019s biggest tech conglomerates continued hiring foreign workers through the H-1B visa program, even as they carried out mass layoffs of American employees. https://t.co/Ebb3JhElhA \u2014 Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) May 31, 2023 The federal programs damage the workplace status of U.S. professionals, reduce salaries and career opportunities for U.S. graduates, and shrink the national innovation that would allow rising salaries. \u201cAll the way up through to 2000 to 2003, we were expected to roll out every [software project] perfect, no defects,\u201d veteran software designed Rex from Dallas told Breitbart News. \u201cBut after they started with the H-1Bs, now they expect large amounts of defects, and they\u2019re okay with it,\u201d he said. The visa workers know they will lose their visas and be sent home if they disagree with their managers, he said, They will do whatever they\u2019re told to do, being over a visa barrel. You know Americans are going to say, like at Boeing for instance, \u201cHey, you can\u2019t have one sensor that you\u2019re betting all these people\u2019s lives on, and you can\u2019t write code to make it nosedive if the sensor quits.\u201d These [visa worker] guys are going to just put their head down and say, \u201cOkay, whatever you said.\u201d I\u2019ve seen that over and over. In some cases, \u201conce they get for citizenship and they\u2019ve got their full-time [IU.S.] job, they will say what they think,\u201d he said, adding: But I\u2019ve never seen it anywhere with anyone that was an Indian contractor, H-1B, or you know, whatever kind of visa they\u2019re on \u2026 Usually, when they have Indian managers they stay like that, and, you know, they\u2019re not likely to raise their voice. Some of them are actually pretty doggone good, and they\u2019ve got good ideas, and they\u2019re afraid to say them. This replacement policy by investors and their C-suite executives has spiked stock values at enormous economic and generational costs to the American middle class and their children. \u201cForced early retirement in Tech is extremely common \u2013 the norm, in fact,\u201d said a Twitter account named Aethelleas on June 8. He continued: My whole network was once Tech folks, and only the sides of my head are whitening, but most of them \u2013 highly skilled \u2013 were pushed out by Indian H1B networks years ago. And this year, the older [American] ones had their grad children laid off or turned away straight out of school. \u201cAll these things are the issues that affect the labor markets that our media will not cover \u2026 [so] they\u2019re becoming increasingly irrelevant,\u201d said Miano. \u201cI used to read the New York Times every single day, and now it\u2019s not worth reading every day.\u201d In contrast, the media\u2019s griping is prompted by a mere handful of new arrivals from Britain. The Wrap wrote: Most recently with the appointment of Will Lewis as the publisher and CEO of the Washington Post \u2014 and his latest restructuring plan, featuring the appointment of Fleet Street-bred editor Robert Winnett as executive editor after the election \u2014 British players are gaining a significant foothold in the U.S. media industry. These latest U.K. natives arrive just months after a growing list of others \u2014 CNN\u2019s CEO Mark Thompson, The Wall Street Journal Editor-in-Chief Emma Tucker, Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait, The Daily Beast\u2019s content chief Joanna Coles and the outlet\u2019s new executive editor Hugh Dougherty. \u201cBritish men turning up to run everything is \u2013 and I cannot state this too strongly \u2013 a bad idea,\u201d tweeted Emily Bell, a former British journalist at the left-wing Guardian newspaper who now works at Columbia University\u2019s journalism school. Each of our three newsrooms will be led by an outstanding white male, which we feel is especially appropriate in Washington DC. If these three newsrooms are successful, we will consider a fourth and fifth \u2014 Margaret Sullivan (@Sulliview) June 3, 2024 \u201cMany Americans hear \u201cBritish journalism\u201d and think \u2018Oh, like the BBC,'\u201d said a tweet from author James Fallows. \u201cMore useful to think \u2018oh, like Fox News with a different accent.\u2019 Murdoch has brought waves of right-wing Brits to [the] helm of WSJ. Now Bezos with WaPo.\u201d \u201cThese British editors are in for a giant shock,\u201d said Miano. \u201cThe typical American newsroom these days is filled with babies.\u201d", "summary": "<p>The U.S. journalists who are ignoring the displacement and demotion of many U.S. professionals by millions of imported visa workers are suddenly complaining about the inflow of British journos into their top media jobs.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/06/09/elite-journalists-whine-as-migrants-take-their-top-jobs/\">Elite Media Whine as Migrants Begin to Take Their Top Jobs</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.breitbart.com\">Breitbart</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/06/09/elite-journalists-whine-as-migrants-take-their-top-jobs/", "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/09/washington_post2-640x335.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:58:33", "author": "Neil Munro", "authors": ["Neil Munro"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.07}

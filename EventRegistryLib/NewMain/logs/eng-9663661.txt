France is in the midst of a blitz campaign for snap parliamentary elections on June 30 and July 7, and the frontrunner far-right National Rally party has sought to make security and immigration key campaign issues.\n\nInterior Minister Gerald Darmanin described the attack as \"awful,\" and said police were limited in their ability to prevent such violence. \"It's a problem of the parents ... of authority.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and his far-right rival, Marine Le Pen, both condemned the gang rape of a 12-year-old Jewish girl in what authorities categorized as an antisemitic attack in a Paris suburb.\n\nDuring a Council of Ministers meeting on Wednesday, Macron said that French schools are being threatened by a \"scourge of antisemitism\" after a 12-year-old girl told police she had been in a park near her home in Courbevoie, northwest of Paris, with a friend on Saturday when three boys, two 13-year-olds and one 12-year-old, approached her. She allegedly was dragged into a shed and raped while they made antisemitic remarks.\n\nTwo boys were charged on Tuesday. Macron instructed French Education Minister Nicole Belloubet to start conversations in schools on the topics of racism and the hatred of Jews in the coming days in order to prevent \"hateful speech with serious consequences\" from \"infiltrating\" classrooms, the BBC reported.\n\nLe Pen, whose party's victory during the European Parliament elections signaled voters in France and elsewhere largely rejected mass migration and other leftist policies, blamed \"the stigmatization of Jews for months by the far left.\" Macron called snap national elections following Le Pen's far-right party victory, and they will begin later this month.\n\n\"The anti-Semitic attack and the rape of a 12-year-old child in Hauts-de-Seine revolt us. The explosion of anti-Semitic acts, up 300% compared to the first three months of 2023, must alert all French people: the stigmatization of Jews for months by the far left through the instrumentalization of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a real threat to civil peace,\" Le Pen wrote on X.\n\n\"Everyone should be fully aware of this on June 30 and July 7,\" she added.\n\n2 BOYS IN FRANCE ARE ACCUSED OF RAPING A 12-YEAR-OLD JEWISH GIRL IN AN ACT OF ANTISEMITISM\n\nFrance is in the midst of a blitz campaign for parliamentary elections on June 30 and July 7, and the frontrunner right-wing National Rally party has sought to make security and immigration key campaign issues.\n\nJordan Bardella, leader of Le Pen's party, said that if he is elected, he would \"fight the antisemitism that has been plaguing France since 7 October,\" the BBC reported.\n\nThe three boys were detained on Monday, and the local Nanterre public prosecutor's office announced Tuesday that two of them are facing multiple preliminary charges, including aggravated gang rape on a minor younger than 15, violence and public insult motivated by religion, death threats, attempted extortion and unlawfully recording or broadcasting sexual images.\n\nOne of the boys allegedly threatened to kill the victim if she went to the police, Le Parisean reported. The girl said she knew at least one of her attackers.\n\nEUROPEAN VOTERS REJECT SOCIALISM, FAR-LEFT POLICIES IN EU PARLIAMENT ELECTIONS: 'POLITICAL EARTHQUAKE'\n\nIn accordance with French law, prosecutors did not release the girl's religion. Later, however, lawyer and Jewish leader Elie Korchia said in an interview with French broadcaster BFM that the girl is Jewish and that Palestine was mentioned during the attack. French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that the girl was \"raped because she's Jewish,\" identifying it as an antisemitic attack.\n\nTwo boys are being held in custody pending further investigation, the prosecutor's office said. The third boy was named as an assisted witness to the alleged rape, and placed in a special education program. The prosecutor's office said the three boys \"expressed regret towards the victim without addressing their involvement.\"\n\nInterior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin described the attack as \"awful,\" and said police were limited in their ability to prevent such violence.\n\n\"It's a problem of the parents ... of authority. It's a problem of society as a whole,\" he said on BFM television.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOn Wednesday evening, hundreds of people gathered in front of Paris City Hall to protest antisemitism. Many in the crowd were holding placards, including some bearing the slogan \"raped because she's Jewish.\"\n\n\"Horror has no limits.

French media reported that the girl is Jewish.\n\nThe attack elicited widespread shock and concern, notably after a surge in antisemitic acts in France since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nAlso Read | Indian Millionaires Migration 2024: About 4,300 Millionaire To Leave India This Year and Go to Other Countries, Says Report.\n\nThe girl reported a rape in the town of Courbevoie on Saturday, and three boys, aged 12 and 13, were detained, according to the regional prosecutor's office.\n\nIt said two of the boys were given multiple preliminary charges on Tuesday, including aggravated gang rape on a minor younger than 15, violence and public insult motivated by religion, death threats, attempted extortion and unlawfully recording or broadcasting sexual images.\n\nAlso Read | Chad Ammunition Depot Fire Pics and Videos: Many Dead, Several Injured After Major Blaze Triggered by Explosion Erupts at Military Weapons and Ammunition Depot in N'Djamena.\n\nThe prosecutor's office did not specify the girl's religion or release her identity, according to policies for the protection of victims, as is standard practice for hate crimes in France. French media reports and the town mayor called it an antisemitic attack, and identified the girl as Jewish.\n\nThe two boys are being held in custody pending further investigation, the prosecutor's office said. The third boy was named as an assisted witness to the alleged rape, and placed in a special education program.\n\nPolitical leaders across the spectrum denounced the attack. France is in the midst of a blitz campaign for snap parliamentary elections June 30 and July 7, and the frontrunner far-right National Rally party has sought to make security and immigration key campaign issues.\n\nInterior Minister Gerald Darmanin described the attack as 'awful', and said police were limited in their ability to prevent such violence. 'It's a problem of the parents ... of authority. It's a problem of society as a whole,' he said on BFM television.

The three teen boys allegedly beat the girl and \"forcibly penetrated\" her while \"making death threats and antisemitic remarks,\" the report said, citing an unnamed police source.\n\nFrench prosecutors have opened an investigation into three teenage boys suspected of raping a 12-year-old girl in an attack motivated by antisemitism, French media reported Tuesday.\n\nAn investigation was opened on Saturday night after the girl and her parents filed a police complaint in Courbevoie, near Paris, alleging that she had been attacked in a park near her home by three teenagers, who hurled antisemitic insults at her before dragging her to a shed and gang-raping her, Le Monde reported.\n\nThe three attackers, aged 12, 13 and 14 years old, beat the girl and \"forcibly penetrated\" her while \"making death threats and antisemitic remarks,\" the report said, citing an unnamed police source. They are being investigated on suspicion of \"aggravated rape, aggravated sexual assault, attempted extortion, invasion of privacy, death threats\" for the attack. They were also being investigated for violence and hate speech due to the antisemitic nature of the attack.\n\nTwo of the three attackers were identified by the girl's friend who was in the park at the time of the attack. Le Parisien reported that one of the suspected assailants was the victim's former boyfriend, who confessed to the attack, saying he acted out of revenge after she hid her religious identity from him.\n\nAccording to the French Minister of Interior, there were 1,242 antisemitic incidents from October 1 to December 31, 2023, a 1000% increase compared to prior months.\n\nCyberWell, an innovative tech nonprofit focused on monitoring and combatting the spread of antisemitism on social media, released data in January exposing the unprecedented traction that the October 7 rape denial was gaining traction online. Cyberwell called for clear policy and enforcement against rape-denial content. Some internet platform employees informed Cyberwell then that the identified posts were not recent enough to be considered causing \"real-world harm.\"\n\nCyberwell has now stated that the recent Paris attack is the real-world harm they warned against. CyberWell Founder & Executive Director Tal-Or Cohen Montemayor shared:\n\n\"CyberWell is outraged by horrific reports that a 12-year-old Jewish girl was gang raped in an antisemitic attack near Paris. When women's rights groups and social media platforms fail to condemn gender-based violence against Jews, no matter the context, they reinforce rape culture everywhere.\n\n\"When CyberWell released data in January exposing the unprecedented traction that October 7 rape denial was getting online and calling for clear policy and enforcement against this vile content, social media platforms failed to act. Some counterparts even told us the data that CyberWell released was not recent enough to be considered causing \"real-world harm.\" This is the real-world harm we warned against then and have shockingly witnessed.\"\n\n\"Clear digital policies prohibiting content denying mass rape and sexual assault are needed now.

They were met by a third boy, who began insulting the 12-year-old girl about her religion, allegedly referring to her as a \"dirty Jew\", according to police information cited by Le Figaro.\n\nThe situation dramatically escalated, with the young girl being beaten and thrown to the ground as the boys took pictures of her. One of her assailants is said to have held a lighter close to her face, threatening to \"burn\" her.\n\nThen they allegedly began to gang rape the 12-year-old, violently forcing vaginal and anal penetration and fellatio. Her attackers also reportedly threatened to kill her if she spoke with the police.\n\nHowever, having told her parents of the attack, the family did go to the police. Three boys, aged 12, 13 and 14 were arrested in connection to the alleged rape based on visual descriptions confirmed by a friend of the 12-year-old girl as well as from CCTV footage placing the three youths near the scene of the incident. The rape was later confirmed by a gynaecological examination at the Garches Medico-Judicial Center.\n\nAccording to Le Parisien, the three youths appeared on Tuesday before a court where \"the judge charged two of the three minors with aggravated rape (group rape, on a minor under 15 and in the presence of minors), sexual assault in a group, attempted extortion, violence committed in a group, on a minor under 15 and on grounds of religion, invasion of privacy by fixing, recording or transmitting the image of a person presenting a sexual nature, repeated death threats, insult on grounds of religion\".\n\nThe third defendant was reportedly \"placed under the status of assisted witness concerning the facts of rape, and charged with the rest of the offences referred to in the introductory indictment.\"\n\nThe youngest alleged rapist was merely subjected to a judicial \"education measure\" while the other two were placed in custody under pre-trial detention for minors.\n\nThe paper reported that the youths \"partially\" admitted to the facts of the case, while saying that they acted out of revenge, with one of the accused having previously been the victim's boyfriend, who was reportedly angered over the girl hiding that she was Jewish from him.\n\nInvestigators are said to have discovered antisemitic images and comments on his phone, including one picture of a burnt Israeli flag.

But America is far from the only place where this plague is spreading. One of the most recent and horrible events took place this week across the ocean in France. In the suburbs outside of Paris, a 12-year-old Jewish girl was raped after being harassed over her faith. Compounding matters further is the fact that her two alleged assailants were 12 and 13 years old. The young girl bravely reported her assault to authorities and identified her attackers who were taken into custody and charged. There is apparently no doubt about their guilt because the little monsters posted a video of the attack online. (Associated Press)\n\nTwo adolescent boys in a Paris suburb have been given preliminary charges of raping a 12-year-old girl and religion-motivated violence, French authorities said Wednesday. A Jewish leader said the girl is Jewish.\n\nThe attack elicited widespread shock and concern, notably after a surge in antisemitic acts in France since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe girl reported a rape in the town of Courbevoie on Saturday, and three boys, aged 12 and 13, were detained, according to the regional prosecutor's office.\n\nIt said two of the boys were given multiple preliminary charges on Tuesday.\n\nThe boys have been charged with aggravated gang rape on a minor younger than 15, violence and public insult motivated by religion, death threats, attempted extortion and unlawfully recording or broadcasting sexual images. It is unclear what the courts can do with these little monsters, however. French criminal law places steep restrictions on what sentences can be given to minors up to the age of 13, so these two would both slip under the wire. Exceptions can be made in the case of murder, but since they didn't kill the girl, those rules would not seem to apply. They may wind up with an \"educational remedy\" and an order not to have contact with the victim for at least a year. That obviously doesn't seem like nearly enough.\n\nIn the United States, the laws vary from location to location, but in most states, juvenile defendants can have their cases moved to adult court when serious offenses are committed. (Minimum ages vary.) Even some blue states including Maryland have recently expanded prosecutors' abilities to transfer such cases as part of an effort to combat escalating gang violence involving minors. If things have gotten this bad in France, they may need to take a page from our books in this regard.\n\nWe have to wonder how this situation even developed in the first place. I can't imagine a 12-year-old just dreaming something like this up out of the blue, though perhaps I'm just being naive. How did they develop such vitriolic hatred of the Jews at that age unless they were exposed to radical antisemitism in their homes or in their school? They seem to have been raised with a complete lack of empathy and respect for human life. To believe that it was somehow acceptable to knock down and sexually assault another child even younger than them is unthinkable.\n\nIf we can't throw the boys in jail, how about their parents? I'm not as familiar with the French systems of justice and law enforcement, but the authorities seriously need to dig in and get to the bottom of this.

The incident has sparked widespread shock, particularly amid a rise in antisemitic acts since the onset of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe alleged assault occurred in Courbevoie, where the girl reported the incident over the weekend. Three boys, aged 12 and 13, were initially detained, according to the regional prosecutor's office. Two of them now face multiple serious charges, including aggravated gang rape of a minor, violence, religiously motivated insults, death threats, attempted extortion, and unlawful recording or broadcasting of sexual images.\n\nRespecting victim protection policies, the prosecutor's office withheld the girl's identity and religion, although media reports and the town mayor have identified her as Jewish, labeling the incident as an antisemitic attack. The accused boys remain in custody as the investigation proceeds, while the third boy has been designated as an assisted witness and placed in special education.\n\nPolitical leaders across France have condemned the attack during a heated parliamentary election campaign. Notably, the far-right National Rally party has focused on security and immigration. Echoing the collective condemnation, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin described the attack as 'awful' and stressed the societal and parental responsibility to prevent such acts.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courbevoie", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Courbevoie"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Courbevoie"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gang rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Rally"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G\u00e9rald_Darmanin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "G\u00e9rald Darmanin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Special education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_the_Interior_(France)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister of the Interior (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Religious_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Religious Studies", "wgt": 15}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/19_06_2024_14_25_41_228811.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663661", "eventUri": "eng-9663661", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

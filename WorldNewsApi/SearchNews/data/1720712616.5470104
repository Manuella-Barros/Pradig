And since it can be hard to achieve the right texture when cooking it in a pot, having a rice cooker to hand can really help - as these handy gadgets essentially do all the hard work for you. So, to see if this kitchen appliance is worth the space on your kitchen counter, trends writer Nicola Roy decided to try out the Cosori 17-in-1 Rice Cooker which is available to buy on Amazon. Shoppers can even nab an extra 17 percent off at the moment, bringing the price down from \u00a3119.99 to \u00a399.99. You can read her honest review below. As much as I do love to cook, something about trying to make rice always makes me want to scream. Boiling it in a pan often results in a wet, sludgy mess, and the microwaveable pouches always seem to taste like plastic no matter how much curry you pile on top. I had been wanting to test out a rice cooker for a long time to see if it actually made a difference in my kitchen. So when Cosori got in touch, one of the major air fryer brands out there, I jumped at the chance to give their first ever rice cooker a spin. Well, imagine my shock when I read in the instruction manual that cooking rice is only one of many functions this Cosori gadget can do. There is in fact 17 different functions, including saut\u00e9, soup, steam, sauce and even cake, making it ideal for all manner of cooking. This appliance couldn't be easier to use. It has a very clear LED display on the front on which you can select your desired cooking mode, and each one of these has a default time and temperature setting so there's no need to work it out for yourself. For example, long-grain white rice cooks for an estimate of 27 minutes on quick mode, whereas it's 50 minutes on standard. Brown rice takes a little longer at around an hour, while sushi rice takes between 37 and 47 minutes. There's also a handy guide in the manual for you to work out the grain to water ratio as well as a measuring cup and spatula for fluffing the rice up when it's done. I knew it would be fairly straightforward to cook rice using this gadget but the simplicity really did blow me away. All you need to do is make sure the rice is thoroughly washed, then pop it in the inner bowl with the right amount of water and select your required setting. And once the time is up - after which you'll hear a beeping noise - you've got a pot full of perfectly fluffy rice with no sticky, burnt pieces or water remaining. If you don't hear the beep then the keep-warm function kicks in automatically, which is ideal. What I also really liked was how the rice kept its texture until the next day after storing it carefully in the fridge overnight - it didn't go mushy like it does so often with boiled rice. I also tried my hand at making a simple shaksuka by popping some cherry tomatoes into the bowl with some salt, pepper and smoked paprika along with a splash of water and let it cook on the sauce setting, before cracking in two eggs and closing the lid back over until they had cooked. What I found a little odd was that the timer didn't always count down steadily when cooking the rice. One minute it would say 30 minutes, the next 18 - but this is actually due to built-in technology that automatically adjusts the gadget depending on its contents. And probably the only drawback is just how hot the inner pot gets after cooking. It's impossible to lift it out without oven gloves which is difficult, but I guess that's just part and parcel of its functionality. Otherwise, it's really easy to clean after it has cooled down, and as mentioned, there weren't any bits of rice sticking to the inside which often happens when cooking it on a stovetop. I'd really recommend this for anyone who has been considering trying out a rice cooker. Even better, there's currently a saving of 17 percent on Amazon, which brings the price down from \u00a3119.99 to \u00a399.99. Alternatively, you could try out the Ninja Foodi 6L Multi Cooker that boasts nine different cooking functions. It also has an impressive discount at the moment, costing \u00a3139 down from \u00a3229.99.

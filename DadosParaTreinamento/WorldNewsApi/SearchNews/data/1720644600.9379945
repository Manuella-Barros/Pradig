{"id": 231259172, "title": "Canadian Grand Prix: Qualifying to be a voyage of F1 discovery", "text": "If there was one theme to come out of every team\u2019s comments following Friday\u2019s practice sessions at the Canadian Grand Prix, it was this: Nobody knows just what to expect from today\u2019s qualifying session. Rainy and wet conditions impacted both practice sessions, restricting the programs for all ten Formula 1 teams and leading to uncertainty as dawn breaks in Montreal on qualifying day. \u201cIn all honesty, there won\u2019t be a lot that any driver or team learnt today,\u201d said Mercedes driver George Russell in the team\u2019s post-practice report. Russell was not alone in that assessment. \u201cIt\u2019s been a bit of a difficult day with the weather, so it\u2019s hard to read where we sit,\u201d described McLaren driver Oscar Piastri. \u201cI think we\u2019re looking good, but it\u2019s just difficult to know considering we didn\u2019t get in all the running we wanted to, but that\u2019s the same for everyone.\u201d Complicating matters for the ten teams is that the surface at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve was resurfaced ahead of this year\u2019s Canadian Grand Prix, which gives the teams yet one more question mark heading into today\u2019s FP3, and qualifying. \u201cOverall, the car felt good today,\u201d said Pierre Gasly in Alpine\u2019s post-practice report. \u201cAlthough, due to the weather conditions and heavy rain we did not get much running in. But it is the same for everyone else. So there are lots of question marks for all the teams, especially with the new asphalt.\u201d However, there may be a bright side to Friday\u2019s sessions for all the teams. Given that the weather may continue to be wet through Sunday, perhaps they have learned all there is to know. \u201cToday\u2019s sessions were both affected by rain. It means we haven\u2019t learned very much about tyre behaviour, car set up or even our competitive position,\u201d described McLaren Team Principal Andrea Stella. \u201cThat said, we may have learned the most valuable information already, because conditions may be the same as this for the rest of the weekend.\u201d We will learn just what, if anything, the teams learned on Friday in a few short hours. Ahead of Friday\u2019s FP1, Red Bull announced that the team was installing a host of new elements on Max Verstappen\u2019s RB20. After running a handful of laps in FP1\u2019s wet conditions, Verstappen lasted just four during FP2. That session ended with the leader in the Drivers\u2019 Championship reporting of smoke in the cockpit, and then jumping out of the car immediately after it was returned to the garage. After the team put yellow caution tape around the RB20 \u2014 a sign that there was concern about an electrical failure \u2014 Red Bull began working on the car, but Verstappen\u2019s day was done. With the Red Bull driver down in P18, a rather unfamiliar position. \u201cThere was a suspected electrical issue so they told me to box and they\u2019re investigating now. I haven\u2019t been back in the garage yet, but I\u2019m sure soon we\u2019ll figure out what it is,\u201d said Verstappen. \u201cIt\u2019s not ideal. I would have liked to drive more laps. Some other people had a few more laps in the dry, a few more laps now in the wet. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not how I would have liked to get on in FP2, but I think it\u2019s more important to just figure out what actually happened, and what kind of implications that will have for this weekend or the rest of the year.\u201d Red Bull arrived in Montreal holding a 24-point lead over Ferrari in the Constructors\u2019 Championship, and Verstappen with a 31-point lead over Charles Leclerc in the Drivers\u2019 Championship. But this year certainly feels different, with the talk from both Maranello and Woking indicating that Ferrari and McLaren believe they can continue to put pressure on Red Bull at the front of the field. Starting a week like this certainly puts Verstappen and Red Bull on the back foot heading into Saturday. Conditions were a bit drier during FP2, which allowed for some more representative times in the second practice session. Given that, Aston Martin fans might feel a bit optimistic this Saturday morning. After all, it was Fernando Alonso who topped the timing sheets in FP2, with teammate \u2014 and hometown hero \u2014 Lance Stroll not too far behind in FP3. While the timing sheet was rather jumbled in FP2, with Verstappen down in P18 and Lando Norris in P20, for example, this is probably a welcome sight for Aston Martin supporters. \u201cIt was a stop-start day thanks to the variable weather. In FP2 we got to complete a fair amount of driving both on the Intermediates and slicks on a drying track, and we learned a few things there and about the new tarmac, which is behaving a little differently to previous years,\u201d described Stroll in the team\u2019s post-practice report. \u201cWe got some good data on set-up and how the Intermediates behave, and that could be crucial for this weekend as there\u2019s more rain forecast.\u201d According to Alonso, who comes out on top Saturday may be a matter of making the right call at the right time. \u201cIt was a tricky Friday for the entire field due to the weather with not many laps recorded, particularly in FP1. The conditions meant the track was never fully wet or fully dry but it could be like this in Qualifying and the race so today could provide very useful information for the rest of the weekend,\u201d described Alonso. \u201cIf the conditions are the same tomorrow, those that are sharp in Qualifying and make the right decision on [tires] could gain a big advantage,\u201d added Alonso. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be interesting for those watching but for us as a team it\u2019ll be about getting the [tire] calls right and aiming to make the most of that.\u201d", "url": "https://www.sbnation.com/formula-one/2024/6/8/24174112/f1-canadian-grand-prix-qualifying-results", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2z_zI6JZIO4NKq0PGQfrvgzT9Wo=/0x0:3000x1571/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25482613/2155874613.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:00:01", "author": "Mark Schofield", "authors": ["Mark Schofield"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.282}

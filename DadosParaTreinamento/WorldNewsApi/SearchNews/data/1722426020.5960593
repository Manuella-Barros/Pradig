Naruhito, 64, was welcomed by chancellor Chris Patten and a hoard of waiting fans at Balliol College - where he, in 1984, first forged a bond with King Charles and would go on to spend days at the Royal Family's Highland retreat. The emperor - once dubbed a 'reluctant royal' among the Japanese elite - attended the event with his wife Empress Masako of Japan, 60, as part of their grand state visit to the UK. Photographs show the two royals flanked by security amidst a large crowd, including wellwishers waving the Japanese flag. For the occasion Naruhito donned a navy blue suit and black leather loafers but it was his stylish wife who stole the show. Masako, a Harvard alum who graduated magna cum laude in economics, looked ethereal in an off-white skirt set and matching leather pumps. The mother-of-one accessorised her look with a pearl necklace and earrings, while a cream clutch bag made for the perfect accompaniment. Her sleek locks were tied backward in a bun, while her fringe was coiffed upwards to create volume. Her make-up was subtle - a palette of pink lip and a light blush. Then couple looked jovial as they made their way around the Oxford grounds and greeted all in attendance. They were hosted by Lord Chris Patten of Barnes, the Chancellor of the University of Oxford and the last Governor of Hong Kong from 1992 to 1997. An adoring crowd awaited them at the steps of the college, including young children who the Emperor and Empress took the time to meet. It is expected that Japan's Emperor and King Charles will reignite a friendship once forged over fly-fishing and barbecues at Balmoral. It will be a chance to catch up and help promote the relationship between their two modern countries and perhaps compare notes on how their two ancient but 'slimmed-down' monarchies operate in the 21st century. The two men bonded back in 1984 when Naruhito, the grandson of the then Emperor Hirohito, was a student at Oxford and spent a few days at the Royal Family's Highland retreat. 'The Queen drove me around and invited me to a barbecue at a building in the grounds and Prince Philip personally guided me around the grounds in a horse-drawn carriage,' Naruhito said at a news conference last week. 'These remain very cherished and nostalgic memories for me.' Naruhito and Masako have been staying at Claridge's in Mayfair after arriving on Saturday. The official three-day visit began on June 25. At a news conference last week, Naruhito also recalled Charles teaching him to fly-fish in the River Dee beside Balmoral Castle. 'The [then] Prince of Wales carefully taught me how to put on a hair hook and how to throw it,' he said. 'We both put on waders and went into the river, where we saw big fish jumping nearby, but neither of us caught anything.' He described how Queen Elizabeth invited him to tea at Buckingham Palace two days after he arrived in the UK as a postgraduate student at Merton College, Oxford, in 1983. 'In a relaxed atmosphere, the Queen herself poured the tea, and we enjoyed a pleasant time together,' he said. 'I remember that the Queen shared stories about her visit to Japan and inquired about my upcoming life in the UK.' Naruhito - who became Emperor in May 2019 after his father Akihito abdicated at the age of 85 arguing declining health meant he could no longer fulfil his duties - has met Charles and other members of the family several times since. He has never forgotten the welcome he was given, particularly during that stay at Balmoral. 'I fondly recall the heartwarming hospitality I received from the Queen and other members of the British Royal Family, who treated me as if I were part of their family,' he said. The 126th monarch to occupy the Chrysanthemum Throne - the world's oldest continuous hereditary monarchy - and his Empress (who also studied at Oxford) will be reliving some of the happiest days of their lives during their stay in Britain. Between 1983 and 1986 Naruhito studied 18th century commerce on the River Thames as a postgraduate. Empress Masako, by then a young diplomat, studied international relations at Balliol College between 1988 and 1990. He and Masako, who met in 1986, both did a bit of rowing and played other sports while at Oxford and developed a love of the historic city - particularly Christ Church Meadow - and the Cotswolds while there.", "summary": "Emperor Naruhito and his wife Empress Masako  were welcomed by chancellor\u00a0Chris Patten and a hoard of waiting fans at\u00a0Balliol College in Oxford University.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-13580541/Emperor-Naruhito-Japan-Oxford-University-student.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/28/15/86700509-0-image-m-49_1719586289875.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:32:24", "author": "Editor,Guy Adams", "authors": ["Editor", "Guy Adams"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.427}

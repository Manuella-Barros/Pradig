While rookies reported on Saturday, July 20, the rest of the team is set to report on Tuesday, July 23.\n\nOnce everyone is in the building, the first practice of training camp is slated for the next day on Wednesday, July 24, and it won't be long after that when the pads come on and the true evaluations begin.\n\nFollowing a 2023 campaign in which the Lions finished with a 12-5 record, won the NFC North and made a run to the NFC Championship Game, expectations are high. In fact, the Lions are considered among the favorites to win a Super Bowl.\n\nHowever, they'll be battling history to do it, as no team has won a Super Bowl after a loss in the NFC title game the previous year since the Green Bay Packers in 1995-96, per Dave Birkett of the Detroit Free Press.\n\nBut the Lions have a good shot to buck that trend given the fact that they have much of the same roster as last season, plus what figure to be some key upgrades on defense, which was the weaker side of the ball in 2023.\n\nAre experts as high on the Lions as we are? Let's find out as we take a look at the pre-training camp NFL power rankings of experts.\n\nJosh Kendall, The Athletic: 3\n\nThe Lions have won more games since Nov. 6, 2022, (22) than they did in the previous 1,769 days (18). These are giddy times in Detroit, and the Lions have responded by throwing cash around, extending quarterback Jared Goff, offensive lineman Penei Sewell and wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown to big-money deals this offseason. Maybe just as importantly, Detroit retained offensive coordinator Ben Johnson, who led the Lions to the fifth-best offense in the league last season based on EPA (expected points added) per play, according to TruMedia.\n\nBleacher Report: 3\n\nIt's the end of the world as we know it -- and fans of the Detroit Lions feel fine.\n\nAfter decades of futility, the Detroit Lions won the NFC North for the first time ever in 2023. The team came within one game of the franchise's first Super Bowl last year.\n\nAs star edge-rusher Aidan Hutchinson told reporters, for him the goal this season isn't just to win two more games than 2023. It's to \"Restore the Roar\" in the long-term -- to lift the Lions to heights the franchise hasn't seen since the 1950s\n\nMike Florio, Pro Football Talk: 3\n\n3. Lions: The hard part is getting to a 17-point halftime lead in the NFC Championship. The easy part is holding it.\n\nDanny Boily, Roto Baller: 5\n\nThe Lions is the top trending team, and with good reason. They are solid (and sometimes elite) at each position group. Detroit is a team that can put up points and hurt you on defense. Jared Goff has proven that he can win (especially at home) with talent around him. Is it enough to win it all?\n\nCurt Popejoy, Steelers Wire: 5\n\nThe Lions were so close last season, we want to see how they rebound.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penei_Sewell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penei Sewell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amon-Ra_St._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amon-Ra St. Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_Golden_Hurricane_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tulsa Golden Hurricane football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Free_Press", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Free Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aidan_Hutchinson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aidan Hutchinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Florio", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Florio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Goff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jared Goff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleacher_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bleacher Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-06/USATSI_23467904.jpg?itok=ttwgUax-", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753907", "eventUri": "eng-9753907", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 155, "textEnd": 162}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 214, "textEnd": 221}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 335, "textEnd": 342}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Now, the Lions have realistic aspirations of winning the Lombardi Trophy in 2024.\n\nThe Lions' organization has been long associate with losing. In fact, it's no secret that their two playoff wins last season marked the first time the team had won in the postseason in 30 years. Last year's division title also snapped a three-decade span without one.\n\nHowever, the tides are certainly changing in Detroit. Each of the last two Draft classes have been apart of teams that have only finished above .500, and Campbell's record in three seasons is inching ever closer to .500 after a 3-13-1 finish to his first campaign.\n\nThe franchise once synonymous with losing is now changing its tune. With a young group of talent that only knows winning, the culture and expectations are shifting.\n\nAdditionally, Detroit's young nucleus is very talented. Amon-Ra St. Brown and Penei Sewell have already inked massive second contracts, while Aidan Hutchinson may be on the brink. If their rookie seasons are any indication, Jahmyr Gibbs, Sam LaPorta and Brian Branch look like pillars of the future.\n\nHaving just went to the NFC Championship game, the Lions' young collection of talent is building its winning pedigree.\n\nCoaching staff continuity\n\nDetroit has been fortunate to retain the majority of its coaching staff since Campbell took over. Several coaches, such as Ben Johnson, Aaron Glenn, Hank Fraley, Antwaan Randle El and Mark Brunell, have been with the Lions since or before Campbell took over.\n\nAs a result, young players can be treated to familiar schematics year over year. In a league full of turnover and changes, the Lions have been able to retain the coaching talent on their staff.\n\nThat's not to say there hasn't been interest elsewhere, as Johnson and Glenn have both garnered head coaching interest over the last two campaigns. However, both have returned to Detroit with aspirations of leading the organization to a title.\n\nWith Campbell leading the way and so many familiar faces still in tow, Detroit's foundation on the coaching staff remains in solid shape.\n\nImproved secondary\n\nThe Lions' secondary has added several new pieces that are expected to change the fortunes of the unit in 2024. After being one of the NFL's worst pass defenses a year ago, Detroit is relying on players such as Carlton Davis, Terrion Arnold, Amik Robertson and Ennis Rakestraw to compete in a better fashion.\n\nLast year, the cornerback position had the feel of a revolving door of sorts. Detroit struggled to find a second option opposite Cam Sutton, who had struggles of his own. This year, Davis and Arnold are among the possible replacements.\n\nAdditionally, Emmanuel Moseley is back in the fold after an injury cost him most of last season. If he can emerge with a spot, it will be an encouraging sign given the depth that now resides in the cornerback room.\n\nOffensive weapons\n\nThe Lions have a vast array of offensive weapons that allow them to score with any possible opponent. Ben Johnson's offense boasts two talented running backs and a collection of pass-catchers with diverse skill sets.\n\nWith David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs providing a nice 1-2 punch in the run game, Detroit has to worry little about whether or not they can survive on the ground. Gibbs also brings a presence as a pass-catcher that the Lions want to explore more in 2024.\n\nThrough the air, the effort starts and ends with the connection Jared Goff has with Amon-Ra St. Brown. The All-Pro wideout surpassed 1,500 yards last season and looks the part of one of the league's best at his position.\n\nIf Jameson Williams can emerge as a reliable second option, the Lions' offense becomes all the more dangerous. Sam LaPorta offers a secure option at tight end, and Kalif Raymond and Donovan Peoples-Jones will battle for an increased workload at receiver.\n\nToughness in trenches\n\nIt's no secret that the Lions have one of the league's best offensive lines. Sewell and Taylor Decker give the team two solid bookend tackles, and the interior is headlined by one of the NFL's best in Frank Ragnow.\n\nAs a whole, the unit has done an excellent job setting the tone for Detroit's run-oriented scheme. They also have had plenty of success keeping Goff clean in the pocket. Last year, Sewell was one of the best pass-protecting tackles in addition to his prowess as a run-blocker.\n\nDefensively, the Lions have a strong core foundation on the line as well. Aidan Hutchinson will bring the heat as a pass-rusher, and the addition of DJ Reader as the nose tackle could be a game-changer. With Reader occupying the blockers in the middle, players like Alim McNeill could be allowed to roam free or operate with less attention.\n\nBecause the Lions have committed so much to the trenches, they have the ability to dominate the line of scrimmage. By controlling this area of the game, they can put themselves in a position to dominate.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The first of a few, I assume.\n\nHere it is: The Lions' offseason was just as impressive as their postseason. Also, for planning purposes, the Super Bowl is Feb. 9, 2025, in New Orleans.\n\nIf you thought Lions Fervor would abate in the months following their loss to the 49ers in the NFC Championship Game, ha. Have you seen the aerial photo of the gigantic, stunning likeness of Dan Campbell carved into a corn maze in Ingham County? Have you seen the prognostications listing the Lions as a Super Bowl favorite?\n\nIt's not all hyperbole, either. Before their most-anticipated season in perhaps forever, the Lions completed one of their most productive offseasons ever. No contract squabbles, no major personnel losses. They attacked their weaknesses and addressed long-term issues. That doesn't mean they got it all right, but at this stage, we're legally (and logically) required to trust Brad Holmes and Campbell.\n\nThey got their foundational stars signed and aligned, inking Penei Sewell, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jared Goff to contract extensions totaling approximately $444 million. These weren't signings of desperation, or signs of overreaction. They were strategic moves to confirm a 12-5 season -- plus two playoff victories -- is an expectation, not an anomaly.\n\nIn late April, the Lions welcomed the rest of the NFL to take a look, hosting a wildly successful draft party that set attendance records. Then just for fun, they went ahead and drafted prime prospects at their most vulnerable position, cornerback. We'll see how first-rounder Terrion Arnold and second-rounder Ennis Rakestraw fill out the secondary, but Holmes collected plenty of options, also trading for top cornerback Carlton Davis from Tampa Bay and signing Amik Robertson.\n\nThe Lions weren't compelled to shake up a lineup that came within 30 minutes of reaching the Super Bowl. Most of the 22 offensive and defensive starters are fairly set, and the team even hung onto prized coordinator Ben Johnson, who'd rather operate a top-five offense than lead a bottom-five team elsewhere. Barring injury, the defense (23rd in the league) should be much, much, much (hyperbole!) better.\n\nVegas odds say the Lions have the look of a Super Bowl team. Evaluators say the Lions have top-five talent. Fans say, hey, how about top-two talent?!\n\nThat's the feverish narrative, and also the danger. Campbell knows there's only one more step after the NFC Championship Game, and he embraces the heady expectations. He declared in the spring he wants \"the whole enchilada,\" but with a cautious caveat.\n\n\"I don't care how much better we get or what we add or what we draft -- it's irrelevant,\" he said. \"It's going to be tough. Everybody in our division's going to be loaded back up and you're not hiding from anybody anymore. Everybody's going to want a piece of you.\"\n\nThe good news is, the Lions can counter with as many pieces as virtually anyone, as they officially open camp Wednesday morning. Various websites ranked the top 25 players in the league under 25, and the Lions have five, most of any team, from Jahmyr Gibbs to Sam LaPorta to Aidan Hutchinson to St. Brown to Sewell.\n\nIn three seasons under Holmes and Campbell, the Lions have sharply weighed immediate competitiveness against long-term goals, balanced youth with experience. Their defense was one of the youngest in the league, and it got both younger and more seasoned. Aaron Glenn has a couple more veteran linemen in DJ Reader and Marcus Davenport, which should help the team's second-biggest weakness, the pass rush.\n\nHutchinson has 21 sacks in two seasons and posted a league-high 62 quarterback pressures last year. The pressure for Glenn's defense is to turn those pressures into actual takedowns. One guy who will be watched closely is pass-rush specialist James Houston. He should be healthy after missing nearly the entire season, and if he can reprise his rookie debut in 2022 (eight sacks in seven games), the Lions should boost their sack total (23rd with 41).\n\nExpectations keep growing, and so do the stakes. The team is mulling plans to build a new practice facility, with more seating and access for fans. That's important because the fan base is expanding, and if the franchise asks for more (ticket prices went up an average of 30%), it's imperative to deliver more.\n\nBut beware, the schedule is tougher and the target is larger. The NFC North doesn't look very patsy-ish anymore. Some intrepid experts are picking the Packers to win it, and I'm not revealing their identities to protect them from overly enthusiastic Lions fans.\n\nIt's easy to contemplate big things in the weeks before big things must be delivered, and some tempering might be necessary. I suggested the Lions would go 11-6 and you'd think I called Campbell a vegan who prefers a refreshing seltzer over beer. The Lions are in that sweet spot where the majority of improvement should come from within, rather than purchased in free agency.\n\nSome of the young talent has been revealed, and I think Gibbs is about to become a superstar. But another layer has potential to be tapped, including linebacker Jack Campbell, defensive back Brian Branch and receiver Jameson Williams.\n\nThere is a downside to having abundant talent -- sort of. For now, there don't appear to be any huge roster battles. There's no quarterback controversy, unless you think Hendon Hooker needs to show real progress as the backup. The Lions have a rare situation with two excellent backs, Gibbs and David Montgomery, who complement each other and don't overshadow each other.\n\nAs camp opens, you might have to settle for one fierce starting-job competition, between incumbent kicker Michael Badgley and USFL phenom Jake Bates. That's a spot the Lions could use a leap, perhaps to allow Campbell to opt for a few more 60-yard field goal attempts, and a few less fourth-down passes.\n\nOh, they might gamble slightly less often, but if you think Campbell and the Lions will dramatically alter their identity, you haven't been paying attention. With a 22-8 record since mid-2022, I think we know who the Lions are, and so do they. After the defining comes the refining and it begins now, etched wherever you look, from the practice field to the cornfield.", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

In the fourth year under Brad Holmes and Dan Campbell, Detroit is in as good a position as any team in the league.\n\nHere are eight things the Lions must accomplish in 2024 in order to have success when the regular season begins in September.\n\nJameson Williams' development\n\nBy letting Josh Reynolds walk, the Lions are setting up an opening for Jameson Williams to step into a bigger role within the offense. The avenue is there for the Alabama product to break out in a big way as the team's second option behind only Amon-Ra St. Brown.\n\nHe showed growth throughout last season, but must now be a consistent option within the offense. Williams dealt with drop issues at the beginning of last year, so consistency will be key. There's no doubting his potential impact with his game-breaking speed, but the next step for him is being a reliable, every down threat within the offense at all levels.\n\nSecondary communication\n\nWith all the new faces in the secondary, Detroit has the look of a much improved defense in 2024. However, the challenge will be getting all the newcomers up to speed in an efficient and timely manner.\n\nCarlton Davis and Amik Robertson are veterans who should have little issue getting up to speed, while rookies Terrion Arnold and Ennis Rakestraw may need more time to develop within the complexities of the scheme.\n\nThe Lions' pass defense was among the team's biggest pitfalls last season, so developing a rapport between the new options will be paramount throughout training camp.\n\nReps for Brodric Martin\n\nAmong the players who are in the biggest need of reps is Brodric Martin, who played in just three games as a rookie last season. The Lions were high on his potential, but he didn't get much in the way of meaningful snaps last season.\n\nThis year, that could change for Martin. He has a valuable opportunity early in camp with DJ Reader placed on the PUP list. As a result, first-team reps are available for the taking at the nose tackle position.\n\nWhile Martin won't need to be an instant game-wrecker, development would be encouraging. He'll likely get plenty of opportunities in the preseason, as well, and could wind up benefiting greatly.\n\nGrowth from Hendon Hooker\n\nAnother player who will get plenty of opportunities this fall is Hendon Hooker. After spending most of last year rehabbing an injury, Hooker will get a chance to go through training camp in full for the first time.\n\nHooker was up-and-down in the spring, and training camp will give him another opportunity to demonstrate his abilities in Ben Johnson's offensive scheme. If he can improve his timing, the Lions' backup quarterback decision becomes much clearer.\n\nNo sophomore slumps\n\nThe Lions had three rookies who were among if not the best at their respective positions in their class. Jahmyr Gibbs, Sam LaPorta and Brian Branch all had fantastic rookie seasons. Now, the key will be maintaining that success and not taking steps back in their second campaigns.\n\nGibbs and LaPorta will be big parts of the offense, while Branch is expected to be a versatile chess piece for the defense. Taking a step forward will be key for each, along with first-round pick Jack Campbell.\n\nAfter taking his lumps as a rookie, Campbell appears primed for a bigger role in 2024. If he can take the next step, Detroit's 2023 Draft class could be among the best in recent memory.\n\nOverall health\n\nBranch was among four players that the Lions placed on injury lists ahead of the start of training camp. While injuries are a natural part of the game, remaining healthy will be exceptionally important for the Lions during camp.\n\nThe current injuries will give the Lions opportunities to evaluate their depth. However, having their key pieces ready to go for the start of training camp will be pivotal. Whether it's being patient with current injured players or monitoring workloads, Detroit must put itself in position to field their best lineups when the regular season approaches.\n\nKicker stability\n\nThe Lions have struggled to find kicker stability since Matt Prater departed after the 2020 season. Now, perhaps the biggest competition at the position of Campbell's tenure looms in camp.\n\nThe incumbent, Michael Badgley, is a player whom the staff is fond of and has been solid during his two years with the Lions. However, he'll battle UFL sensation Jake Bates for the job.\n\nBates has immense popularity with the Lions' fan base after nailing several long-range kicks with the Michigan Panthers this spring. Detroit needs stability at the position, as it's one that can win or lose big games.\n\nHandling expectations\n\nMore than anything, the Lions must manage the big expectations facing them in 2024. After years of being an afterthought, the organization is being placed among the league's elite by pundits. It would be little surprise if the team was in contention for a title at the end of the regular season.\n\nGetting back to where they finished last season and clearing that final hurdle will be no easy task, however. As a result, the overall attitude of the team and morale throughout camp will be closely monitored.\n\nHolmes and Campbell have worked diligently to construct a championship-caliber roster. Now, it's time for the team to show it can win at the highest stage.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brodric_Martin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brodric Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jameson_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jameson Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain_national_rugby_league_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain national rugby league team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendon_Hooker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hendon Hooker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Holmes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amon-Ra_St._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amon-Ra St. Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Reynolds_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Reynolds (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Campbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amik_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amik Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophomore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sophomore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlton_Football_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlton Football Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically_unable_to_perform", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physically unable to perform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Branch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian Branch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Campbell_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Campbell (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_LaPorta", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam LaPorta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahmyr_Gibbs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jahmyr Gibbs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_XFL_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 XFL season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Badgley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Badgley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Prater", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Prater"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5289,h_2975,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_lions/01j3eqr57wsgnj3mhc5r.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753907", "eventUri": "eng-9753907", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

The team, fresh off an NFC Championship Game appearance, added talented defenders like D.J. Reader and Carlton Davis and also extended star players Jared Goff, Amon-Ra St. Brown, and Penei Sewell.\n\nMany expect the Lions to challenge for the NFC crown once again, but that's not to say the roster is without concerns.\n\nJared Dubin of CBS Sports recently identified each team's biggest weakness. For the Lions, Dubin picked the secondary. Regarding that selection, Dubin offered the following:\n\nDetroit cut Cam Sutton earlier this offseason in the wake of his arrest.\n\nThen the Lions selected Terrion Arnold in the draft, but for a defensive\n\nback room that was so friendly late last season, it would have been nice to get more reinforcements beyond him and Carlton Davis. Counting on a rookie DB to play at a really high level is dicey, even if he was a top\n\nprospect.\n\nCurrently, the Lions are slated to start the aforementioned Arnold and Davis on the boundary, but it remains to be seen who will start in the slot if the Lions play Brian Branch at safety more, something the team is considering. If it opens up, Amik Robertson and Ennis Rakestraw Jr. will vie for that role.\n\nAt safety, the team has two former third-round draft picks in Ifeatu Melifonwu and Kerby Joseph penciled in to start if Branch doesn't.\n\nWhile the Lions have plenty of options in their secondary, they will still be relying on at least one rookie for a major role, which makes things unpredictable because there's no telling how a player will produce in his first year.\n\nWhile it's valid to have concerns over the Lions' cornerback situation, Detroit is on much sturdier ground at that spot than they are with their edge rushers. After all, the Lions are depending on Marcus Davenport to take pressure off Aidan Hutchinson, but his injury history makes him a question mark.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlton_Davis", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carlton Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penei_Sewell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penei Sewell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amon-Ra_St._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amon-Ra St. Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Goff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jared Goff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerby_Joseph", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kerby Joseph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aidan_Hutchinson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aidan Hutchinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amik_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amik Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Davenport", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Davenport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-07/USATSI_21364894.jpg?itok=5-o8bFRO", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753907", "eventUri": "eng-9753907", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Their 2024 prospects are high among those in the media. But what about after 2024? Are the Lions set to keep their championship aspirations?\n\nESPN seems to think so based on their recent future power rankings based on rosters, coaching staff and front office.\n\nThe Lions checked in at No. 4 on the list. [affiliatewidget_smgtolocal]\n\nReason for hope: The Lions may eventually lose offensive coordinator Ben Johnson to a head coaching job, but it hasn't happened yet -- which is selfishly good for Dan Campbell and Detroit's offense. The team spent a lot this offseason, but it now has key players (including receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and offensive tackle Penei Sewell) secured for the long term. And the culture that Campbell has built here has already resulted in an NFC Championship Game appearance and has the arrow pointing up. -- Dan Graziano\n\nThere were some concerns brought up, too,\n\nReason for concern: General manager Brad Holmes did everything he could to fix a secondary that gave up way too many explosive plays last season, and Terrion Arnold and Carlton Davis III will make an impact there. But I still have many doubts about which pass rusher will support third-year defensive end Aidan Hutchinson. Hutch has 21 sacks over his first two seasons combined but has had little help. Detroit was 27th in PRWR in 2023, and Marcus Davenport (signed this offseason) has never played a full season in his six-year career, so I'm not counting on the production to come from him. -- Louis Riddick\n\nNugget to know: Last season, the Lions were the fourth-youngest defense in the NFL based on snap-weighted age (25.5). This year, they project to be the youngest defense based on the average age of the 12 starters (including both base and nickel defenses) at 25.3. Linebacker Alex Anzalone is the only projected starter over 28, and four projected starters are still under 24. -- Aaron Schatz\n\nNot only are the Lions very high on this list and already in the Super Bowl mix, they are the highest ranked NFC team. The Philadelphia Eagles came in right behind the Lions at No. 5 with the San Francisco 49ers at No. 7.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs, Baltimore Ravens and Buffalo Bills were the only teams ranked above the Lions.\n\nJared Goff, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Penei Sewell were signed to extensions this offseason as the Lions kept some of the core of their roster locked up for the next few years during their Super Bowl window.\n\nThe window is open and the future is bright in Detroit.", "source": {"uri": "lionswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lions Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "billy_riccette@lionswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Billy Riccette", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Campbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aidan_Hutchinson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aidan Hutchinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Holmes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penei_Sewell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penei Sewell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amon-Ra_St._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amon-Ra St. Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Goff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jared Goff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Riddick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louis Riddick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bills", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Bills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davenport,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Davenport, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Davenport, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://lionswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2023/09/USATSI_21447766.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753907", "eventUri": "eng-9753907", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The Lions proved they belong among the league's best with their run to the NFC Championship last season, and are hoping to exceed that mark this year.\n\nThe road won't be easy, but Campbell and Brad Holmes have put together a strong infrastructure for the future. The Super Bowl window is open, and the time is now for the Lions to take advantage.\n\nHere is a recap of the offseason, as well as a preview of what's to come in 2024 as the Lions get set to beginning training camp this week.\n\nKey losses\n\nThe Lions lost two starters on the offensive side of the ball in free agency. Offensive guard Jonah Jackson departed for a three-year deal with the Los Angeles Rams, while wide receiver Josh Reynolds inked a two-year agreement with the Denver Broncos.\n\nJackson was a starter for the duration of his four years with the Lions but struggled with injuries in the final year of his rookie deal. Reynolds, meanwhile, was a strong downfield threat who had good rapport with Jared Goff dating back to their time together with the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nDefensively, the Lions will be without two of their higher profile free agency additions from a season ago. C.J. Gardner-Johnson returned to the Philadelphia Eagles after injuries sidelined him for a majority of last year, while Cam Sutton was released after a legal issue and ultimately returned to the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nBoth players were expected to be big additions for the secondary, but neither panned out. Gardner-Johnson missed 14 regular season games with a torn pec, while Sutton struggled to lock down opposing top wide receivers.\n\nTracy Walker III was released in the offseason and has yet to find a new team, while Jerry Jacobs was not retained as a restricted free agent after starting 12 games last season at cornerback.\n\nOther depth departures include offensive linemen Matt Nelson and Halapoulivaati Vaitai and defensive end Charles Harris. Backup quarterback Teddy Bridgewater and defensive lineman Romeo Okwara both retired from the NFL.\n\nKey additions\n\nThe secondary was the biggest target area of the Lions this offseason, as Holmes devoted several resources to adding better talent to the group. Detroit acquired Carlton Davis in a trade on the first day of the legal tampering period and signed fellow cornerback Amik Robertson the following day.\n\nHolmes also addressed the defensive line, adding a pair of high-upside pieces. DJ Reader has been one of the NFL's better nose tackles, and Marcus Davenport has strong potential despite injuries limiting his progress throughout his career.\n\nTo fill the void left by Jackson at the guard position, the Lions inked a one-year deal with veteran guard Kevin Zeitler. The 12-year veteran has played for four NFL teams previously and has been one of the league's most durable linemen.\n\nWith all the newcomers, the Lions will have options at the cornerback position. Davis appears primed to be the top option, but there will be a battle for the starting spot opposite him. Arnold is a popular pick, but adjusting to life as a corner at the NFL level can be difficult.\n\nIf Arnold can't claim the second spot, Robertson could be a natural fit. Though undersized, Robertson plays with an edge and has versatility to play either on the boundary or in the slot as the nickel cornerback. Rakestraw can also stake his claim at the role with a strong spring.\n\nAnother intriguing option is Emmanuel Moseley. After coming to Detroit on a one-year deal last season, Moseley played in just one game before suffering a season-ending knee injury. The Lions like his potential enough to give him another opportunity, and he appears to be close to healthy as camp begins.\n\nDefensive end\n\nAidan Hutchinson took another big step forward in his second NFL season, and looks the part of one of the league's best young pass-rushers. However, the Lions' pass-rush struggled overall and finished near the bottom of the league in sacks.\n\nAs a result, one of the more intriguing storylines will center on who emerges as the team's second option in this area. James Houston is a trendy pick after injuries cut his campaign short last year, as he burst onto the scene as a rookie and showed flashes of dominance.\n\nDavenport is another option if he can remain healthy, though he will start training camp on the PUP list. John Cominsky has been a stable veteran presence, but will need an uptick in production to warrant serious consideration.\n\nFormer CFL standout Mathieu Betts is a dark horse option, as he was a force at that level working off the edge. If Betts can emerge into a standout, his signing will be considered one of Holmes' most shrewd moves.\n\nWide receiver\n\nThere's no question that Amon-Ra St. Brown is the team's top option at wideout, and a path has been set for Jameson Williams to emerge as the second. However, there's a battle expected for the third wideout option after Reynolds' departure.\n\nKalif Raymond appears to be the leader in the clubhouse as it stands, but Donovan Peoples-Jones and Antoine Green are ready for roles bigger than what they had with the team a year ago.\n\nAdditionally, unheralded options such as Daurice Fountain and Kaden Davis could give the Lions interesting decisions after strong showings in spring workouts.\n\nLinebacker\n\nEvery indication shows that Jack Campbell is ready for a bigger role in 2024 after an up-and-down rookie year, but last season showed that nothing is guaranteed. After all, Campbell was beaten out for a starting spot by Derrick Barnes after being drafted 18th overall last year.\n\nCampbell was praised for his offseason efforts and is emerging as a leader, so there's plenty to like about his trajectory. Barnes won't go quietly, though, and Malcolm Rodriguez could also factor in after taking on a smaller role last year.\n\nKicker\n\nThe Lions have a serious kicking competition after the addition of Jake Bates. The UFL standout and viral sensation has a big leg, but consistency will be key for him to beat out the incumbent Michael Badgley.\n\nThough not posting flashy long-range kicks, Badgley has been consistent through parts of two seasons with the organization. He lost out on the job last year during the spring, but was brought back on the practice squad and eventually beat out Riley Patterson to win the job late in the year.\n\nThere are high expectations for Bates given his success at the UFL level. Still, he must prove to be consistent if he is to claim the job.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

For starters, Green Bay nearly upended the 49ers in the Divisional Round and beat the Lions in their second matchup last season.\n\nWith Jordan Love playing at such a high level, the Packers seem to have their quarterback of the future in place. Green Bay added defensive playmakers as well as running back Josh Jacobs.\n\nChicago drafted Caleb Williams as well as Rome Odunze, setting up an offense that threatens to be much improved from a year ago. Minnesota faltered last year after Kirk Cousins' injury and still has questions under center, but the Vikings should be improved from where they finished last season.\n\nBecause each of the teams in the North got better, the Lions will face a gauntlet within the division. Last season proved that there were no cakewalks to begin with, but this season could see the NFC North be one of the best divisions in the league.\n\nDifficult schedule\n\nBecause the Lions finished first in their division, they will play top teams in other divisions. The Lions will play eight games against teams that made the playoffs last year, including rematches with each of their three postseason opponents.\n\nDetroit opens the year with games against the Rams and Buccaneers, both of whom will be looking for revenge after the Lions ended their seasons in the playoffs. Also mixed in the schedule will be a showdown with Buffalo and road games at Dallas and Houston.\n\nThe Lions will certainly be battle tested as a result, with tough opponents and environments littered throughout the schedule.\n\nPass defense concerns\n\nThe Lions' pass defense was one of the league's worst last year for multiple reasons. It was a struggle in the secondary, while the pass-rush also struggled to generate heat.\n\nWith offseason moves, Detroit hopes it has pulled the necessary strings in both areas. Carlton Davis and Terrion Arnold are expected to help the secondary, while Marcus Davenport could be a difference maker in the pass-rush.\n\nDetroit's defense finished second in the league against the run last season, so the efforts in that area were exemplary. However, they will need an uptick in production against the pass if they are to eventually reach their lofty goals.\n\nHistory's trends\n\nHistorically, it has been tough for teams to reach the Super Bowl the year after losing in the NFC Championship game. The 49ers did it last year, becoming the first team to do so since they did it under Jim Harbaugh in the 2011 season.\n\nAs a result, history is not on the side of the Lions' success in 2024. Detroit is facing more buzz than ever before, and as a result will face pressure to live up to the high expectations.\n\nInjury threats\n\nIf there's one factor that can quickly derail a team, it's the injury bug. The Lions were fortunate to remain mostly healthy throughout last season, a luxury not afforded to every team given the physical nature of the game.\n\nThe Lions will start training camp with four players on injury lists, including a pair of key free agent additions in Marcus Davenport and DJ Reader. Both players have injury history, so monitoring their health will be key.\n\nAnother area that has been impacted by injuries in recent years is the offensive line. Frank Ragnow dealt with a myriad amount of bumps and bruises last season. Teams in recent years with Super Bowl aspirations have had their seasons derailed by injuries, so having reliable depth in place will be just as important as keeping the starters healthy.", "source":

Holmes also cut down potential distractions by giving quarterback Jared Goff, receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and offensive tackle Penei Sewell new contracts.\n\n\"We know we can win a Super Bowl,\" St. Brown said. \"We have the team. We have the coaches. We have everything we need in this building to win a Super Bowl. That's our goal. That's our focus.\n\n\"Everything we do from here out moving forward is to get that Super Bowl.\"\n\nIf a Lions player said that a couple years ago, the response would've likely been laughter.\n\nCampbell's first team lost 13 games in 2021 -- a fourth straight season with double-digit losses -- and had setbacks in six of the first seven games the following year.\n\nSoon after Lions owner Sheila Ford Hamp refused to panic during the rough start in 2022, insisting she was confident in Holmes and Campbell, a franchise that has struggled to get it right for decades found a groove.\n\nDetroit closed that season with eight wins in 10 games, narrowly missing the playoffs, and picked up where it left off last year by matching a team record with 12 wins.\n\nThe Lions won a division title for the first time since 1993, beat the Matthew Stafford-led Los Angeles Rams for their first playoff victory in three-plus decades and eliminated Tampa Bay before falling one game short of the Super Bowl.\n\n\"We're fortunate to have the success, but we know what came before that,\" said offensive tackle Taylor Decker, who endured a lot of losing after being drafted by Detroit in 2016. \" It was the work that came before that when no one cared what the Lions were doing.\"\n\nWhen the Lions kicked off training camp last year, Campbell asked the players to stand up, turn around and look toward the back of the full-team meeting room. They saw the team hadn't won a playoff game since 1992, a division title since 1993 and a league championship since 1957.\n\nAfter finally winning the division and a playoff game, offensive guard Graham Glasgow said the display was updated by someone who wrote 2023 on pieces of white, athletic tape.\n\n\"Those are still up there and there's still tape through it with old-school tape,\" Campbell said. \"It just looks better that way.\n\n\"But we've checked the box on two and we've got one more to check.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Campbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Bears_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brown Bears football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Holmes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheila_Ford_Hamp", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheila Ford Hamp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penei_Sewell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penei Sewell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amon-Ra_St._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amon-Ra St. Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Goff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jared Goff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Decker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Decker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/24/f668d869-d734-4fb1-8524-c05a0e6dcb0b/thumbnail/1200x630/3a29d1414e1eb5a6ae04802cadf877b6/ap24206536493908.jpg?v=5501038cbc281520ff9fdc308faab7dc", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753907", "eventUri": "eng-9753907", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

They have coaches who've been courted by other teams, only to remain in Detroit to see this through. They have a roster full of young, dynamic talent -- among the NFL's best. They've supplemented that core with veterans hungry to win and win for this city after tasting success in January.\n\nThese Detroit Lions, on paper, have everything needed to win a Super Bowl. Not often you can say that about this franchise.\n\nBut that's where we are. And the road to New Orleans begins this week, as training camp kicks off in Allen Park, Mich.\n\nOftentimes, success in this league isn't linear. It's what makes what the Lions have done so impressive. Each year of the Dan Campbell era, the Lions have shown noticeable improvement. From 3-13-1 to 9-8 to 12-5 and a trip to the NFC Championship game, it's been a steady yet remarkable rise for a franchise that's been anything but over the years. It's a testament to Sheila Hamp, Chris Speilman, Campbell, Holmes and company for getting the organization this far, but the work isn't done. The goal for these Lions now is clear. It starts with a division title, which could prove more difficult than last year with the Packers looking like a threat and the Bears on the rise. They should be aiming for the No. 1 seed in the NFC. And if all goes according to plan, Campbell will be eating enchiladas in February.\n\nHow will the Lions handle the target on their backs?\n\nEven though the Lions were NFC North favorites entering the 2023 season, they hadn't accomplished anything yet. Division title bragging rights belonged to Minnesota, and the Lions hadn't hung a banner for winning one in 30 years. Of course, that all changed last season, which now elevates the Lions as the team to beat. While the team did well to turn a good roster into a strong one, they'll now face a first-place schedule and what's looking like a tougher division. The Packers nearly took down the 49ers to reach the NFC Championship, and they remain one of the league's youngest rosters. The Bears have a rising defense and an offense that added No. 1 pick Caleb Williams, No. 9 pick Rome Odunze, star WR Keenan Allen and RB D'Andre Swift. Even the Vikings remained competitive without Kirk Cousins last year. The NFC North is coming for the Lions. They'll need to be ready.\n\nIs this the last dance for Campbell's closest confidants?\n\nFor years, we've been wondering when Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson and defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn might leave Detroit. And for years, they've remained in their positions as OC and DC. It's rare to have this kind of continuity in the NFL. It wouldn't be surprising to see Campbell's coordinators remain in Detroit -- they like it here, after all. However, it does feel like a matter of time before the band breaks up. Things could look different a year from now, and if that's what's in store, it makes winning this year, with a team that has what it takes to do it, all the more important.\n\nIs the new-look secondary enough to propel the defense?\n\nWhen you have a team that makes it within a game of the Super Bowl and returns its core roster, you don't have to reinvent the wheel. The offense should remain one of the best in the league with Goff and Johnson running it. But what about the defense? Glenn's group improved in some areas -- most notably, a run defense that ranked 2nd in the league in yards per game allowed -- but the passing defense was very much a liability, both in the regular season and the playoffs. Some new faces could help Glenn return to the man-heavy defense he wants to play, but we need to see results.\n\nWR Jameson Williams: You can't talk players to watch without talking Jameson Williams. Stepping into a larger role in 2024, this is his most important season yet. In terms of pure fit, Williams is everything the Lions need in this offense. He's the perfect complement to Amon-Ra St. Brown and Sam LaPorta in the passing game, as his deep-threat ability can open up the underneath game for others, and vice versa. The spring showed a more focused Williams, working with the first-team offense. We'll see what training camp has in store.\n\nQB Hendon Hooker: Jared Goff has been durable in his Lions' tenure, but these are things you have to think about when you reach contender status. The Lions will need to have a capable backup in the event Goff goes down for a bit, and they're turning to Hooker -- a 2023 third-round pick -- to fill that role. Hooker has natural skill and maturity beyond his years, but he faced growing pains this offseason as he corrected his footwork. The hope is that he'll look smoother in August, but we won't know until the preseason games begin.\n\nLB Jack Campbell: The No. 18 pick in the 2023 draft, Campbell didn't have the same immediate success as other rookies in the class. However, coaches have raved about his offseason. He's been deemed a \"grown man\" for the way he controls the huddle. This will be his first full season as a green-dot Mike linebacker, and if he can take a leap forward, this defense will follow.\n\nDB Brian Branch: It only took a year, but Branch is one of the Lions' most valuable defenders. And while he settled in nicely at nickel a year ago, there's a chance he plays safety more regularly in 2024. Just how much remains to be seen, but wherever he spends the majority of his time will have ripple effects on the rest of the secondary.\n\nCB Terrion Arnold: The Lions trading up to pick No. 24 for Arnold felt inevitable the longer the first round played out. He's a perfect fit in terms of everything the Lions look for out of their corners -- a competitive mindset, confidence and the ability to play man coverage. It might take time for him to get there, but he's the best CB prospect they've added since Holmes and Campbell arrived. He'll compete for a starting gig.\n\nCB Ennis Rakestraw Jr.: If Arnold is No. 1 CB prospect, Rakestraw is right there as the No. 2. In fact, Rakestraw was the second-highest-ranked corner on the team's board behind Arnold this past April. They're different personalities -- Arnold is flashier, while Rakestraw is a bit more reserved -- but they're both alphas on the field. Detroit's front office was shocked Rakestraw was still available at No. 61 and even considered trading up for him. That should tell you what they think of him. Rakestraw was spotted playing nickel in the spring, which might be his fastest path to playing time -- even if he's not a regular starter.\n\nOL Giovanni Manu: This is very much a development year for Manu. He's got tools for days -- size, length, mobility, power -- but he'll have to learn how to hone it in the NFL. The Lions traded a 2025 third-round pick to get into the fourth round for Manu, a sign that they believe in his upside. The plan is to cross train Manu at tackle and guard, and let him sit behind one of the league's best offensive lines. With that in mind, expectations should be minimal for Year 1, and most likely, Year 2 as well. He needs time.\n\nRB Sione Vaki: If you followed Vaki's story before the draft, you couldn't help but feel like he was a fit for the Lions. A hardworking athlete who played safety or running back in college and could do the same in the NFL, the Lions will start Vaki off at running back and see how he develops. After watching him in OTAs, it feels like the right move. He's a natural with the ball in his hands and his film as a rusher in college showed a player who doesn't go down on first contact. There's real value in that for a team that runs the ball as much as the Lions do, and he can also be a weapon on special teams. Fun one to watch.\n\nDL Mekhi Wingo: A sixth-round pick out of LSU, Wingo was thought of by a few draft experts as a potential top-100 talent. He comes in a smaller frame (6-foot, 291 pounds), but he adds some pass-rush juice from the interior. The Lions believe he can play on the edge, too. Don't be surprised if he works his way into the playing rotation early on.\n\nOG Christian Mahogany: Another sixth-rounder given a fourth-round grade by many during the pre-draft process, Mahogany looks like a pro. He's got four years of starting experience under his belt from Boston College. He's competitive and has a mean streak in his game. His favorite player growing up was Larry Allen and wears No. 73 because of it. He just feels like a guy who'll wind up starting for 10 seasons.\n\nWR3: We know St. Brown and Williams will start, but who might join them? The early favorites are Donovan Peoples-Jones and Antoine Green, and if the Lions don't add a veteran here before camp is over, it's because they're confident in one of these two stepping in. Kalif Raymond could also see an uptick in usage to account for the loss of Josh Reynolds. Perhaps Jahmyr Gibbs, too.\n\nEdge: The Lions felt they needed more along the edge, so they added a familiar face in Marcus Davenport. Campbell and Glenn know Davenport from their days in New Orleans, but it's been that long since he was a standout. His breakout 2021 campaign helped put him on the map, but he hasn't been able to recreate that magic since -- with injuries plaguing him. If he's healthy, he's most likely your starter opposite Aidan Hutchinson, but don't count out a third-year Josh Paschal.\n\nSecondary: There could be some moving parts in the secondary, so it's worth talking about the backend all together. Carlton Davis III has a starting spot locked up at outside corner, but there's competition elsewhere. If Branch remains at nickel full-time, you'll see a competition between Arnold and free-agent addition Amik Robertson for the spot next to Davis. Perhaps Rakestraw for Emmanuel Moseley, coming off a torn ACL, joins the action as well. But right now, it feels like Arnold vs. Robertson.\n\nIf Branch moves to safety on a more regular basis, the nickel spot suddenly becomes open. In that event, Robertson would be the clear frontrunner for the position, with Rakestraw perhaps factoring in down the road if Robertson struggles. In this scenario, you'd likely see Arnold and Davis on the outside, Robertson at nickel and Branch at one safety spot. Kerby Joseph and Ifeatu Melifonwu are two starting-caliber safeties in the NFL, but one would have to move to the bench. The Lions value Joseph's ballhawk skills as a centerfielder in this defense, so the early nod goes to him.\n\nKicker: Another year, another kicking competition in Detroit. This is the most anticipated one by far, though. Michael Badgley is the incumbent, and a player who's been with the organization since 2022. He'll face Jake Bates -- a fan favorite from his time with the UFL Michigan Panthers with range from 60-plus. Whether the Lions go with Badgley's reliability from within 50 or Bates' range from beyond will tell us how they plan to operate in key decisions this year.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com",

You made it. Football officially returns with the start of training camp this week.\n\nThe Detroit Lions will begin their quest to appear in Super Bowl LIX in practice this week, and in the meantime, we've got a couple key position battles for you to watch this summer.\n\nCornerback\n\nWe'll start with the obvious. Most of the top players on Detroit's cornerback depth chart are newcomers: Carlton Davis III (via trade), Terrion Arnold (draft), Ennis Rakestraw (draft) and Amik Robertson (free agency). Even Emmanuel Moseley, who signed with Detroit in the 2023 offseason, is basically a new body, after not returning until Week 4 and getting injured on his second play.\n\nGiven the third-round pick Detroit used to acquire Davis, plus his time on task in the league, it can be safely assumed he's CB1. But outside of that? All bets are off.\n\nThe intrigue comes in tandem with Detroit's safety situation. The Lions will probably want Ifeatu Melifonwu and Kerby Joseph on the field a ton next year, but depending on how they use Brian Branch -- who they believe can be a guy that plays darn near every position, including high safety -- there might be more snaps available at nickel corner than one might think.\n\nRobertson, Arnold and Rakestraw all have experience in the slot, but each man would likely prefer to play outside.\n\nAt the bottom of the depth chart, expect it to be an intense battle between Khalil Dorsey, Steven Gilmore, Kindle Vildor and Morice Norris.\n\nLinebacker\n\nDerrick Barnes somewhat defied expectations last season by earning his role as the team's No. 2 off-ball linebacker next to Alex Anzalone, but everything we've heard from the coaching staff seems to indicate that Jack Campbell, the 2023 first-rounder, is coming.\n\nIt remains to be seen what that means for Barnes, but the Lions did a good job last season of using every member of their linebacking unit -- perhaps the most underrated on the roster -- in a way that played to their strengths. Heck, Malcolm Rodriguez was catching passes in 2023 while Jalen Reeves-Maybin made second-team AP All-Pro for his role on special teams. Anzalone will be a leader of the defense once again, but behind him, there's a lot that needs to be figured out between now and Week 1 -- and that's by no means a bad thing.\n\nDefensive line\n\nOutside of Aidan Hutchinson, Alim McNeill and DJ Reader, it feels as though every spot on the defensive line is up for grabs -- and that's if the 30-year-old Reader has fully recovered his second torn quad in four seasons.\n\nIf he can stay healthy, veteran free-agent signing Marcus Davenport feels like he'll be in pole position to be Hutchinson's main running partner on the edge. But there's also reason to believe this could be Josh Paschal's breakout year; John Cominsky won't go away quietly and there's a good amount of intrigue on what Mathieu Betts, the CFL Defensive Player of the Year, can bring to the table.\n\nLast season, many thought James Houston would be the team's other starting defensive end, but the Lions seemed committed to rounding him into a true outside linebacker -- and then he suffered an ankle injury in Week 2 that was just about season-ending, save a couple of snaps in the playoffs. His deployment will be among the biggest things to watch in camp.\n\nOn the interior, Reader's injury could open the door for others to announce themselves as next. It should be fun to see who emerges from a young group of recent draft picks that includes Levi Onwuzurike, Brodric Martin and Mekhi Wingo while Chris Smith and Kyle Peko fight for their spots.\n\nWide receiver\n\nAfter losing Josh Reynolds to free agency, many considered receiver to be a (minor) position of need for the Lions entering this offseason. It appears the Lions' brass did not agree; they didn't add anybody of note. The Lions carried five receivers into the regular season last year, and we can safely assume that Amon-Ra St. Brown, Jameson Williams and Kalif Raymond will account for three of those spots in 2024.\n\nDonovan Peoples-Jones also seems a front-runner to be an impact player and fill the Reynolds role. Though he didn't have much involvement after being dealt to Detroit at the deadline last season, he did catch seven of the eight passes thrown his way and produced 839 receiving yards just two seasons ago.\n\nIf we assume that experience wins out and the Lions only carry five receivers once again, that leaves just one roster spot between Antoine Green, Tre'Quan Smith, Maurice Alexander, Tom Kennedy, Daurice Fountain, Tre'Quan Smith and a few other youngsters. Of that group, only Green has the luxury of being a Brad Holmes pick -- which, historically, bodes well for sticking around. But the Lions have carried both Alexander and Kennedy for a handful of years, so maybe one of them gets a crack at the initial 53 if Green fails to impress.\n\nTight end\n\nThe Lions have their top two tight-end spots locked down with Sam LaPorta and Brock Wright. The battle for TE3 will likely come down to James Mitchell, who's entering year three, and Shane Zylstra, who's coming off a season-ending knee injury that he suffered in training camp last year.\n\nTight ends coach Steve Heiden has been complimentary of the way Mitchell ended last season (his first healthy season in the league), and, as previously mentioned, the Lions typically like to see their draft picks through.\n\nLike running back, the Lions carried three tight ends into last season but have carried four before, and perhaps this is where the Lions get their \"fullback\" from, with Jason Cabinda still a free agent. Behind Mitchell and Zylstra, Parker Hesse and Sean McKeon are also vying for a spot of their own.", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Depth chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerby_Joseph", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kerby Joseph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifeatu_Melifonwu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ifeatu Melifonwu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amik_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amik Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Moseley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Moseley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlton_Davis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlton Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_receptor_type_1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannabinoid receptor type 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Houston_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Houston (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Rodriguez", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malcolm Rodriguez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadriceps", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quadriceps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Campbell_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Campbell (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Paschal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Paschal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Barnes_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Barnes (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aidan_Hutchinson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aidan Hutchinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alim_McNeill", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alim McNeill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathieu_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mathieu Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Reeves-Maybin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Reeves-Maybin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Davenport", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Davenport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalif_Raymond", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kalif Raymond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amon-Ra_St._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amon-Ra St. Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daurice_Fountain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daurice Fountain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tre'Quan_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tre'Quan Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Reynolds_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Reynolds (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Peoples-Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Peoples-Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Cabinda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Cabinda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John F.

That hasn't changed early in training camp this summer.\n\nWhile speaking to the media on July 24, Lions No. 1 receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown told reporters to expect big things from Williams this season.\n\n\"I think this year is going to be huge for him,\" Williams said, via SB Nation's Pride of Detroit's Jeremy Reisman. \"Actually I know it is.\"\n\nSt. Brown admitted that he's said that about Williams \"every year.\" But he added that Williams \"looks more comfortable\" and has already scored during training camp practice.\n\nThe Lions would certainly love to see Williams in the end zone more often this fall. He scored twice in the NFC championship game, which helped the Lions build a 24-7 halftime lead.\n\nBut the San Francisco 49ers responded with 27 straight points during the second half and held on to win, 34-31.\n\nMembers of the Lions organization have been telling the media for months that a big breakout is coming for Williams. It really started in earnest with Lions wide receivers coach Antwaan Randle El in November.\n\n\"I think it's just coming,\" Randle El told reporters on November 16, via The Athletic's Colton Pouncy. \"It's a matter of time.\"\n\nOver the offseason, Lions head coach Dan Campbell addressed Williams at the NFL combine and then during the team's offseason workouts program.\n\n\"By the end of the year, we really felt like he started to come into his own,\" Campbell said of Williams on February 27. \"He's going to be push to be a full-time starter now, and that's what we're looking for.\"\n\nBut the Lions still need Williams to emerge as a bigger target to keep the offense as productive as it has been the past two years.\n\nWilliams scored only 4 touchdowns in his first 18 regular season NFL games. But he's been a big-play threat in limited opportunities, averaging 15.8 yards per catch on 25 receptions.\n\nReynolds, who signed with the Denver Broncos, caught 40 passes for 608 yards and 5 touchdowns for the Lions last season.\n\nHyping Williams isn't the only theme within the Lions organization to begin training camp. Detroit has one goal in mind for the 2024 season -- win the Super Bowl.\n\n\"That's our goal. That's our focus,\" St. Brown told reporters on July 24, via ESPN's Eric Woodyard. \"And everything we do from here out, moving forward is to get that Super Bowl.\n\n\"Our main goal is the Super Bowl.

He told the media during minicamp that he wants \"the whole enchilada.\"\n\nThe Lions haven't won an NFL championship since 1957 and have never been to the Super Bowl. But the franchise accomplished a lot of things for the first time in decades last season, so winning a Super Bowl doesn't seem like a lofty goal for the Lions anymore.\n\nLast season, Detroit won its first division title, its first playoff game and advanced to the NFC championship for the first time since the early 1990s.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dave_holcomb@heavy.com", "name": "Dave Holcomb", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jameson_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jameson Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amon-Ra_St._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amon-Ra St. Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Campbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwaan_Randle_El", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antwaan Randle El"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SB_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SB Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "End zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Scouting_Combine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL Scouting Combine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1793664139.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753907", "eventUri": "eng-9753907", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 228, "textEnd": 235, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-16", "textStart": 1218, "textEnd": 1229}, {"amb": false, "date": "-02-27", "textStart": 1543, "textEnd": 1554}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Three years later, they were 30 minutes of football away from the Super Bowl and have exceeded expectations -- even if they're reluctant to take the credit.\n\n\"I remember when we first got here, everybody was wondering kind of how long this was going to take, how long is this build going to be,\" Holmes reflected after the 2023 season. \"And I remember I used the word 'retool' and I got killed because I probably should've used the word rebuild. [...] I never wanted to put a timestamp on it -- or an anchor -- a time anchor on it because I said, 'Look, we're just going to do our job, roll our sleeves up, and work to improve every single day.' And that's what we did. So, it's hard for me to say, 'Yeah, we are ahead of schedule.' Because I don't know what that original timestamp should've been in the first place. But I do know we love where we are at and I believe we are at where exactly where we're supposed to be.\"\n\nA big key to their success in 2023 was the return of a top-five offense, paired with an elite run defense, which kept them in position to win games in ways that had previously eluded their reach. But as impressive as their defensive growth was, they still had glaring weaknesses in their secondary, and teams routinely took advantage.\n\nWith overhauling the secondary at the forefront of Detroit's agenda this offseason, Holmes attacked the problem in a variety of ways during the 2024 offseason.\n\nThe first step in upgrading the Lions' secondary began by moving on from both starting outside corners, releasing Cam Sutton after a domestic battery by strangulation arrest and allowing Jerry Jacobs to depart after his contract expired. They also allowed C.J. Gardner-Johnson and Tracy Walker -- both briefly held starting jobs in 2023 -- to exit Detroit this offseason.\n\nTo replace their corners, Holmes traded for veteran Carlton Davis and signed veteran Amik Robertson in free agency. In the NFL Draft. The Lions used their first and second-round picks on cornerbacks, trading up and selecting Terrion Arnold with pick No. 24, then snagging Ennis Rakestraw with pick No. 61 overall. They also re-signed Emmanuel Moseley to a one-year deal, hoping he could return to the starter competition after tearing his ACL for the second consecutive season. The Lions are counting on their new additions to create a five-way competition for starting jobs that will result in a higher level of play on the outside.\n\nBrian Branch returns as the Lions' primary option in the slot, while Kerby Joseph and Ifeatu Melifonwu maintain their starting safety roles. The Lions did little to replace Gardner-Johnson and Walker, only re-signing special teams ace C.J. Moore (after he served his year-long suspension for gambling), but are planning on expanding Branch's role to include more reps at safety.\n\n\"We have so many options right now, so much competitiveness,\" Campbell said during minicamp. \"[Lions defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn] AG and I were talking about it again, and Brad and I talk about it every evening: the talent level, the competitiveness, the versatility. Honestly, we have no idea who our starting lineups are going to be right now and it's exciting.\"\n\nAs exciting as it may be for Campbell to have new players to work with, in order for the Lions to have success, they'll need several things to happen through training camp and the preseason. Newly-acquired veterans will need to adjust to the Lions' scheme, rookies will need to adapt to the talent level of the NFL, injured players will need to prove they're healthy, and returning players need to expand their roles while maintaining or exceeding their level of play. Additionally, with the number of new players competing for starting jobs, and because communication is paramount in the Lions' split-zone scheme, establishing a report quickly will be vital to early season success.\n\nIn the first two weeks of the season, the Lions face the Los Angeles Rams and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, two teams they faced in the playoffs last season that will be difficult early tests. If the Lions' secondary is not on point from the jump, both offenses have shown that they have the potential to score points in Ford Field. If the Lions hope to match or exceed their 12-5 record from last season, the opening two games will be critical to that process.\n\nOn paper, the Lions' offseason aggression looks to be an upgrade to the secondary but how fast this unit gels will go a long way in determining if the Lions can take the next step in 2024, or if the defense as a whole will regress.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dan Campbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Holmes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amik_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amik Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Moseley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Moseley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlton_Davis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlton Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerby_Joseph", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kerby Joseph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifeatu_Melifonwu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ifeatu Melifonwu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Glenn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Glenn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ford Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eDGKX4-N0JF0JfBcuQ3mW4NVGB4=/0x0:2400x1200/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25542341/usa_today_23119529.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753907", "eventUri": "eng-9753907", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Detroit Lions coach Dan Campbell stepped on a riser and stood behind a new, large lectern at the team's training facility.\n\n\"This is a huge podium,\" Campbell said Monday before the team's first training camp practice.\n\nExpectations are big for the Lions, too.\n\nDetroit is coming off its best season in generations, earning two playoff victories in one postseason for the first time since winning the 1957 NFL title.\n\nThe Lions are one of four franchises that haven't reached the Super Bowl, but they're No. 4 among favorites to reach the championship game, according to BetMGM Sportsbook.\n\nIt's easy to see what oddsmakers like about Detroit.\n\nThe Lions have won 20 of their last 27 games in the regular season and are coming off a closely contested loss in the NFC championship game at San Francisco after leading the 49ers by 17 points in the third quarter.\n\nGeneral manager Brad Holmes made many moves to improve the team's chances of taking another step, strengthening weaknesses on both sides of the ball in free agency, a trade and the draft. Holmes also cut down potential distractions by giving quarterback Jared Goff, receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and offensive tackle Penei Sewell new contracts.\n\n\"We know we can win a Super Bowl,\" St. Brown said. \"We have the team. We have the coaches. We have everything we need in this building to win a Super Bowl. That's our goal. That's our focus.\n\n\"Everything we do from here out moving forward is to get that Super Bowl.\"\n\nIf a Lions player said that a couple years ago, the response would've likely been laughter.\n\nCampbell's first team lost 13 games in 2021 -- a fourth straight season with double-digit losses -- and had setbacks in six of the first seven games the following year.\n\nSoon after Lions owner Sheila Ford Hamp refused to panic during the rough start in 2022, insisting she was confident in Holmes and Campbell, a franchise that has struggled to get it right for decades found a groove.\n\nDetroit closed that season with eight wins in 10 games, narrowly missing the playoffs, and picked up where it left off last year by matching a team record with 12 wins.\n\nThe Lions won a division title for the first time since 1993, beat the Matthew Stafford-led Los Angeles Rams for their first playoff victory in three-plus decades and eliminated Tampa Bay before falling one game short of the Super Bowl.\n\n\"We're fortunate to have the success, but we know what came before that,\" said offensive tackle Taylor Decker, who endured a lot of losing after being drafted by Detroit in 2016. \" It was the work that came before that when no one cared what the Lions were doing.\"\n\nWhen the Lions kicked off training camp last year, Campbell asked the players to stand up, turn around and look toward the back of the full-team meeting room. They saw the team hadn't won a playoff game since 1992, a division title since 1993 and a league championship since 1957.\n\nAfter finally winning the division and a playoff game, offensive guard Graham Glasgow said the display was updated by someone who wrote 2023 on pieces of white, athletic tape.\n\n\"Those are still up there and there's still tape through it with old-school tape,\" Campbell said. \"It just looks better that way.\n\n\"But we've checked the box on two and we've got one more to check.\"\n\nFollow Larry Lage at https://twitter/larrylage\n\nAP NFL:

The franchise has taken the necessary approach to accomplish that task by locking down its foundational players in QB Jared Goff, WR Amon-Ra St. Brown and OT Penei Sewell with massive offseason extensions, while revamping its secondary with new faces such as rookie DBs Terrion Arnold and Ennis Rakestraw Jr.\n\nThe Lions were able to snap some notable droughts in 2023 with their first division title since 1993 as well as their first playoff victory and conference championship appearance since 1991 and will enter this season with high expectations.\n\n\"If I had to put it in one word, I would just say contender. I know it's gonna be very hard, if not harder, than it was last year because people might do a little extra homework when they're playing us, but just knowing the character of our locker room, that's just what we, as a team, want to be about,\" Lions veteran offensive tackle Taylor Decker told ESPN. \"And if you're not trying to compete for championships, much like me taking pride in what I do, it's like, 'What are we doing here?' This is all about winning.\"\n\nHere is a 53-man roster projection as the Lions open training camp.\n\nQUARTERBACKS (2): Jared Goff, Hendon Hooker\n\nGoff has established himself as the clear-cut guy, agreeing to a four-year, $212 million contract extension during the offseason. The 2016 No. 1 pick completed 407 passes last season, which were the second most in the NFL and the most by a Lions QB since Matthew Stafford in 2012. Detroit will also continue to develop Hooker as a backup.\n\nRUNNING BACKS (4): David Montgomery, Jahmyr Gibbs, Craig Reynolds, Sione Vaki\n\nGibbs and Montgomery formed one of the most potent tandems in the league. Montgomery rushed for 1,015 yards in 2023, while Gibbs finished 55 yards shy of 1,000 but had 37 fewer carries than his counterpart. The last team with a pair of running backs with 1,000 rushing yards in a single season was the 2009 Panthers with Jonathan Stewart and DeAngelo Williams. The Lions have a legitimate chance to be the next, barring injuries.\n\nWIDE RECEIVERS (5): Amon-Ra St. Brown, Donovan Peoples-Jones, Jameson Williams, Antoine Green, Kalif Raymond\n\nSt. Brown had nine games with 100-plus receiving yards last season, most in the NFL and most by a Lions receiver since Hall of Famer Calvin Johnson's franchise-record 12 in 2012. He is motivated to reach new heights after agreeing to a four-year, $120 million extension in the offseason. The Lions are looking for third-year receiver Williams to take a leap and help the offense reach a new level after showing flashes of his playmaking ability last season.\n\nTIGHT ENDS (3): Sam LaPorta, Brock Wright, Shane Zylstra\n\nLaPorta experienced one of the greatest rookie seasons by a tight end in league history. He was one of seven Lions players to earn Pro Bowl honors while being named a finalist for the 2023 Offensive Rookie of the Year. LaPorta had at least five receptions in 10 games, most among rookie tight ends in NFL history. He finished with 86 receptions for 889 yards and 10 touchdowns, all franchise records for a tight end.\n\nOFFENSIVE LINEMEN (9): Taylor Decker, Graham Glasgow, Frank Ragnow, Kevin Zeitler, Penei Sewell, Colby Sorsdal, Dan Skipper, Giovanni Manu, Christian Mahogany\n\nSewell has established himself as one of the brightest stars in the league after a first-team All-Pro season. The seventh overall pick in 2021 signed an extension that'll lock him down in Detroit through the 2029 season. Detroit also added Pro Bowl guard Zeitler after losing Jonah Jackson to the Los Angeles Rams via free agency.\n\nDEFENSIVE LINEMEN (10): Aidan Hutchinson, Alim McNeill, DJ Reader, Marcus Davenport, Levi Onwuzurike, John Cominsky, Brodric Martin, Mekhi Wingo, Josh Paschal, Mathieu Betts\n\nThe defensive line needs a boost. The Lions ranked 27th in the NFL and last among playoff teams in pass rush win rate at 35.8%. Their run stop win rate by interior lineman was 27.4%, which was the second worst in the league, ahead of only the Chiefs. Detroit added former Bengals defensive tackle Reader to help.\n\nLINEBACKERS (6): Jack Campbell, Alex Anzalone, Derrick Barnes, Jalen Reeves-Maybin, James Houston, Ben Niemann\n\nSelected 18th overall in the 2023 NFL draft, Campbell will look to take a leap in Year 2. He didn't have the greatest statistical season as a rookie but did make an impact, with 95 total tackles and a pair of sacks. The competition will be strong within this unit during training camp.\n\nCORNERBACKS (7): Carlton Davis III, Emmanuel Moseley, Steven Gilmore, Terrion Arnold, Amik Robertson, Ennis Rakestraw Jr., Khalil Dorsey\n\nThe Lions took an aggressive approach in upgrading the secondary, which was one of the squad's weakest units in 2023. They struggled when the ball was in the air, allowing 34 receptions thrown 20-plus yards downfield, which tied for the second-most in the NFL. Detroit is hoping that top pick Arnold can help plug those holes. The 24th overall selection had five interceptions and 12 pass breakups with Alabama in 2023, which both tied for the most in the SEC.\n\nSAFETIES (4): Brian Branch, Kerby Joseph, Ifeatu Melifonwu, C.J. Moore\n\nThe Lions are expecting to get Branch back for training camp after the second-year defensive back missed minicamp and most of the organized team activities after undergoing surgery on his lower left leg. Branch was spotted in a walking boot while using a scooter over the summer after a strong first season in which he ranked second among all rookies with three interceptions.\n\nSPECIALISTS (3): Jake Bates, Jack Fox, Scott Daly\n\nBates made the 2024 All-UFL Team with the Michigan Panthers. He holds the record for the second-longest field goal in pro football history with a 64-yard game-winning kick in the season opener against the St. Louis Battlehawks, which was just two yards less than Justin Tucker's NFL record set against the Lions in 2021.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_woodyard@espn.com", "name": "Eric

(AP) -- Detroit Lions coach Dan Campbell stepped on a riser and stood behind a new, large lectern at the team's training facility.\n\n\"This is a huge podium,\" Campbell said Monday before the team's first training camp practice.\n\nExpectations are big for the Lions, too.\n\nDetroit is coming off its best season in generations, earning two playoff victories in one postseason for the first time since winning the 1957 NFL title.\n\nThe Lions are one of four franchises that haven't reached the Super Bowl, but they're No. 4 among favorites to reach the championship game, according to BetMGM Sportsbook.\n\nIt's easy to see what oddsmakers like about Detroit.\n\n\"We know we can win a Super Bowl,\" St. Brown said. \"We have the team. We have the coaches. We have everything we need in this building to win a Super Bowl. That's our goal. That's our focus.\n\n\"Everything we do from here out moving forward is to get that Super Bowl.\"\n\nIf a Lions player said that a couple years ago, the response would've likely been laughter.\n\nCampbell's first team lost 13 games in 2021 -- a fourth straight season with double-digit losses -- and had setbacks in six of the first seven games the following year.\n\nSoon after Lions owner Sheila Ford Hamp refused to panic during the rough start in 2022, insisting she was confident in Holmes and Campbell, a franchise that has struggled to get it right for decades found a groove.\n\nDetroit closed that season with eight wins in 10 games, narrowly missing the playoffs, and picked up where it left off last year by matching a team record with 12 wins.\n\nThe Lions won a division title for the first time since 1993, beat the Matthew Stafford-led Los Angeles Rams for their first playoff victory in three-plus decades and eliminated Tampa Bay before falling one game short of the Super Bowl.\n\n\"We're fortunate to have the success, but we know what came before that,\" said offensive tackle Taylor Decker, who endured a lot of losing after being drafted by Detroit in 2016. \" It was the work that came before that when no one cared what the Lions were doing.\"\n\nWhen the Lions kicked off training camp last year, Campbell asked the players to stand up, turn around and look toward the back of the full-team meeting room. They saw the team hadn't won a playoff game since 1992, a division title since 1993 and a league championship since 1957.\n\nAfter finally winning the division and a playoff game, offensive guard Graham Glasgow said the display was updated by someone who wrote 2023 on pieces of white, athletic tape.\n\n\"Those are still up there and there's still tape through it with old-school tape,\" Campbell said. \"It just looks better that way.\n\n\"But we've checked the box on two and we've got one more to check.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Campbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM_Resorts_International", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MGM Resorts International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Bears_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brown Bears football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheila_Ford_Hamp", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheila Ford Hamp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Glasgow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graham Glasgow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Decker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Decker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/srVXxBERzPPh_hOG6lZEcQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cp_sports_913/e49c2cd91b0662c0c6c957ff7a67b559", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753907", "eventUri": "eng-9753907", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

They had also never won the NFC North division, logging their last division title in the defunct NFC Central. If you asked just about any Lions fan before the 2023 season if they'd be pleased with one playoff victory and an NFC North title, they would say yes in a heartbeat.\n\nInstead, the Lions won two playoff games and came one horrible half of football away from appearing in their first Super Bowl.\n\nNow Detroit is expected to repeat as a Super Bowl contender in the NFC in 2024. If they want that to happen, they'll need a few things to break their way this season.\n\nOne of those is improved play from their defense. Detroit's pass defense was one of the worst in the NFL, and it was one of the big factors that cost them a trip to the Super Bowl. The Lions allowed the most passing plays of 20+ yards in the NFL last season and were in the bottom half of the league in most statistical categories related to defending the pass. Thankfully, GM Brad Holmes has invested heavily in remaking the team's cornerback room. Detroit added Carlton Davis III, Amik Robertson, Terrion Arnold, and Ennis Rakestraw Jr. via free agency and the 2024 NFL Draft. There is no doubt this unit will be improved in 2024.\n\nThe Lions need Jameson Williams to take a huge leap forward in 2024. Will he deliver?\n\nThe Lions also need to replace Josh Reynolds' production on offense. Reynolds had great chemistry from his time with Goff in Los Angeles and was an important part of the passing game. In 2023, Reynolds logged 40 receptions for 608 yards and five touchdowns. He was third on the team in receiving yards behind only Amon-Ra St. Brown and Sam LaPorta.\n\nIf Detroit wants to stay on top of the NFC, they'll need to replace Reynolds in the aggregate.\n\nDan Campbell and the Lions are counting on Jameson Williams to take a huge leap forward in year three.\n\nWilliams has had a shaky start to his NFL career. He started his career on IR due to a torn ACL in his final collegiate game. Williams got his first full offseason program before the 2023 season, but missed the first four games with a gambling suspension. These roadblocks kept Williams off the field and slowed his development as a pro.\n\nNone of these concern are holding Williams back anymore, which sets him up to have his first full year in the NFL in 2024.\n\nEarlier this offseason, Campbell was clear that he thinks Williams is ready for the challenge. In May, Campbell was asked to name the most improved Lions player during spring workouts. He named Jameson Williams right away.\n\n\"He's a man on a mission, and I'm just gonna leave it at that,\" Campbell said, per Colton Pouncey of The Athletic.\n\nWhen asked where exactly Williams has improved, Campbell replied: \"Everywhere.\"\n\nThis is a huge endorsement from Dan Campbell. It suggests that Williams is well on his way to becoming the player Detroit dreamed of getting in the draft a few years ago.\n\nWhat are realistic expectations for Jameson Williams in 2024?\n\nWe should start by saying that Williams doesn't need to be a hero. He just needs to get better and become a full-time starter with a clear role in the offense.\n\nWilliams does not need to make up for all of Reynolds' vacated production on his own. Second-year RB Jahmyr Gibbs was hailed as a \"position-less weapon\" by GM Brad Holmes after the 2023 NFL Draft and could become more involved in the passing attack. Sam LaPorta and Amon-Ra St. Brown could absorb some volume as well. There are also other role players like Kalif Raymond and Donovan Peoples-Jones who figure to do their fair share. Let's also not forget about David Montgomery and rookie running back/safety Sione Vaki.\n\nHowever, none of those players has the potential to open up Detroit's offense like Williams.\n\nIf Jameson Williams can become the dangerous deep threat that he was billed as coming out of college, he would add an entirely new element to the Lions' offense.\n\nA realistic expectation for Jamo in year three probably looks something like 50 catches for 800 yards and a handful of touchdowns. This would be a significant upgrade over Josh Reynolds as the team's WR2 last season.\n\nWhat's more, it would confirm that Jameson Williams has arrived as a legit playmaker for the Detroit Lions.",

(AP) - Detroit Lions coach Dan Campbell stepped on a riser and stood behind a new, large lectern at the team's training facility.\n\n\"This is a huge podium,\" Campbell said Monday before the team's first training camp practice.\n\nExpectations are big for the Lions, too.\n\nDetroit is coming off its best season in generations, earning two playoff victories in one postseason for the first time since winning the 1957 NFL title.\n\nThe Lions are one of four franchises that haven't reached the Super Bowl, but they're No. 4 among favorites to reach the championship game, according to BetMGM Sportsbook.\n\nIt's easy to see what oddsmakers like about Detroit.\n\nDetroit Lions head coach Dan Campbell watches during an NFL football practice in Allen Park, Mich., Wednesday, July 24, 2024. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya)\n\nThe Lions have won 20 of their last 27 games in the regular season and are coming off a closely contested loss in the NFC championship game at San Francisco after leading the 49ers by 17 points in the third quarter.\n\nGeneral manager Brad Holmes made many moves to improve the team's chances of taking another step, strengthening weaknesses on both sides of the ball in free agency, a trade and the draft. Holmes also cut down potential distractions by giving quarterback Jared Goff, receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and offensive tackle Penei Sewell new contracts.\n\n\"We know we can win a Super Bowl,\" St. Brown said. \"We have the team. We have the coaches. We have everything we need in this building to win a Super Bowl. That\u00b4s our goal. That\u00b4s our focus.\n\n\"Everything we do from here out moving forward is to get that Super Bowl.\"\n\nIf a Lions player said that a couple years ago, the response would've likely been laughter.\n\nCampbell's first team lost 13 games in 2021 - a fourth straight season with double-digit losses - and had setbacks in six of the first seven games the following year.\n\nSoon after Lions owner Sheila Ford Hamp refused to panic during the rough start in 2022, insisting she was confident in Holmes and Campbell, a franchise that has struggled to get it right for decades found a groove.\n\nDetroit closed that season with eight wins in 10 games, narrowly missing the playoffs, and picked up where it left off last year by matching a team record with 12 wins.\n\nThe Lions won a division title for the first time since 1993, beat the Matthew Stafford-led Los Angeles Rams for their first playoff victory in three-plus decades and eliminated Tampa Bay before falling one game short of the Super Bowl.\n\n\"We\u00b4re fortunate to have the success, but we know what came before that,\" said offensive tackle Taylor Decker, who endured a lot of losing after being drafted by Detroit in 2016. \" It was the work that came before that when no one cared what the Lions were doing.\"\n\nWhen the Lions kicked off training camp last year, Campbell asked the players to stand up, turn around and look toward the back of the full-team meeting room. They saw the team hadn't won a playoff game since 1992, a division title since 1993 and a league championship since 1957.\n\nAfter finally winning the division and a playoff game, offensive guard Graham Glasgow said the display was updated by someone who wrote 2023 on pieces of white, athletic tape.\n\n\"Those are still up there and there\u00b4s still tape through it with old-school tape,\" Campbell said. \"It just looks better that way.\n\n\"But we\u00b4ve checked the box on two and we\u00b4ve got one more to check.\"\n\nFollow Larry Lage at https://twitter/larrylage\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\n\nDetroit Lions quarterback Jared Goff (16) hands off to running back Jahmyr Gibbs (26) during an NFL football practice in Allen Park, Mich., Wednesday, July 24, 2024.

Years of futility and disappointment made finding an optimistic, bullish take on the Lions ahead of training camp a rarity.\n\nNot anymore, certainly not after Detroit's 2023 campaign -- the best season for the Lions in the Super Bowl era. This summer, it's notable when an analyst pours some cold water on the fiery dreams and visions of Detroit grandeur for 2024. Yet we did manage to find one...\n\nNate Davis of USA TODAY is one of the few national analysts who has broken ranks with the Lions as the predicted winners of the NFC North.

A pathway to the first Super Bowl berth in franchise history likely requires a strong start as the Lions play just two home games over an eight-week period spanning October and November. But it could happen if a young core continues to blossom - WR Jameson Williams needs to step up - and reaps results from an upgraded pass defense.\n\nIn propping up the Packers, Davis notes their youth and also a change in defensive coordinator that Green Bay hopes overcome recent underachievement from that unit.\n\nExpanding out the projections, Davis has the Lions knocking off the NFC South champs, the Atlanta Falcons, in the wild card round game before succumbing to the Packers in Green Bay in the NFC Divisional Round.\n\nA quick check of last year's predictions shows Davis is not a Lions hater; he correctly pegged them as the NFC North champs, going 11-6.

And win they did.\n\nThose Giants, coached by Jim Fassel, went 12-4 in 2000 -- winning the NFC East and the conference title, but ultimately falling short to the Baltimore Ravens in the Super Bowl. Naturally, there was hope for a return to the big stage the following season. The core remained in place. They believed they could run it back, and this time, win. But Campbell noticed a shift in energy ahead of it.\n\nA day in shorts instead of full pads was applauded by players. A practice ending early, celebrated. Campbell saw the little things adding up. He saw his team slowly lose its identity, ahead of a 7-9 season in 2001.\n\nThese days? He sees it as one of the best things that ever happened to him.\n\n\"I was a part of a team that, man, we did something really special,\" Campbell said. \"We came up a little short and the next year, we had the exact same team. The exact same team. ...And pretty soon, by the end of it, you just lost your identity and everything that made you what you are. You went away from it because, 'You know what? We'll be OK. We've got the same guys.' And that was a lesson learned for me. Because we were average. We went 7-9 the next year after going 12-4, and I will never forget that. Ever.\n\n\"So, we're not going to lose our identity. That is the most important thing to me, and I won't sacrifice it for anyone or anything.\"\n\nThat was Campbell's message to the Lions team he now coaches, having experienced the falloff firsthand as a player. It was in his head in Santa Clara, shortly after the Lions' 34-31 loss to the 49ers in the NFC Championship -- openly pondering if this was the last time he and his team would be here. Not because he doesn't think the Lions have what it takes to win. But because many have tried and failed to win it all after getting a taste. Some of those teams succumb to their own hype.\n\nAhead of his fourth training camp as a head coach, Campbell is trying to ensure these Lions don't. His players are with him.\n\n\"At this point, nobody cares what we did last year. It doesn't matter,\" Lions left tackle Taylor Decker said. \"It's gonna have no bearing on the season moving forward. If anything, it's going to make it harder for us. So, we can't take that for granted. It's hard to have a great season and then refocus and get back doing things the right way. But again, I think that goes back to Dan and Brad bringing in the right people who are culture fits, who won't let that happen. You have the right core group of guys, you're not going to let that happen. And I think we've got that.\"\n\nThe last thing Campbell wants is a complacent team. But by the looks of it, he doesn't have that.\n\nHe has a hungry one.\n\nThat's what we learned from the first day of training camp. Here's more.\n\nWords matter, and the Lions were very careful about the ones they used last year when describing their goals for the season. Back then, you didn't hear much external talk of a Super Bowl. And why would you? That 2022 team didn't even make the playoffs. The franchise hadn't won a division title in 30 years or a playoff game in 32.\n\nThere's a process to this, one they fully understood then. They had to crawl before they walked. But these days, they're up and running, and running things.\n\n\"You know, last year around this time, the year before, we were 9-8, barely missed the playoffs,\" Amon-Ra St. Brown said. \"So for us, I feel like going into last year it was like, 'Let's that's win the division, let's get into the playoffs and once we get there we can go get that Super Bowl. But our biggest goal (this year), our main goal, is the Super Bowl. I feel like everyone in the room is thinking the same way.\"\n\nThere is a difference. There's also a balancing act when speaking on those differences. This team proved it can compete last year. That's a box checked that's only going to give them something to fall back on in times of doubt. That's why experience is valuable, and the Lions gained that last season. Of course, you don't want to assume you'll be right back without putting in the work. However, the reason this team believes it can get back is because of just that -- how they prepare and how they're wired, along with some savvy moves made this offseason to get them that much closer.\n\nThat the Lions can now openly discuss their super-sized aspirations is the best sign of growth imaginable. Campbell mentioned the experience he, his staff and his team gained in January, and how it'll make everyone better. Decker said this team found its identity and now it's about consistency -- the mark of a good organization, in his mind. It's only been one day, but even this spring, the Lions carried themselves like a group that's been together and knows how to prepare.\n\nThe goal for any head coach is to assemble a self-policing locker room -- one that's so established and so strong culturally that new players can't help but fall in line and adapt to their surroundings. When you look around this Lions team -- from St. Brown to Penei Sewell to Jared Goff, Alex Anzalone, Aidan Hutchinson and more -- you can't help but see that. A business-like approach from this bunch. Even on a lighter Day 1, that was evident.\n\n\"We don't live off reputation, we live off of work,\" Campbell said. \"And that's what's gotten us where we're at. It's been a long, hard road to get to where we're at right now, and there's a price to be paid, and so we've got to go pay it again.\"\n\nOne of the Lions' biggest weaknesses last year was failing to generate much pressure outside of Hutchinson. Per Brett Kollman, Hutchinson generated 37.4 percent of the Lions' pressures last season. Typical elite edge rushers hover between the 27-30 percent range.\n\nIn other words, Hutchinson needs help. James Houston could be one to provide it.\n\nIn his first taste of action as a rookie in 2022, Houston recorded eight sacks in just seven games with a pass-rush win rate of 19.3 percent, per PFF -- good for 9th among all edge rushers. His 2023 season was cut short, but his win rate in two games (small sample size alert) was 23.1 percent. That's elite. If the Lions can get 200 pass-rush snaps out of Houston and he flirts with a win rate of 18-20 percent, he'll be able to help this group.\n\nSo I caught up with Houston one-on-one to see how he's feeling after an offseason to heal.\n\n\"I feel much better, man,\" Houston told me. \"I feel better than I did last year. I'm ready to go in the preseason with a little chip on my shoulder.\"\n\nThis offseason, Houston went to a few pass-rush summits -- one led by pass-rush specialist Brandon T. Jordan and another led by Von Miller. He said he was able to pick the brains of vets and learn how they approach the game. He called it \"instrumental\" for him to have that experience and hopes to put the tips he learned into practice this year.\n\nHouston said it was difficult watching the Lions' run without him -- perhaps even bittersweet. The team was successful in his absence, but it dearly missed his ability to get after the quarterback. And even when he returned for the NFC Championship game, he wasn't particularly close to 100 percent. That's why he's excited for what's ahead.\n\nThe current plan, Houston says, is to continue learning the Sam linebacker spot in Glenn's defense, while subbing in as a situational pass rusher. Don't expect him to be an every-down player, but he has the speed to make splash plays in this defense, and the finishing ability this roster sorely lacked last year.\n\nHe knows his job.\n\n\"They're looking for guys that are gonna be able to change the game -- get turnovers, ball production, so that's gonna have to be what I'll have to do,\" Houston said. \"Get to that quarterback, get the ball out.\"\n\n* The Lions will practice in shorts for the first four days of training camp. They'll be off on Sunday, before the first day of full pads on Monday.\n\n* Lions DT DJ Reader is healed from his torn quad, per Campbell. The next step is getting him up to speed and involved in competition, but the Lions won't rush him back to action. He's on track, though.\n\n* DB Brian Branch and Edge Marcus Davenport were both activated from the PUP list Wednesday, and participated in walkthroughs. Campbell said they're \"going slowly,\" as they're worked back into this mix. He thinks Davenport is closer than Branch to full strength, but they both participated a little bit in the meantime and are well on their way.\n\n* Speaking of Branch, I think we're starting to get some questions answered about his positional home this year. The Lions kicked things off with that walkthrough period, and Branch was next to Kerby Joseph at safety. So, this is looking like a thing. What might that mean for the rest of the secondary? Glad you asked.\n\n* Ifeatu Melifonwu would move to a reserve role -- and boy, is that some great depth. I'd still expect him to play semi-regular snaps depending on the look the offense presents. That's the value of Branch's flexibility, and his ability to move back to nickel on any play.\n\n* Today we saw Emmanuel Moseley at nickel, with Ennis Rakestraw Jr. and Terrion Arnold at outside corner. Part of that has to do with the absence of Carlton Davis III and Amik Robertson, who were placed on the active/NFI list and did not practice Wednesday, so the Lions were down some depth. If Branch to safety is a permanent thing, I think you'll see Davis and Arnold on the outside at corner, Robertson at nickel and Branch and Joseph at safety. Might be a way to get their best five on the field.\n\n* A couple more looks: When the Lions weren't playing with a nickel, they rotated a couple of Sam linebackers into the mix -- mainly Derrick Barnes and Houston. Levi Onwuzurike was playing some edge, a position he said the coaches wanted to see with him play this spring. With Reader out, Brodric Martin got a lot of interior reps at nose tackle. Too early to say if he's ready, but if he can be a rotational piece this year, that would be a boost.\n\n* Hutchinson had himself a day. During a three-play sequence, I credited him with a sack (or at the very least, a QB hit), a tackle for a short gain on a run play and another sack. This was against the first-team offense. He was going up against Penei Sewell, folks. Think he's in for a big year.\n\n* Jameson Williams cooked the defense during the first team period. Cooked. Initially lined up against Rakestraw (playing zone), Williams zoomed past Rakestraw, who passed him off to the safety Ifeatu Melifonwu on what looked like a deep post. Didn't stand a chance. Goff launched it, Williams tracked and caught it, then held out both arms in celebration and threw the ball at the fence in front of him. Here's the play:\n\n* Shortly thereafter, however, Williams puked. Something he ate, apparently. Very strange sequence. Still, a nice day for him. Here's St. Brown on Williams: \"He just looks more comfortable. He looks like he's done this before.\"\n\n* Josh Paschal quietly flashed a few times. I had him with a TFL and a sack during team periods. The Lions brought in competition for him with Davenport, so it's good to see him respond early.\n\n* I'll say this: both backup QBs looked good on Day 1. Hendon Hooker threw with zip and accuracy during his reps. He hit Daurice Fountain near the sideline for one of his more impressive throws. Ripped a crosser to Tom Kennedy over the middle for another nice gain. I liked what I saw. Nate Sudfeld also looked good. He threw a nice deep ball to Jalon Calhoun was solid for much of the day. I really wouldn't be surprised if he makes the roster.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colton_pouncy@nytimes.com", "name":

Thanks to a young nucleus and plenty of veteran contributors, the Lions have a core in place that is capable of being among the league's elite.\n\nHowever, there are still uncertainties surrounding the roster. While several starters are viewed among the best at their respective positions, the depth on the roster remains a question in multiple areas.\n\nFor starters, there are unproven options set to potentially play key roles at wide receiver and defensive end. After Josh Reynolds left the Lions for the Broncos, Detroit's offense lost a very solid secondary pass-catching option.\n\nThere's plenty of expectations surrounding the potential development of Jameson Williams, and all signs point to him being the WR2. However, there is an ongoing battle for the third wide receiver position headlined by Kalif Raymond, Donovan Peoples-Jones and Antoine Green.\n\nPeoples-Jones and Green both had small roles last year, albeit for different reasons. Green was a rookie at the bottom of the depth chart, while Peoples-Jones took time to acclimate to the scheme after being acquired at the trade deadline.\n\nAt the receiver position, Amon-Ra St. Brown is the bona fide top option. However, the Lions are placing a lot in the hands of Williams developing into the second option. If he has hiccups throughout the year, the Lions' receiver depth will be tested.\n\nThe defensive end position is another that has questions. Like the receiver spot, the Lions have a top edge rusher in Aidan Hutchinson. Behind him, though, there are uncertainties.\n\nMarcus Davenport, the team's top free agent addition at the spot, will begin training camp on the Physically Unable to Perform list. While he can be activated at any time, there will be open opportunities in the meantime.\n\nJames Houston is a candidate to make an impact. Though he missed most of last season with an injury, the potential he showed in 2022 as a rookie was tantalizing.\n\nJosh Paschal could be another option, though he has made bigger impacts as a run defender throughout his first two NFL seasons. John Cominsky has a case, as does CFL standout Mathieu Betts.\n\nAnother avenue the Lions could explore is utilizing their interior defenders on the edge. Campbell hinted that the team had done so in the spring, as Levi Onwuzurike and rookie Mekhi Wingo both were options playing on the edge.\n\nIf Detroit does not feel as though their end options are satisfactory, using these bigger defenders on the edge could give the defense a unique look.\n\nOther positions with depth concerns include safety and tight end. Ifeatu Melifonwu and Kerby Joseph figure to be the team's starters, with Brian Branch also potentially entering the mix if the Lions elect to slide him from the nickel position.\n\nHowever, the top two options behind that trio are C.J. Moore and Brandon Joseph. Moore missed all of last year while serving a suspension, while Joseph is a 2023 UDFA who played two games as a practice squad elevation last year.\n\nThe tight end position is set to have a battle for the third spot behind Sam LaPorta and Brock Wright. James Mitchell holds weight as a 2022 fifth-round pick, but injuries have limited his impact.\n\nThe Lions brought back Shane Zylstra to compete for the job, as well as adding a pair of veterans in Parker Hesse and Sean McKeon. The dichotomy of the tight end room will create an interesting competition.\n\nUltimately, the Lions do have holes on their roster from a depth perspective. However, the holes are largely a result of inexperience or unproven players. Detroit has plenty of talent to bank on in 2024, but the roster as a whole is deep enough to make serious noise.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"},

Webb Rice served as the first local president.\n\nThe installation of the Norfolk Lions Club was held later in the year on Sept. 30, 1921. The club consisted of 25 members throughout the community.\n\nThe last living charter member of the Lions was Dr. Carl Johannes Verges. The 46-year member died Oct. 25, 1967, nearly 3\u00bd years prior to the Lions celebrating their 50th anniversary. The golden anniversary celebration was in May 1971.\n\nThis past year, the Norfolk Lions Club celebrated 103 years in existence. There are now 80 members. Causes are paid for by private donations and dues.\n\n\"All of the money raised locally goes into the community,\" current Lions member Leon Sweigard said.\n\nSome of the events put on by the Lions throughout the year include a golf tournament, parade, pancake feed, Big Wheel races and a fishing derby.\n\nThe Lions support a variety of other causes throughout the community.\n\nGlobally, the Lions focus on eight causes: Childhood cancer, diabetes, disaster relief, environment, humanitarian, hunger, vision and youth.\n\n\"The most dollars contributed to Lions Club International goes to the environment,\" Sweigard said.\n\nThe Lions' Norfolk chapter meets the first four Wednesdays each month.\n\n\"If anyone is looking to grow their leadership skills, they should really look into the Lions Club,\" Sweigard said. \"We develop leaders and give them all of the resources that a Fortune 500 company would do.\"\n\n* * *\n\nWant to learn more?\n\nTo learn more about the Norfolk Lions Club, visit https://norfolklionsclub.com/.", "source": {"uri": "norfolkdailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Norfolk Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eddie_evans_eevans@norfolkdailynews.com", "name": "Eddie Evans Eevans", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Clubs_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lions Clubs International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norfolk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norfolk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvin_Jones_(Lions_Club)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melvin Jones (Lions Club)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Daily_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Daily News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rice University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rotary International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Childhood cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fortune 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferris_wheel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ferris wheel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Service_Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Service Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Self-Improvement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Self-Improvement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Nudism/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Nudism/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Clubs", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/norfolkdailynews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/6b/16bed658-3149-11ee-8a91-138644d217ed/64ca7603113ab.image.jpg?crop=700%2C368%2C0%2C22&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753907", "eventUri": "eng-9753907", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

That remains to be seen, but one NFL analyst thinks it's going to happen.\n\nAccording to USA TODAY's Nate Davis, the Lions will finish with an 11-6 record, which is just one win shy of what they had in 2023. We actually predicted Detroit would win 11 games this season, but we also have them winning the division.\n\nHowever, Davis doesn't see things shaking out like that, as he has the Green Bay Packers going and winning 13 games to finish in first place. Here's what he said about the Lions:\n\n(5) Detroit Lions (11-6): Like the Pack, their Lombardi bid last season came up just short in a playoff loss at San Francisco. However outside expectations will now match what HC Dan Campbell has demanded internally from his team the past few years. The rest of a division the Lions just won for the first time is also fast improving. A pathway to the first Super Bowl berth in franchise history likely requires a strong start as the Lions play just two home games over an eight-week period spanning October and November. But it could happen if a young core continues to blossom - WR Jameson Williams needs to step up - and reaps results from an upgraded pass defense.\n\nAnd the Packers:\n\n(2) Green Bay Packers (13-4): What a dazzling statement QB Jordan Love made in his first year as the post-Rodgers starter, driving what was the league's youngest roster in 2023 to the verge of an appearance in the NFC championship game. This talent-teeming nucleus should continue to ascend, especially if it enjoys the expected boosts from the new set of rookies and free agent additions like RB Josh Jacobs and S Xavier McKinney. But the real delta here could occur courtesy of new DC Jeff Hafley, who's shifting the scheme and charged with shifting the fortunes of a bunch that's underachieved despite being armed with seven first-round picks. Fresh rings in Titletown? Could be.\n\nLions fans would be hard-pressed to be upset about an 11-win season, but it loses its luster if the Packers end up surpassing that total and win the division.\n\nDavis' prediction is bold, to say the least. There's no question quarterback Jordan Love showed a ton of promise during his first full season as a starter, but it's still just one season.\n\nNow, that's not to say Love and the Packers won't be good in 2024, because they likely will be. However, we'll have to see them unseat the Lions to believe it, especially after Detroit bolstered its defense during the 2024 offseason.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jameson_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jameson Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dan Campbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Love", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Jacobs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Jacobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Hafley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Hafley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Musketeers_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xavier Musketeers men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-07/USATSI_23360126.jpg?itok=KNCsHFz2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753907", "eventUri": "eng-9753907", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

That's what I'm looking for.\"\n\nBeyond Glenn, one of Campbell's first hires when he took over as Lions coach in 2021, and Johnson, who helped with play-calling duties after an in-season promotion that first year, the Lions return special teams coordinator Dave Fipp and top assistants Hank Fraley (offensive line), Kelvin Sheppard (linebackers), Antwaan Randle El (receivers) and Mark Brunell (quarterbacks) for their fourth seasons.\n\nMORE FROM BIRKETT: Detroit Lions training camp preview: Aiming for goal no NFL team has hit in 3 decades\n\nThey will have new faces in key places throughout the defense - free-agent additions D.J. Reader and Marcus Davenport are expected to play big roles up front for new defensive line coach Terrell Williams, and Carlton Davis III, Amik Robertson and rookie Terrion Arnold could start at cornerback under new secondary coach Deshea Townsend this fall - but the offensive nucleus remains largely intact and the Lions were able to keep another key offensive assistant this offseason despite job interest elsewhere.\n\nPassing game coordinator Tanner Engstrand was a candidate for offensive coordinator jobs with the New England Patriots, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Seattle Seahawks this offseason.\n\nEngstrand said this spring he \"couldn't be happier to\" have remained in Detroit, though going through the interview process made him realize how far he's come as a coach.\n\n\"It's a little different place that being on the University of San Diego (staff) a few years back,\" Engstrand said in June. \"It's, we've come a long way in a short amount of time and we just, we look forward to what we have continuing to build and grow here and the opportunities that we're going to have here with this team.\"\n\nLike Campbell, Engstrand said he expects the Lions' unusual continuity to pay big dividends this fall.\n\n\"I think it's been fantastic because, again as coaches you're always coaching but last year there was a lot of coaching the coaches because they were new,\" he said. \"This year, everybody's on the same page, we all know what we're doing. We're able to jump into Year 3 in the offense and not necessarily be dragged, but bring it along slowly as we're teaching the players and the coaches. Now, the coaches are coaching the players as we go and everybody's really on the same page in continuity, understanding why we're doing things, what are the details, where do we need to be. And so I think that's been a huge advantage for us this spring, for sure.\"\n\nNo substitute for Sudfeld\n\nNate Sudfeld was not one of four players the Lions placed on a restricted list over the weekend, which should clear the way for him to compete with Hendon Hooker for the backup quarterback job at the start of camp.\n\nSudfeld tore his ACL in the Lions' preseason finale last year and missed all of the 2023 season. He spent most of the fall rehabbing in California, but returned to be around the team in the playoffs.\n\n\"There's no substitute for a veteran presence in that room, the experience that he has,\" Brunell said last month. \"Now, he hasn't played a lot but he's been around a lot. This is what Nate brings to the table: He's been in multiple systems, he is a hard-working guy with a great attitude. He's excellent in the room, he's excellent in the locker room, guys like him. But he's very smart. He understands situational football as well as anybody I've been around.\"\n\nHooker is expected to take the bulk of the second-team and preseason reps as the Lions groom the 2023 third-round pick for a roster spot. But for one of the NFC's leading Super Bowl contenders, Sudfeld might offer the Lions better insurance.\n\nAn eight-year NFL veteran who saw limited playing time with the Lions as a backup in 2022, Sudfeld was a limited participant in OTAs and June minicamp.\n\nTHIS IS WHY YOU HAVE DEPTH: Lions place D.J. Reader, Marcus Davenport, Brian Branch on PUP list to start training camp\n\n\"We ask a lot of our quarterbacks at the line of scrimmage and in the huddle,\" Brunell said. \"We ask our guys to get us into the right play, and so if you have a play and there's a problem over there, you got to be able to fix it. And within the parameters of the play, we have the opportunity to go from one play to the next depending on what we're seeing. Ninety-nine percent of the time, Nate is right.\n\n\"He understands defenses. He knows what to look for. He's just very, very smart, and he can get you into the right play and that's half the battle. If you can do that, and then you go execute it, you're going to move the team. And so having him in the room with that ability and his ability to work well with the other guys and be a resource for Jared, much like David Blough was last year and much like Nate has been, having those guys in the room is a huge asset for the quarterback and the quarterback coach, really.\"", "source": {"uri": "freep.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Detroit Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Glenn", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Glenn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Campbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Fipp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dave Fipp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Fraley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hank Fraley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Brunell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Brunell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amik_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amik Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._J._Reader", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D.

It's been a long, hard road to get to where we're at right now, and there's a price to be paid and so we've got to go pay it again. That's the message, and it will always be the message.\"\n\nAs the Lions enter the 2024 season with the third-best chance to reach the Super Bowl at 17.6%, according to ESPN Analytics, Campbell continues to drive that gritty mindset that helped Detroit reach this point.\n\nOnce veterans reported to training camp Tuesday night at the newly named Meijer Performance Center, Campbell's message was to stay committed to putting the work into position themselves for a championship.\n\n\"I believe that what we did last year can carry over into this season. I do, as long as we go to work,\" Campbell said.\n\nThe Lions also are favored to win their division for the second consecutive season, which has only happened once in franchise history when they captured titles from 1952-54. However, the Lions have never won 10 or more games in back-to-back seasons; they are one of only two active franchises, along with the Carolina Panthers, to never accomplish this feat.\n\nEntering Year 4, Campbell feels he's a better coach than last year because he's \"more experienced.\" With increased expectations, the Lions coaching staff is also committed to improving after a making noise around the league with risky play-calling under Campbell, notably on fourth downs.\n\nThe Lions \"went for it\" on 34% of their fourth downs last season, the highest percentage in a season by any team since at least 2000.\n\n\"I've got more experience, but so does the staff under me,\" Campbell said. \"They've got more experience, and they've got more experience being around me and myself being around them, so that makes me better.

Cornerback competition\n\nThe Lions completely revamped the cornerback room, acquiring Carlton Davis via trade, signing Amik Robertson in free agency, and bringing back Emmanuel Moseley, all before drafting Terrion Arnold in the first round and Ennis Rakestraw Jr. in the second round of this year's NFL Draft.\n\nJust how will roles and playing time shake out? Davis enters camp at one of the outside spots. Arnold was opposite him with the first-team defense during OTAs and minicamp and we could certainly see that combo on the outside to start camp.\n\nBrian Branch is currently on Active/PUP, but when he returns the Lions play to use his versatility a little more than they did his rookie season by adding some safety to his duties. He will still see time at nickel, where he thrived as a rookie. How will reps for Robertson and Rakestraw shake out? Both have the versatility to play inside and outside. Will Moseley be ready to go at the start of camp coming off his second straight ACL tear, and what will he look like when he does get on the field? Don't forget he was a starter on the outside for a very good 49ers defense in 2022.\n\nNo position group went through more change than the cornerback room this offseason. Detroit looks to be much more talented with better depth, and the competition for playing roles and roster spots is expected to be fierce. Coaches are hoping that makes everyone better.\n\n2. Second-year players\n\nRunning back Jahmyr Gibbs, tight end Sam LaPorta and linebacker Jack Campbell made the Pro Football Writers Association All-Rookie Teams, while Branch was arguably one of the best nickel cornerbacks in the league last season.\n\nGibbs, LaPorta and Branch combined for 22 touchdowns, the most from a Lions rookie class since 1934. Gibbs and LaPorta were the NFL's first set of rookie teammates to each produce 10 touchdowns in their first season. Campbell recorded the second most tackles by a rookie (89) and was the only rookie to record at least 80 tackles, five tackles for loss and have 2.0 sacks on the season.\n\nWe typically see players take their biggest leap in development in their second season as the game slows down for them after a entire year in the league under their belt. If that's true for this second-year crew, what kind of numbers could they produce?\n\nI'll definitely have a little closer eye on Campbell, who is expected to take over the MIKE job on a full-time basis.\n\n\"Let me tell you first off he's a man,\" Lions defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn said of Campbell this offseason. \"He's a grown man. He's really taken control of this offseason the way he should take control of it.\n\n\"He's a true MIKE backer. He's a guy that lives, breathes green dot mentality as a MIKE linebacker. He's done a really good job - all our guys have - of transforming their body because they've had a true offseason in the NFL.\"\n\nAnother second-year player to watch is quarterback Hendon Hooker, who is competing with veteran Nate Sudfeld to be Jared Goff's backup.\n\n2024 training camp preview: Special teams 2024 training camp preview: Offensive line Lions place 3 players on PUP & 1 on NFI ahead of training camp\n\n3. Kicker competition\n\nCan the incumbent Michael Badgley, a reliable player down the stretch for Detroit last season and during their playoff run, hold off big-legged UFL sensation Jake Bates, who stood out with the Michigan Panthers this spring.\n\nBadgley is a career 82.4 percent field goal kicker but has just five makes on 13 attempts from 50-plus yards. He did make a critical 54-yard field goal to help propel the Lions past the Los Angeles Rams in the playoffs last season. Bates made 77.3 percent of his attempts (17-for-22), but four of those misses came from 50-plus yards. He also had makes from 64, 62 and 60 yards.\n\nWill consistency and experience win out or can the youngster step in and win the job? Expect head coach Dan Campbell and special teams coordinator Dave FIpp to put both kickers in as many pressure situations as they can think up in camp. The preseason games will be huge for both players as well. The new kickoff rules and the accuracy of placing the football in the landing zone could also factor into the competition.\n\n4. Depth along both lines\n\nThe starters upfront along both the offensive and defensive lines is pretty well set, but what will the depth in the trenches look like?\n\nThe offensive line is arguably the top unit in the league led by tackle Penei Sewell and center Frank Ragnow, considered by most to be the best in the league at their respective positions. Last season, the Lions faced a number of injuries upfront but players like Graham Glasgow, Kayode Awosika and Dan Skipper stepped in and the unit didn't skip a beat. Can Christian Mahogany push Awosika, Sorsdal and others for a role? And when Giovanni Manu returns from Active/NFI, can he take big enough strides in camp to be a depth player?\n\nOn defense, Aidan Hutchinson, Alim McNeill, DJ Reader and Marcus Davenport make up a formidable front four. Reader isn't ready to start camp (Active/PUP) as he's still rehabbing a torn quad suffered last season. That could give young players like Brodric Martin, Chris Smith and Mekhi Wingo an opportunity to show what they can do inside early on. Can Levi Onwuzurike finally break through and be the player the Lions thought he could be when they selected him in the second round in 2021?\n\nDetroit needs more production opposite Hutchinson on the edge and are hoping the veteran Davenport can make a significant impact in that department when he returns from Active/PUP, but can others like John Cominsky, Josh Paschal and James Houston be part of that conversation too? When the pads come on after the acclimation period we'll start to get answers to what Detroit's depth upfront on both sides of the ball will look like.\n\n5. Jamo development\n\nDetroit's offense was one of the best in the NFL last season and more of the same is expected from that side of the ball. What could take Ben Johnson's offense to a new level is if third-year wide receiver Jameson Williams becomes the player the Lions drafted him to be in 2022 (12th overall).\n\nWilliams had a red-shirt year of sorts his first season recovering from a torn ACL suffered in college. He was suspended the first month of last season and dealt with some early injuries, but really came on strong at the end of the year. We can count on one hand the number of players in this league with the kind of speed Williams has, but can he be a complete weapon at the position in Year 3?\n\nHe's going to see a significant rise in snaps as the No. 2 option at receiver behind Amon-Ra St. Brown. Will we also see a significant uptick in targets and receptions? If he becomes a consistent weapon all over the field - not just on the go balls - Detroit's offense has the potential to be the most explosive unit in the league.", "source": {"uri":

He was excellent in every phase, providing stability to a secondary that was always searching for more.\n\nWho will those players be this season? The ones who hold some intrigue, but could vault into sky-high expectations by the time Week 1 rolls around? Let's look at five potential X-factors to watch in Lions training camp.\n\n\u25b6 Jameson Williams, receiver\n\nSince the day he was drafted with the 12th pick in 2022, Williams has been a lightning rod. His combination of speed and athleticism is so unique that it's hard to remember a time when Lions fans were so excited about seeing a draft pick on the field. The first time he entered a game, the crowd literally chanted his name.\n\nBut Williams' trajectory as a pro has not been linear. He's had outbursts of production and has provided peeks at his incredibly high ceiling, but sports are about consistency, and he struggled to find that through his first couple of years, as injuries and a gambling suspension halted his year-two development at a critical time.\n\nThe Lions' reluctance to add another top receiver into the mix -- especially in the wake of a departing Josh Reynolds -- indicates that they believe Williams is ready to be a top guy in 2024, and through the offseason program, he showed why. His chemistry with quarterback Jared Goff is clearly better than ever and he's shown vast improvement tracking the ball downfield. Though this list is in no particular order, we'd put Williams in the top spot if we had to rank them.\n\n\u25b6 Jack Campbell, linebacker\n\nIt wasn't easy for Campbell to see the field after being a first-round pick a year ago, but that wasn't necessarily a knock on his game. Off-ball linebacker is arguably the most difficult position to adjust to when going from college to the pros, and the Lions were getting quality play from Alex Anzalone and Derrick Barnes.\n\nBut linebackers coach Kelvin Sheppard was adamant that Campbell is a man possessed entering Year 2, showing massive improvements as a leader of the defense through the offseason program. Like Williams, it's obvious what Campbell's size and athleticism can provide to his unit. And with the mental side coming along, it's hard not to be intrigued by what he's able to show in camp.\n\n\u25b6 Ifeatu Melifonwu, safety\n\nThere's been plenty of excitement behind the idea of what Brian Branch can be in his second year, but one defensive back whose potential doesn't get nearly enough shine is Melifonwu. After finally getting healthy for the final stretch of the year, there were few players in football who were more impactful. He had three sacks, 26 tackles, two interceptions, seven pass deflections and a forced fumble in his last five games alone.\n\nNot only that, but his versatility will allow the Lions to get creative with disguises and keep Melifonwu on the field, using him and Branch as a pair of Swiss Army Knives to keep offenses guessing. 52.5% of his defensive snaps last season came in the box and slot corner. Following a successful playoff run and healthy offseason, it's possible he's one of the stars of training camp. Branch would be a good candidate for this list, too, but he's going to begin camp on the injury list (and you likely already know that he's oozing with potential in year two).\n\n\u25b6 Josh Paschal, defensive lineman\n\nPaschal's injury history caused him to get a slow start on his Lions career, but toward the end of last season -- and before he got hurt at the beginning of the year -- Paschal showed flashes of why the Lions drafted him with a second-round pick in 2022.\n\nAfter his first two seasons, there's some belief that Paschal has a better chance of making contributions inside, but he was drafted as an edge defender and that is, in fact, where he played a majority of his defensive snaps last season.\n\nWith EDGE Marcus Davenport and defensive tackle DJ Reader both starting camp on the injury list, Paschal will have plenty of opportunity to show what he can do all along the offensive line. It also doesn't hurt that the Lions this offseason hired what many believe to be one of the best defensive line coaches in the NFL, Terrell Williams.\n\n\u25b6 Sione Vaki, running back\n\nThis one is kind of off the wall, and even if we're just looking at the rookie class, there's probably a player or two on defense who could ultimately have more of an immediate, team-wide impact. But there's just something about the ceiling of Vaki; he's an explosive play waiting to happen. He can do it as a running back. He can do it as a receiver. He can do it on kick returns.\n\nBut above all, the most exciting thing about Vaki is that he'll spend his first year in the NFL under the tutelage of offensive coordinator Ben Johnson. Last year, the Lions slow-played the involvement of rookie running back Jahmyr Gibbs, so maybe we won't see Vaki really come on until the second half of the season. But they also realized they could throw Sam LaPorta straight into the fire and did so without hesitation. If Vaki can gain the trust of the coaching staff and quarterback Jared Goff, it seems like there's no limit to what the Lions can do with him.", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Branch", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brian Branch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jameson_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jameson Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Campbell_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Campbell (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifeatu_Melifonwu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ifeatu Melifonwu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Reynolds_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Reynolds (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Goff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jared Goff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Anzalone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Anzalone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_deflected", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pass deflected"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin_Sheppard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kelvin Sheppard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_LaPorta", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam LaPorta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Paschal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Paschal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Davenport", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Davenport"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North America", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Special_Needs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Special Needs", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Sports", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/30/PDTN/73909031007-20240530-dmlionsota-0056.jpg?auto=webp&crop=1551,873,x0,y124&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753907", "eventUri": "eng-9753907", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Coming off a trip to the NFC Championship Game last season, there are among the top Super Bowl favorites heading into the 2024 season. With a young roster, shaped at its core by shrewd drafting from general manager Brad Holmes, they are also set up well for the foreseeable future.\n\nESPN analysts Dan Graziano, Aaron Schatz and Louis Riddick came together to rank all 32 teams based on their future prospects over the next three seasons (subscription required). Four categories were used, and weighted to create an overall score: Roster (minus the quarterback), the quarterback, coaching and front office.\n\nThe Lions come in at No. 4, behind the Kansas City Chiefs, Baltimore Ravens and Buffalo Bills, with a an overall score of 88.9. Their overall roster (minus quarterback), coaching and front office scores were all top-six, while their quarterback score was 12th.\n\nGraziano lauded the Lions' offense and the culture Dan Campbell has built. Schatz noted how they had the fourth-youngest defense based on snap-weighted age last season (25.5) and how they're similarly young there this year based on starters in base and nickel defenses, with one projected starter (Alex Anzalone) older than 28.\n\nRiddick noted a concern for him that is lingering as camp starts.\n\nRiddick noted how the Lions have a rebuilt cornerback depth chart. But he landed on a concern that is not going away.\n\n\"But I still have many doubts about which pass rusher will support third-year defensive end Aidan Hutchinson. Hutch has 21 sacks over his first two seasons combined but has had little help. Detroit was 27th in PRWR in 2023, and Marcus Davenport (signed this offseason) has never played a full season in his six-year career, so I'm not counting on the production to come from him.\"\n\n-Louis Riddick\n\nDavenport will open training camp on the active/PUP list, as he apparently is still dealing with the ankle issue that cost him all but four games with the Vikings last season. He was never on the practice field for OTAs, and there's not a lot of optimism he'll be what the Lions need opposite Hutchinson.\n\nOverall, the Lions get dinged a little here via an outside the top-10 grade for their quarterback situation.

Mandatory Credit: David Reginek-USA TODAY Sports / David Reginek-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Detroit Lions are now just a day away from their first full practice of training camp on Wednesday.\n\nThe offense appears to be bound for another highly productive season, while the defense should be vastly improved.\n\nReader will start training camp on the physically unable to perform (PUP) list. But, once he is cleared to return to play, there is no doubt that he's the Lions' starter at nose tackle. The prized offseason acquisition brings a much-needed pass-rushing presence to the interior of the defensive line. And, he should form a solid one-two punch with fellow DT Alim McNeill on the interior of the line.\n\nMeanwhile, Martin, after making little-to-no impact as a rookie in 2023, is expected to take a step forward in his second season in the league. He notably underwent a significant physical transformation this offseason, similar to that of McNeill last offseason.\n\nMcNeill returns as Detroit's starter at defensive tackle, after recording a breakthrough season in 2023. He recorded a career-best five sacks, and surely looked the part of a core piece for the Lions' defensive line.\n\nMeanwhile, Onwuzurike enters a make-or-break fourth season with the Lions, and he'll face some stiff competition from the likes of Wingo and Peko for playing time.\n\nReserves: John Cominsky, Mathieu Betts, Mitchell Agude, Isaac Ukwu (UDFA), Nate Lynn (UDFA)\n\nDavenport, who has yet to play a full season in his NFL career, will start training camp on the PUP list after playing in just four games with the Vikings in 2023. Yet, I still believe he'll be Hutchinson's running mate at EDGE upon returning to action.\n\nHutchinson, meanwhile, is by far the Lions' most consistently productive pass-rusher. He recorded a career-best 11.5 sacks and a staggering 101 pressures in 2023.\n\nAt EDGE, he'll periodically be spelled by fellow third-year pros Josh Paschal and James Houston. And, if Davenport's injury issues linger into the upcoming season, Paschal and Houston will be in store for an uptick in snaps, along with the team's \"Swiss Army\" knife, John Cominsky.\n\nDepending on his performance in training camp, Betts - the Canadian Football League's Most Outstanding Defensive Player last season - could also see some reps at EDGE in 2024.\n\nCampbell enters camp as the team's starter at MIKE linebacker. However, Barnes, who showcased signs of vast improvement a season ago, is a legitimate threat to steal snaps from the second-year linebacker.\n\nAnd, even if Campbell proves to be consistently productive, Barnes has the ability to be an ultra reliable backup at the position.\n\nAnzalone, the de facto leader of the Lions' defense, has taken a step forward in each of his three seasons in Detroit. The off-ball tackling machine is set to be backed up by Malcolm Rodriguez and special teams ace Jalen Reeves-Maybin in 2024.\n\nReserves: Khalil Dorsey, Kindle Vildor, Steven Gilmore, Morice Norris (UDFA)\n\nDavis and Arnold, barring something drastic, are in line to be Detroit's starting outside corners come Week 1 of the regular season.\n\nDavis will be the team's No. 1 corner to start the season, but Arnold - Detroit's first-round pick this past April - could very well supplant Davis as the season progresses. Regardless, Davis and Arnold both are expected to be upgrades over the likes of Cam Sutton, Jerry Jacobs and Will Harris.\n\nAdditionally, the Lions will enter the season with a very capable pair of backup corners in Emmanuel Moseley and Ennis Rakestraw. If either Davis or Arnold were to miss time, I believe the Lions would still be in good hands because of the presence of Moseley and Rakestraw.\n\nMeanwhile, Dorsey, Vildor and Gilmore all could also see time at corner in 2024, depending on how the season shakes out.\n\nBranch, Detroit's best defensive back in 2023, enters training camp on the PUP list. He emerged as one of the league's best at the nickel corner position as a rookie, and the hope is that he can replicate his production in 2024.\n\nDue to the offseason departure of C.J. Gardner-Johnson, Branch could also see playing time at safety - and a lot of it - this upcoming season. If such occurs, expect Robertson - one of Brad Holmes' several defensive back acquisitions this offseason - to be first in line to absorb Branch's reps at nickel.\n\nThe team's depth behind the two of them is a bit thin, though. Brandon Joseph played in just two games as a rookie in 2023, and logged zero defensive snaps. Meanwhile, Moore, who missed all of last year due to a suspension for gambling, has spent the majority of his NFL career as a special teams performer.\n\nSo, if Kerby Joseph and/or Melifonwu were to miss any time at all in 2024, the Lions would find themselves in an unenviable situation at safety.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [],

But they remained on the unwanted list of teams that have never made it. So can defensive end Aidan Hutchinson be blamed for treading lightly when discussing the Lions' hopes for the 2024 NFL season?\n\nAppearing on the Rich Eisen Show, Hutchinson didn't say two important words when asked what he visualized for the Lions' final game.\n\n\"I'm visualizing the Honolulu blue, the white little confetti coming down and doing some snow angels,\" Hutchinson said. \"That's the visualization.\"\n\nBut what does Lions DE Aidan Hutchinson really think?\n\nPressure comes in all forms in the NFL. Hutchinson apparently didn't want to add to the mix.\n\n\"There's a lot of expectations and pressure but I really do believe this team can get it done,\" he said. \"And I feel like myself, as an individual I've mentally prepared myself to be playing until February this year.\n\n\"All of my regimens and running, I'm getting ready to have my body going until February. It's a very realistic thing, and it's something that's not too far out there. It's something very much within grasp.\"\n\nThe experts -- including nfl.com -- seem to agree, slotting the Lions at No. 4 in the post-draft power rankings. Detroit got receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and tackle Penei Sewell under comfortable contract extensions, and beefed up their secondary weakness with first-round pick CB Terrion Arnold. Then they added CB Ennis Rakestraw Jr. in round two. Also, Detroit added DT Mekhi Wingo and guard Christian Mahogany, drafting like a team with win-now aspirations.\n\nSo Detroit fans probably don't have any problem with Hutchinson cutting loose with a bold prediction. Eventually, Hutchinson gave in and told Eisen, \"I feel like a lot of guys are saying Super Bowl this, and Super Bowl that, but what gives me a lot of joy is I know when those seconds are ticking down, confetti's falling, you take that deep breath knowing you did it, that's what I look forward to.\"\n\nHutchinson has lived up to the billing of being the No. 2 overall pick in 2022. He finished second in the AP defensive rookie of the year voting with 9.5 sacks, 52 tackles, and a surprising three interceptions. Year two brought more good stuff, including his first Pro Bowl appearance. Hutchinson totaled 11.5 sacks and met his tackle quota with 51. He picked off another pass and forced three fumbles.\n\nStill, it's Detroit\n\nEven the great running back Barry Sanders couldn't get the Lions to the big game. Detroit remains one of four teams without a Super Bowl trophy. The others are the Browns, Texans and Jaguars. So even talking about the Super Bowl, with the 2024 roster looking nice and last year's experience to grow on, makes for fun times in Detroit.\n\nHead coach Dan Campbell famously said the Lions might have missed their best chance to reach the big game. But Hutchinson told Pro Football Talk Campbell's comments came out of the tough blow of the close loss to the 49ers in the NFC Championship -- a game the Lions led 24-7 at halftime. Hutchinson said the entire Lions team deal with raw emotions after the game.\n\n\"I don't know if he meant those things completely, because in our exit meetings the day after, he's like, 'We're going to the Super Bowl next year!' Hutchinson said. \"Like, 'I don't care what it takes!' You kind of hear that after the game, and you get a little discouraged because you're like, 'Do you think that was our only shot?'

Nevertheless, here's what he wrote:\n\nThe Lions don't need to add another offensive weapon, with Amon-Ra St. Brown, Jameson Williams, Sam LaPorta, David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs anchoring one of the most explosive attacks in football, but Aiyuk would give the unit an outside receiver with WR1 capabilities. Though the addition could disrupt the chemistry, rhythm and flow of a unit that already operates at a high level, the aggressive move could also make Detroit's offense impossible to defend. The team would enter the 2024 regular season without a glaring weakness on that side of the ball, while simultaneously decreasing the explosive potential of an NFC rival. (Which, to be frank, underscores why this deal probably won't take place.) If head coach Dan Campbell and offensive coordinator Ben Johnson could craft game plans that provide each of the Lions' top playmakers with sufficient touches, the lovable underdogs could quickly become Super Bowl favorites with Aiyuk joining the fold.\n\nThe Lions would have a true embarrassment of riches if they landed Aiyuk. They'd have him and Jameson Williams on the outside, Amon-Ra St. Brown in the slot, and budding star Sam LaPorta at tight end. Good luck defending all that.\n\nThe problem with that dream scenario is three-fold: the 49ers are reportedly not interested in trading him, they are unlikely to want to deal him to a team that stands to compete with them for the NFC crown, and it stands to reason San Francisco would want Williams as a return in the trade.\n\nThe bad news is, trading for Aiyuk is a pipe dream. The good news is, the Lions don't need that kind of move.

After winning the first division title in three decades and making a run to the NFC Championship game last season, confidence is aplenty inside the walls of the team's Allen Park facility.\n\nAmong those feeling the new wave of confidence is wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown, who is coming off an All-Pro season. Having been with the team since the start of the Dan Campbell era, the USC product is part of the core foundation that has been essential to the recent success.\n\nAfter surprising some last year with postseason success, the Lions are not running from expectations. Rather, leaders such as St. Brown are embracing the hype and using it as fuel.\n\n\"I think we're really confident. Each year, you get into that meeting on the first day and it's like, 'What do you want to accomplish as a team?' I can truthfully say this year, it's not even playoffs,\" St. Brown said. \"It's not (being the) number one seed, it's the Super Bowl. That's the feeling with everyone in the room. Personally, I feel like truly as a team, we all feel the same way. We all want to win the Super Bowl, we know we can win the Super Bowl. We have the team, we have the coaches. We have everything we need in this building to win a Super Bowl. That's our goal, that's our focus, and everything we do from here on moving forward is to get that Super Bowl.\"\n\nLast season, the Lions entered training camp with a more moderate sense of hype. They finished the 2022 season on a winning surge, and the belief was that the team would prove its legitimacy as a contender by winning their division in 2023.\n\nThey did just that, then rode a wave of momentum through the first two rounds of the playoffs before an untimely collapse against the San Francisco 49ers. Now, the team knows what it is capable of and is setting high goals as a result.\n\n\"Last year around this time, the year before we were 9-8, barely missed the playoffs,\" St. Brown said. \"So for us, I feel like going into last year it was like, 'Let's win the division, let's get into the playoffs and once we get there, we can go get that Super Bowl.'\n\n\"Last year, let's win the division, get to the playoffs and hopefully once we get there we can go make a run at it. This year, it's like, obviously you can't win the Super Bowl without making the playoffs. Number one seed, all that stuff sounds good, but our main goal is the Super Bowl. I feel like everyone in the room is thinking the same way. I think just the thought alone is that it means a lot.\"\n\nOne more box to check\n\nLast season, the Lions made a point of acknowledging how long it had been since the franchise previously won both a division title and a playoff game. The years of each time they'd last accomplished those feats lined the back of the team meeting room.\n\nNow, after the Lions did both last season, those numbers have been taped over. However, the Lions know that in order to reach the ultimate goal, they will have to once again take the previous two steps.\n\n\"Those are still up there, and there's still taped through with old school tape. It just looks better that way. But we've checked the box on two, and we've got one more to check,\" Campbell said. \"But to get there, we've got to check those first two one more time and update them. Everything starts with finding a way to win your division. You do that, you've got to put in the work, man. You've got to find a way to win the first game of the season and then you go from there.\"\n\nThis focus points to the larger mindset echoed by St. Brown, who believes that the Lions have what it takes to set themselves apart from the rest of the league.\n\nEvery team enters the season with high expectations, but the Lions feel as though their blend of experience and talent give them a chance to make good on the hype surrounding them this offseason.\n\n\"I think we all know what the goal is. It doesn't need to be said. We all, in the room, as a team, we've got one goal, and that's the Super Bowl,\" St. Brown stated. \"We're not looking any further, we're not looking anywhere else. Obviously you've got to take it one game at a time every week, we understand that. The end goal, I think for every team, is to win the Super Bowl. But some teams it's just different. For us, we know we're capable of doing it but we've got to put the work in.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amon-Ra_St._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amon-Ra St. Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saitama_Seibu_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saitama Seibu Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Campbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1079,h_606,x_0,y_14/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/all_lions/01j3jsx42mytknhywm1g.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753907", "eventUri": "eng-9753907", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 130, "textEnd": 137}], "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Previously, he had stints between the Buffalo Bills, Kansas City Chiefs and Indianapolis Colts. He's only played in 36 games in his career with 17 total career starts. Those 17 starts happened in Buffalo between the 2020 and 2021 season. He was undrafted out of Iowa in 2018 and had signed with the Bills.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Focus (PFF), Boettger had 636 offensive snaps played in 2021 and he allowed one sack while earning a 59.8 overall grade. In 2020, he didn't allow a sack while playing 623 offensive snaps. This was good enough to earn a 65.3 overall grade.\n\nLast season he only played 8 snaps on special teams for the Colts. He didn't take a snap on offense. It'll be interesting if Boettger can make the 53-man roster for the Lions. Either way, he's a veteran player as the Lions prepare to start training camp on Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Boettger", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oskar Boettger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ike_Boettger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ike Boettger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Zeitler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Zeitler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bills", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Bills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Hawkeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/qeW5cn_DQt.R3FEi0rOf3w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD0xNjAzO2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/detroit_lines_wire_usa_today_sports_articles_856/7f80dcd6517a45c2e50ce1162736ef6d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753907", "eventUri": "eng-9753907", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Or perhaps 11. Or worst-case scenario, 10.\n\nOf course there's no guarantee they'll take the next step from the NFC Championship Game to the Super Bowl because climbs aren't always smooth and linear. But there's no way the Lions could drop, say, from 12 victories to seven, right?\n\nNah. Too talented, too deep, too motivated. That's the encouraging part, the one Dan Campbell is counting on. And then there's the scary part, the one Campbell has seen, and lived.\n\nWhen training camp opened Wednesday, Campbell delivered a few pointed messages, including one that came straight from the gut. He was a third-year tight end for the New York Giants in 2001 when they were coming off a 12-4 season and a Super Bowl appearance. The defense was menacing and Jim Fassel was an accomplished coach entering his fifth season.\n\nSuper Bowl aspirations melted to a 7-9 record, and the decline was gradual but visible. Campbell saw it then, and never forgot it. He said workouts ran a little shorter, to give veteran players more rest. Padded practices weren't as fierce. The edge started to fade, and the Giants plummeted as if in slow motion.\n\n\"It's one of the best things that ever happened to me,\" Campbell said Wednesday. \"We did something really special and came up a little short, and the next year we had the exact same team. ... And pretty soon, by the end of it, you've lost your identity and everything that made you what you are. You went away from it because, 'You know what? We'll be OK. We've got the same guys.'\"\n\nCampbell is big on messages, and this is one he's hammering to a team that's 22-8 since mid-2022 and has most of the same guys, and more. He's not trying to scare anyone. He's not downplaying the Lions' chances. He's explaining something most people don't understand unless they've been through it.\n\n\"That was a lesson learned for me (in 2001),\" Campbell said. \"We went 7-9 the year after going 12-4 and I will never forget that. Ever. So we're not going to lose our identity. That is the most important thing to me, and I won't sacrifice it for anyone or anything.\"\n\nBack to work\n\nIn his three seasons here, Campbell has delivered a consistent message -- \"We don't live off reputation, we live off of work,\" he reiterated. The Lions have become experienced with success, and are learning to handle it.\n\nEarly indications are, complacency won't be a problem. If it becomes one, Campbell has the voice to stamp it out, as do many of the players. This is a young group with the right mix of humility and hunger. Its leader, Jared Goff, has taken more hits (verbal and otherwise) than any $53-million-per-year quarterback should. He figures the Lions have more of their own to deliver.\n\n\"Yeah, we've got a target on our backs now,\" Goff said. \"But we certainly have our list of people we got a target on. Teams that maybe still don't respect us. Teams that have said certain things in the past. It's not like we're at the top of the mountain looking down. We're constantly feeling like we're the underdog and have to fight for what we deserve, fight for our respect.\"\n\nGoff wouldn't identify the Lions' primary targets, but you can guess a few. NFC North rivals for sure, especially the Packers, who are stirring with quarterback Jordan Love. Gotta be the Cowboys, too, who often beat the Lions in bizarre and controversial ways. Naturally the 49ers and maybe the Seahawks, a persistent nemesis.\n\nHumility and hunger can be a lethal combination. Campbell endured a 4-19-1 start here with players hardened by it. It's no accident those early survivors -- Goff, Penei Sewell, Aidan Hutchinson, Amon-Ra St. Brown -- are a huge part of what could be next, and they sound ready for it.\n\nWhat would make this season a success?\n\n\"I think the obvious answer would be a Super Bowl,\" Hutchinson said. \"That's the expectation, and if we fall short, if we end up in the same spot, it'd be a failure for sure. That is the mentality, and it's kind of a harsh mentality. But we have the guys and there's no reason we shouldn't be playing in that game and winning that game.\"\n\nHutchinson has believed in himself and his team since his Michigan days, when he helped beat Ohio State and changed the program's culture. He turns 24 next month, and still finds it hard to fathom how much he's gained entering his third NFL season.\n\nThe Lions bet big on Goff, Sewell and St. Brown with contract extensions. They're betting on Hutchinson too, and he'll take that wager. With Aaron Glenn ramping up the aggressive play-calling, and veterans DJ Reader and Marcus Davenport added to a defensive line that includes Alim McNeill, that group could make the biggest leap.\n\n\"I know I'm the guy that people are gonna rely on,\" Hutchinson said. \"I know I'm the guy that's gonna face the most expectations and pressure, and I've really learned to embrace that. The biggest difference in my mentality is, when it's the fourth quarter and someone's got to make a play, and everyone's looking at me, I say bring it on.\"\n\nCrush complacency\n\nWell, bring it on indeed. The franchise has prepped for increased attention, even adding double-decker stands around the practice field, newly christened the Meijer Performance Center.\n\nOn the first day of camp, it was overcast and mild, with hotter, tougher days ahead. The Lions have dutifully watched tape of the collapse against the 49ers in the conference title game, when a 24-7 halftime lead turned into a crushing 34-31 loss. Goff said it's hard but \"you think about it every day.\" Campbell said he only watches the second half because the first half was \"irrelevant.\"\n\nFeel the pain so you don't forget it. Build on the reputation so you don't lose it. Campbell didn't intend to impugn Fassel (who's deceased) with his example of a team letting up. In fact, he appreciates it more than ever.\n\n\"I've seen too many teams, man, if you start doing things just a little different, get a little complacent, that takes away from your identity,\" Campbell said. \"And I really believe you become something you don't want to be.\"\n\nCampbell knows what that looks like. So do some of his players. The opening message is, don't act like you've been there -- act like you plan to go back.", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Campbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Park,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allen Park, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Allen Park, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Love", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Goff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jared Goff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Fassel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Fassel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aidan_Hutchinson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aidan Hutchinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alim_McNeill", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alim McNeill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penei_Sewell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penei Sewell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amon-Ra_St._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amon-Ra St. Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Glenn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Glenn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Davenport", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Davenport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Seahawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin Bowling", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/11/PDTN/74061373007-20240611-dmlionsota-0116.jpg?auto=webp&crop=1853,1042,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753907", "eventUri": "eng-9753907", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Before veterans fully report on Tuesday, that spot has been filled. According to NFL insider Aaron Wilson, the Lions have signed veteran guard Ike Boettger.\n\nThe Lions announced the move shortly after Wilson's report.\n\nBoettger went undrafted out of Iowa, where he played guard and tackle, in 2018. He signed with the Buffalo Bills, who waived him after training camp. The Kansas City Chiefs claimed and waived him in September that year, and he ended up back with the Bills and played four games as a reserve guard.\n\nAfter playing just two games for the Bills in 2019, Boettger started 17 regular season games for them over the following two seasons. He also started all three playoff games for Buffalo in 2020, including the AFC Championship Game. He has started games at both guard spots.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Focus, Boettger did not allow a sack while playing 623 offensive snaps in 2020 (a 65.3 overall grade that year). In 2021, he played 636 offensive snaps and allowed one sack while earning a 59.8 overall grade.\n\nBoettger spent most of the 2022 season on the PUP list, then he did not make the Bills' roster last year. He landed on the Indianapolis Colts' practice squad, eventually playing eight special teams snaps over two games for them last season.\n\nThe Lions placed rookie offensive lineman Giovanni Manu on the Active/NFI list to start training camp. So that feels like a factor in the addition of Boettger, along with a general lack of experience behind the starters at guard.\n\nThere's a chance Boettger, with versatility and experience as his primary assets, makes a legit push for a spot on the Lions' 53-man roster. It's just as likely he's not around very long though, and he ends up as the definition of a camp body.", "source": {"uri": "sidelionreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SideLion Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Boettger", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oskar Boettger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ike_Boettger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ike Boettger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Hawkeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placekicker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Placekicker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bills", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Bills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_squad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Practice squad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill_and_Spell", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill and Spell", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2608,h_1467,x_0,y_829/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/53/01j3dxvq4c4rx3hch014.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753907", "eventUri": "eng-9753907", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

However, fourth-year coach Dan Campbell has been adamant that the process it will take to reach that height will require double the effort that the team exerted last year to reach the NFC Championship game.\n\nBattling complacency seems to be a theme ahead of the start of training camp, as Campbell has reiterated the importance of hard work and consistency leading through OTAs and the start of training camp.\n\nCampbell shared his message with the team Tuesday as veterans reported, emphasizing the importance of work and not coasting off of last year's success.\n\n\"I talked to them last night. It was really like it's been, and that's, 'It's all about the work.' We don't live off of reputation, we live off of work,\" Campbell explained. \"That's what's gotten us to where we're at. It's been a long, hard road to get to where we're at right now and there's a price to be paid, so we've got to go pay it again. That's the message, and it'll always be the message.\"\n\nFirst padded practice\n\nThe Lions' first four practices of training camp will be designated as acclimation practices, which will be conducted without pads.\n\nOn Monday, July 29, however, the Lions will don pads for the first time this year. For many, the true evaluations of training camp can be made when the pads come on. Detroit will be able to begin truly evaluating its roster when contact practices begin.\n\n\"It's about working guys in this week and, let's get them the reps and spread the load and get their legs under them,\" Campbell said. \"Let's get their football legs under them and then along the way improve a little bit here. There's not a ton of reps to go around. There's a restriction on time lime limits. ... We're well within the rules, but that's really it. It's getting their football legs under them.\"\n\n'They make me look better'\n\nAhead of the start of his fourth season, Campbell was asked to reflect on how he feels he has improved as a coach in the past six months. Since the last time the Lions took the field, which was Jan. 28, the coach explained that he has gained valuable experience.\n\nThat experience has come in the form of working even closer with his assistants. Many of the key faces have been in Detroit since or before Campbell arrived, such as Ben Johnson, Aaron Glenn and Hank Fraley.\n\nAs a result, the Lions have a rare continuity amongst NFL staffs. By working with this group for so long, Campbell is able to better understand those around him which adds to the experience.\n\n\"More experienced. More experienced, and then I just bring this up, I've got more experience but so does the staff under me, they've got more experience,\" Campbell said. \"And they've got more experience being around me and myself being around them.

And while he appears to be living up to the hype on day one of Lions training camp, Williams reportedly had a pretty brutal start to practice on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to Lions beat reporter Kyle Meinke, Williams briefly left day one of camp after \"vomiting several times\" during the early portion of practice.\n\n\"He told me he's fine, just ate the wrong thing for breakfast,\" Meinke reported.\n\nWilliams, who was limited to just six games in his rookie year after tearing his ACL in the National Championship with Alabama, also missed significant time to start the 2023 NFL season.\n\nHe was initially suspended six games after violating the NFL's gambling rules, however, the suspension was later shortened after the league revised its policy.\n\nHe ultimately missed the first four games of the year.\n\nWilliams' 2023 numbers certainly don't jump off the page - he recorded just 24 receptions for 354 yards and three total touchdowns during the regular season.\n\nWith that said, though, his big-play ability and game-breaking speed were on full display during the NFC title game vs. San Francisco.\n\nThe Lions will open the 2024 season at home in Week 1 against Matthew Stafford and the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nRelated: NFL Insider Has Telling Two-Word Update on Cowboys' Dak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb Situation\n\nRelated: Jonathan Taylor Issues Blunt Anthony Richardson Warning to NFL Before 2024 Season", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_flynn@postandcourier.com", "name": "Cameron Flynn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jameson_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jameson Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amon-Ra_St._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amon-Ra St. Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CeeDee_Lamb", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CeeDee Lamb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Taylor_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Taylor (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Blunt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Blunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Stafford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Stafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753907", "eventUri": "eng-9753907", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

He looks like he's done this before. He looks like he knows what to expect.\"\n\nLions quarterback Jared Goff and Williams also showed a strong connection.\n\nGoff hit Williams on some nice sideline routes in individual drills - Williams got in and out of his breaks fast, showed improved hands, stronger body control and nice footwork.\n\n\"I'm getting better every day,\" Williams said.\n\nFacing the defense, Goff hit Williams on beautiful post pattern for a touchdown - Williams simply split the defensive backs and blew the top off the defense.\n\n\"I'm just excited to be playing ball,\" Williams said. \"Trying to make plays - that's it.\"\n\nBACK. TO. WORK: Priority No. 1 for Detroit Lions at start of training camp? Avoid complacency\n\nEntering his third season, Williams is expected to play a more critical role this fall.\n\nHis first season was slowed because of a knee injury, and last season was stunted because of a gambling suspension.\n\nNow, he should be full go for the first time in his career.\n\n\"The biggest thing I'd probably say is confidence,\" David Montgomery said of Williams. \"He was doing special things in college, but to see him here in person from the first year that I was here to now, it's a big, big improvement. And, you know, his body's changed too.\"\n\nAfter catching a long touchdown pass, he lost his cookies, not to mention his breakfast.\n\nBut this didn't appear to be a player who had to vomit in the middle of practice for being out of shape, which is hardly unusual for the first day of training camp.\n\nNo.\n\nThis looked like somebody who was working so hard, playing with so much intensity, running all around the field - excited for the first practice and a significantly new and improved role - that it got the better of him.\n\n\"Ah, I just ate the wrong thing this morning,\" Williams said, walking into the facility.\n\nAnother lesson learned.\n\n\"He's not that young rookie guy anymore,\" St. Brown said. \"He's been here for a few years. Every year he just gets more comfortable. And I know I've been saying this every year but I think I'm he's gotten better every year, obviously. But I think this year is gonna be huge for him.\"\n\nHow does the Lions' defense look early on?\n\nThe first defenders on the field during the seven-on-seven portion of practice were Derrick Barnes at left linebacker, Jack Campbell at middle and Alex Anzalone at right linebacker. Ennis Rakestraw Jr. and Terrion Arnold were at corner with Kerby Joseph and Ifeatu Melifonwu at safety. Emmanuel Moseley replaced Barnes as the slot corner for a nickel set. Rakestraw also took reps at slot cornerback with the second-team defense.\n\nJoseph praised the new additions to the defensive backfield for eagerly looking to improve.\n\n\"I love their sense of urgency and their work ethic,\" Joseph said about the rookie corners. \"Everybody wants to get better. Everybody wants to work hard, no matter what round they went in or who they are. They keep their head down and they are humble.\"\n\nIT STILL GRINDS YOUR GEARS: 25 years after Barry Sanders' retirement, he -- and Detroit Lions -- still owe an apology\n\nTaylor Decker got more dry needlers. Well, the Lions' left tackle wasn't the only player who requested a few more folks who could perform the muscle-related restorative therapy. Nor were dry needlers Decker's only request.\n\nHe asked for a few more athletic trainers as well. And got those too. His requests came out of an organizational effort to update and renovate the training facilities at the team's headquarters in Allen Park.\n\nAnd for Decker, the effort sent a powerful message:\n\n\"We are going to give everything we can back to you.\"\n\nThe \"reinvestment,\" as he called it, is most notable in the team's new athletic training room, replete with the latest equipment, technology, and much more spacious.\n\nFor Decker, and surely for his teammates, finding more efficient ways to minimize injury and recover from injuries could offer a slight competitive advantage over the season.\n\nEven, he said, if that advantage amounts only to one or two percent.\n\n\"Got to stay healthy, got to get back on the field,\" he said.\n\nIn a game decided by the tiniest of margins, the Lions, and Decker, hope they just increased theirs.\n\nHendon Hooker's hot start\n\nQuarterback Hendon Hooker was beaming as he came off the field, rightly excited to talk about performing well in his first NFL training camp practice. We've been talking about the Lions' 2023 third-round for so long that it's easy to forget he missed all of camp last year while he covered from a torn ACL in November 2022.\n\nHe had a full offseason this year and looked sharp as the No. 2 on Wednesday, taking snaps ahead of Nate Sudfeld. Hooker tossed some nice, crisp sideline passes to Amon-Ra St. Brown, Jalon Calhoun and Kalif Raymond and was quick and steady in the pocket.\n\n\"I really haven't played to the best of my ability that I know I can play until now,\" he said. \"So going through this offseason I was just really amped up to get back out here and showcase my talent.\n\n\"So really that first team (period) I was too jittery and too amped up. So once I relaxed and I got into my groove you could really see the ball coming out on time and smoother drops. I was in control of the huddle and felt great after that first team (period).\"\n\nExpect Hooker and Sudfeld to alternate as the No. 2, which should make their camp battle fun. Both made some great throws, with one of Sudfeld's best coming on an over-the-shoulder pass to Zonovan Knight, who beat safety Loren Strickland for a big gain in a 4-minute drill.\n\n\"Competition makes the room better,\" Hooker said. \"So continue to push off Jared, continue to push off Nate, and then the coaching has been great. So I'm just learning and staying consistent every day.\"\n\nGrand new seating\n\nFans planning to attend an open practice will be pleasantly surprised when they see the upgraded covered seating they get to enjoy.\n\nThe bleachers have been replaced in the general-admission section with two large grandstands that accommodate 2,500 fans and feature stadium-style chair backs.

Perhaps it's for reasons out of their control, such as injuries, or maybe they were passed up on the depth chart by a player on his way to stardom. Maybe their play simply declined.\n\nAs veterans report to training camp, here are five Lions looking to have bounce-back years in 2024.\n\n\u25b6 John Cominsky, defensive lineman\n\nCominsky was a great story in the 2022 season. After being claimed off waivers from the Atlanta Falcons in May 2022 -- the Lions were one of eight teams to put a claim in, a fairly high number -- Cominsky made the most of his opportunity in a pivotal season for the franchise. He finished that season with 44 pressures, four sacks and 12 QB hits, earning himself a two-year contract to stay in Detroit.\n\nBut as the entire defensive line as a whole (outside of Aidan Hutchinson) took a step back in pass-rush success through the 2023 season, Cominsky was one of the players who couldn't quite return to form. His pressure totals dropped by 25% (to 33) despite seeing 434 pass-rush snaps, as opposed to 356 the previous season.\n\nAs we've mentioned throughout our training camp previews, there's hope the defensive line as a whole will see improvement through the hiring of vaunted position coach Terrell Williams. And with so much uncertainty in the unit entering camp, opportunity will be abound for Cominsky to stake his claim as a key contributor.\n\n\u25b6 James Mitchell, tight end\n\nMitchell was recovering from a torn ACL to begin his rookie season in 2022, and even with the arrival of Sam LaPorta, the Lions were hoping to see Mitchell continue that progress after a full, healthy offseason in 2023.\n\nBut despite showing some solid pass-catching ability the year prior -- he had 11 catches on 11 targets as a rookie -- Mitchell struggled to crack the rotation and saw just two targets last season. Lions general manager Brad Holmes is loyal to the players he drafted, so maybe this camp isn't quite as make-or-break as it seems from the outset. But with Shane Zylstra vying for the third tight end job, it feels as though Mitchell doesn't have much room for error.\n\n\u25b6 James Houston, outside linebacker\n\nHouston was one of the most exciting players to come out of the 2022 season, as the sixth-round rookie made his debut in Week 12 and went on to accumulate eight sacks in the final seven games. Many thought he was on a trajectory to be one of the defense's most impactful players last season.\n\nBut even before a broken ankle in Week 2 ended his season prematurely, there was reason to be skeptical about whether the Lions felt the same way about his potential as local and national media did. He mainly repped with the third team in practice as Detroit attempted to round out his abilities into somebody who could rush the passer and play off-ball linebacker, an area where he never really stood out.\n\nIn addition to seeing how he returns to this year's training camp, there's intrigue in seeing how the Lions plan to use Houston in Year 3.\n\n\u25b6 Donovan Peoples-Jones, wide receiver\n\nThrough each of the first three years of his career, Peoples-Jones saw vast improvements in production. But this past season, he wasn't quite in the mix with Cleveland, and after a midseason trade to Detroit, he turned in his quietest season as a pro: 13 receptions on 25 targets for a grand total of 155 yards and no touchdowns.\n\nPeoples-Jones' potential is obvious, and it makes sense why the Lions didn't feel compelled to force him into action with an offense that was absolutely humming. It can be difficult -- especially in an offense that depends on timing -- to get on the same page on the fly.\n\nBut even if we assume that Jameson Williams successfully takes a third-year jump, there should be plenty of opportunity for Peoples-Jones to bring something unique to the table as a big-bodied outside receiver with good hands.\n\n\u25b6 Emmanuel Moseley, cornerback\n\nWith all of the new talent in Detroit's secondary, it's easy to forget how intriguing the addition of Moseley was entering last season. Though he would be getting a late start due the rehab of his torn ACL, he had shown through his first five games of the 2022 campaign that he had become a surefire starting corner in the league.\n\nAfter finally being cleared to play, Moseley's season once again ended in a hurry, as he tore the opposite ACL on his second play back. But while he had the same road to recovery ahead of him as the year prior, it appears that things have gone a bit better this time. Moseley was not named as one of the players who would be starting training camp on the active/PUP list.\n\nWho knows how long it'll take Moseley to return to his best football after missing the better part of two full seasons, but he certainly can't be forgotten as the Lions aim to reshape their secondary once again.", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_XFL_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2023 XFL season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_USFL_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2022 USFL season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aidan_Hutchinson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aidan Hutchinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Depth chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waivers_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Waivers (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Zylstra", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shane Zylstra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_LaPorta", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam LaPorta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Holmes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jameson_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jameson Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Moseley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Moseley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Peoples-Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Peoples-Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically_unable_to_perform", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physically unable to perform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North America", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Special_Needs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Special Needs", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Sports", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/23/PDTN/73822306007-20240523-dmlionsota-0659.jpg?auto=webp&crop=3113,1752,x0,y333&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753907", "eventUri": "eng-9753907", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

His 86 receptions, 889 yards and 10 touchdowns ranked first, fourth and second all-time.\n\nWith a year under his belt and more targets available after the departure of Josh Reynolds, it stands to reason he could be even better in 2024, which would most certainly garner All-Pro consideration.\n\nHutchinson improved his career-best mark for sacks in 2023, with the Michigan product tallying 11.5 after posting 9.5 during his rookie campaign. That was especially impressive because he didn't have a ton of help around him.\n\nBut with the additions of Marcus Davenport and D.J. Reader, along with an improved secondary that should give him more time to get after the quarterback, Hutchinson is primed to take a massive step forward in his third season.\n\nMcNeill is fresh off a breakout campaign and is in a contract year. If he can build upon what he did in his third campaign, it's certainly reasonable to believe he can at least work his way into the All-Pro conversation.\n\nLast but not least, we have Zeitler, who has been a good interior offensive lineman for years now. The veteran solidified his status with his first Pro Bowl nod in 2023 and could be even better with the Lions thanks to caliber of players he has next to him.\n\nAs impressive as it is to have four Lions make the list, you can make an argument for even more players, like quarterback Jared Goff and running back Jahmyr Gibbs, for example.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aidan_Hutchinson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aidan Hutchinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Zeitler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Zeitler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Reynolds_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Reynolds (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan Wolverines football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahmyr_Gibbs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jahmyr Gibbs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Goff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jared Goff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Davenport", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Davenport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-07/USATSI_22343885.jpg?itok=NqyFQ1d_", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753907", "eventUri": "eng-9753907", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

Detroit came so close to the Super Bowl that they could taste it. Now, they are ready to attack the 2024 season with renewed vigor.\n\nThey got the 2024 NFL season off to a great start during the offseason. General manager Brad Holmes aggressively addressed the team's biggest need -- the defensive secondary. The Lions added Amik Robertson in free agency and traded for Carlton Davis III from the Buccaneers. They also invested their first two draft picks in cornerbacks, adding Terrion Arnold and Ennis Rakestraw Jr. These players join a secondary that already includes second-year standout Brian Branch and ball hawking free safety Kerby Joseph.\n\nHowever, there is one important position group that the Lions hardly addressed in either free agency or the 2024 NFL Draft. The Lions desperately need a reliable pass rusher to pair with Aidan Hutchinson.\n\nYou can say they haven't tried to find a solution. During free agency, the Lions signed journeyman Marcus Davenport to a one-year contract. Davenport comes with first-round pedigree, but injuries have hampered his NFL career. He is a cheap upside play, but not someone who the Lions should single-handedly depend upon for production.\n\nDetroit also has a handful of rotational role players who have made up the bulk of the team's pass rush the past few years. Josh Pascal and John Cominsky are both tweener players who can line up at edge rusher or kick inside for some interior pass rush. They will also try out CFL superstar Mathieu Betts, who has some Aidan Hutchinson vibes himself. These are all valuable players, but none of them have the realistic upside of becoming an every-down starter in 2024.\n\nFinally, there's James Houston. He may be more of a situational player, but he has the potential to become the team's best pass rusher this season.\n\nWho is James Houston?\n\nJames Houston was a relatively unheralded player in college who became a diamond in the rough for the Lions.\n\nHouston was recruited by the University of Florida to play linebacker. Things didn't pan out with the Gators, so Houston transferred to Jackson State and played for head coach Deion Sanders. It was coach Sanders who saw Houston's potential as a pass rusher.\n\nAccording to Jeff Risdon of Lions Wire, Houston pitched himself to Sanders as an off-ball linebacker. However, Sanders was quick to guide Houston in the right direction.\n\nThe following quotes come from an episode of Coach Prime on YouTube, which aired in 2022.\n\n\"I know the talent that I have,\" Houston said. \"And y'all have put a cap on my talent, here. I know exactly what I can do.\"\n\nCoach Prime gave Houston a blunt response in return.\n\n\"James, let me tell you something,\" Sanders retorted. \"If you were able to do that, you would have done that, and you would have never came here. If you was that dude that you think you are at linebacker, you would have never been here.\"\n\nIt turns out that Coach Prime was right. In his final collegiate season, Houston racked up 16.5 sacks as an edge rusher. His ability to rush off the edge and play some off-ball linebacker made him a tempting prospect for the Lions, who picked him in the sixth round.\n\nCan James Houston provide consistent pass rush for the Lions opposite Aidan Hutchinson in 2024?\n\nHouston has proved that he has what it takes to succeed as an NFL pass rusher. However, he hasn't mastered the most important ability yet -- availability.\n\nHouston put himself on the map in 2022 when he logged a whopping eight sacks and one forced fumble in only seven games played. In fact, according to Pro Football Focus, Houston managed this production only 92 pass rush snaps. It should go without saying, but I'll spell it out for you -- this is absolutely absurd efficiency!\n\nThe problem is it only came in a handful of games.\n\nHouston's 2023 season was cut short after he suffered a pedal ankle fracture in Week 2 against the Seattle Seahawks. He underwent tightrope surgery, which ended his season.\n\nIf we're being optimistic, this injury gave Houston a chance to catch up on the mental side of the game. That's why Lions fans are optimistic that Houston can have a larger impact if he can return healthy in 2024.\n\nJames Houston has a chance to become a dangerous situational pass rusher for the Lions as long as he can stay healthy. If Detroit gets what they're hoping for from Houston, their defense will become all the more ferocious.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors":

The first move in that effort was acquiring Carlton Davis from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. They also got sixth-round picks this year and next in the deal, while sending a 2024 third-round pick to Tampa Bay.\n\nDavis, as a top-notch man coverage corner, appears to be an ideal fit for what Lions defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn wants to do. There are durability concerns, as he has missed four of more games in three straight seasons. His level of play has fallen some in line with that, after he was second in the league in pass breakups in both 2019 and 2020.\n\nDavis is in the final year of his contract, and a change of scenery is probably good for him. This, albeit with no football having been played yet, looks to be a good trade for both sides.\n\nIt's a practical requirement to grade trades immediately after they happen, and we certainly had a lofty one for the Davis trade from a Lions' angle. As training camps start around the league, Tony Catalina of Pro Football Network looked back at the offseason to grade the best and worst NFL trades.\n\nCatalina has the Lions' trade for Davis among his five worst offseason trades, with a grade of C+. It is clearly a grade of the Lions' side of the deal.\n\n\"The Lions are a good football team that was close to a Super Bowl appearance last season. So, it makes sense for them to attack what many view as a weak spot by adding veteran CB Carlton Davis.\n\n\"However, Davis has been an oft-injured player over the last few years, and 2023 wasn't his best statistical year.\"\n\n\"Maybe a change of scenery will do him good, but with Detroit's approach to free agency and the draft, they may have been better served giving a younger guy a shot at winning a job.\"\n\nDavis will turn 28 late in the coming season (Dec. 31), so any attempt to classify him as old is a reach. He's got experience, up to and including a Super Bowl ring, and the Lions needed someone with that kind of resume after things didn't quite work out in the rebuild of their cornerback depth chart the year before.\n\nDavis has to play in games and remove the Cameron Sutton on-field PTSD from the psyche of Lions' fans. So it's fair to be a little skeptical of him until that happens, if it happens. But a C+ plus grade lands a little light compared to every other grade of the deal that has been done, when nothing meaningful has happened since it happened.", "source": {"uri": "sidelionreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SideLion Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlton_Davis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlton Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Glenn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Glenn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Depth chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Sutton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Sutton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3872,h_2178,x_0,y_103/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/53/01j3gtpr99d0t63bjw11.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753907", "eventUri": "eng-9753907", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-31", "textStart": 1996, "textEnd": 2003}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

No need to rehash how the second half went, but the dynamic has changed with the Lions now the proverbial \"hunted\" rather than the \"hunter.\"\n\nThis spring, head coach Dan Campbell noted the challenge heading into this season.\n\n\"I mentioned this last year and I'll say it again: It's going to take a lot more than it did last year to get to where we were,\" Campbell said. \"That's just the nature of how it goes. But we're going to be more than capable of doing that. Things got to go your way, but it does start with you. It starts with those players, starts with the coaches. We've got to put the work in.\"\n\nPutting in the work will not be an issue for the Lions, be it coaches or players. They are embracing the expectations around them, and they expect to deliver. But as they emerge from their own lackluster franchise history, there's a piece of conference history working against them.\n\nAs part of his training camp preview, Dave Birkett of the Detroit Free Press noted the history of recent NFC runner-ups the following season.\n\nNo NFC runner-up has gone on to win the Super Bowl the next season since the Green Bay Packers in 1996. The Packers lost to the Dallas Cowboys in the 1995 NFC title game, then they beat the Bill Parcells, Drew Bledsoe-led New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXI after the 1996 season.\n\nBefore last year's 49ers, no NFC team that lost in the previous year's conference championship game had advanced to the Super Bowl since the 49ers also did it under Jim Harbaugh in 2012. Of the 10 NFC runners-up from 2012-2021, five failed to make the playoffs. Campbell was on the New Orleans Saints' coaching staff when they lost the NFC Championship Game in 2018 then lost their first playoff game in 2019.\n\nThis is the kind of thing that, should they be aware of it, will further motivate the Lions this season. But there's no denying nearly 30 years of NFC runner-ups failing to take the next step to win the Super Bowl the following year, with many not reaching the conference title game that following year.", "source": {"uri": "sidelionreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SideLion Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dan Campbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Free_Press", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Free Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Parcells", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Parcells"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl XXXI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Harbaugh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Harbaugh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Saints"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3630,h_2041,x_0,y_81/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/53/01j3e23k5cs5fgn2c8s8.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753907", "eventUri": "eng-9753907", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

There are a couple that are easy to point to be or be concerned about, and wide receiver is a prominent one that's hard to ignore right now.\n\nAmon-Ra St. Brown is the top guy for the Lions at wide receiver. After him, the Lions are putting a lot of faith in Jameson Williams putting it all together this year. Kalif Raymond is a solid player, with Donovan Peoples-Jones and second-year man Antoine Green also set to compete for a role.\n\nFor many national analysts, it's baffling that the Lions did not add a wide receiver of note after losing Josh Reynolds in free agency. Wild ideas about trading for Brandon Aiyuk don't make sense, and prominent remaining free agent possibilities (Michael Thomas, Hunter Renfrow) feel like a stretch too.\n\nPro Football Focus suggested acquiring outside wide receiver help as the the move the Lions should make before training camp, while mentioning Aiyuk, Tee Higgins and Davante Adams as possible options.\n\n\"Still, Detroit needs a true outside receiver. The free-agent market doesn't offer much in that archetype, but could the Lions be a potential landing spot for Brandon Aiyuk, Tee Higgins or Davante Adams?\"\n\n-Pro Football Focus\n\nDallas Robinson of Pro Football Network has offered a list of 10 potential training camp trades. On the list is the following proposal involving the Lions.\n\nLions acquire: WR Darius Slayton\n\nGiants acquire: 2025 sixth-round pick\n\n\"Darius Slayton would be an upgrade over Kalif Raymond at Detroit's other outside WR spot. He's spent most of his career on the perimeter, which would allow St. Brown to stay in the slot in 11 personnel. He's hardly a star, but Slayton has posted 700 receiving yards in four of his five NFL seasons.\"\n\n\"New York might be willing to trade Slayton after using the sixth overall pick on WR Malik Nabers in April. While Big Blue placated Slayton by adding new incentives to his contract in May, moving him would open new opportunities for younger receivers like Wan'Dale Robinson and Jalin Hyatt.\"\n\nSlayton got a contract adjustment from the Giants after he didn't show up for voluntary offseason work this spring. That absence fueled a little trade speculation. A connection to the Lions has been easy to offer, within the idea the cost in a trade would be cheap.\n\nSlayton's has largely overcome the ineptitude of the offense and quarterback play around him in New York. He has topped 720 yards in four of five seasons, while averaging at least 15 yards in those same four campaigns. Last season, he accounted for 25 percent of the team's touchdown receptions (four).\n\nSlayton has untapped upside if he were ever in a consistently good offense.

After an offseason full of additions and hype, the organization has high hopes for 2024.\n\nAmong other reasons, the Lions have unprecedented continuity in a league full of turnover and changes. Detroit held onto both of its coordinators despite head coaching interest and signed three core players to contract extensions.\n\nAs a result, the Lions have much of the same core in place that made a run to the NFC Championship game last year. Coach Dan Campbell has high expectations for his team, and hopes the squad will hit the ground running.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153To me, we should be so much further. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not gonna be mistakes, but we should look so much crisper than that,\" Campbell said. \"Not even close. We should pick up where we left off in the spring with OTAs, is really how I see it. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just an example of it. You should feel like we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re ready to go play right now. Now, is it good enough? No, it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be good enough and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we have camp. But yet, man, it should, from the outside looking in, like these guys could go play right now. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we expect.\u00e2\u20ac\u00c2\n\nAll eyes on Jameson Williams\n\nOne of the biggest storylines surrounding Lions' camp in 2024 will be the development of Jameson Williams. After limited contributions in his first two seasons, the 2022 12th overall pick has the opportunity to step into a bigger role this season.\n\nWilliams has drawn plenty of praise from Campbell and the Lions' coaching staff throughout the spring. After much of the input from coaches came with tempered expectations last year, Campbell called him the most improved player at the start of OTAs.\n\nThe praise has also come from teammates. In a recent podcast appearance, safety Ifeatu Melifonwu noted that Williams looks as fast as he ever has leading into the upcoming season.\n\nIt was a tough start to the day for him, though, as he vomited several times at the start of practice and briefly left. He explained at the end of practice that he had simply consumed the wrong thing for breakfast.\n\nThe Alabama product showed off his defining trait during an early team period. Jared Goff hit him on a deep pass, and the wideout looked fast on an efficient route to haul in the toss. Overall, he looked stronger and more explosive in his performance.\n\n\"He just looks more comfortable. He looks like he's done this before,\" Amon-Ra St. Brown said. \"He looks like he knows what to expect. He's not that young, rookie guy no more. He's been here for a few years. Every year he just gets more comfortable. I know I've been saying this every year, but I think he's gotten better every year and I think this year's gonna be huge for him. I can't wait.\"\n\nHendon Hooker's improvements\n\nAfter an up-and-down spring, Hendon Hooker had a strong day. The Tennessee product underwent adjustments to his footwork in the spring in an effort to better acclimate to Ben Johnson's offensive scheme that is based around timing.\n\nOn Wednesday, his passes looked sharp. During 7-on-7 drills, he connected on a strike with Daurice Fountain toward the right sideline. His delivery looked quicker, and the ball jumped out of his hand. Later in the drill, he also hit on a crisp toss to Jalon Calhoun toward the left sideline.\n\nHooker attacked his craft in the break between OTAs and camp. Among other things, he spent time with former Lions backup Teddy Bridgewater working on various nuances of development.\n\n\"We just really worked on timing and really taking control of the huddle, which I did a pretty good job of today,\" Hooker said. \"Once I calmed down, I had some jitters the first reps in team today. Once I calmed down and got my rhythm, I felt good.\"\n\nHis timing on passes looked much improved, as evidenced by an efficient delivery to Kalif Raymond. Hooker will still have to compete for the backup job with Nate Sudfeld, who returns for his third season with the organization.\n\nSudfeld had a nice connection with Calhoun on a deep throw, splitting Steven Gilmore and Kindle Vildor in the process. However, he also had a pass dropped by Antoine Green, who was covered by Ennis Rakestraw, and had another throw in the direction of Tom Kennedy broken up by Vildor.\n\nHutchinson's dominant energy\n\nAll signs are pointing to another big step forward for defensive end Aidan Hutchinson in his third NFL season. The Michigan product emerged as a force last season, which led to increased attention from opposing offenses in 2023.\n\nThough the team's practice was non-contact, Hutchinson looked the part of a dominant player on Wednesday. At one point in practice, he burst through the line on three straight plays. Had the practice been with pads, all three plays would've caused problems for the offense.\n\nCoaches complete up-downs\n\nCampbell and defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn participated in the team's annual up-down ritual, completing the necessary 40 with the defensive unit at the start of Wednesday's practice.\n\nThis is a yearly tradition for the Lions, who utilize the drill as an initiation leading into the start of the season.\n\nAdditionally, members of the offense and defense were wearing the guardian caps that have become a staple of training camp. Worn atop the helmet, these are designed for protection and to limit head injuries.\n\nPost-practice work\n\nSt. Brown has set the standard for the receiver room with his post-practice work on the JUGS machine. Hauling in 202 passes each day, the USC product is relentless with his work.\n\nOn the first day of camp, several players got work in on the machine following the conclusion of practice. Undrafted rookie wideouts Isaiah Williams and Jalon Calhoun, along with veteran Kalif Raymond and running back Sione Vaki, took turns catching passes from the machine.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jameson_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jameson Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Campbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendon_Hooker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hendon Hooker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin_flipping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coin flipping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifeatu_Melifonwu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ifeatu Melifonwu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amon-Ra_St._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amon-Ra St. Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Goff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jared Goff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Formation (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Green", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antoine Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aidan_Hutchinson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aidan Hutchinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalif_Raymond", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kalif Raymond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Sudfeld", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nate Sudfeld"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Glenn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Glenn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_helmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football helmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussions_in_American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Concussions in American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Bridgewater", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teddy Bridgewater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John F.

It took a journey halfway around the world for the Norfolkan to receive it.\n\nSweigard and his wife, Kelly, attended the 106th Lions International Convention from June 21-25.\n\nLeon Sweigard, a Norfolk Lions Club member, was inaugurated at the First Vice District Governors/District Governors-Elect seminar during the four-day event. Sweigard was one of 750 district governors recognized at the event.\n\nAbout 11,000 people from 208 countries attended the convention from across the world.\n\n\"It's pretty awesome for the Lions Club to put on such an event internationally,\" Kelly Sweigard said.\n\nLeon Sweigard has been a member of the Norfolk chapter of the Lions Club for the past 26 years. He is in his sixth year serving in a leadership role.\n\nThe recognition of district governor was only the most recent honor Leon Sweigard has received. Earlier this year, he was a recipient of the Melvin Jones award. Jones founded the Lions organization in 1917.\n\nDuring the trip, the Sweigards attended several more convention events, interacted with other Lions from around the world and even learned more about the Australian culture.\n\nBefore arriving in Australia, Sweigard was one of 14 Lions members from Nebraska attending the convention.\n\n\"When we went there, we had a lot of familiar faces,\" Leon Sweigard said. \"All of the sudden, you are in a different country halfway across the world, but you are with a group of people that made it very relaxing.\"\n\nInteracting with other Lions Club members from throughout the world was interesting for the Sweigards. At the beginning of the convention, they were presented with a translation box.\n\nThe Sweigards met the newly installed international president, Fabricio Oliveira of Brazil.\n\n\"If there was an international speaker who didn't speak your language, you had a setting to hear it in your language,\" Kelly Sweigard said. \"We had an opportunity to speak with a gentleman from France, and we used our phones to interact. Everybody was willing to do it. It was just neat that they want to converse with you and will use the tools to do it.\"\n\nSweigard and his wife went to a sanctuary 31 miles outside of Melbourne. There, they could see the koala bears and kangaroos. They also got to see how Australians raise their own food and how the animals were fed.\n\nTheir agriculture consists primarily of Brussels sprouts, strawberries, cherries and apple orchards.\n\n\"Their apple orchards are netted from top-to-side because they don't want blemishes on the food because it lowers the price,\" Leon Sweigard said. \"That's why they put netting over the apple orchards to stop the animals and the hail.\"\n\nThe kangaroo population is similar to the deer population in the United States.\n\nDay three of the convention featured a parade. The event was held on a 56-degree day in the heart of winter.

I have a depth chart for every team with their 2023 Field Vision Sports HAVOC rankings and scores. Projected rookie starters will receive the league average HAVOC for that position. Notable losses are located in the upper left-hand corner. Click on the picture to expand for a better look.\n\nWhat is HAVOC? I wanted to create a metric that better understood how defenders play within their scheme. For the D-line and LBs, it is pretty straightforward. Can you fit the run and create a pass rush? For LBs and some Edges, coverages have also been added.\n\nRelated Content: Field Vision Sports - Introducing Havoc Ratings\n\nIn the secondary, it can get complicated. Not every team runs the same amount of coverage. Some, like Dan Quinn, Jim Schwartz, and Gus Bradley, live in a singular style of play, while others, namely Mike Macdonald and Vic Fangio, choose to play a multitude of coverages. I wanted to create a more nuanced way to look at DB play. How are they playing within man and zone schemes, and how diverse is their coverage palate?\n\nUtilizing HAVOC, which is biased towards player and scheme usage, we can better understand how these players are used within the ecosystem they play in. A great example is Seattle's Riq Woolen, one of the best man coverage CBs in the game but struggles at zone. Team-wise, the Browns have three CBs that excel at man coverage, which suits what DC Schwartz is trying to do.\n\nHAVOC allows us to track free agency signings and paint a better picture of their fit. Should the Commanders, who will play mainly man and 3-match coverages, bring in a zone-centric CB? No, that wouldn't be wise. Using HAVOC allows us to see how teams are building their rosters defensively. So remember, these numbers show how productive the player was in the scheme they played in last year, which is reflected against their peers in their overall ranking.\n\nRelated Content: The Power of Evaluating Players using Play-by-Play Data\n\nThe ratings in this article are my 'raw' Havoc scores.

With projections hitting $17 trillion - that's 9 Amazons - the potential is huge. But here's the deal: sharp investors who are ahead of the game have the opportunity to invest in a company poised for domination. Thanks to The Motley Fool, you can access the full story in this exclusive report.\n\n\" Unlock the secrets of tomorrow's tech revolution now.\n\nThe Lions shocked everyone the first week of last season when they came out and beat the Chiefs at home. From that point forward, Detroit had put everyone on notice. Fast-forward to the end of the season, and the Lions were NFC North divisional champs and headed to the playoffs, even winning a playoff game. All things that had not happened since the early '90s.\n\nMost pundits focus on the offense, but Detroit's defense has quietly had a resurgence. The previous year ('22) was a disaster in the secondary, but embattled defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn made a few tweaks in playcalling to alleviate issues there. Adding Quarters to a Cover 1 dominant scheme was a boon for the Lions all year, and it gave Detriot more answers and a layered approach.\n\nThe scheme is Nickel-based (68%/4-2-5) and mainly closed-post in the secondary. When in Base (27%), Detroit is multiple, able to align in a 3-4 or 4-3 depending on the game plan, but typically their alignment looked like a traditional 3-4. Derrick Barnes (LB19) or DE John Cominsky (DL37) came in to create the Lions Base. Barnes could moonlight as an Edge. Besides production in the back end, the most significant difference from '22 to '23 was the emergence of a Quarters scheme.\n\nThe '22 season saw the Lions sit atop the Cover 1 usage leaderboard at 30% of its calls. Detroit complemented that with Cover 3 at a similar rate. The secondary couldn't handle the heat.\n\nIn '23, Glenn came out against the Chiefs running Quarters on over 30% of their calls. Not every team got that treatment, though. The Vikings, for instance, only saw a few snaps of the coverage. Still, Glenn's ability to at least usher in change gave the Lions a much-needed boost on defense.\n\nOverall, the unit was still average in stopping the pass, so this offseason, the Lions went out and got Buccanners' CB Carlton Davis III (CB36) and drafted CB Terrion Arnold of Alabama. Both CBs excel in man coverage and have the coverage diversity to play Quarters. Glenn still wants to play man coverage but needs the CBs to do it.\n\nLast year, Detroit had the highest DVOA against the rush, yet still went out and got DJ Reader (DL34). The Lions are also banking on former Vikings first-round pick Marcus Davenport to have a bounce-back year after an injury cut his '23 season short. Glenn wants to live in 'sub' packages that feature man and man-match coverages, and several big splash off-season moves illustrate that philosophy. There are no more excuses for Glenn.\n\nSay what you want about Aidan Hutchinson (ED2), but the kid can rush the passer. He still needs to develop against the run to make him more of a complete player. Most of his production has come without much help from the opposite Edge. The hope is that Davenport or James Houston (or a combination of both) can give Hutchinson support.\n\nInside, the team signed DJ Reader, arguably one of the best Noses in the league. Alim McNeal (DL32) was productive last year at the 3 technique. DE Cominsky is a workhorse and will come in when the Lions want to run a 3-4 or Penny (5-1) package as the 3 tech. opposite McNeal. He can also play the 'big' 5 tech. in certain four-down packages.\n\nThe run-stopping ability of the Lions should continue with this group. More importantly, the Edge opposite of Hutchinson has to start showing up. Most teams will want to double Reader, allowing the other D-linemen to work their one-on-ones.\n\nThe Lions finished fifth in pressure rate but were 24th in average time to pressure. Reader should give the Edges better looks, and Detriot desperately needs Davenport or Houston to start playing ball opposite Hutchinson. It's not enough to stop the run in the modern NFL.\n\nAlex Anzalone (LB12) has quietly become one of the better LBs in the NFL. The Lions use him in various ways, and he is the solo backer in the team's Penny package (5-1). As a Will, or $-backer, he is mainly tasked with blitzing or defending the RB. His ability to stop the run is a bonus.\n\nJack Campbell (LB68) was drafted to be a traditional Mike or box LB; for the most part, he didn't disappoint. Campbell can hold down the box while Anzalone is used as a chess piece to create pressure of mismatches. The coverage aspect of Campbell will need to take another step this year to bring Detroit's defense into the top 10.\n\nLast year young Safety duo of Kerby Joseph (S50) and Ifeatu Melifonwu (S16). Melifonwu, in particular, had a knack for making plays as a pass rusher and the added value of being able to defend TEs when needed. Joseph has the potential to continue to grow in this system. Both need to become more competent in man coverage, but in true Lions fashion, they are both solid against the run.\n\nThe CB room will look completely different from the '23 version. Both starters, Jerry Jacobs (CB 72) and Cameron Sutton (CB59) are gone. The Lions traded for Buccaneers' CB Carlton Davis to replace them and drafted Terrion Arnold. Both CBs are man-coverage defenders and can play Quarters and Cover 3. Look at the CB spot if you want to see where Glenn and the Lions' brass heads are.\n\nFinally, the Lions have arguably the best Slot defender in all of football. Brian Branch instantly upgraded the defense and gave Detroit an every-down defender in one of the most critical positions in modern football. The rookie finished near the top of the DB charts in tackles for loss (TFLs) and second in picks by a rookie.\n\nGive it to Detroit for understanding that they need to solidify the secondary to win a championship. If Arnold can produce and Joseph continues to grow alongside Melifonwu, the secondary has the potential to take a significant leap.\n\nUnique Insights for Professionals, Proven predictions for fans.

Several pieces on defense are standouts, but they are potholed with players that seem not to be able to get over the hump. Tampa runs a 3-4 multiple defense that traditionally has run a lot of Cover 1.\n\nOver the past few seasons, Bowles has maintained his pressure-heavy scheme but has shifted his coverage palette to be more diverse, mainly playing zones. Up front, the team can easily transition from their base 3-4 into Nickel (4-2-5) with ease because of their two inside LBs and tough interior D-line.\n\nThat might not be the case this year, as longtime LB Devin White (LB34) will depart for greener pastures in Philly. The duo of White and Lavonate David (LB6) has always been one of the best in the NFL. The transition away from White shows how the NFL economy has shifted away from LBs as a priority in free agency.\n\nOne of the most significant additions to this year's team will be Jets Safety Jordan Whitehead (S26), whom the Bucs let walk several seasons ago. Once he hit the market this offseason, Tampa brought him back to work. Antoine Winfield Jr. (S2), who was an All-Pro last year, has quickly become one of the best Safety in the league. Pairing him with Whitehead gives the Bucs a dynamic backend.\n\nBowles has shown a knack for evolving his scheme to fit the needs of those on the roster. Last year, Tampa was second in the NFL in blitz rate, right behind the Vikings. The transition to zone is on par with others around the league. Bowles is banking on some personnel changes to bolster the defense and get it back into the top 10.\n\nInside is where the Buccaneers have the potential to be truly special. Nose Vita Vea (DL14) is a freak and, when healthy, is a one-of-one player. Last year's 1st-round draft pick, Calijah Kancey (DL27), showed flashes of greatness. The combination of Vea and Klancey gives the Bucs flexibility to hop from 3-4 to Ni without losing much production. DE Logan Hall (DL90) needs to begin showing up in production, though, or he could potentially see his way out the door.\n\nAt Edge, rookie Chris Braswell will be inserted into the fray to provide juice. Tampa lost Shaq Barrett (ED33) but hopes the addition of the Bama star can push players like Joe Tryon-Shoyinka (ED63) to begin playing up to their draft slot. Tryon-Shoyinka has shown sparks, but the Buccaneers opted not to take his 5th Year Option. He will be playing for his contract this fall.\n\nYaya Diaby (ED91) is in the same situation as JTS. The pressure is on for the young Edges. Tampa signed Randy Gregory (ED84) to provide depth, but he is currently AWOL from camp. If there is one group in the Tampa defense that has major question marks, it is the Edge group. Braswell has a clean slate and ample opportunity to earn a starting job before the season begins.\n\nGone is White, but David is still there to hold down the second level of the defense. A complete LB, David will create pressure if the Edges aren't up for the job. The Bucs blitzed so much last year because of the lack of pressure from outside.\n\nOpposite David will be KJ Britt (LB42), who shadowed White last year. The Tampa front office felt that he played well enough that the team could move on from White. Britt is good in the box and should allow Bowles to use David as a chess piece, moving him around to create mismatches or pressure.\n\nTo start the 2024 season, the Buccaneers might have the best Safety duo in football. The combination of Winfield and Whitehead is back, and both excel in zone schemes. The duo's pressure will be on to help keep a cap on the secondary, as the CBs are more of a question mark.\n\nWinfield was an elite do-everything workhorse as a pass rusher and one of the best run-stopping safeties in '23. He also dominated Cover 1 and Cover 3, which are the preferred coverages of Bowles.\n\nWhitehead will bring another dimension back into the secondary. A hybrid safety, Whitehead can be used as a tool opposite Winfield, who has an extensive background as a Nickel defender. Together, the two can act as counterweights in Bowles' scheme.\n\nAfter Carlton Davis's departure to the Lions, the CB duo will be Jamel Dean (CB25) and Zyon McCollum (CB56). Behind those two, there is no form of production. Whereas the Edge group has question marks centered around the lack of production, the CB questions center on a lack of depth.\n\nDean and McCullum are serviceable CBs, but there is no depth if one is injured. The only depth provided this offseason was the drafting of Tyreke Smith as a Ni/Safety hybrid, not a CB. Christian Izien (Ni24) is better suited as the slot, especially with Winfield earning the right to play Safety full time.", "source": {"uri": "matchquarters.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Anything less than a deep playoff run would be disappointing.\n\nThere's the massive crowd of reporters: The press room was so packed, it was standing room only.\n\nThere's the double-decker bleachers installed at the practice field: Demand has grown so big just to watch practice that the Lions added stands with an upper deck.\n\nSeriously. The podium in the press room got all big and bulky, looking like it had spent the offseason working out.\n\nCoach Dan Campbell stood behind it and for the first time in his life he actually looked small.\n\n\"This is a huge podium,\" he quipped.\n\nRemember, back in the day, when you could \"super-size\" a pop at McDonald's? That's what has happened here -- this podium has been super-sized (and splashed with the Meijer corporate logo).\n\nThen again, everything around this team has been super-sized -- starting with a mountain of hope and belief -- so why not the podium?\n\nMaybe it was fitting that Campbell looked smaller behind that podium.\n\nBecause something else has changed behind the scenes. There was a time when he had to be not just the face of the team, but the soul. He had to teach an entire roster about grit and attitude and culture, imposing himself on everything while gritting his teeth over mistakes and misalignments.\n\nBut this team has evolved to the next stage. It's now a player-driven team, which is the best kind.\n\n\"Yeah, look this is their team,\" Campbell said, while listing several key leaders. \"We set the standards a long time ago, but now as players, you guys control it. So if it's not up to your standards, well, it needs to be said and let's do it again: You guys control it. We shouldn't have to worry about that anymore. That's on them. That's what I want, that's what I expect.\"\n\nTHE GOALS: Priority No. 1 for Lions at start of training camp? Avoid complacency\n\nRarely did a ball hit the ground. Quarterback Jared Goff was particularly impressive and particularly efficient.\n\nEverybody was moving and hustling between drills. It was like a well-oiled machine.\n\nSo, I asked running back David Montgomery about it: \"Did this feel pretty crisp and clean?\"\n\nAnd in keeping with the theme, that comment is actually huge.\n\nMonstrous, really.\n\nIf you think this team will rest on its laurels, much less its appearance in the NFC championship game, you don't know Campbell.\n\nMore importantly, you don't understand how they have built this team.\n\n\"Your own worst enemy is yourself,\" Campbell said from behind that giant podium. \"It's not anybody else, it's really not the opponent, it's always going to be yourself. So, we're always going to have to guard against -- I'll bring it up again, the complacency, the entitlement, the reputation. Like, 'What is that? That's nothing. We've got to go back to work.' \"\n\nThey might not win as many games as last year -- you never know what will happen in any given season with injuries, crazy bounces, last-second drives or anything else that can go wrong in the NFL. (See: The last 60 years of the Lions franchise.)\n\nBut I seriously doubt it will be because of complacency.\n\n\"We don't live off reputation, we live off of work,\" Campbell said. \"And that's what's gotten us where we're at, it's been a long, hard road to get to where we're at right now, and there's a price to be paid, and so we've got to go pay it again. That's the message, and it'll always be the message.\"\n\nDAVE BIRKETT: With familiar faces everywhere, Lions at 'Level 401' entering training camp\n\nLions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson stopped everything.\n\nJohnson moved a wide receiver a few yards closer to the sideline, and it felt like a little thing that was actually a big thing.\n\nThose tiny details will determine everything.\n\n\"You should feel like we're ready to go play right now,\" Campbell said. \"Now, is it good enough? No, it won't be good enough, that's why we have camp. But yeah, man, it should -- from the outside looking in, like, 'Man, these guys could go play right now.' And that's what I expect.\"\n\nAfter the first practice was done, about 40 players stayed on the field, putting in extra work.\n\nIf nothing else, that is a reflection of everything that Campbell has infused into this team.\n\n\"We're not going to lose our identity,\" Campbell said. \"That is the most important thing to me, and I won't sacrifice it for anyone or anything. I told the team that and they know that.\"\n\nDuring the extra practice after the practice, Goff threw a ball to Jameson Williams, who had a fantastic practice, looking fast, strong and confident.\n\nI think it was the first time all day that they didn't connect.\n\nA short time later, Goff threw a ball to Williams -- again -- and this time, he turned it into a thing of beauty.\n\nWilliams kind of flipped upside down, holding onto the ball -- and in the background, Goff threw up both arms in celebration. Remember, this all happened after practice.\n\n\"He's not that young rookie guy anymore,\" fellow wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown said. \"He's been here for a few years. Every year he just gets more comfortable. And I know I've been saying this every year, but I think I'm he's gotten better every year, obviously. But this I think this year is gonna be huge for him.\"\n\nHere's my first big prediction: Williams is gonna have a monstrous season. (Yes, that word keeps coming up around this team.)\n\n\"We all know he's fast,\" St. Brown said. \"He just looks more comfortable. He looks like he's done this before. He looks like he knows what to expect.\"\n\nOne last point.\n\nEven though this was the first official practice, nothing about this felt like a start.", "source": {"uri": "freep.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Detroit Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Campbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "McDonald's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Park,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allen Park, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Allen Park, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Montgomery_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Montgomery (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Goff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jared Goff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soul music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jameson_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jameson Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amon-Ra_St._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amon-Ra St. Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Team_Building", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Team Building", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/24/PDTF/74528571007-lions-072424-es-07.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2399,1351,x0,y7&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753907", "eventUri": "eng-9753907", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

It should be noted that he missed the first four contests due to a gambling suspension.\n\nWith an increased role, the team hopes he can step up significantly for a team that was one game away from the Super Bowl.\n\nAlso Read: Lions Deal WR Jameson Williams To NFC Rival In Blockbuster Trade Proposal That Would Shake Up The NFL Playoff Race", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darrelle_lincoln@totalprosports.com", "name": "Darrelle Lincoln", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jameson_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jameson Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amon-Ra_St._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amon-Ra St. Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North America", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Special_Needs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Special Needs", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Alumni", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Alumni", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Associations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1968553744-1-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753907", "eventUri": "eng-9753907", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

He started to Goff's right and made a beeline up the seam and angled for the opposite pylon, blowing past rookie Ennis Rakestraw and Ifeatu Melifonwu to get open for a bomb of a touchdown pass from Goff.\n\nOn his way back to the huddle, though, Williams puked and reportedly told MLive on his way off the field that he had eaten the wrong thing for breakfast. He wasn't involved much in the later portions of practice, which was generally a light day for many players; All-Pro Amon-Ra St. Brown, for example, only had one catch during the day.\n\n\u25b6 The limited practice production from St. Brown and Williams provided an opportunity for a few other players to shine. Undrafted rookie Jalon Calhoun made a pair of nice catches, including a deep ball over the middle from Nate Sudfeld that he caught over Steven Gilmore. Daurice Fountain, who was with the team's practice squad for much of last season, also made some noise, with a high-point catch from Hendon Hooker near the sideline being the highlight of his day.\n\n\u25b6 Hendon Hooker showed some positive developments during the spring portion of the offseason, but it was noticeable that he had some room to grow before the Lions could feel comfortable throwing him out there in a pinch. Wednesday, Hooker looked far more decisive than he did at any point during OTAs and minicamp.\n\nAfter scrambling under duress and sailing a pass to Kalif Raymond in the first set of team drills, Hooker settled down and was on the money for the rest of practice. He went 4-for-4 in the ensuing seven-on-seven drills, including a few difficult throws near the sideline and over the middle of the field. He extended that success into his next set of 11-on-11 work, going 3-for-3 with a variety of throws.\n\n\u25b6 While it's typical this time of year for the defense to be ahead of the offense, that was not the case Wednesday. The Lions' offense was firing on all cylinders; call it a benefit of bringing pretty much everybody (including offensive coordinator Ben Johnson) back from last season. In addition to Hooker's success, Goff started his day 3-for-3 and missed just one pass the rest of practice, firing incomplete to Raymond on an out route in his final set of 11-on-11. One of the more notable defensive wins of the day came from cornerback Kindle Vildor, who had a nice breakup on a throw to Tom Kennedy.", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aidan_Hutchinson", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aidan Hutchinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alim_McNeill", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alim McNeill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Goff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jared Goff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Bears_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brown Bears football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jameson_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jameson Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendon_Hooker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hendon Hooker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifeatu_Melifonwu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ifeatu Melifonwu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penei_Sewell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penei Sewell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amon-Ra_St._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amon-Ra St. Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Sudfeld", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nate Sudfeld"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huddle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Huddle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalif_Raymond", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kalif Raymond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_squad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Practice squad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_scramble", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback scramble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mini-camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John F.

I'm not sure that's something anyone could have imagined just a few years ago.\n\nWhat is one of the best attributes about Campbell? The man is incredibly high-energy, and he hasn't lost a step going into 2024.\n\nCampbell is notorious for getting in on the training during practice. After all, the man spent 10 years on different active NFL rosters. He loves the game. It's a part of who he is, and that includes getting the heart pumping during training camp.\n\nTo the surprise of nobody, Campbell was ripping up-downs with the team Wednesday. Check out the awesome video below, and let me know your thoughts at David.Hookstead@outkick.com.\n\nHow big of a football guy is Dan Campbell? Not only is he doing up-downs with the team, but he also appears to be wearing a compression sleeve on his leg. Are you not entertained?\n\nImagine any other coach in the league showing up to not just do up downs, but make sure his leg is stabilized while doing so. You probably can't, and I don't blame you.\n\nCampbell seems to think he's 28-years old - not a couple years short of 50. Yet, that's the energy and passion that has resulted in players and fans completely buying in.\n\nHe wants to get in the trenches with his guys. Hell, if he was allowed to wear pads and get in a game, he probably would. After all, we are talking about the man who seriously tried to get a live lion roaming Detroit's sideline.\n\nAs a Lions fan, I've never been more excited for a season than I am for the one starting in September. This Lions team has the pieces, Campbell has proven the team can win under him and it's now time to find out just how far the Lions can go.

All four teams have a chance to develop into winners in the 2024 season, and one of those teams could emerge as the NFC's Super Bowl representative at the season's conclusion.\n\nMake no mistake about it, there is definitely a pecking order and the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers have a clearer path than the Chicago Bears or Minnesota Vikings, but all four teams could have memorable seasons.\n\nEach team has strengths that could propel them to help them perform in a dynamic way. In this piece, we will identify the greatest strength that each of these teams has to offer.\n\nThe Lions know that it's what's up front that counts. Quarterback Jared Goff is a wonderful story who has risen to his greatest heights in Detroit, and Amon-Ra St. Brown has established himself as one of the toughest wideouts in the league. Tight end Sam LaPorta caught 86 passes in his rookie season and he has no limitations as he goes forward.\n\nBut no position group is stronger than the offensive line. Dan Campbell talked about his team's Super Bowl aspirations in the offseason, and that's because the Lions have a group of blockers who can just take over. Right tackle Penei Sewell was a first-team All-Pro last season and he may be the best blocker in the league. Frank Ragnow is nearly as good at center and was also an All-Pro. Left tackle Taylor Decker is just a notch or two below those two, and right guard Graham Glasgow is quite solid. The Lions added right guard Kevin Zeitler in the offseason, and the former Raven is one of the best pass blockers in the league.\n\nWhen the game is on the line in the fourth quarter, look for this group to take over.\n\nThere is no position group on the Packers that can match the Lions' excellence on the offensive line, but Jordan Love has a chance to become one of the game's elite quarterbacks. Is it unfair that the Packers have a QB progression of Brett Favre, Aaron Rodgers and now Love? That's a question for another day, even if Bears fans curse their fate as they consider this issue on an every-day basis.\n\nLove had a brilliant first year as the team's QB1. He completed 409 of 634 passes for 4,625 yards with a 98.5 passer rating along with 28 touchdown passes and 13 interceptions. As good as his regular season was, he was significantly better in the playoffs. He eviscerated the Dallas Cowboys by completing 16 of 21 passes for 272 yards and 3 touchdowns while keeping it clean on the interception side of the ledger.\n\nLove is expecting to get a contract extension from the Packers before the end of training camp, and he should get it. He is conducting a \"hold-in,\" and says he won't practice until he gets a new contract. While his sample size is not huge, his peak efforts are sensational and most expect him to get a deal that will put him in the neighborhood of Joe Burrow and Trevor Lawrence.\n\n\"He'll get paid,\" an agent told The Athletic. \"Love is young and has been in that building for several years. He showed that the playoff stage wasn't too big for him and never complained about sitting. I can't see why they wouldn't make him the highest-paid quarterback or close to it.\"\n\nLove carries the hopes and dreams of the Packers on his shoulders.\n\nThe Bears are banking on No. 1 draft choice Caleb Williams having a brilliant rookie season and leading the team out of the abyss the team has been in for years. That's a scary proposition because the adjustment to the NFL is rarely as smooth as C.J. Stroud made it look last year with the Houston Texans. It is usually much closer to the way 2023 No. 1 draft choice Bryce Young played with the Carolina Panthers last season.\n\nWhile Williams will have to answer questions, he does have a group of elite receivers waiting for him to develop. D.J. Moore is the holdover and he is coming off a brilliant 96-1,034-8 season that showed off his toughness as well as his all-around skill. Keenan Allen established himself as one of the best technical receivers during his run with the Los Angeles Chargers. Allen says rookie Rome Odunze is further ahead in his development than he was as a rookie. This is a group that can dominate on an every-week basis.\n\nThis brings us to the Vikings, and this team will have the biggest mountain to climb in order to play winning football. The questions are numerous with a placeholder quarterback in Sam Darnold and a rookie-in-waiting in J.J. McCarthy. Will running back Aaron Jones give the Vikings a lift at the running back slot? Can wideout Jordan Addison build off his impressive rookie season or will off-the-field issues continue to dog him?\n\nBut the Vikings have the best wideout in the league in Justin Jefferson and one of the best left tackles in Christian Darrisaw. Both men have been paid in the most elite fashion and are expected to dominate. Jefferson has shown he can make the biggest and most difficult catches under pressure, while Darrisaw shows off his balance and strength on an every-game basis.\n\nIt's a much bigger hill for the Bears and Vikings than the Lions and the Packers, but all four have a chance to do something special this season.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors":

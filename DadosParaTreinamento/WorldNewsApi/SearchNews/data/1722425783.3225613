She never gave them her address", "text": "A woman is outraged after she says a brand sent her a smart scale that she specifically didn\u2019t order. Not only did she not intentionally give this brand her address, but the item they sent triggered unpleasant memories of her previous eating disorder. TikTok user Cassie (@noclasscasssss) posted a video on Tuesday where she lays out the situation. She starts by stitching another video from May 21 that shows her opening a package that she was unpleasantly surprised to find contained a smart scale from the company Eufy. \u201cOK, so I had taken this video down, not as a kindness to the brand, but because I didn\u2019t want to come on the internet and talk about my eating disorder,\u201d she says. \u201cI had changed my mind about it, so I took the video down, but it\u2019s going back up, and I\u2019m making another one.\u201d Cassie says the reason she changed her mind about posting the video is that she had just received a call from TikTok inquiring about why she hadn\u2019t posted a promotional video for the Eufy product. \u201cI was like, \u2018Happy to talk about it, I\u2019m glad you brought it up,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI just spent like an hour going through and getting all the receipts for you guys.\u201d She says everything started when she got an email with a Google Form about creating influencer content for the brands Pumiey and Shaperx. \u201cBut also in this form, there were a million other things, and I decided I want the Pumiey and I want the Shaperx, and I clicked \u2018don\u2019t want\u2019 on everything else on that form,\u201d Cassie says. \u201cBut I had to, because I clicked \u2018yes\u2019 to two things, I had to provide my name, my phone number, my address. And it went out to all of these brands\u2014not just the people I said \u2018yes\u2019 to.\u201d Unfortunately, it appears that one of the brands, Eufy, misread the form and thought Cassie wanted its product delivered to her home. \u201cWhich wouldn\u2019t, I guess, have been a horrible, big deal, except for the fact that it was a scale, and I\u2019m trying to recover from an eating disorder,\u201d Cassie says. To make matters more annoying, Cassie received a shipping confirmation email from the company. She shows a screenshot of the email, which includes a graphic titled \u201cEufy Smart Scale P3 Viral TikTok Video Creation Guide.\u201d Cassie says, \u201cAnd so I get this email from them on May 16 telling me that my shipment is on the way. I respond, and I say, \u2018Excuse me? I never agreed to this, nor did I provide you with my address.\u2019\u201d The brand responded, \u201cHoney, did you apply.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that the initial email also includes the word \u201choney,\u201d so this may just be a translation error. However, Cassie did not appreciate being called \u201choney\u201d and let them know about it. \u201cDon\u2019t honey me,\u201d she writes in response. \u201cDon\u2019t get sassy with me. I never agreed to this, and I know that to be a fact. I am recovering from an eating disorder and purposefully do not own a scale. Nor would I ever promote owning one.\u201d Eufy\u2019s representative replied, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I understand how you feel, it\u2019s because you requested it before we shipped it to you, if you don\u2019t like it I\u2019ll give you a return code when it arrives, don\u2019t be mad okay.\u201d The exchange continued with Cassie informing them that she\u2019d not only already received the scale but had also posted the video blasting the company for sending it without her permission. She refused to go out of her way to return a product she says she didn\u2019t order. @noclasscasssss #stitch with @Cassie leave. me. alone. you. psycho. people. @eufyhome US \u266c original sound \u2013 Cassie The representative then asked if Cassie would take that video down and said they would talk to their leadership about how to make the situation right. However, Cassie was more concerned with how they got her address in the first place and demanded to see the application that she allegedly sent. That\u2019s when she realized that Google Form surveys can sometimes be hard to read. \u201cThat scoop neck short sleeve T-shirt in extra-small? I said that I want that,\u201d Cassie says. \u201cThat mid-thigh bodysuit (random color) extra-extra-small/extra-small? I said I want that. So why it says \u2018I don\u2019t want it\u2019 right there for both of those? That\u2019s crazy because those are the two things on the form that I said \u2018yes\u2019 to that I received. And then down there at the very bottom, it says \u2018yes,\u2019 and then it says the \u2018Smart Scale P2 Pro,\u2019 which I said \u2018I don\u2019t want\u2019 to but got anyways.\u201d She asserts, \u201cSo this form is bullsh*t. They printed the results out wrong, or they just totally fudged this. I don\u2019t know because it was a Google Forms thing, and I worked with Google Forms a lot in college. And sometimes, if you click \u2018see the results\u2019 in a weird way, it prints sh*t out weird in a way that doesn\u2019t make sense. So maybe that\u2019s what they did? I think that\u2019s what they did.\u201d To make matters worse, Cassie says she continued to receive communication from the brand even after blocking its emails. In the communications, the brand warned that it would report her to TikTok if she didn\u2019t post content about the product. Cassie says that\u2019s why she received the call from TikTok. TikTok creators who meet certain criteria are able to participate in the platform\u2019s affiliate marketing program. In order to continue qualifying, they need to meet certain metrics, and one of those is posting about the products they receive within a two-week period. \u201cI had a nightmare about these people,\u201d Cassie says. \u201cI had a nightmare that they FaceTimed me, and they were yelling at me about why I haven\u2019t posted this product yet. This is f*cking insane. I did not ask for your scale. Learn how to read a Google Form and crawl the f*ck out of my a**.\u201d The video has amassed more than 341,000 views as of this writing. In the comments section, some viewers questioned why Cassie didn\u2019t just return the scale. She posted a follow-up video addressing the question, in which she states that she doesn\u2019t have a printer at her home. Printing out a shipping label and going to the post office feels like too much effort to expend on a brand \u201cthat has been nothing but rude to me,\u201d she says.

According to a statement from the Secret Service, amid an ongoing investigation, the driver was \"discovered deceased\" before they could render aid.\n\nAs detailed from the federal agency, \"Shortly before 10:30pm on May 4th, a vehicle traveling at a high rate of speed collided with an outer perimeter gate on the White House complex. Security protocols were implemented as officers cleared the vehicle and attempted to render aid to the driver who was discovered deceased.\"\n\nAnthony Guglielmi, chief of communications for the USSS, indicated on social media, \"Limited traffic closures remain in effect as Secret Service teams, @dcfireems & @DCPoliceDept investigate a fatal vehicle crash that occurred at an exterior perimeter gate by the White House. There is no threat or public safety implications and our preliminary statement is below.\"\n\nThe statement from the Secret Service added, \"There was no threat to the White House. The fatal crash portion of this will be turned over to the Washington Metropolitan Police Department Crash Investigation Unit and the Secret Service investigation continues.\"\n\nImages captured by freelancer Andrew Leyden, who goes by the handle PenguinSix, included a graphic shot of the decedent seen under a tarp on the pavement outside the crashed vehicle.\n\nHardly a unique instance of such an accident outside the president's residence, the crash wasn't even the first of its kind this calendar year.\n\nIn January, Guglielmi had confirmed that an arrest had been made outside the White House perimeter while an investigation into the \"cause and manner\" of the incident was underway.\n\nSimilarly, in May 2023, a suspect identified as 19-year-old Varshith Kandula had been arrested after a U-Haul truck had been crashed into a White House barricade containing a Nazi flag, duct tape and a notebook after President Joe Biden had declared white supremacy the biggest threat to the country.\n\nEven while traveling, the Secret Service has had to remain on their toes for vehicular mishaps as in December, Biden was spotted leaving his 2024 campaign office in Wilmington, Delaware and being questioned by the press moments before being ushered into a waiting SUV when a vehicle had crashed into the motorcade blocking off the street.\n\nVideo from the incident showed as law enforcement surrounded the vehicle and questioned the driver before the USSS released a statement that said detailed after the initial crash, \"The sedan then tried to continue into a closed-off intersection, before Secret Service personnel surrounded the vehicle with weapons drawn and instructed the driver to put his hands up.\"\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

No deaths or injuries were reported as a result of the attack carried out by Sai Varshith Kandula, 19, on May 22, 2023. He allegedly drove the U-Haul into a security fence and had planned to kill the president, praising Adolf Hitler as he was arrested by police. A Nazi flag was recovered from the van.\n\nAnother breach of the security gates was recorded on August 10, 2020 when Myron Berryman, 51, attempted to run towards armed officers with his hands in his pockets. The suspect was unarmed but shot and taken to hospital where he was charged with assault.\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

No information on the identity of the person' man implicated in the accident was not communicated, as were the circumstances of the accident.\n\nIn January, the driver of a vehicle was arrested for also hitting one of the security perimeter gates.\n\nThe White House has been the subject of several intrusion attempts in recent years, sufficiently worrying for the security services to decide in 2020 to build a new barrier, higher and ;rsquo;a more resistant metal, around the perimeter of the presidential residence.", "source": {"uri": "bobrtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bobrtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestapo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gestapo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secret service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Repair", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Repair", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Safety_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Safety and Security", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540303", "eventUri": "eng-9540303", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 174, "textEnd": 179, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

An investigation ensues following the loss of a man involved in the accident which unfolded near the White House on Saturday night.\n\nThe incident was reported around 10:45 p. m.\n\n, at the crossroads of Pennsylvania Avenue and 15th Street in Northwest D. C.\n\nUpon reaching the scene, police found the devastated man who was declared dead.\n\nAuthorities shared that a car had rammed through a security boundary around the White House. This incident is being treated as a traffic mishap for now, reports the Mirror US.\n\nNotably, this follows an incident in January where a man was detained by the US Secret Service after his vehicle hit a barricade surrounding the White House compound - unfolding just before 6:00 p. m. local time.\n\nAccording to Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesperson for the Secret Service, the \"vehicle collided with an exterior gate\", as stated on a platform formerly known as Twitter. At the time, President Joe Biden was on a journey from South Carolina to Texas, not being present in Washington, DC.\n\nThankfully, no injuries were reported from this incident. According to Mr. Guglielmi, one individual was taken into custody and the incident continues to be under investigation.\n\nThe driver's identity remained undisclosed, and there were no criminal charges declared by the prosecution thus far. As a result of the event, roads in downtown Washington, DC east of the White House were subsequently closed.\n\nJoin the Daily Record's news flash service by subscribing here. The 19 year old lad from Missouri, allegedly aiming to harm the US president, crashed a truck into barriers close to the White House in May 2023, say officials.\n\nAccording to Park Police, Sai Varshith Kandula from Chesterfield, Pennsylvania was behind the wheel. A Secret Service bloke reported Kandula faced charges of \"threatening to kill, kidnap, inflict harm on a president, vice president, or family member\" based on his words to various law enforcement squads.\n\nHead over here and follow Daily Record US on Google News for all your up-to-date news, sport, and entertainment updates.\n\nPressed Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre informed that President Joe Biden was within the White House when Kandula drove his truck into it. He was meeting up with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy for a chinwag about the debt ceiling.\n\nThe uncertainty remains regarding whether Biden was updated about the situation when it was unfolding. Jean-Pierre chimed in that he was later briefed by the Park Police and Secret Service.\n\n\"He's relieved that no one was injured last night and grateful to the agent and law enforcement officer who responded so quickly,\" she relayed to the journos.\n\nA spokeswoman for the agency confirmed that Secret Service agents had interviewed the suspect as part of a joint investigation involving the FBI, U. S.\n\nCapitol Police, and United States Park Police. Kandula was also charged with trespassing, careless driving, and assault with a deadly weapon.\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter here.",

{"id": 243289062, "title": "Impossible Deadline For PoS Registration", "text": "The Central Bank of Nige-ria (CBN) recently man-dated that all Point of Sales (PoS) operators complete their registration with the Corpo-rate Affairs Corporation (CAC) by July 7, 2024. This directive aims to formalize the operations of PoS businesses across the country, boost-ing regulatory compliance and pro-moting financial inclusion. However, for many PoS opera-tors, this new requirement poses significant challenges, both fi-nancially and logistically. As mi-cro-businesses, already grappling with economic uncertainties, the stringent deadline could threaten their survival and, by extension, the broader goal of financial inclusion in Nigeria. PoS operators have become cru-cial players in Nigeria\u2019s financial landscape, particularly in rural and underserved urban areas. They provide essential services such as cash withdrawals, deposits, bill payments, and transfers, bridging the gap between the unbanked population and formal financial institutions. Their accessibility and convenience have made them indispensable, particularly as the country pushes towards a cashless economy. Reports indicate that there are close to a million registered PoS terminals in the country. Ac-cording to Statista, \u201cAs of 2023, PoS payments in Nigeria were worth over 860 billion Nigerian naira, reg-istering an increase compared to the previous years reviewed. Between 2015 and 2023, the number of POS payments rose significantly.\u201d These numbers tell a story. PoS operators are today an integral part of the financial inclusion value chain. So, efforts should be made to ensure the sustainability of the sub-sector. The real issue is that the tight registration deadline poses chal-lenges to the operators. Number one, registering a business with the CAC involves several costs, including registra-tion fees, documentation, and sometimes legal services. Many PoS operators, who operate on thin margins, may struggle to afford these expenses. For micro businesses that often subsist on daily earnings, diverting funds towards registration could mean a significant financial setback. What would likely happen is that many will not bother to register and may thus close shop. Two, the July 7 deadline is too short. It provides the operators with a limited timeframe to com-plete the registration process. Giv-en the bureaucratic hurdles often associated with such processes in Nigeria, this timeline is impractical for many. The urgency compounds the stress on operators who must balance their daily operations with the demands of registration. They may be forced to pay above the usual rate because of the urgency of the situation. Thirdly, many PoS operators are not fully aware of the registra-tion requirements or the steps in-volved. Without adequate support and clear guidance from the CBN or CAC, they may find the process overwhelming. The absence of targeted awareness campaigns ex-acerbates this issue, leaving many operators in the dark. The Nation-al Orientation Agency (NOA) has a role to play here. The biggest challenge is the dis-ruption of business activities. The focus on meeting the registration deadline may lead to operational disruptions. PoS operators might need to temporarily halt their ser-vices to manage the registration process, affecting their income and the communities that rely on their services. It should not be this way. First and foremost, there must be some sort of financial assistance program. Yes, the government, in collaboration with financial insti-tutions, could establish a finan-cial assistance program to support PoS operators with the costs of reg-istration. This could take the form of grants, subsidized loans, or fee waivers. Such assistance would alleviate the financial burden and ensure compliance without jeopar-dizing operators\u2019 livelihoods. Secondly, the regulator should immediately extend the deadline. Extending the deadline would pro-vide PoS operators with a more realistic timeframe to complete the registration process. An extended period would allow operators to plan and save for the costs involved, reducing the risk of financial strain. A 12 to 24-month window sounds reasonable. In addition, massive awareness campaigns and support have to be instituted. The comprehensive awareness campaigns are crucial to inform PoS operators about the registration requirements and process. The CBN and CAC could collaborate to disseminate infor-mation through various channels, including social media, commu-nity meetings, and local radio sta-tions. Additionally, establishing support centres or helplines to guide operators through the regis-tration process would be beneficial. The CAC should streamline the registration process. The thinking is that simplifying the registration process could encourage compli-ance. Streamlining documenta-tion requirements and reducing bureaucratic red tape would make the process more accessible. Online registration portals with clear, step-by-step instructions could also expe-dite the process. Furthermore, community en-gagement and partnerships must come into play. Engaging with com-munity leaders and local organisa-tions can help mobilize PoS operators and provide them with the necessary resources and information. Partner-ships with non-governmental or-ganisations (NGOs) and business associations could also facilitate workshops and training sessions to aid the registration process. The CBN\u2019s directive for PoS op-erators to register with the CAC is well-intentioned. It aims to formal-ize and regulate the sector. Howev-er, without addressing the financial and logistical challenges faced by these micro businesses, the direc-tive could have adverse effects on the economy. Ensuring the sustain-ability of PoS operations is essential for maintaining financial inclusion and supporting Nigeria\u2019s broader economic goals. \u2026Eromosele, a corporate communica-tion professional and public affairs analyst, writes via elviseroms@gmail. com", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"560\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/POS-5.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/POS-5.jpg 560w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/POS-5-300x241.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\" /></div>The Central Bank of Nige\u00adria (CBN) recently man\u00addated that all Point of Sales (PoS) operators complete their registration with the Corpo\u00adrate Affairs Corporation (CAC) by July 7, 2024.

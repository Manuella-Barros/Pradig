Earps sustained the problem during Friday\u2019s Euro 2025 qualifying defeat to Les Bleues. The 31-year-old was forced off at St James\u2019 Park just seven minutes into her 50th Lionesses appearance and left the stadium on crutches. Chelsea\u2019s Hannah Hampton, her replacement in Newcastle, is set to start in the return fixture in Saint-Etienne. Birmingham\u2019s Lucy Thomas, who had been on standby, has been drafted into the 23-player squad. A first European qualifying defeat since 2002 has left England third in League A Group 3 and they need to finish in the top two to automatically qualify for their title defence at next summer\u2019s tournament in Switzerland.", "summary": "<p>Lionesses\u2019 star goalkeeper Earps suffered the injury in the first of two fixtures against France </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/mary-earps-injury-england-lionesses-b2555256.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/02/13/newFile.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:17:22", "author": "Carl Markham", "authors": ["Carl Markham"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.185}

Previous such declarations have failed, raising doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might lead to a resolution between Hamas, which has ruled the Gaza Strip for the past 17 years, and Fatah, the main force in the U.S.-backed Palestinian Authority that administers parts of the occupied West Bank.\n\nIsrael swiftly denounced the agreement. The U.S. and other Western countries have refused to accept any Palestinian government that includes Hamas unless it expressly recognizes Israel -- a factor that has helped wreck past unity attempts, along with the factions' own competition for power.\n\nChinese state broadcaster CCTV announced that the two sides and other, smaller Palestinian factions signed the Beijing Declaration on \"ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity,\" pledging to form a unity government for the Palestinian territories. The agreement offered only broad outlines on how they would work together.\n\n\"There is an opportunity ... but it is not big, because it lacks a specific timetable for implementation,\" said Hani Al-Masry, an expert on Palestinian reconciliation affairs.\n\nThe declaration comes at a sensitive time, as the war in Gaza rages on into its 10th month and as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nOne of the thorniest issues is the question of who will run Gaza after the war -- and the unity efforts are in part motivated by Palestinians' desire to offer a scenario for postwar rule.\n\nBut Israel vehemently opposes any role for Hamas, which it has vowed to destroy after its Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. It also has rejected U.S. calls for the Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza after the fighting ends, though it has not presented a cohesive postwar vision of its own.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah has been deeply reluctant to share power with its longtime rival. Hamas won Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006. The following year, amid escalating tensions, Hamas routed forces loyal to Abbas in Gaza. It has ruled the impoverished coastal enclave ever since.\n\nDuring the current war, Hamas officials have said the group does not want to return to ruling Gaza and advocates forming a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions. That government would then prepare for elections in Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nReacting to the announcement out of China, Israel's foreign minister said no joint governance between Hamas and Fatah in Gaza will take place \"because Hamas' rule will be crushed.\"\n\nThe agreement also underscored China's attempts to have a growing role in Middle East diplomacy, after its success in mediating the restoration of relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\n\"To be sure, China is still in the process of trying to earn credibility as a global mediator,\" said James Char, a research fellow at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n\nOfficials from Fatah, Hamas and 12 other factions met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, concluding talks that started Sunday, according to a post on social media platform Weibo from Chinese TV network CGTN.\n\nThe Palestinian factions issued a joint statement announcing the deal but giving no details on how or when the government would be formed, saying only that it would be done \"by agreement among the factions.\" It said they promised to follow up on previous reconciliation agreements signed in 2011 and 2022.\n\nIn the statement, all the factions including Hamas said they were committed to the creation of a Palestinian state on lands Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.\n\nHamas, whose original charter directly called for Israel's destruction, has said it would accept a Palestinian state based on the pre-1967 war borders but refuses to officially recognize Israel.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, has recognized Israel and works within the framework of peace deals signed in the early 1990s. Those deals were supposed to lead to an eventual state in the West Bank and Gaza, but talks have been defunct for years, leaving it in charge of only isolated West Bank enclaves. Many Palestinians view the authority as corrupt, out of touch and a subcontractor for Israel because of their joint security coordination.\n\nThe unity announcement is based on widening the membership of the Fatah-led Palestine Liberation Organization, including Hamas, said Jamal Nazzal, a Fatah spokesperson.\n\n\"It's a long way ahead, and most of it will be implemented after a possible cease-fire,\" he added.\n\nHamas members have never been part of the PLO, the umbrella group of Palestinian factions that undergirds the Palestinian Authority. Husam Badran, a Hamas political official based in Qatar, called the agreement a further \"positive step towards achieving Palestinian national unity.\"\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden's administration envisions a revamped Palestinian Authority ruling postwar Gaza and has sought reforms that might make it a viable presence in the war-ravaged territory. Israel rejected that idea.\n\nThe Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group allied with Hamas, issued a statement after the talks saying it still \"rejects any formula that includes recognition of Israel explicitly or implicitly\" and that it had \"demanded the withdrawal of the Palestine Liberation Organization's recognition of Israel.\"\n\nGoldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel; Wu reported from Bangkok.

That government would then prepare for elections in Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nReacting to the announcement out of China, Israel's foreign minister said no joint governance between Hamas and Fatah in Gaza will take place \"because Hamas' rule will be crushed.\"\n\nThe agreement also underscored China's attempts to have a growing role in Middle East diplomacy, after its success in mediating the restoration of relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\n\"To be sure, China is still in the process of trying to earn credibility as a global mediator,\" said James Char, a research fellow at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n\nOfficials from Fatah, Hamas and 12 other factions met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, concluding talks that started Sunday, according to a post on social media platform Weibo from Chinese TV network CGTN.\n\nThe Palestinian factions issued a joint statement announcing the deal but giving no details on how or when the government would be formed, saying only that it would be done \"by agreement among the factions.\" It said they promised to follow up on previous reconciliation agreements signed in 2011 and 2022.\n\nIn the statement, all the factions including Hamas said they were committed to the creation of a Palestinian state on lands Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.\n\nHamas, whose original charter directly called for Israel's destruction, has said it would accept a Palestinian state based on the pre-1967 war borders but refuses to officially recognize Israel.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, has recognized Israel and works within the framework of peace deals signed in the early 1990s. Those deals were supposed to lead to an eventual state in the West Bank and Gaza, but talks have been defunct for years, leaving it in charge of only isolated West Bank enclaves. Many Palestinians view the authority as corrupt, out of touch and a subcontractor for Israel because of their joint security coordination.\n\nThe unity announcement is based on widening the membership of the Fatah-led Palestine Liberation Organization, including Hamas, said Jamal Nazzal, a Fatah spokesperson.\n\n\"It's a long way ahead, and most of it will be implemented after a possible cease-fire,\" he added.\n\nHamas members have never been part of the PLO, the umbrella group of Palestinian factions that undergirds the Palestinian Authority. Husam Badran, a Hamas political official based in Qatar, called the agreement a further \"positive step towards achieving Palestinian national unity.\"\n\nUS President Joe Biden's administration envisions a revamped Palestinian Authority ruling postwar Gaza and has sought reforms that might make it a viable presence in the war-ravaged territory. Israel rejected that idea.\n\nThe Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group allied with Hamas, issued a statement after the talks saying it still \"rejects any formula that includes recognition of Israel explicitly or implicitly\" and that it had \"demanded the withdrawal of the Palestine Liberation Organization's recognition of Israel.\"", "source": {"uri": "news18.com",

The following year, amid escalating tensions, Hamas routed forces loyal to Abbas in Gaza. It has ruled the impoverished coastal enclave ever since.\n\nDuring the current war, Hamas officials have said the group does not want to return to ruling Gaza and advocates forming a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions.\n\nThat government would then prepare for elections in Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nReacting to the announcement out of China, Israel's foreign minister said no joint governance between Hamas and Fatah in Gaza will take place \"because Hamas' rule will be crushed\".\n\nThe agreement also underscored China's attempts to have a growing role in Middle East diplomacy, after its success in mediating the restoration of relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\n\"To be sure, China is still in the process of trying to earn credibility as a global mediator,\" said James Char, a research fellow at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n\nOfficials from Fatah, Hamas and 12 other factions met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, concluding talks that started Sunday, according to a post on social media platform Weibo from Chinese TV network CGTN.\n\nThe Palestinian factions issued a joint statement announcing the deal but giving no details on how or when the government would be formed, saying only that it would be done \"by agreement among the factions\".\n\nIt said they promised to follow up on previous reconciliation agreements signed in 2011 and 2022.\n\nIn the statement, all the factions, including Hamas, said they were committed to the creation of a Palestinian state on lands Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.\n\nHamas, whose original charter directly called for Israel's destruction, has said it would accept a Palestinian state based on the pre-1967 war borders but refuses to officially recognise Israel.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, has recognised Israel and works within the framework of peace deals signed in the early 1990s.\n\nThose deals were supposed to lead to an eventual state in the West Bank and Gaza, but talks have been defunct for years, leaving it in charge of only isolated West Bank enclaves.\n\nMany Palestinians view the authority as corrupt, out of touch and a subcontractor for Israel because of their joint security co-ordination.\n\nThe unity announcement is based on widening the membership of the Fatah-led Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), including Hamas, said Jamal Nazzal, a Fatah spokesperson.\n\n\"It's a long way ahead, and most of it will be implemented after a possible ceasefire,\" he added.\n\nHamas members have never been part of the PLO, the umbrella group of Palestinian factions that undergirds the Palestinian Authority.\n\nHusam Badran, a Hamas political official based in Qatar, called the agreement a further \"positive step towards achieving Palestinian national unity\".\n\nUS President Joe Biden's administration envisions a revamped Palestinian Authority ruling post-war Gaza and has sought reforms that might make it a viable presence in the war-ravaged territory. However, Israel rejected that idea.\n\nThe Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group allied with Hamas, issued a statement after the talks saying it still \"rejects any formula that includes

But previous such declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution.\n\nThe declaration comes at a sensitive time, as the war in Gaza rages on into its 10th month and as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nThe question of Palestinian political unity could complicate planning for a postwar leadership structure for Gaza, one of the thornier issues in the ongoing peace talks. Hamas won parliamentary elections in Gaza in 2006 and then overran the territory in a violent takeover the following year.\n\nGaza's postwar future remains in doubt. Israel vehemently opposes any Hamas role in governing Gaza after the war. It has also rejected calls from the United States for the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority to run Gaza after the fighting ends.\n\nSince the current war broke out in Gaza almost 10 months ago, Hamas officials have said that the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and the group has called for formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nBut both Israel and the PA have deep distrusts about Hamas' intentions.\n\nIsrael's Foreign Minister, Israel Katz, swiftly rejected the agreement Tuesday, stating that no joint governance between Hamas and Fatah in Gaza will take place \"because Hamas's rule will be crushed.\"\n\nThe two rival Palestinian groups, along with 12 other political factions, met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, concluding talks that started Sunday, according to a post on social media platform Weibo from Chinese TV network CGTN.\n\nThe agreement also underscores China's growing role in Middle East diplomacy, with success in the restoration of relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\n\"But to be sure, China is still the process of trying to earn credibility as a global mediator,\" said James Char, a research fellow at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n\nA joint statement issued after the most recent talks in Beijing gave no details on how or when the government would be formed, saying only that it would be done \"by agreement among the factions.\" According to the joint statement, the two groups are committed to the creation of a Palestinian state on lands Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.\n\nThe deal does not appear to bridge the two group's diverging position on Israel. Hamas previously said it would accept a state based on the pre-1967 war borders, while also refusing to officially recognize Israel. The Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, abides by interim peace agreements with Israel signed in the early 1990s.\n\nThe agreement signed by the Palestinian factions promised to follow up on previous reconciliation agreements signed in both 2011 and 2022.\n\n\"The understanding in China is based on widening the scope of the membership on the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) to include other factions who have not joined it\" including Hamas, said Jamal Nazzal, a Fatah spokesperson.\n\n\"It's a long way ahead, and most of it will be implemented after a possible cease-fire,\" he added.\n\nFatah and Hamas have been rivals since Hamas violently routed forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah in Gaza in 2007, taking over the impoverished coastal enclave. The Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, headed by Abbas, administers parts of the occupied West Bank. It is widely viewed by the Palestinian public as corrupt, out of touch, and a subcontractor for Israel because of their joint security coordination.\n\nHamas members have never been part of PLO, the Palestinian government body responsible for international affairs.

Previous such declarations have failed, raising doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might lead to a resolution between Hamas, which has ruled the Gaza Strip for the past 17 years, and Fatah, the main force in the U.S.-backed Palestinian Authority that administers parts of the occupied West Bank.\n\nIsrael swiftly denounced the agreement. The U.S. and other Western countries have refused to accept any Palestinian government that includes Hamas unless it expressly recognizes Israel -- a factor that has helped wreck past unity attempts, along with the factions' own competition for power.\n\nChinese state broadcaster CCTV announced that the two sides and other, smaller Palestinian factions signed the Beijing Declaration on \"ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity,\" pledging to form a unity government for the Palestinian territories. The agreement offered only broad outlines on how they would work together.\n\n\"There is an opportunity ... but it is not big, because it lacks a specific timetable for implementation,\" said Hani Al-Masry, an expert on Palestinian reconciliation affairs.\n\nThe declaration comes at a sensitive time, as the war in Gaza rages on into its 10th month and as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nOne of the thorniest issues is the question of who will run Gaza after the war -- and the unity efforts are in part motivated by Palestinians' desire to offer a scenario for postwar rule.\n\nBut Israel vehemently opposes any role for Hamas, which it has vowed to destroy after its Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. It also has rejected U.S. calls for the Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza after the fighting ends, though it has not presented a cohesive postwar vision of its own.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah has been deeply reluctant to share power with its longtime rival. Hamas won Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006. The following year, amid escalating tensions, Hamas routed forces loyal to Abbas in Gaza. It has ruled the impoverished coastal enclave ever since.\n\nDuring the current war, Hamas officials have said the group does not want to return to ruling Gaza and advocates forming a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions. That government would then prepare for elections in Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nReacting to the announcement out of China, Israel's foreign minister said no joint governance between Hamas and Fatah in Gaza will take place \"because Hamas' rule will be crushed.\"\n\nThe agreement also underscored China's attempts to have a growing role in Middle East diplomacy, after its success in mediating the restoration of relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\n\"To be sure, China is still in the process of trying to earn credibility as a global mediator,\" said James Char, a research fellow at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n\nOfficials from Fatah, Hamas and 12 other factions met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, concluding talks that started Sunday, according to a post on social media platform Weibo from Chinese TV network CGTN.\n\nThe Palestinian factions issued a joint statement announcing the deal but giving no details on how or when the government would be formed, saying only that it would be done \"by agreement among the factions.\" It said they promised to follow up on previous reconciliation agreements signed in 2011 and 2022.\n\nIn the statement, all the factions including Hamas said they were committed to the creation of a Palestinian state on lands Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.\n\nHamas, whose original charter directly called for Israel's destruction, has said it would accept a Palestinian state based on the pre-1967 war borders but refuses to officially recognize Israel.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, has recognized Israel and works within the framework of peace deals signed in the early 1990s. Those deals were supposed to lead to an eventual state in the West Bank and Gaza, but talks have been defunct for years, leaving it in charge of only isolated West Bank enclaves. Many Palestinians view the authority as corrupt, out of touch and a subcontractor for Israel because of their joint security coordination.\n\nThe unity announcement is based on widening the membership of the Fatah-led Palestine Liberation Organization, including Hamas, said Jamal Nazzal, a Fatah spokesperson.\n\n\"It's a long way ahead, and most of it will be implemented after a possible cease-fire,\" he added.\n\nHamas members have never been part of the PLO, the umbrella group of Palestinian factions that undergirds the Palestinian Authority. Husam Badran, a Hamas political official based in Qatar, called the agreement a further \"positive step towards achieving Palestinian national unity.\"\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden's administration envisions a revamped Palestinian Authority ruling postwar Gaza and has sought reforms that might make it a viable presence in the war-ravaged territory. Israel rejected that idea.\n\nThe Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group allied with Hamas, issued a statement after the talks saying it still \"rejects any formula that includes recognition of Israel explicitly or implicitly\" and that it had \"demanded the withdrawal of the Palestine Liberation Organization's recognition of Israel.\"\n\nGoldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel; Wu reported from Bangkok.

In reality, this won't happen because Hamas' rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands,\" Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on X.\n\nBadran said the national unity government would manage the affairs of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, oversee reconstruction, and prepare conditions for elections.\n\nCurrently Hamas runs Gaza and Fatah forms the backbone of the Palestinian Authority, which has limited control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nDetails of the agreement did not set out a timeframe for forming a new government. In March, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who heads Fatah, appointed a new government led by one of his close aides, Mohammad Mustafa.\n\nAshraf Abouelhoul, a specialist on Palestinian affairs, said previous similar declarations had not been implemented and nothing would happened without U.S. approval.\n\n\"Forming a unity government with Hamas is rejected by the United States, Israel, and Britain. There is a consensus among those countries to exclude Hamas from any role in the day after the war,\" Abouelhoul said.\n\n\"What happened in China was nothing but a meeting, a celebratory event, but it is impossible to resolve the problems between Palestinian factions in just three days,\" said Abouelhoul, managing editor of the Egyptian state-owned paper Al-Ahram.\n\nFEUDING FACTIONS\n\nNonetheless, the agreement further demonstrates Beijing's growing influence in the Middle East, after it brokered a breakthrough peace deal between longstanding regional foes Saudi Arabia and Iran last year.\n\n\"The core achievement is to make it clear that the Palestine Liberation Organization is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people,\" Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said during the closing ceremony, according to the readout.\n\n\"China sincerely hopes that the Palestinian factions will achieve Palestinian independence at an early date on the basis of internal reconciliation, and is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with relevant parties to jointly work to implement the Beijing Declaration reached today.\"\n\nThe most \"prominent highlight\" was the agreement on forming an interim national reconciliation government around the post-war governance of Gaza, Wang said, adding that the international community should support efforts to form an interim Palestinian government to control Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nHamas and Islamic Jihad are not members of the PLO, the Palestinians' highest decision-making body, but they demand that any unity deal includes holding an election for the PLO parliament to secure their inclusion. The Islamist groups are at odds with the current PLO over peace accords with Israel.\n\n\"This declaration comes at an important time as our people are facing a genocidal war, especially in the Gaza Strip,\" a statement quoted Badran as saying.\n\nRival factions Hamas and Fatah first met in Beijing in April to discuss reconciliation efforts to end around 17 years of disputes, the first time a Hamas delegation was publicly known to have visited China since the war in Gaza began.\n\nThe second round of talks, originally planned for last month, were delayed as both factions traded

Palestinian factions including rivals Hamas and Fatah agreed to end their divisions and form an interim national unity government during negotiations in China that ended on Tuesday, China's foreign ministry said.\n\nThe Beijing Declaration was signed at the closing ceremony of a reconciliation dialogue among 14 Palestinian factions held in China's capital from July 21-23, according to the readout.\n\nPrevious efforts by Egypt and other Arab countries to reconcile Hamas and Fatah have failed to end 17 years of power-sharing conflict that have weakened Palestinian political aspirations, and it remains to be seen whether this deal will survive the realities on the ground.\n\nThe meeting was held amid attempts by international mediators to reach a ceasefire deal for Gaza, with one of the sticking points being the \"day-after\" plan - how the Hamas-run enclave will be governed once the war that began on Oct. 7 ends.\n\nSenior Hamas official Hussam Badran said the most important point of the Beijing Declaration was to form a Palestinian national unity government to manage the affairs of Palestinians.\n\n\"This creates a formidable barrier against all regional and international interventions that seek to impose realities against our people's interests in managing Palestinian affairs post-war,\" Badran said.\n\nTwo Fatah officials contacted by Reuters declined to comment.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his goal is to destroy the Iran-backed Hamas group and opposes it having any role in a post war Gaza administration.\n\n\"Instead of rejecting terrorism, (Fatah leader) Mahmoud Abbas embraces the murderers and rapists of Hamas, revealing his true face. In reality, this won't happen because Hamas' rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands,\" Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on X.\n\nBadran said the national unity government would manage the affairs of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, oversee reconstruction, and prepare conditions for elections.\n\nCurrently Hamas runs Gaza and Fatah forms the backbone of the Palestinian Authority, which has limited control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nDetails of the agreement did not set out a timeframe for forming a new government. In March, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who heads Fatah, appointed a new government led by one of his close aides, Mohammad Mustafa.\n\nAshraf Abouelhoul, a specialist on Palestinian affairs, said previous similar declarations had not been implemented and nothing would happened without U.S. approval.\n\n\"Forming a unity government with Hamas is rejected by the United States, Israel, and Britain. There is a consensus among those countries to exclude Hamas from any role in the day after the war,\" Abouelhoul said.\n\n\"What happened in China was nothing but a meeting, a celebratory event, but it is impossible to resolve the problems between Palestinian factions in just three days,\" said Abouelhoul, managing editor of the Egyptian state-owned paper Al-Ahram.\n\nFeuding factions\n\nNonetheless, the agreement further demonstrates Beijing's growing influence in the Middle East, after it brokered a breakthrough peace deal between longstanding regional foes Saudi Arabia and Iran last year.\n\n\"The core achievement is to make it clear that the Palestine Liberation Organization is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people,\" Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said during the closing ceremony, according to the readout.\n\n\"China sincerely hopes that the Palestinian factions will achieve Palestinian independence at an early date on the basis of internal reconciliation, and is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with relevant parties to jointly work to implement the Beijing Declaration reached today.\"\n\nThe most \"prominent highlight\" was the agreement on forming an interim national reconciliation government around the post-war governance of Gaza, Wang said, adding that the international community should support efforts to form an interim Palestinian government to control Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nHamas and Islamic Jihad are not members of the PLO, the Palestinians' highest decision-making body, but they demand that any unity deal includes holding an election for the PLO parliament to secure their inclusion. The Islamist groups are at odds with the current PLO over peace accords with Israel.\n\n\"This declaration comes at an important time as our people are facing a genocidal war, especially in the Gaza Strip,\" a statement quoted Badran as saying.\n\nRival factions Hamas and Fatah first met in Beijing in April to discuss reconciliation efforts to end around 17 years of disputes, the first time a Hamas delegation was publicly known to have visited China since the war in Gaza began.\n\nThe second round of talks, originally planned for last month, were delayed as both factions traded blame.\n\nThe long-feuding Palestinian factions have previously failed to heal their political disputes after Hamas fighters expelled Fatah from Gaza in a short war in 2007.\n\nChinese officials have ramped up advocacy for the Palestinians in international forums in recent months, calling for a larger-scale Israeli-Palestinian peace conference and a specific timetable to implement a two-state

It also comes as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed ceasefire proposal that would wind down the nine-month war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nStill, the future of Gaza is undecided, with Israel vehemently opposed to any role by Hamas in governing Gaza. It has also rejected calls from the United States for the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority to run Gaza after the war ends.\n\nThe lack of a post-war vision for running the Gaza Strip has complicated ceasefire negotiations.\n\nSince the current war broke out in Gaza almost 10 months ago, Hamas officials have said that the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict.\n\nThe group has called for the formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nHamas and Fatah signed the Beijing Declaration on \"ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity\", according to state broadcaster CCTV.\n\nIsrael's Foreign Minister, Israel Katz, swiftly rejected the agreement on Tuesday, stating that no joint governance between Hamas and Fatah in Gaza will take place \"because Hamas's rule will be crushed\".\n\nThe two rival Palestinian groups, along with 12 other political factions, met Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi on Tuesday, concluding talks that started on Sunday.\n\nA joint statement issued after the most recent talks in Beijing gave no details on how or when the government would be formed, saying only that it would be done \"by agreement among the factions\".\n\nAccording to the joint statement, the two groups are committed to the creation of a Palestinian state on lands Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.\n\nWhile the groups have said they would work together many times before and failed, the signing of the declaration coincides with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying that a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appears within sight.\n\nHamas routed Fatah forces in Gaza in a violent takeover of the territory in 2007.\n\nUnity efforts have been wrecked by the factions' own bitter rivalry over power and the West's refusal to accept any government that includes Hamas unless it expressly recognises Israel.", "source": {"uri": "londonglossy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "London Glossy Post"}, "authors":

We are committed to national unity and we call for it,\" Abu Marzouk said after meeting Wang and the other envoys.\n\nWang called it an \"historic moment for the cause of Palestine's liberation.\"\n\nThe announcement comes more than nine months into the war in Gaza highlighting China's quest for an enhanced role in the Middle East since it secured a Saudi-Iranian rapprochement in March 2023.\n\nBeijing has since sought to play a mediator role in the Gaza war and post-conflict preparations. Its efforts have been complicated by the intense rivalry between Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, and Fatah, which partially governs the occupied West Bank.\n\nIsrael has vowed to keep fighting until it destroys Hamas, and world powers including key Israeli backer the United States have scrambled to ponder scenarios for the governance of Gaza once the war ends. Washington would like the PA to play a leading role in managing Gaza after the war. Israel does not want Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority to rule the enclave once the war is over.\n\nAs Tuesday's meeting wrapped up in Beijing, Wang said the groups had committed to \"reconciliation\".\n\n\"The most prominent highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government around the governance of post-war Gaza,\" Wang said following the signing of the \"Beijing declaration\" by the factions in the Chinese capital.\n\n\"Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community,\" Wang said.\n\nChina, he added, was keen to \"play a constructive role in safeguarding peace and stability in the Middle East\".\n\nBeijing, Wang said, called for a \"comprehensive, lasting and sustainable ceasefire\", as well as efforts to promote Palestinian self-governance and full recognition of a Palestinian state at the UN.\n\nHamas and Fatah have been bitter rivals since Hamas fighters ejected Fatah from the Gaza Strip after deadly clashes that followed the resounding Hamas victory in a 2006 election.\n\nFatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which has partial administrative control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nSeveral reconciliation bids have failed leading many regional experts to be sceptical about the prospects for success of the announced \"reconciliation\". But calls have grown for inter-Palestinian entente since the Hamas October attack and nine-month war in Gaza, with violence also soaring in the West Bank where Fatah is based.\n\nChina had hosted Fatah and Hamas in April but a meeting scheduled for June was postponed.\n\nChina has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and supportive of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nThe deal iwas announced amid ongoing war in Gaza, which has killed so far more than 39,000 Palestinian in the enclave, mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Gaza.\n\nThe brutal war has also plunged Gaza into a severe humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe conflict was sparked by Hamas' October attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures. The militants also seized 251 hostages. Mediation has so far failed to produce a ceasefire or the release of the hostages.", "source": {"uri": "thearabweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AW"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mousa_Mohammed_Abu_Marzook", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Yi_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wang Yi (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fatah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestine Liberation Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_occupation_of_the_West_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli occupation of the West Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran\u2013Saudi_Arabia_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran\u2013Saudi Arabia relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Two-state solution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image_800x450_/public/2024-07/2024-07-23_07-40-11_273052.jpg?itok=TXbwjh4x", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749919", "eventUri": "eng-9749919", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

The two heavyweights of Palestinian politics signed the Beijing Declaration on \"ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity,\" according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV, pledging to form a unity government for the Palestinian territories. But previous such declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution.\n\nThe declaration comes at a sensitive time, as the war in Gaza rages on into its 10th month and as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. The question of Palestinian political unity could complicate planning for a postwar leadership structure for Gaza, one of the thornier issues in the ongoing peace talks.\n\nSince the current war broke out in Gaza almost 10 months ago, Hamas officials have said that the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and the group has called for formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government. But both Israel and the PA have deep distrusts about Hamas' intentions. Israel's Foreign Minister, Israel Katz, swiftly rejected the agreement Tuesday, stating that no joint governance between Hamas and Fatah in Gaza will take place \"because Hamas's rule will be crushed.\"\n\nThe two rival Palestinian groups, along with 12 other political factions, met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, concluding talks that started Sunday. The agreement also underscores China's growing role in Middle East diplomacy, with success in the restoration of relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\nA joint statement issued after the most recent talks in Beijing gave no details on how or when the government would be formed, saying only that it would be done \"by agreement among the factions.\" According to the joint statement, the two groups are committed to the creation of a Palestinian state on lands Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.\n\nThe deal does not appear to bridge the two group's diverging position on Israel. Hamas previously said it would accept a state based on the pre-1967 war borders, while also refusing to officially recognize Israel. The Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, abides by interim peace agreements with Israel signed in the early 1990s. The agreement signed by the Palestinian factions promised to follow up on previous reconciliation agreements signed in both 2011 and 2022.\n\n\"The understanding in China is based on widening the scope of the membership on the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) to include other factions who have not joined it\" including Hamas, said Jamal Nazzal, a Fatah spokesperson. \"It's a long way ahead, and most of it will be implemented after a possible cease-fire,\" he added.\n\nFatah and Hamas have been rivals since Hamas violently routed forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah in Gaza in 2007, taking over the impoverished coastal enclave. The Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, headed by Abbas, administers parts of the occupied West Bank. It is widely viewed by the Palestinian public as corrupt, out of touch, and a subcontractor for Israel because of their joint security coordination.\n\nHamas members have never been part of PLO, the Palestinian government body responsible for international affairs. In a statement, Husam Badran, a Hamas political official based in Qatar, praised the agreement, describing it as a further \"positive step towards achieving Palestinian national unity.\" But Tuesday's deal doesn't have a hard timeline.\n\n\"There is an opportunity ... but it is not big, because it lacks a specific timetable for implementation,\" said Hani Al-Masry, an expert on Palestinian reconciliation affairs. Repeated attempts at mending the rift have failed, wrecked by the factions' own bitter rivalry over power and the West's refusal to accept any government that includes Hamas unless it expressly recognizes Israel.\n\nUnited States President Joe Biden's administration envisions a revamped Palestinian Authority ruling postwar Gaza and has sought a series of reforms that might make it a viable presence in the war-ravaged territory. Israel rejected that idea, but has not put forward a credible alternative for who will govern Gaza. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group allied with Hamas, issued a statement Tuesday after the talks saying that it still \"rejects any formula that includes recognition of Israel explicitly or implicitly\" and that it had \"demanded the withdrawal of the Palestine Liberation Organization's recognition of Israel.\"\n\nGoldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel; Wu reported from Bangkok.

We are committed to national unity and we call for it,\" Abu Marzuk said after meeting Wang and the other envoys.\n\nThe announcement comes more than nine months into a war sparked by Hamas's October attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 44 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.\n\nThe relentless fighting has plunged Gaza into a severe humanitarian crisis.\n\nChina has sought to play a mediator role in the conflict, which has been rendered even more complex due to the intense rivalry between Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, and Fatah, which partially governs the occupied West Bank.\n\nIsrael has vowed to keep fighting until it destroys Hamas, and world powers including key Israeli backer the United States have scrambled to imagine scenarios for the governance of Gaza once the war ends.\n\nNeither Israel nor the United States would sanction any post-war plan that includes Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Washington.\n\nWhile it is unclear whether the deal announced in Beijing on Tuesday can hold, it does indicate that the only world power that can engineer a rapprochement between the Palestinian rivals is China.\n\nAs Tuesday's meeting wrapped up in Beijing, Wang said the groups had committed to \"reconciliation\".\n\n\"The most prominent highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government around the governance of post-war Gaza,\" Wang said after the factions signed the \"Beijing declaration\" in the Chinese capital.\n\n\"Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community,\" Wang said.\n\nFatah official Mahmoud al-Aloul thanked China for its \"unending support\" for the Palestinian cause.\n\n\"To China, you have our love, you have all our friendship, from all the Palestinian people,\" he said.\n\nNotably, he did not mention whether any agreement had been reached with Hamas and the other factions.\n\nAlso present at Tuesday's meeting were envoys from Egypt, Algeria and Russia, according to Wang.\n\nEgypt, which neighbours Israel and Gaza, is a key mediator in the conflict.\n\nAlgeria is a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, and has drafted resolutions on the war.\n\nAnd while Western powers have sought to isolate Russia over its Ukraine invasion, China has maintained its strategic partnership with Moscow.\n\nChina, Wang said, was keen to \"play a constructive role in safeguarding peace and stability in the Middle East\".\n\nHe also called for a \"comprehensive, lasting and sustainable ceasefire\", as well as efforts to promote Palestinian self-governance and full recognition of a Palestinian state at the UN.\n\nHamas and Fatah have been bitter rivals since Hamas fighters ejected Fatah from the Gaza Strip after deadly clashes that followed Hamas's resounding victory in a 2006 election.\n\nFatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which has partial administrative control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nSeveral reconciliation bids have failed, but calls have grown since the Hamas October attack and nine-month war in Gaza, with violence also soaring in the West Bank where Fatah is based.\n\nChina hosted Fatah and Hamas in April but a meeting scheduled for June was postponed.\n\nChina has positioned itself as a more neutral actor on the Israel-Palestinian conflict than its rival the United States, advocating for a two-state solution while also maintaining good ties with Israel.\n\nAnd it has sought to play a greater role in the Middle East in recent years, facilitating last year's historic rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times AU"}, "authors": [],

It also comes as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the nine-month war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nStill, the future of Gaza is undecided, with Israel vehemently opposed to any role by Hamas in governing Gaza. It has also rejected calls from the United States for the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority to run Gaza after the war ends. The lack of a postwar vision for running the Gaza Strip has complicated negotiations over a cease-fire.\n\nSince the current war broke out in Gaza almost 10 months ago, Hamas officials have said that the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and the group has called for formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nThe two groups signed the Beijing Declaration on \"ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity,\" according to state broadcaster CCTV.\n\nIsrael's Foreign Minister, Israel Katz, swiftly rejected the agreement Tuesday, stating that no joint governance between Hamas and Fatah in Gaza will take place \"because Hamas's rule will be crushed.\"\n\nThe two rival Palestinian groups, along with 12 other political factions, met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, concluding talks that started Sunday, according to a post on social media platform Weibo from Chinese TV network CGTN.\n\nThe agreement also underscores China's growing role in Middle East diplomacy, with success in the restoration of relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\n\"But to be sure, China is still the process of trying to earn credibility as a global mediator,\" said James Char, a research fellow at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n\nA joint statement issued after the most recent talks in Beijing gave no details on how or when the government would be formed, saying only that it would be done \"by agreement among the factions.\" According to the joint statement, the two groups are committed to the creation of a Palestinian state on lands Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.\n\nThe deal does not appear to bridge the two group's diverging position on Israel. Hamas previously said it would accept a state based on 1967 borders, while also refusing to officially recognize Israel. The Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, abides by interim peace agreements with Israel signed in the early 1990s.\n\nThe agreement signed by the Palestinian factions promised to follow up on previous reconciliation agreements signed in both 2011 and 2022.\n\n\"The understanding in China is based on widening the scope of the membership on the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) to include other factions who have not joined it\" including Hamas, said Jamal Nazzal, a Fatah spokesperson.\n\n\"It's a long way ahead, and most of it will be implemented after a possible cease-fire,\" he added.\n\nFatah and Hamas have been rivals since Hamas violently routed forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah in Gaza in 2007, taking over the impoverished coastal enclave. The Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, headed by Abbas, administers parts of the occupied West Bank. It is widely viewed by the Palestinian public as corrupt, out of touch, and a subcontractor for Israel because of their joint security coordination.\n\nHamas members have never been part of PLO, the Palestinian government body responsible for international affairs. In a statement, Husam Badran, a Hamas political official based in Qatar, praised the agreement, describing it as a further \"positive step towards achieving Palestinian national unity.\"\n\nBut Tuesday's deal doesn't have a hard timeline.\n\n\"There is an opportunity ... but it is not big, because it lacks a specific timetable for implementation,\" said Hani Al-Masry, an expert on Palestinian reconciliation affairs.\n\nRepeated attempts at mending the rift have failed, wrecked by the factions' own bitter rivalry over power and the West's refusal to accept any government that includes Hamas unless it expressly recognizes Israel.\n\nUnited States President Joe Biden's administration envisions a revamped Palestinian Authority to rule postwar Gaza and has sought a series of reforms that might make it a viable presence in the war-ravaged territory. Israel rejected that idea, but has not put forward a credible alternative for who will govern Gaza.\n\nThe Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group allied with Hamas, issued a statement Tuesday after the talks saying that it still \"rejects any formula that includes recognition of Israel explicitly or implicitly\" and that it had \"demanded the withdrawal of the Palestine Liberation Organization's recognition of Israel.\"\n\n___\n\nGoldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel; Wu reported from Bangkok.

The following year, amid escalating tensions, Hamas routed forces loyal to Abbas in Gaza. It has ruled the impoverished coastal enclave ever since.\n\nThat government would then prepare for elections in Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nReacting to the announcement out of China, Israel's foreign minister said no joint governance between Hamas and Fatah in Gaza will take place \"because Hamas' rule will be crushed\".\n\nThe agreement also underscored China's attempts to have a growing role in Middle East diplomacy, after its success in mediating the restoration of relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\n\"To be sure, China is still in the process of trying to earn credibility as a global mediator,\" said James Char, a research fellow at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n\nOfficials from Fatah, Hamas and 12 other factions met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, concluding talks that started Sunday, according to a post on social media platform Weibo from Chinese TV network CGTN.\n\nIt said they promised to follow up on previous reconciliation agreements signed in 2011 and 2022.\n\nIn the statement, all the factions, including Hamas, said they were committed to the creation of a Palestinian state on lands Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.\n\nHamas, whose original charter directly called for Israel's destruction, has said it would accept a Palestinian state based on the pre-1967 war borders but refuses to officially recognise Israel.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, has recognised Israel and works within the framework of peace deals signed in the early 1990s.\n\nThose deals were supposed to lead to an eventual state in the West Bank and Gaza, but talks have been defunct for years, leaving it in charge of only isolated West Bank enclaves.\n\nThe unity announcement is based on widening the membership of the Fatah-led Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), including Hamas, said Jamal Nazzal, a Fatah spokesperson.\n\n\"It's a long way ahead, and most of it will be implemented after a possible ceasefire,\" he added.\n\nHamas members have never been part of the PLO, the umbrella group of Palestinian factions that undergirds the Palestinian Authority.\n\nHusam Badran, a Hamas political official based in Qatar, called the agreement a further \"positive step towards achieving Palestinian national unity\".\n\nUS President Joe Biden's administration envisions a revamped Palestinian Authority ruling post-war Gaza and has sought reforms that might make it a viable presence in the war-ravaged territory.

In reality, this won't happen because Hamas' rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands,\" Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on X.\n\nBadran said the national unity government would manage the affairs of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, oversee reconstruction, and prepare conditions for elections.\n\nCurrently Hamas runs Gaza and Fatah forms the backbone of the Palestinian Authority, which has limited control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. There has been no immediate comment from Fatah.\n\nDetails of the agreement did not set out a timeframe for forming a new government. In March, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who heads Fatah, appointed a new government led by one of his close aides, Mohammad Mustafa.\n\nNonetheless, the agreement marks a diplomatic coup for Beijing and its growing influence in the Middle East, after it brokered a breakthrough peace deal between longstanding regional foes Saudi Arabia and Iran last year.\n\n\"The core achievement is to make it clear that the Palestine Liberation Organization is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people,\" Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said during the closing ceremony, according to the readout.\n\n\"China sincerely hopes that the Palestinian factions will achieve Palestinian independence at an early date on the basis of internal reconciliation, and is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with relevant parties to jointly work to implement the Beijing Declaration reached today.\"\n\nThe most \"prominent highlight\" was the agreement on forming an interim national reconciliation government around the post-war governance of Gaza, Wang said, adding that the international community should support efforts to form an interim Palestinian government to control Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nHamas and Islamic Jihad are not members of the PLO, the Palestinians' highest decision-making body, but they demand that any unity deal includes holding an election for the PLO parliament to secure their inclusion. The Islamist groups are at odds with the current PLO over peace accords with Israel.\n\n\"This declaration comes at an important time as our people are facing a genocidal war, especially in the Gaza Strip,\" a statement quoted Badran as saying.\n\nRival factions Hamas and Fatah first met in Beijing in April to discuss reconciliation efforts to end around 17 years of disputes, the first time a Hamas delegation was publicly known to have visited China since the war in Gaza began.\n\nThe second round of talks, originally planned for last month, were delayed as both factions traded blame.\n\nThe long-feuding Palestinian factions have previously failed to heal their political disputes after Hamas fighters expelled Fatah from Gaza in a short war in 2007.\n\nChinese officials have ramped up advocacy for the Palestinians in international forums in recent months, calling for a larger-scale Israeli-Palestinian peace conference and a specific timetable to implement a two-state solution.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type":

China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi on July 23 hailed an agreement by 14 Palestinian factions to set up an \"interim national reconciliation government\" to govern Gaza after the war.\n\nRival Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah agreed to end their long-standing enmity and work to form a national unity government following talks held in China, Chinese state media reported Tuesday.\n\n\"On the morning of July 23, the closing ceremony of the reconciliation dialogue among Palestinian factions was held in Beijing. Representatives of Palestinian factions signed the 'Beijing Declaration' on ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity,\" Chinese state media outlet CGTN wrote in a post on local social media platform Weibo, according to a translation provided by the website and vetted by CNBC.\n\nThe \"inter-Palestinian reconciliation dialogue,\" as it was described by the state outlet, had been underway in Beijing since Sunday.\n\nThis marks a significant development, as Hamas and Fatah have been bitter enemies ever since the bloody 2006-2007 civil war in the Gaza Strip. Fatah, the Palestinian political party then governed both the West Bank and the Gaza enclave at the time, was violently kicked out of the latter territory, following Hamas' election win in the Strip in 2006.\n\nHamas has governed the Gaza enclave since then and is currently embroiled in a brutal war with Israel. The offensive was triggered by the Hamas-led terror attacks of Oct. 7, which resulted in 1,200 deaths in Israel, with a further 253 people taken hostage by Hamas into the Gaza Strip, according to Israeli tallies. The Palestinian militant group is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. and U.K.\n\nIn the months since, Israel's retaliatory assaults on the Gaza Strip have killed nearly 39,000 Palestinians there, according to health authorities in the enclave.\n\nHussam Badran, a senior Hamas official taking part in the talks, said in a statement cited by Reuters that \"this declaration comes at an important time\" amid Israel's war in Gaza, and that the agreement was an \"additional positive step towards achieving Palestinian national unity.\"\n\nFatah, formally called the Palestinian National Liberation Movement, is led by Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority (PA). The PA, and Fatah as its dominant party, govern the West Bank -- a Palestinian territory occupied by Israel.\n\nChinese state media hailed the agreement, saying it was signed by 14 Palestinian factions, while Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called it a \"historic moment for the cause of Palestine's liberation.\"\n\nBut this is far from the first time that Hamas and Fatah have signed reconciliation pacts, only to return to hostilities due to persisting disagreements.\n\n\"Before everyone gets excited and files a batch of stories about China as the Middle East's new diplomatic power: a reminder that, since 2006, Hamas and Fatah also signed reconciliation agreements in Algiers, Cairo, Doha, Mecca and Sana'a, none of which actually reconciled them,\" Gregg Carlstrom, author of the book \"How Long Will Israel Survive? The Threat From Within,\" wrote in a post on X.\n\nWhile statements following the talks highlighted the signatories' consensus on building an interim unity government that would be established with China's support, long-time observers of the region noted that meetings and declarations will not determine success for the diplomatic efforts.\n\n\"Since 2007, there have been numerous rounds of negotiation and even provisional agreements aimed at reconciliation but they have all failed,\" Taufiq Rahim, principal at 2040 Advisory and author of \"Middle East in Crisis & Conflict: A Primer,\" told CNBC.\n\n\"The devil is not in the details but the implementation,\" he said. \"Given the many uncertainties on the ground and the upcoming US elections the deal could be upended easily.\"\n\nChina has increasingly moved to expand its role in international diplomacy, making world headlines in March of 2023 when it helped broker a historic normalization agreement between then-adversaries Iran and Saudi Arabia.", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNBC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "natasha_turak@cnbc.com", "name": "Natasha Turak", "type": "author",

We are committed to national unity and we call for it,\"\n\nAbu Marzuk said after meeting Wang and the other envoys. The announcement comes more than nine months into the genocide.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Gaza.\n\nThe relentless fighting has plunged Gaza into a severe humanitarian crisis. China has sought to play a mediator role in the conflict, which has been rendered even more complex due to the intense rivalry between Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, and Fatah, which partially governs the occupied West Bank.\n\nIsrael has vowed to keep fighting until it destroys Hamas, and world powers, including key Israeli backer the United States, have scrambled to imagine scenarios for the governance of Gaza once the war ends. As Tuesday's meeting wrapped up in Beijing, Wang said the groups had committed to \"reconciliation\".\n\n\"The most prominent highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government around the governance of post-war Gaza,\" Wang said following the signing of the \"Beijing Declaration\" by the factions in the Chinese capital.\n\n\"Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community,\" Wang said. China, he added, was keen to \"play a constructive role in safeguarding peace and stability in the Middle East\". Beijing, Wang said, called for a \"comprehensive, lasting and sustainable ceasefire\", as well as efforts to promote Palestinian self-governance and full recognition of a Palestinian state at the UN.\n\nHamas and Fatah have been bitter rivals since Hamas fighters ejected Fatah from the Gaza Strip after deadly clashes that followed Hamas's resounding victory in a 2006 election.\n\nFatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which has partial administrative control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

We are committed to national unity and we call for it,\" Abu Marzuk said after meeting Wang and the other envoys.\n\nThe announcement comes more than nine months into a war sparked by Hamas's October attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nThe operatives also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 44 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.\n\nThe relentless fighting has plunged Gaza into a severe humanitarian crisis.\n\nChina has sought to play a mediator role in the conflict, which has been rendered even more complex due to the intense rivalry between Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, and Fatah, which partially governs the occupied West Bank.\n\nIsrael has vowed to keep fighting until

committed to \"reconciliation\".\n\n\"The most prominent highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government around the governance of post-war Gaza,\" Wang said after the factions signed the \"Beijing Declaration\" in the Chinese capital.\n\n\"Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it cannot be achieved without the

all our friendship, from all the Palestinian people,\" he said.\n\nNotably, he did not mention whether any agreement had been reached with Hamas and the other factions.\n\nAlso present at Tuesday's meeting were envoys from Egypt, Algeria and Russia, according to Wang.\n\nEgypt, which neighbours Israel and Gaza, is a key mediator in the conflict.\n\nAlgeria is a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council and has drafted resolutions on the war.\n\nAnd while Western powers have sought to isolate Russia over its Ukraine invasion, China has maintained its strategic partnership with Moscow.\n\n'Peace and stability'\n\nChina, Wang said, was keen to \"play a constructive role in safeguarding peace and stability in the Middle East\".\n\nHe also called for a \"comprehensive, lasting

In reality, this won't happen because Hamas' rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands,\" Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on X.\n\nBadran said the national unity government would manage the affairs of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, oversee reconstruction, and prepare conditions for elections.\n\nCurrently Hamas runs Gaza and Fatah forms the backbone of the Palestinian Authority, which has limited control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. There has been no immediate comment from Fatah.\n\nDetails of the agreement did not set out a timeframe for forming a new government. In March, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who heads Fatah, appointed a new government led by one of his close aides, Mohammad Mustafa.\n\nTWO-STATE SOLUTION\n\nNonetheless, the agreement marks a diplomatic coup for Beijing and its growing influence in the Middle East, after it brokered a breakthrough peace deal between longstanding regional foes Saudi Arabia and Iran last year.\n\n\"The core achievement is to make it clear that the Palestine Liberation Organization is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people,\" Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said during the closing ceremony, according to the readout.\n\n\"China sincerely hopes that the Palestinian factions will achieve Palestinian independence at an early date on the basis of internal reconciliation, and is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with relevant parties to jointly work to implement the Beijing Declaration reached today.\"\n\nThe most \"prominent highlight\" was the agreement on forming an interim national reconciliation government around the post-war governance of Gaza, Wang said, adding that the international community should support efforts to form an interim Palestinian government to control Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nHamas and Islamic Jihad are not members of the PLO, the Palestinians' highest decision-making body, but they demand that any unity deal includes holding an election for the PLO parliament to secure their inclusion. The Islamist groups are at odds with the current PLO over peace accords with Israel.\n\n\"This declaration comes at an important time as our people are facing a genocidal war, especially in the Gaza Strip,\" a statement quoted Badran as saying.\n\nRival factions Hamas and Fatah first met in Beijing in April to discuss reconciliation efforts to end around 17 years of disputes, the first time a Hamas delegation was publicly known to have visited China since the war in Gaza began.\n\nThe second round of talks, originally planned for last month, were delayed as both factions traded blame.\n\nThe long-feuding Palestinian factions have previously failed to heal their political disputes after Hamas fighters expelled Fatah from Gaza in a short war in 2007.\n\nChinese officials have ramped up advocacy for the Palestinians in international forums in recent months, calling for a larger-scale Israeli-Palestinian peace conference and a specific timetable to implement a two-state solution.", "source": {"uri": "kayhanlife.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KAYHAN LIFE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kayhan_life@kayhanlife.com", "name": "Kayhan Life", "type": "author", "isAgency":

We are committed to national unity and we call for it,\" Abu Marzouk said after meeting Wang and the other envoys.\n\nThe announcement comes more than nine months into a war sparked by Hamas's 7 October attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 44 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed 39,006 people, also mostly civilians, with a further 89,818 wounded, according to data from the health ministry in Gaza.\n\nThe relentless fighting has plunged Gaza into a severe humanitarian crisis.\n\nChina has sought to play a mediator role in the conflict, which has been rendered even more complex due to the intense rivalry between Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, and Fatah, which partially governs the Israeli occupied West Bank.\n\nIsrael has vowed to keep fighting until it destroys Hamas, and world powers including key Israeli backer the United States have scrambled to imagine scenarios for the governance of Gaza once the war ends.\n\nNeither Israel nor the United States would sanction any post-war plan that includes Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Washington.\n\nWhile it is unclear whether the deal announced in Beijing on Tuesday can hold, it does indicate that the only world power that can engineer a rapprochement between the Palestinian rivals is China.\n\nAs Tuesday's meeting wrapped up in Beijing, Wang said the groups had committed to \"reconciliation\".\n\n\"The most prominent highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government around the governance of post-war Gaza,\" Wang said after the factions signed the \"Beijing declaration\" in the Chinese capital.\n\n\"Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community,\" Wang said.\n\nFatah official Mahmoud al-Aloul thanked China for its \"unending support\" for the Palestinian cause.\n\n\"To China, you have our love, you have all our friendship, from all the Palestinian people,\" he said.\n\nNotably, he did not mention whether any agreement had been reached with Hamas and the other factions.\n\nAlso present at Tuesday's meeting were envoys from Egypt, Algeria and Russia, according to Wang.\n\nEgypt, which neighbours Israel and Gaza, is a key mediator in the conflict.\n\nAlgeria is a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, and has drafted resolutions on the war.\n\nAnd while Western powers have sought to isolate Russia over its Ukraine invasion, China has maintained its strategic partnership with Moscow.\n\nChina, Wang said, was keen to \"play a constructive role in safeguarding peace and stability in the Middle East\".\n\nHe also called for a \"comprehensive, lasting and sustainable ceasefire\", as well as efforts to promote Palestinian self-governance and full recognition of a Palestinian state at the UN.\n\nHamas and Fatah have been bitter rivals since Hamas fighters ejected Fatah from the Gaza Strip after deadly clashes that followed Hamas's resounding victory in a 2006 election.\n\nFatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which has partial administrative control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nSeveral reconciliation bids have failed, but calls have grown since the Hamas October attack and nine-month war in Gaza, with Israeli raids and settler violence against Palestinians also soaring in the West Bank where Fatah is based.\n\nChina hosted Fatah and Hamas in April but a meeting scheduled for June was postponed.\n\nChina has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and supportive of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nChina has positioned itself as a more neutral actor on the Israel-Palestinian conflict than its rival the United States, advocating for a two-state solution while also maintaining good ties with Israel.\n\nAnd it has sought to play a greater role in the Middle East in recent years, facilitating last year's historic rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran.", "source": {"uri": "newarab.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Arab"}, "authors":

The talks came as the future governance of the Palestinian territories remains uncertain following Israel's repeated promise to eradicate Hamas in response to the Oct. 7 terror attack on its territory.\n\nThe PLO is a coalition of parties that signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1993 and formed a new government within the Palestinian Authority (PA).\n\nFatah dominates both the PLO and the PA, the interim Palestinian government established in the Israeli-occupied West Bank after the signing of the 1993 Oslo Accords. Hamas was not a party to the accords and does not recognize Israel.\n\nMustafa Barghouti, chairman of the Palestinian National Initiative, who was present at the Beijing talks, said all parties had agreed to join the PLO and that the organization was the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinians.\n\nThere is a long history of bitter enmity between Hamas and Fatah. The two sides have repeatedly tried to reach an agreement to unite the two separate Palestinian territories under a single governance structure, with the 2017 deal quickly turning violent.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority exercised administrative control over Gaza until 2007, after Hamas won the 2006 legislative elections in the occupied territories and expelled it from the Gaza Strip. Since then, Hamas has ruled Gaza and the Palestinian Authority has governed parts of the West Bank.\n\nHamas and Fatah signed a reconciliation deal in Cairo in October 2017, under pressure from Arab states led by Egypt. Under the deal, a new unity government was to take administrative control of Gaza two months later, ending a decade of rivalry that began when Hamas violently expelled the Palestinian Authority from Gaza in 2007.\n\nBut the deal's ambitions were quickly dashed. When Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah visited Gaza in March 2018, he was the target of an assassination attempt when a bomb exploded near his convoy. Hamdallah's Fatah party immediately blamed Hamas for the attack.\n\nBarghouti said the latest attempt at reconciliation between Palestinian factions went much further than previous efforts and included specific steps toward forming a consensus government.\n\nThe war in Gaza, he told CNN, has pushed factions to unite in a common front against the Israeli occupation.\n\nThere is a very clear sense that what Israel is doing is a threat to everyone, he said. And so in that sense, the sense of unity to confront the Israeli side is very clear here.\n\nA new government would ensure the unity of the occupied West Bank and Gaza, governing the two territories after the war and effectively blocking Israeli efforts to maintain its occupation of Gaza, he said.\n\nMost Palestinians, however, would take the news of reconciliation with the usual caution and pessimism, said Tahani Mustafa, a senior Palestine analyst at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank.\n\nThe main issues that have stood in the way of reconciliation in the past have not been addressed, she told CNN. It is highly unlikely that anything substantial will come of it, especially since the biggest obstacle so far has been Mahmoud Abbas (president of the Palestinian Authority and leader of Fatah) and his absolute unwillingness to give up his monopoly on power in any way.\n\nHamas is not opposed to the PLO but demands equal representation within the organization, she added. Abbas has been reluctant to accept this because it would mean Fatah would lose its hegemony over the last Palestinian political institution it controls.\n\nAt a press conference in Beijing on Tuesday, Hamas delegation representative Mousa Abu Marzook said they had reached an agreement to complete a reconciliation process, while using Beijing's platform to defend the group's October 7 attack on Israel.\n\n\"We are at a historic turning point. Our people are rising up in their struggle efforts,\" Abu Marzook said, according to a translation provided by the Chinese Foreign Ministry, adding that the October 7 operation had changed a lot in both the international and regional landscape.\n\nBeijing has not explicitly condemned Hamas for its October 7 attack on Israel.\n\nTuesday's deal follows a previous round of negotiations between Hamas and Fatah brokered by Beijing in April.\n\nSince the start of the Gaza war, China, which has sought to strengthen its influence and ties in the Middle East in recent years, has presented itself as a leading voice for countries in the Global South denouncing Israel's war in the enclave and calling for the creation of a Palestinian state.\n\nIn May, Chinese leader Xi Jinping called for an international peace conference during his meetings with Arab leaders and also dispatched a special envoy to the Middle East to meet with diplomats and officials.\n\nObservers have questioned the extent of Beijing's geopolitical influence in a region where the United States has long been a dominant power, but China surprised many last March when it played a role as a broker in a rapprochement between longtime rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\nThese efforts have been widely seen as part of Beijing's push to position itself as a geopolitical heavyweight with a different worldview from the United States.\n\nTuesday's deal also came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in the United States for a highly anticipated visit during which he will meet with senior U.S. officials and address Congress.\n\nIsrael launched its military operations in Gaza after the October 7 Hamas attack, which left more than 1,100 dead and about 250 kidnapped. About 39,000 Palestinians have died in the conflict, which has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis and widespread destruction.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Instead of rejecting terrorism, Mahmoud Abbas embraces the murderers and rapists of Hamas, revealing his true face.\n\n'In reality, this won't happen because Hamas's rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands,' he added.\n\nThis comes after Hamas on Tuesday said that it had signed an agreement in Beijing with other Palestinian organisations including rivals Fatah to work together for 'national unity', with China describing it as a deal to rule Gaza together once the war ends.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who hosted senior Hamas official Musa Abu Marzuk, Fatah envoy Mahmud al-Aloul and emissaries from 12 other Palestinian groups, said they had agreed to set up an 'interim national reconciliation government' to govern post-war Gaza.\n\nMahmoud al-Aloul, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of Palestinian organisation and political party Fatah, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi, and Mussa Abu Marzuk, senior member of the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, attend an event at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing on Tuesday after Hamas said that it had signed an agreement in Beijing with other Palestinian organisations including rivals Fatah to work together for 'national unity'\n\nIraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz has slammed the deal, and said on X that Hamas will be 'crushed'\n\n'Today we sign an agreement for national unity and we say that the path to completing this journey is national unity.

The following year, amid escalating tensions, Hamas routed forces loyal to Abbas in Gaza. It has ruled the impoverished coastal enclave ever since.\n\nThe accord provided no guarantees or timelines but marked the initial step forward for two rival groups (Pedro Pardo/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nDuring the current war, Hamas officials have said the group does not want to return to ruling Gaza and advocates forming a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions.\n\nThat government would then prepare for elections in Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nReacting to the announcement out of China, Israel's foreign minister said no joint governance between Hamas and Fatah in Gaza will take place \"because Hamas' rule will be crushed\".\n\nThe agreement also underscored China's attempts to have a growing role in Middle East diplomacy, after its success in mediating the restoration of relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\n\"To be sure, China is still in the process of trying to earn credibility as a global mediator,\" said James Char, a research fellow at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n\nOfficials from Fatah, Hamas and 12 other factions met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, concluding talks that started Sunday, according to a post on social media platform Weibo from Chinese TV network CGTN.\n\nThe two rival groups have said that they are committed to the creation of a Palestinian state on lands captured by Israel in the 1960s (Abdel Kareem Hana/AP)\n\nThe Palestinian factions issued a joint statement announcing the deal but giving no details on how or when the government would be formed, saying only that it would be done \"by agreement among the factions\".\n\nIt said they promised to follow up on previous reconciliation agreements signed in 2011 and 2022.\n\nIn the statement, all the factions, including Hamas, said they were committed to the creation of a Palestinian state on lands Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.\n\nHamas, whose original charter directly called for Israel's destruction, has said it would accept a Palestinian state based on the pre-1967 war borders but refuses to officially recognise Israel.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, has recognised Israel and works within the framework of peace deals signed in the early 1990s.\n\nThose deals were supposed to lead to an eventual state in the West Bank and Gaza, but talks have been defunct for years, leaving it in charge of only isolated West Bank enclaves.\n\nA ceasefire proposal is still in the works as Israel and Hamas try to come to an agreement to end the war (AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana)\n\nMany Palestinians view the authority as corrupt, out of touch and a subcontractor for Israel because of their joint security co-ordination.\n\nThe unity announcement is based on widening the membership of the Fatah-led Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), including Hamas, said Jamal Nazzal, a Fatah spokesperson.\n\n\"It's a long way ahead, and most of it will be implemented after a possible ceasefire,\" he added.\n\nHamas members have never been part of the PLO, the umbrella group of Palestinian factions that undergirds the Palestinian Authority.\n\nHusam Badran, a Hamas political official based in Qatar, called the agreement a further \"positive step towards achieving Palestinian national unity\".\n\nUS President Joe Biden's administration envisions a revamped Palestinian Authority ruling post-war Gaza and has sought reforms that might make it a viable presence in the war-ravaged territory. However, Israel rejected that idea.\n\nThe Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group allied with Hamas, issued a statement after the talks saying it still \"rejects any formula that includes recognition of Israel explicitly or implicitly\" and that it had \"demanded the withdrawal of the Palestine Liberation Organisation's recognition of Israel\".", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

The lack of a postwar vision for running the Gaza Strip has complicated negotiations over a cease-fire.\n\nSince the current war broke out in Gaza almost 10 months ago, Hamas officials have said that the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and the group has called for formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nThe two groups signed the Beijing Declaration on \"ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity,\" according to state broadcaster CCTV.\n\nIsrael's Foreign Minister, Israel Katz, swiftly rejected the agreement Tuesday, stating that no joint governance between Hamas and Fatah in Gaza will take place \"because Hamas's rule will be crushed.\"\n\nThe two rival Palestinian groups, along with 12 other political factions, met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, concluding talks that started Sunday, according to a post on social media platform Weibo from Chinese TV network CGTN.\n\nThe agreement also underscores China's growing role in Middle East diplomacy, with success in the restoration of relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\n\"But to be sure, China is still the process of trying to earn credibility as a global mediator,\" said James Char, a research fellow at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n\nA joint statement issued after the most recent talks in Beijing gave no details on how or when the government would be formed, saying only that it would be done \"by agreement among the factions.\" According to the joint statement, the two groups are committed to the creation of a Palestinian state on lands Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.\n\nThe deal does not appear to bridge the two group's diverging position on Israel. Hamas previously said it would accept a state based on 1967 borders, while also refusing to officially recognize Israel. The Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, abides by interim peace agreements with Israel signed in the early 1990s.\n\nThe agreement signed by the Palestinian factions promised to follow up on previous reconciliation agreements signed in both 2011 and 2022.\n\n\"The understanding in China is based on widening the scope of the membership on the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) to include other factions who have not joined it\" including Hamas, said Jamal Nazzal, a Fatah spokesperson.\n\n\"It's a long way ahead, and most of it will be implemented after a possible cease-fire,\" he added.\n\nFatah and Hamas have been rivals since Hamas violently routed forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah in Gaza in 2007, taking over the impoverished coastal enclave. The Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, headed by Abbas, administers parts of the occupied West Bank. It is widely viewed by the Palestinian public as corrupt, out of touch, and a subcontractor for Israel because of their joint security coordination.\n\nHamas members have never been part of PLO, the Palestinian government body responsible for international affairs. In a statement, Husam Badran, a Hamas political official based in Qatar, praised the agreement, describing it as a further \"positive step towards achieving Palestinian national unity.\"\n\nBut Tuesday's deal doesn't have a hard timeline.\n\n\"There is an opportunity ... but it is not big, because it lacks a specific timetable for implementation,\" said Hani Al-Masry, an expert on Palestinian reconciliation affairs.\n\nRepeated attempts at mending the rift have failed, wrecked by the factions' own bitter rivalry over power and the West's refusal to accept any government that includes Hamas unless it expressly recognizes Israel.\n\nUnited States President Joe Biden's administration envisions a revamped Palestinian Authority to rule postwar Gaza and has sought a series of reforms that might make it a viable presence in the war-ravaged territory. Israel rejected that idea, but has not put forward a credible alternative for who will govern Gaza.\n\nThe Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group allied with Hamas, issued a statement Tuesday after the talks saying that it still \"rejects any formula that includes recognition of Israel explicitly or implicitly\" and that it had \"demanded the withdrawal of the Palestine Liberation Organization's recognition of Israel.\"\n\nGoldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel; Wu reported from Bangkok.

We are committed to national unity and we call for it,\" Abu Marzuk said after meeting Wang and the other envoys.\n\nThe announcement comes more than nine months into a war sparked by Hamas's October attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 44 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.\n\nThe relentless fighting has plunged Gaza into a severe humanitarian crisis.\n\nChina has sought to play a mediator role in the conflict, which has been rendered even more complex due to the intense rivalry between Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, and Fatah, which partially governs the occupied West Bank.\n\nIsrael has vowed to keep fighting until it destroys Hamas, and world powers including key Israeli backer the United States have scrambled to imagine scenarios for the governance of Gaza once the war ends.\n\nAs Tuesday's meeting wrapped up in Beijing, Wang said the groups had committed to \"reconciliation\".\n\n\"The most prominent highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government around the governance of post-war Gaza,\" Wang said following the signing of the \"Beijing declaration\" by the factions in the Chinese capital.\n\nMore from this section Yonkers fire department gets life-saving thermal

and stability' -\n\nChina, he added, was keen to \"play a constructive role in safeguarding peace and stability in the Middle East\".\n\nBeijing, Wang said, called for a \"comprehensive, lasting and sustainable ceasefire\", as well as efforts to promote Palestinian self-governance and full recognition of a Palestinian state at the UN.\n\nHamas and Fatah have been bitter rivals since Hamas fighters ejected Fatah from the Gaza Strip after deadly clashes that followed Hamas's resounding victory in a 2006 election.\n\nFatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which has partial administrative control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nSeveral reconciliation bids have failed, but calls have grown since the Hamas October attack and nine-month war in Gaza, with violence also soaring in the West Bank where Fatah is based.\n\nChina hosted Fatah and Hamas in April but a meeting scheduled for June was postponed.\n\nChina has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and supportive of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nisk-oho/je/ser/cwl", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"},

In reality, this won't happen because Hamas' rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands,\" Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on X.\n\nBadran said the national unity government would manage the affairs of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, oversee reconstruction, and prepare conditions for elections.\n\nCurrently Hamas runs Gaza and Fatah forms the backbone of the Palestinian Authority, which has limited control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. There has been no immediate comment from Fatah.\n\nDetails of the agreement did not set out a timeframe for forming a new government. In March, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who heads Fatah, appointed a new government led by one of his close aides, Mohammad Mustafa.\n\nTWO-STATE SOLUTION\n\nNonetheless, the agreement marks a diplomatic coup for Beijing and its growing influence in the Middle East, after it brokered a breakthrough peace deal between longstanding regional foes Saudi Arabia and Iran last year.\n\n\"The core achievement is to make it clear that the Palestine Liberation Organization is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people,\" Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said during the closing ceremony, according to the readout.\n\n\"China sincerely hopes that the Palestinian factions will achieve Palestinian independence at an early date on the basis of internal reconciliation, and is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with relevant parties to jointly work to implement the Beijing Declaration reached today.\"\n\nThe most \"prominent highlight\" was the agreement on forming an interim national reconciliation government around the post-war governance of Gaza, Wang said, adding that the international community should support efforts to form an interim Palestinian government to control Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nHamas and Islamic Jihad are not members of the PLO, the Palestinians' highest decision-making body, but they demand that any unity deal includes holding an election for the PLO parliament to secure their inclusion. The Islamist groups are at odds with the current PLO over peace accords with Israel.\n\n\"This declaration comes at an important time as our people are facing a genocidal war, especially in the Gaza Strip,\" a statement quoted Badran as saying.\n\nRival factions Hamas and Fatah first met in Beijing in April to discuss reconciliation efforts to end around 17 years of disputes, the first time a Hamas delegation was publicly known to have visited China since the war in Gaza began.\n\nThe second round of talks, originally planned for last month, were delayed as both factions traded blame.\n\nThe long-feuding Palestinian factions have previously failed to heal their political disputes after Hamas fighters expelled Fatah from Gaza in a short war in 2007.\n\nChinese officials have ramped up advocacy for the Palestinians in international forums in recent months, calling for a larger-scale Israeli-Palestinian peace conference and a specific timetable to implement a two-state

Last year, it brokered a breakthrough peace deal between longstanding regional foes Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\nPalestinian factions including rivals Hamas and Fatah agreed to end their divisions and form an interim national unity government during negotiations in China that ended on Tuesday, China's foreign ministry said.\n\nThe Beijing Declaration was signed at the closing ceremony of a reconciliation dialogue among 14 Palestinian factions held in China's capital from July 21-23, according to the readout.\n\nPrevious efforts by Egypt and other Arab countries to reconcile Hamas and Fatah have failed to end 17 years of power-sharing conflict that have weakened Palestinian political aspirations, and it remains to be seen whether this deal will survive the realities on the ground.\n\nNETANYAHU'S MEETING AT WHITE HOUSE MOVED AMID BIDEN'S COVID RECOVERY, HARRIS CAMPAIGNING\n\nThe meeting was held amid attempts by international mediators to reach a ceasefire deal for Gaza, with one of the sticking points being the \"day-after\" plan - how the Hamas-run enclave will be governed once the war that began on Oct. 7 ends.\n\nSenior Hamas official Hussam Badran said the most important point of the Beijing Declaration was to form a Palestinian national unity government to manage the affairs of Palestinians.\n\n\"This creates a formidable barrier against all regional and international interventions that seek to impose realities against our people's interests in managing Palestinian affairs post-war,\" Badran said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his goal is to destroy the Iran-backed Hamas group and opposes it having any role in a post-war Gaza administration.\n\n\"Instead of rejecting terrorism, (Fatah leader) Mahmoud Abbas embraces the murderers and rapists of Hamas, revealing his true face. In reality, this won't happen because Hamas' rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands,\" Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on X.\n\nBadran said the national unity government would manage the affairs of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, oversee reconstruction, and prepare conditions for elections.\n\nCurrently, Hamas runs Gaza and Fatah forms the backbone of the Palestinian Authority, which has limited control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. There has been no immediate comment from Fatah.\n\nDetails of the agreement did not set out a timeframe for forming a new government. In March, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who heads Fatah, appointed a new government led by one of his close aides, Mohammad Mustafa.\n\nAshraf Abouelhoul, a specialist on Palestinian affairs, said previous similar declarations had not been implemented and nothing would happen without U.S. approval.\n\n\"Forming a unity government with Hamas is rejected by the United States, Israel, and Britain. There is a consensus among those countries to exclude Hamas from any role in the day after the war,\" Abouelhoul said.\n\n\"What happened in China was nothing but a meeting, a celebratory event, but it is impossible to resolve the problems between Palestinian factions in just three days,\" said Abouelhoul, managing editor of the Egyptian state-owned paper Al-Ahram.\n\nISRAEL STRIKES IRAN-BACKED HOUTHIS AFTER TEHRAN PROXY ATTACKED JEWISH STATE: 'SIGNIFICANCE IS CLEAR'\n\nNonetheless, the agreement marks a diplomatic coup for Beijing and its growing influence in the Middle East, after it brokered a breakthrough peace deal between longstanding regional foes Saudi Arabia and Iran last year.\n\n\"The core achievement is to make it clear that the Palestine Liberation Organization is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people,\" Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said during the closing ceremony, according to the readout.\n\n\"China sincerely hopes that the Palestinian factions will achieve Palestinian independence at an early date on the basis of internal reconciliation, and is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with relevant parties to jointly work to implement the Beijing Declaration reached today.\"\n\nThe most \"prominent highlight\" was the agreement on forming an interim national reconciliation government around the post-war governance of Gaza, Wang said, adding that the international community should support efforts to form an interim Palestinian government to control Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nHamas and Islamic Jihad are not members of the PLO, the Palestinians' highest decision-making body, but they demand that any unity deal includes holding an election for the PLO parliament to secure their inclusion. The Islamist groups are at odds with the current PLO over peace accords with Israel.\n\n\"This declaration comes at an important time as our people are facing a genocidal war, especially in the Gaza Strip,\" a statement quoted Badran as saying.\n\nRival factions Hamas and Fatah first met in Beijing in April to discuss reconciliation efforts to end around 17 years of disputes, the first time a Hamas delegation was publicly known to have visited China since the war in Gaza began.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe second round of talks, originally planned for last month, were delayed as both factions traded blame.\n\nThe long-feuding Palestinian factions have previously failed to heal their political disputes after Hamas fighters expelled Fatah from Gaza in a short war in 2007.\n\nChinese officials have ramped up advocacy for the Palestinians in international forums in recent months, calling for a larger-scale Israeli-Palestinian peace conference and a specific timetable to implement a two-state solution.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Beijing Declaration was signed, marking a significant diplomatic achievement for China. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu opposes Hamas' role in post-war Gaza. This agreement aims for Palestinian national unity amid ongoing conflicts.\n\nVarious Palestinian factions, including rivals Hamas and Fatah, have reached an agreement to end their divisions and form a national unity government. The negotiations, which took place in China, concluded on Tuesday, Chinese state media confirmed.\n\nThe Beijing Declaration was signed at the closing ceremony of a reconciliation dialogue in Beijing from July 21-23, state broadcaster CCTV reported. According to senior Hamas official Hussam Badran, forming a Palestinian national unity government is the declaration's crucial element.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu aims to dismantle the Iran-backed Hamas group and opposes its involvement in any post-war Gaza administration. Fourteen Palestinian factions, including leaders from Fatah and Hamas, met with the media, with China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi present, CGTN reported in a social media post.\n\nThis diplomatic success underscores Beijing's growing influence in the Middle East, following last year's historical peace deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran facilitated by China. Badran commended China for its role in hosting the talks and achieving the declaration.\n\nBadran emphasized the declaration's importance, given the ongoing conflict, especially in the Gaza Strip.

We are committed to national unity and we call for it,\" Abu Marzuk said after meeting Wang and the other envoys.The announcement comes more than nine months into a war sparked by Hamas's October attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 44 the Israeli military says are dead.Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.The relentless fighting has plunged Gaza into a severe humanitarian crisis.China has sought to play a mediator role in the conflict, which has been rendered even more complex due to the intense rivalry between Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, and Fatah, which partially governs the occupied West Bank.Israel has vowed to keep fighting until it destroys Hamas, and world powers including key Israeli backer the United States have scrambled to imagine scenarios for the governance of Gaza once the war ends.Neither Israel nor the United States would sanction any post-war plan that includes Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Washington.While it is unclear whether the deal announced in Beijing on Tuesday can hold, it does indicate that the only world power that can engineer a rapprochement between the Palestinian rivals is China.As Tuesday's meeting wrapped up in Beijing, Wang said the groups had committed to \"reconciliation\".\"The most prominent highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government around the governance of post-war Gaza,\" Wang said after the factions signed the \"Beijing declaration\" in the Chinese capital.\"Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community,\" Wang said.Fatah official Mahmoud al-Aloul thanked China for its \"unending support\" for the Palestinian cause.\"To China, you have our love, you have all our friendship, from all the Palestinian people,\" he said.Notably, he did not mention whether any agreement had been reached with Hamas and the other factions.Also present at Tuesday's meeting were envoys from Egypt, Algeria and Russia, according to Wang.Egypt, which neighbours Israel and Gaza, is a key mediator in the conflict.&nbsp;Algeria is a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, and has drafted resolutions on the war.And while Western powers have sought to isolate Russia over its Ukraine invasion, China has maintained its strategic partnership with Moscow.- 'Peace and stability' -China, Wang said, was keen to \"play a constructive role in safeguarding peace and stability in the Middle East\".He also called for a \"comprehensive, lasting and sustainable ceasefire\", as well as efforts to promote Palestinian self-governance and full recognition of a Palestinian state at the UN.Hamas and Fatah have been bitter rivals since Hamas fighters ejected Fatah from the Gaza Strip after deadly clashes that followed Hamas's resounding victory in a 2006 election.Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which has partial administrative control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.Several reconciliation bids have failed, but calls have grown since the Hamas October attack and nine-month war in Gaza, with violence also soaring in the West Bank where Fatah is based.China hosted Fatah and Hamas in April but a meeting scheduled for June was postponed.China has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and supportive of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.China has positioned itself as a more neutral actor on the Israel-Palestinian conflict than its rival the United States, advocating for a two-state solution while also maintaining good ties with Israel.And it has sought to play a greater role in the Middle East in recent years, facilitating last year's historic rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran.isk-oho/je/ser", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type":

But previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations will actually lead to a resolution. It also comes as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed ceasefire proposal that would wind down the nine-month war and potentially free 120 Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\n\"Today we sign an agreement for national unity and we say that the path to completing this journey is national unity. We are committed to national unity and we call for it,\" Abu Marzouk said after meeting Wang and the other envoys.\n\nIsrael lambasted Fatah for agreeing to reconciliation with the terror group.\n\n\"Instead of rejecting terrorism, Mahmoud Abbas embraces the murderers and rapists of Hamas, revealing his true face,\" Foreign Minister Israel Katz wrote on X, referring to the PA president.\n\n\"In reality, this won't happen because Hamas's rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar,\" he wrote in English. \"Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands.\"\n\nThe declaration comes as negotiations continue between Israel and Hamas for a hostage-ceasefire deal to end the war in Gaza, which began on October 7 when thousands of Hamas-led terrorists invaded southern Israel from the Gaza Strip, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages.\n\nIt is believed that 120 hostages are currently held in Gaza, including the bodies of over 40 confirmed dead by the IDF. A framework endorsed by both sides would see Hamas release the remaining hostages in stages, in exchange for a permanent ceasefire and the release of hundreds of Palestinian security prisoners.\n\nA previous Israel-Hamas deal in November saw 105 civilian hostages released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian security prisoners, during a weeklong truce.\n\nSince October 7, Hamas officials have said that the group does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and have called for the formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections in both Gaza and the West Bank with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nThe agreement underscored China's growing role in Middle East diplomacy, after success in the restoration of relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\nAlso present at Tuesday's meeting were envoys from Egypt, Algeria and Russia, according to Wang.\n\nA joint statement issued after the most recent talks in Beijing gave no details on how or when a new Palestinian government might be formed, saying only that it would be done \"by agreement among the factions.\"\n\nAccording to the joint statement, the two groups are committed to the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt, respectively, in 1967, during the Six Day War.\n\nFatah and Hamas have been rivals since Hamas violently routed forces loyal to Abbas's Fatah in Gaza in 2007, taking over the coastal enclave.\n\nThe deadly internal fighting happened after Hamas won a Palestinian legislative election in 2006, following Israel's unilateral withdrawal from Gaza the previous year.\n\nThe Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, headed by Abbas, administers parts of the West Bank. It is widely viewed by the Palestinian public as corrupt and out of touch, and many resent its security coordination with Israel.\n\nRepeated attempts at mending the rift between Fatah and Hamas have failed, wrecked by the factions' bitter rivalry over power.\n\nUS President Joe Biden's administration envisions a revamped Palestinian Authority to rule postwar Gaza and has sought a series of reforms that might make it a viable presence in the war-ravaged territory. Israel has rejected that idea, but has not put forward a credible alternative for who will govern Gaza.\n\nPalestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller terror group allied with Hamas, issued a statement Tuesday after the talks saying that it still \"rejects any formula that includes recognition of Israel explicitly or implicitly\" and that it had \"demanded the withdrawal of the Palestine Liberation Organization's recognition of Israel.\"", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "timesofisrael.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mahmoud_al_aloul@timesofisrael.com", "name":

Previous such declarations have failed, raising doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might lead to a resolution between Hamas, which has ruled the Gaza Strip for the past 17 years, and Fatah, the main force in the U.S.-backed Palestinian Authority that administers parts of the occupied West Bank.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nIsrael swiftly denounced the agreement. The U.S. and other Western countries have refused to accept any Palestinian government that includes Hamas unless it expressly recognizes Israel -- a factor that has helped wreck past unity attempts, along with the factions' own competition for power.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nChinese state broadcaster CCTV announced that the two sides and other, smaller Palestinian factions signed the Beijing Declaration on \"ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity,\" pledging to form a unity government for the Palestinian territories. The agreement offered only broad outlines on how they would work together.\n\n\"There is an opportunity ... but it is not big, because it lacks a specific timetable for implementation,\" said Hani Al-Masry, an expert on Palestinian reconciliation affairs.\n\nThe declaration comes at a sensitive time, as the war in Gaza rages on into its 10th month and as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nOne of the thorniest issues is the question of who will run Gaza after the war -- and the unity efforts are in part motivated by Palestinians' desire to offer a scenario for postwar rule.\n\nBut Israel vehemently opposes any role for Hamas, which it has vowed to destroy after its Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. It also has rejected U.S. calls for the Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza after the fighting ends, though it has not presented a cohesive postwar vision of its own.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah has been deeply reluctant to share power with its longtime rival. Hamas won Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006. The following year, amid escalating tensions, Hamas routed forces loyal to Abbas in Gaza. It has ruled the impoverished coastal enclave ever since.\n\nDuring the current war, Hamas officials have said the group does not want to return to ruling Gaza and advocates forming a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions. That government would then prepare for elections in Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nReacting to the announcement out of China, Israel's foreign minister said no joint governance between Hamas and Fatah in Gaza will take place \"because Hamas' rule will be crushed.\"\n\nThe agreement also underscored China's attempts to have a growing role in Middle East diplomacy, after its success in mediating the restoration of relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\n\"To be sure, China is still in the process of trying to earn credibility as a global mediator,\" said James Char, a research fellow at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOfficials from Fatah, Hamas and 12 other factions met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, concluding talks that started Sunday, according to a post on social media platform Weibo from Chinese TV network CGTN.\n\nThe Palestinian factions issued a joint statement announcing the deal but giving no details on how or when the government would be formed, saying only that it would be done \"by agreement among the factions.\" It said they promised to follow up on previous reconciliation agreements signed in 2011 and 2022.\n\nIn the statement, all the factions including Hamas said they were committed to the creation of a Palestinian state on lands Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.\n\nHamas, whose original charter directly called for Israel's destruction, has said it would accept a Palestinian state based on the pre-1967 war borders but refuses to officially recognize Israel.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, has recognized Israel and works within the framework of peace deals signed in the early 1990s. Those deals were supposed to lead to an eventual state in the West Bank and Gaza, but talks have been defunct for years, leaving it in charge of only isolated West Bank enclaves. Many Palestinians view the authority as corrupt, out of touch and a subcontractor for Israel because of their joint security coordination.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe unity announcement is based on widening the membership of the Fatah-led Palestine Liberation Organization, including Hamas, said Jamal Nazzal, a Fatah spokesperson.\n\n\"It's a long way ahead, and most of it will be implemented after a possible cease-fire,\" he added.\n\nHamas members have never been part of the PLO, the umbrella group of Palestinian factions that undergirds the Palestinian Authority. Husam Badran, a Hamas political official based in Qatar, called the agreement a further \"positive step towards achieving Palestinian national unity.\"\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden's administration envisions a revamped Palestinian Authority ruling postwar Gaza and has sought reforms that might make it a viable presence in the war-ravaged territory. Israel rejected that idea.\n\nThe Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group allied with Hamas, issued a statement after the talks saying it still \"rejects any formula that includes recognition of Israel explicitly or implicitly\" and that it had \"demanded the withdrawal of the Palestine Liberation Organization's recognition of Israel.\"\n\n___\n\nGoldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel; Wu reported from Bangkok.

This came after Palestinian President and Fatah leader Mahmoud Abbas dissolved the Hamas-led unity government formed when Hamas won national elections the year before.\n\nSince then, the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority has been left in charge of only parts of the West Bank.\n\nHamas has lost control in Gaza since the war with Israel began on 7 October with Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel, in which it killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. More than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of the Israeli offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nIn a statement posted on Telegram, Hamas spokesman Hossam Badran said the declaration was an \"additional positive step on the path to achieving Palestinian national unity\".\n\nHe said the groups were in agreement on \"Palestinian demands relating to ending the war... which are: a ceasefire, complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, relief and reconstruction.\"\n\nHe said \"the most important\" part of what was agreed was to form a Palestinian national consensus government \"that would manage the affairs of our people in Gaza and the West Bank, supervise reconstruction, and prepare the conditions for elections\".\n\nThe declaration is in effect an expression of intent as there are major obstacles to making such an agreement work. Fatah has yet to comment on it, though its representative Mahmoud al-Aloul thanked China for its support of the Palestinian cause following the announcement.\n\nIsrael, which has vowed to destroy Hamas before it will end the war, swiftly dismissed the Beijing declaration.\n\n\"Instead of rejecting terrorism, Mahmoud Abbas embraces the murderers and rapists of Hamas, revealing his true face,\" Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on X.\n\n\"In reality, this won't happen because Hamas's rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands.\"\n\nBut the lack of success of past deals has not deterred China, which wants to broker peace in the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict and sees Palestinian unity as key to that outcome. Beijing previously hosted talks between Hamas and Fatah in April.\n\n\"China and Palestine are trustworthy brothers and good partners,\" said foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Tuesday, adding that China would \"work tirelessly with all relevant parties\" towards unity and reconciliation.\n\n\"Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community,\" said foreign minister Wang Yi after the declaration was signed, in remarks reported by Reuters news agency.\n\nHe also outlined a three-step plan to address the Gaza war: promoting a lasting ceasefire; upholding the \"principle of Palestinians governing Palestine\"; and recognising the state of Palestine as part of a two-state solution and giving them full UN membership.\n\nChina's support of Palestinian causes stretches back to the era of Chinese Communist Party leader Mao Zedong, who sent weapons to Palestinians in support for so-called \"national liberation\" movements around the world. Mao even compared Israel to Taiwan - both backed by the US - as bases of Western imperialism.\n\nIn their remarks on the latest conflict, Chinese officials and even President Xi Jinping have stressed the need for an independent Palestinian state. Mr Xi has also sent his top diplomats to the Middle East for talks and recently hosted Arab leaders for a conference in Beijing.\n\nThe conflict has also erupted at a time when China has ambitions to play a more direct role in international politics and has presented itself as a better suitor for the world than the US. Last year it brokered a deal between Middle East rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia to restore ties for the first time since 2016.\n\nSince then, it has promoted a vision of a Chinese-led world order while criticising what it sees as the failures of US \"hegemonic\" leadership.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We are committed to national unity and we call for it,\" Abu Marzuk said after meeting Wang and the other envoys.\n\nThe announcement comes more than nine months into a war sparked by Hamas's October attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 44 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.\n\nThe relentless fighting has plunged Gaza into a severe humanitarian crisis.\n\nChina has sought to play a mediator role in the conflict, which has been rendered even more complex due to the intense rivalry between Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, and Fatah, which partially governs the occupied West Bank.\n\nIsrael has vowed to keep fighting until it destroys Hamas, and world powers including key Israeli backer the United States have scrambled to imagine scenarios for the governance of Gaza once the war ends.\n\nNeither Israel nor the United States would sanction any post-war plan that includes Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Washington.\n\nWhile it is unclear whether the deal announced in Beijing on Tuesday can hold, it does indicate that the only world power that can engineer a rapprochement between the Palestinian rivals is China.\n\nAs Tuesday's meeting wrapped up in Beijing, Wang said the groups had committed to \"reconciliation\".\n\n\"The most prominent highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government around the governance of post-war Gaza,\" Wang said after the factions signed the \"Beijing declaration\" in the Chinese capital.\n\n\"Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community,\" Wang said.\n\nFatah official Mahmoud al-Aloul thanked China for its \"unending support\" for the Palestinian cause.\n\n\"To China, you have our love, you have all our friendship, from all the Palestinian people,\" he said.\n\nNotably, he did not mention whether any agreement had been reached with Hamas and the other factions.\n\nAlso present at Tuesday's meeting were envoys from Egypt, Algeria and Russia, according to Wang.\n\nEgypt, which neighbours Israel and Gaza, is a key mediator in the conflict.\n\nAlgeria is a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, and has drafted resolutions on the war.\n\nAnd while Western powers have sought to isolate Russia over its Ukraine invasion, China has maintained its strategic partnership with Moscow.\n\n- 'Peace and stability' -\n\nChina, Wang said, was keen to \"play a constructive role in safeguarding peace and stability in the Middle East\".\n\nHe also called for a \"comprehensive, lasting and sustainable ceasefire\", as well as efforts to promote Palestinian self-governance and full recognition of a Palestinian state at the UN.\n\nHamas and Fatah have been bitter rivals since Hamas fighters ejected Fatah from the Gaza Strip after deadly clashes that followed Hamas's resounding victory in a 2006 election.\n\nFatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which has partial administrative control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nSeveral reconciliation bids have failed, but calls have grown since the Hamas October attack and nine-month war in Gaza, with violence also soaring in the West Bank where Fatah is based.\n\nChina hosted Fatah and Hamas in April but a meeting scheduled for June was postponed.\n\nChina has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and supportive of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nChina has positioned itself as a more neutral actor on the Israel-Palestinian conflict than its rival the United States, advocating for a two-state solution while also maintaining good ties with Israel.\n\nAnd it has sought to play a greater role in the Middle East in recent years, facilitating last year's historic rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran.", "source": {"uri": "spacewar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SpaceWar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In reality, this won't happen because Hamas' rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands,\" Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on X.\n\nBadran said the national unity government would manage the affairs of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, oversee reconstruction, and prepare conditions for elections.\n\nCurrently Hamas runs Gaza and Fatah forms the backbone of the Palestinian Authority, which has limited control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nDetails of the agreement did not set out a timeframe for forming a new government. In March, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who heads Fatah, appointed a new government led by one of his close aides, Mohammad Mustafa.\n\nAshraf Abouelhoul, a specialist on Palestinian affairs, said previous similar declarations had not been implemented and nothing would happened without U.S. approval.\n\n\"Forming a unity government with Hamas is rejected by the United States, Israel, and Britain. There is a consensus among those countries to exclude Hamas from any role in the day after the war,\" Abouelhoul said.\n\n\"What happened in China was nothing but a meeting, a celebratory event, but it is impossible to resolve the problems between Palestinian factions in just three days,\" said Abouelhoul, managing editor of the Egyptian state-owned paper Al-Ahram.\n\nNonetheless, the agreement further demonstrates Beijing's growing influence in the Middle East, after it brokered a breakthrough peace deal between longstanding regional foes Saudi Arabia and Iran last year.\n\n\"The core achievement is to make it clear that the Palestine Liberation Organization is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people,\" Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said during the closing ceremony, according to the readout.\n\n\"China sincerely hopes that the Palestinian factions will achieve Palestinian independence at an early date on the basis of internal reconciliation, and is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with relevant parties to jointly work to implement the Beijing Declaration reached today.\"\n\nThe most \"prominent highlight\" was the agreement on forming an interim national reconciliation government around the post-war governance of Gaza, Wang said, adding that the international community should support efforts to form an interim Palestinian government to control Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nHamas and Islamic Jihad are not members of the PLO, the Palestinians' highest decision-making body, but they demand that any unity deal includes holding an election for the PLO parliament to secure their inclusion. The Islamist groups are at odds with the current PLO over peace accords with Israel.\n\n\"This declaration comes at an important time as our people are facing a genocidal war, especially in the Gaza Strip,\" a statement quoted Badran as saying.\n\nRival factions Hamas and Fatah first met in Beijing in April to discuss reconciliation efforts to end around 17 years of disputes, the first time a Hamas delegation was publicly known to have visited China since the war in Gaza began.\n\nThe second round of talks, originally planned for last month, were delayed as both factions traded blame.\n\nThe long-feuding Palestinian factions have previously failed to heal their political disputes after Hamas fighters expelled Fatah from Gaza in a short war in 2007.\n\nChinese officials have ramped up advocacy for the Palestinians in international forums in recent months, calling for a larger-scale Israeli-Palestinian peace conference and a specific timetable to implement a two-state solution.\n\n(Reporting by Liz Lee, Ethan Wang and Beijing newsroom, and Nidal al-Mughrabi in Cairo; Maayan Lubell in Jerusalem and Ali Sawafta in Ramallah; Writing by Laurie Chen in Beijing; Editing

The talks were held as the future governance of Palestinian territories remains in question as Israel's current leadership have vowed to eradicate Hamas, following the group's October 7 terrorist attack.\n\nThe Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is a coalition of parties that signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1993, and formed a new government in the Palestinian Authority (PA).\n\nFatah dominates both the PLO and the PA, the interim Palestinian government that was established in the Israeli-occupied West Bank after the 1993 agreement known as the Oslo Accords was signed. Hamas does not recognize Israel.\n\nThere is a long history of bitter enmity between Hamas in Gaza and Fatah. The two sides have tried - and failed - multiple times to reach an agreement to unite the two separate Palestinian territories under one governance structure, with a 2017 agreement quickly folding in violence.\n\nThe PA held administrative control over Gaza until 2007, after Hamas won the 2006 legislative elections in the occupied territories and expelled it from the strip. Since then, Hamas has ruled Gaza and the PA governs parts of the West Bank.\n\nAt a press conference Tuesday in Beijing, Hamas delegation representative Mousa Abu Marzook said they had reached an agreement to complete a \"course of reconciliation,\" while also using the platform in Beijing to defend the group's October 7 terrorist attack on Israel.\n\n\"We're at a historic junction. Our people are rising up in their efforts to struggle,\" Abu Marzook said, according to a translation provided by China's Foreign Ministry, adding that the October 7 operation had \"changed a lot, both in international and regional landscape.\"\n\nThe agreement comes as Beijing - which has sought to increase its influence and ties in the Middle East in recent years - has presented itself as a leading voice for countries across the Global South decrying Israel's war in Gaza and calling for Palestinian statehood.\n\nBeijing has not explicitly condemned Hamas for its October 7 attack on Israel.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping in May decried \"tremendous sufferings\" in the Middle East and called for an international peace conference as leaders from Arab nations visit Beijing, even as observers have questioned the extent of Beijing's geopolitical clout in a region where the US has long been a dominant power.\n\nThe agreement was also inked as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in the United States for a highly anticipated visit in which he will meet top US officials and address Congress.\n\nIsrael launched its military operations in Gaza following Hamas' October 7 attack that killed more than 1,100 people and saw roughly 250 others kidnapped. Around 39,000 Palestinians have died in Israel's war in Gaza that has triggered a mass humanitarian crisis and widespread destruction.\n\nHamas and Fatah signed a reconciliation agreement in Cairo in October 2017 under pressure from the Arab states, led by Egypt. Under the deal, a new unity government was supposed to take administrative control of Gaza two months later, ending a decade of rivalry that began when Hamas violently evicted the Palestinian Authority from Gaza in 2007.\n\nBut the deal's lofty aspirations quickly collapsed. When Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah visited Gaza in March 2018, he was the target of an assassination attempt when a bomb detonated near his convoy. Hamdallah's Fatah party immediately blamed Hamas for the attack.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors":

Representatives of Palestinian factions signed the 'Beijing Declaration' on ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity,\" Chinese state media outlet CGTN wrote in a post on local social media platform Weibo, according to a translation provided by the website and vetted by CNBC.\n\nThe \"inter-Palestinian reconciliation dialogue,\" as it was described by the state outlet, had been underway in Beijing since Sunday.\n\nThis renewed attempt at unity marks a significant development, as Hamas and Fatah have been bitter enemies ever since the bloody 2006-2007 civil war in the Gaza Strip. Fatah, the Palestinian political party then governed both the West Bank and the Gaza enclave at the time, was violently kicked out of the latter territory, following Hamas' election win in the Strip in 2006.\n\nHamas has governed the Gaza enclave since then and is currently embroiled in a brutal war with Israel. The offensive was triggered by the Hamas-led terror attacks of Oct. 7, which resulted in 1,200 deaths in Israel, with a further 253 people taken hostage by Hamas into the Gaza Strip, according to Israeli tallies. The Palestinian militant group is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. and U.K.\n\nIn the months since, Israel's retaliatory assaults on the Gaza Strip have killed nearly 39,000 Palestinians there, according to health authorities in the enclave.\n\nHussam Badran, a senior Hamas official taking part in the talks, said in a statement cited by Reuters that \"this declaration comes at an important time\" amid Israel's war in Gaza, and that the agreement was an \"additional positive step towards achieving Palestinian national unity.\"\n\nFatah, formally called the Palestinian National Liberation Movement, is led by Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority (PA). The PA, and Fatah as its dominant party, govern the West Bank -- a Palestinian territory occupied by Israel.\n\nChinese state media hailed the agreement, saying it was signed by 14 Palestinian factions, while Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called it a \"historic moment for the cause of Palestine's liberation.\"\n\nBut this is far from the first time that Hamas and Fatah have signed reconciliation pacts, only to return to hostilities due to persisting disagreements.\n\n\"Before everyone gets excited and files a batch of stories about China as the Middle East's new diplomatic power: a reminder that, since 2006, Hamas and Fatah also signed reconciliation agreements in Algiers, Cairo, Doha, Mecca and Sana'a, none of which actually reconciled them,\" Gregg Carlstrom, author of the book \"How Long Will Israel Survive? The Threat From Within,\" wrote in a post on X.\n\nWhile statements following the talks highlighted the signatories' consensus on building an interim unity government that would be established with China's support, long-time observers of the region noted that meetings and declarations will not determine success for the diplomatic efforts.\n\n\"Since 2007, there have been numerous rounds of negotiation and even provisional agreements aimed at reconciliation but they have all failed,\" Taufiq Rahim, principal at 2040 Advisory and author of \"Middle East in Crisis & Conflict: A Primer,\" told CNBC.\n\n\"The devil is not in the details but the implementation,\" he said. \"Given the many uncertainties on the ground and the upcoming US elections the deal could be upended easily.\"\n\nChina has increasingly moved to expand its role in international diplomacy, making world headlines in March of 2023 when it helped broker a historic normalization agreement between then-adversaries Iran and Saudi Arabia.", "source": {"uri": "nbcmiami.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 6 South Florida"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But previous such declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe declaration comes at a sensitive time, as the war in Gaza rages on into its 10th month and as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe question of Palestinian political unity could complicate planning for a postwar leadership structure for Gaza, one of the thornier issues in the ongoing peace talks. Hamas won parliamentary elections in Gaza in 2006 and then overran the territory in a violent takeover the following year.\n\nGaza's postwar future remains in doubt. Israel vehemently opposes any Hamas role in governing Gaza after the war. It has also rejected calls from the United States for the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority to run Gaza after the fighting ends.\n\nSince the current war broke out in Gaza almost 10 months ago, Hamas officials have said that the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and the group has called for formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nBut both Israel and the PA have deep distrusts about Hamas' intentions.\n\nIsrael's Foreign Minister, Israel Katz, swiftly rejected the agreement Tuesday, stating that no joint governance between Hamas and Fatah in Gaza will take place \"because Hamas's rule will be crushed.\"\n\nThe two rival Palestinian groups, along with 12 other political factions, met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, concluding talks that started Sunday, according to a post on social media platform Weibo from Chinese TV network CGTN.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe agreement also underscores China's growing role in Middle East diplomacy, with success in the restoration of relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\n\"But to be sure, China is still the process of trying to earn credibility as a global mediator,\" said James Char, a research fellow at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n\nA joint statement issued after the most recent talks in Beijing gave no details on how or when the government would be formed, saying only that it would be done \"by agreement among the factions.\" According to the joint statement, the two groups are committed to the creation of a Palestinian state on lands Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.\n\nThe deal does not appear to bridge the two group's diverging position on Israel. Hamas previously said it would accept a state based on the pre-1967 war borders, while also refusing to officially recognize Israel. The Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, abides by interim peace agreements with Israel signed in the early 1990s.\n\nThe agreement signed by the Palestinian factions promised to follow up on previous reconciliation agreements signed in both 2011 and 2022.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"The understanding in China is based on widening the scope of the membership on the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) to include other factions who have not joined it\" including Hamas, said Jamal Nazzal, a Fatah spokesperson.\n\n\"It's a long way ahead, and most of it will be implemented after a possible cease-fire,\" he added.\n\nFatah and Hamas have been rivals since Hamas violently routed forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah in Gaza in 2007, taking over the impoverished coastal enclave. The Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, headed by Abbas, administers parts of the occupied West Bank. It is widely viewed by the Palestinian public as corrupt, out of touch, and a subcontractor for Israel because of their joint security coordination.\n\nHamas members have never been part of PLO, the Palestinian government body responsible for international affairs. In a statement, Husam Badran, a Hamas political official based in Qatar, praised the agreement, describing it as a further \"positive step towards achieving Palestinian national unity.\"\n\nBut Tuesday's deal doesn't have a hard timeline.\n\n\"There is an opportunity ... but it is not big, because it lacks a specific timetable for implementation,\" said Hani Al-Masry, an expert on Palestinian reconciliation affairs.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nRepeated attempts at mending the rift have failed, wrecked by the factions' own bitter rivalry over power and the West's refusal to accept any government that includes Hamas unless it expressly recognizes Israel.\n\nUnited States President Joe Biden's administration envisions a revamped Palestinian Authority ruling postwar Gaza and has sought a series of reforms that might make it a viable presence in the war-ravaged territory. Israel rejected that idea, but has not put forward a credible alternative for who will govern Gaza.\n\nThe Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group allied with Hamas, issued a statement Tuesday after the talks saying that it still \"rejects any formula that includes recognition of Israel explicitly or implicitly\" and that it had \"demanded the withdrawal of the Palestine Liberation Organization's recognition of Israel.\"\n\n___\n\nGoldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel; Wu reported from Bangkok.

We are committed to national unity and we call for it,\" Abu Marzouk said during the closing ceremony.\n\nIn a statement published on Hamas' website, Husam Badran, member of the group's political bureau and head of its national relations office, hailed the declaration as \"an additional positive step\" to achieve Palestinian unity.\n\nFor his part, member of the Islamic Jihad's political bureau Ihsan Ataya said in a statement that the importance of the Beijing Declaration lies in unifying the Palestinian position in the face of the ongoing Israeli war.\n\nDetails of the agreement\n\nAccording to the Beijing Declaration, the factions agreed to achieve \"a comprehensive Palestinian national unity that includes all Palestinian factions under the PLO framework, and to commit to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital ... with the help of Egypt, Algeria, China and Russia.\"\n\nThe declaration also stressed the Palestinian people's right to resist the Israeli occupation in accordance with international laws and the United Nations charter and to thwart any attempts to displace Palestinians from their land.\n\n\"A Palestinian national unity government will be temporarily formed with the consensus of all Palestinian factions and by a decision from the president,\" the declaration continued. Said government will exercise its powers over all Palestinian territories, including the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, unify all Palestinian institutions and begin the reconstruction process, as well as prepare for holding general elections.\n\nThe factions in Beijing also agreed to deploy all efforts to lift the Israeli blockade on Gaza and ensure the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid into the enclave.\n\nThe Beijing Declaration comes as the Israeli war in the Gaza Strip approaches its tenth month. Nearly 39,000 people, mostly women and children, have been killed in Gaza and about 1.9 million others displaced since Israel launched its air and ground campaign in response to Hamas' cross-border assault Oct. 7. During their unprecedented attack, Hamas militants killed nearly 1,200 people and took over 240 others hostage.\n\nEfforts to achieve Palestinian reconciliation have intensified since the war broke out in October, amid increasing talks on who will govern Gaza after the end of the conflict.\n\nAxios reported on Tuesday that the United States, Israel and the United Arab Emirates held talks in Abu Dhabi last Thursday on plans for post-war Gaza.\n\nAxios cited two Israeli officials as saying that Emirati Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan hosted the meeting with President Joe Biden's top Middle East adviser Brett McGurk and State Department counselor Tom Sullivan, as well Israel's Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer.\n\nThe UAE has reportedly expressed its readiness to be part of a multinational force that would administer the Gaza Strip after the war.\n\nIsrael, meanwhile, has repeatedly rejected any idea that Hamas remains in control of Gaza when the war ends.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz slammed the Beijing Declaration on Tuesday.\n\n\"Instead of rejecting terrorism, Mahmoud Abbas embraces the murderers and rapists of Hamas, revealing his true face,\" Katz wrote on the X platform. \"In reality, this won't happen because Hamas' rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar.\"\n\nChina's diplomatic role in region\n\nThe Beijing Declaration marks another major diplomatic achievement for China, which has been increasingly involved in the region since it successfully brokered the March 2023 agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran on the resumption of their diplomatic ties.\n\nSince the onset of the Gaza war, Beijing has been deploying diplomatic efforts to achieve Palestinian reconciliation and end the war. It repeatedly called for a cease-fire in the Strip and expressed support for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state based on a two-state solution.\n\nIn April, it hosted representatives of the Hamas and Fatah factions for reconciliation talks.\n\nEarlier in March, Chinese diplomat Wang Kejian and head of Hamas' political bureau Ismail Haniyeh met in Qatar where they discussed the Gaza conflict.\n\nHamas took over the Gaza Strip in 2007 after ousting the Fatah-affiliated government in heavy clashes between the military wings of the two parties. The takeover left the Palestinian territories divided into two entities: a Hamas-run government in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority running the West Bank. Since then, all mediation attempts by regional actors, mainly Egypt, have failed to end the Palestinian division.", "source": {"uri": "al-monitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al-Monitor"},

The talks were held as the future governance of Palestinian territories remains in question as Israel's current leadership have vowed to eradicate Hamas, following the group's October 7 terrorist attack.\n\nThe Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is a coalition of parties that signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1993, and formed a new government in the Palestinian Authority (PA).\n\nFatah dominates both the PLO and the PA, the interim Palestinian government that was established in the Israeli-occupied West Bank after the 1993 agreement known as the Oslo Accords was signed. Hamas does not recognize Israel.\n\nThere is a long history of bitter enmity between Hamas in Gaza and Fatah. The two sides have tried - and failed - multiple times to reach an agreement to unite the two separate Palestinian territories under one governance structure, with a 2017 agreement quickly folding in violence.\n\nThe PA held administrative control over Gaza until 2007, after Hamas won the 2006 legislative elections in the occupied territories and expelled it from the strip. Since then, Hamas has ruled Gaza and the PA governs parts of the West Bank.\n\nAt a press conference Tuesday in Beijing, Hamas delegation representative Mousa Abu Marzook said they had reached an agreement to complete a \"course of reconciliation,\" while also using the platform in Beijing to defend the group's October 7 terrorist attack on Israel.\n\n\"We're at a historic junction. Our people are rising up in their efforts to struggle,\" Abu Marzook said, according to a translation provided by China's Foreign Ministry, adding that the October 7 operation had \"changed a lot, both in international and regional landscape.\"\n\nThe agreement comes as Beijing - which has sought to increase its influence and ties in the Middle East in recent years - has presented itself as a leading voice for countries across the Global South decrying Israel's war in Gaza and calling for Palestinian statehood.\n\nBeijing has not explicitly condemned Hamas for its October 7 attack on Israel.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping in May decried \"tremendous sufferings\" in the Middle East and called for an international peace conference as leaders from Arab nations visit Beijing, even as observers have questioned the extent of Beijing's geopolitical clout in a region where the US has long been a dominant power.\n\nThe agreement was also inked as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in the United States for a highly anticipated visit in which he will meet top US officials and address Congress.\n\nIsrael launched its military operations in Gaza following Hamas' October 7 attack that killed more than 1,100 people and saw roughly 250 others kidnapped. Around 39,000 Palestinians have died in Israel's war in Gaza that has triggered a mass humanitarian crisis and widespread destruction.\n\nHamas and Fatah signed a reconciliation agreement in Cairo in October 2017 under pressure from the Arab states, led by Egypt. Under the deal, a new unity government was supposed to take administrative control of Gaza two months later, ending a decade of rivalry that began when Hamas violently evicted the Palestinian Authority from Gaza in 2007.\n\nBut the deal's lofty aspirations quickly collapsed. When Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah visited Gaza in March 2018, he was the target of an assassination attempt when a bomb detonated near his convoy. Hamdallah's Fatah party immediately blamed Hamas for the attack.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The agreement was signed by long-term rivals Hamas and Fatah, as well as 12 other Palestinian groups.\n\n\"Today we sign an agreement for national unity and we say that the path to completing this journey is national unity,\" said senior Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk at a news conference in Beijing.\n\nMustapha Barghouti, secretary general of the Palestinian National Initiative, one of the 14 factions to sign onto the accord, told Al Jazeera the agreement goes \"much further\" than any others reached in recent years.\n\nHe said its four main elements are the establishment of an interim national unity government, the formation of unified Palestinian leadership ahead of future elections, the free election of a new Palestinian National Council, and a general declaration of unity in the face of ongoing Israeli attacks.\n\nThe move towards a unity government is especially important, he said, because it \"blocks Israeli efforts to create some sort of collaborative structure against Palestinian interests\".\n\nReconciliation between Hamas and Fatah would be a key turning point in internal Palestinian relations. The two main Palestinian political parties in the Palestinian territories have been bitter rivals since conflict arose in 2006, after which Hamas seized control of Gaza.\n\n\"We're at a historic junction,\" Abu Marzouk said according to CNN. \"Our people are rising up in their efforts to struggle.\"\n\nHamas, which led the October 7 attack on Israel, advocates for armed resistance against Israel's occupation.\n\nFatah controls the Palestinian Authority, which has partial administrative control of the occupied West Bank. It favours peaceful negotiations in pursuit of a Palestinian state.\n\nSeveral past reconciliation bids between the two factions have failed. However, calls have grown for them to come together as the war has dragged on and Israel and its allies, including the United States, have discussed who could govern the enclave after the fighting ends.\n\nIsrael has said it is vehemently opposed to any Hamas role, and has suggested it intends to maintain control via its military for the foreseeable future.\n\nBarghouti said the war in Gaza was the \"main factor\" motivating the Palestinian sides to set aside their differences.\n\n\"There is no other way now but for Palestinians to be unified and struggle together against this terrible injustice,\" he said.\n\n\"The most important thing now is to not only sign the agreement, but to implement it.\"\n\nChina, which has sought to play a mediating role in the conflict, previously hosted Fatah and Hamas in April.\n\nDuring those talks, the pair \"expressed their political will to achieve reconciliation through dialogue and consultation\" and made progress on \"many specific issues\", Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said at the time.\n\nThe latest round of talks featured Hamas's political leader Ismael Haniyeh and Fatah's deputy head Mahmoud al-Aloul.\n\nFollowing the signing of what has been referred to as the \"Beijing Declaration\", China's Wang said: \"Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community.\"\n\nChina has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and supportive of a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping has called for an \"international peace conference\" to end the war.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [],

Instead of rejecting terrorism, Mahmoud Abbas embraces the murderers and [sexual abusers] of Hamas, revealing his true face. 'In reality, this won't happen because Hamas' s rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands,' he added.\n\nThis comes after Hamas on Tuesday said that it had signed an agreement in Beijing with other Palestinian organisations including rivals Fatah to work together for 'national unity', with China describing it as a deal to rule Gaza together once the war ends. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who hosted senior Hamas official Musa Abu Marzuk, Fatah envoy Mahmud al-Aloul and emissaries from 12 other Palestinian groups, said they had agreed to set up an 'interim national reconciliation government' to govern post-war Gaza.\n\n'Today we sign an agreement for national unity and we say that the path to completing this journey is national unity. We are committed to national unity and we call for it,' Abu Marzuk (pictured) said after meeting Wang and the other envoys. The announcement comes more than nine months into a war sparked by Hamas's October attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 44 the Israeli military says are dead. Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.\n\nChina has sought to play a mediator role in the conflict, which has been rendered even more complex due to the intense rivalry between Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, and Fatah, which partially governs the occupied West Bank. Israel has vowed to keep fighting until it destroys Hamas, and world powers have scrambled to imagine scenarios for the governance of Gaza once the war ends. Neither Israel nor the U.S. would sanction any post-war plan that includes Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Washington.\n\nWhile it is unclear whether the deal announced in Beijing on Tuesday can hold, it does indicate that the only world power that can engineer a rapprochement between the Palestinian rivals is China. As Tuesday's meeting wrapped up in Beijing, Wang said the groups had committed to 'reconciliation'.\n\n'The most prominent highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government around the governance of post-war Gaza,' Wang (pictured center) said after the factions signed the 'Beijing declaration' in the Chinese capital. 'Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community,' Wang said. Fatah official Mahmoud al-Aloul thanked China for its 'unending support' for the Palestinian cause. 'To China, you have our love, you have all our friendship, from all the Palestinian people,' he said. Notably, he did not mention whether any agreement had been reached with Hamas and the other factions.\n\nAlso present at Tuesday's meeting were envoys from Egypt, Algeria and Russia, according to Wang. Egypt, which neighbours Israel and Gaza, is a key mediator in the conflict. Algeria is a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, and has drafted resolutions on the war. And while Wetern powers have sought to isolate Russia over its Ukraine invasion, China has maintained its strategic partnership with Moscow.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

The talks were held as the future governance of Palestinian territories remains in question following Israel's repeated vow to eradicate Hamas in response to the group's October 7 terrorist attack on its territory.\n\nThe PLO is a coalition of parties that signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1993, and formed a new government in the Palestinian Authority (PA).\n\nFatah dominates both the PLO and the PA, the interim Palestinian government that was established in the Israeli-occupied West Bank after the 1993 agreement known as the Oslo Accords was signed. Hamas does not recognize Israel.\n\nThere is a long history of bitter enmity between Hamas in Gaza and Fatah. The two sides have tried - and failed - multiple times to reach an agreement to unite the two separate Palestinian territories under one governance structure, with a 2017 agreement quickly folding in violence.\n\nThe PA held administrative control over Gaza until 2007, after Hamas won the 2006 legislative elections in the occupied territories and was expelled from the strip. Since then, Hamas has ruled Gaza and the PA governs parts of the West Bank.\n\nAt a press conference Tuesday in Beijing, Hamas delegation representative Mousa Abu Marzook said they had reached an agreement to complete a \"course of reconciliation,\" while also using the platform in Beijing to defend the group's October 7 attack on Israel.\n\n\"We're at a historic junction. Our people are rising up in their efforts to struggle,\" Abu Marzook said, according to a translation provided by China's Foreign Ministry, adding that the October 7 operation had \"changed a lot, both in the international and regional landscape.\"\n\nBeijing has not explicitly condemned Hamas for its October 7 attack on Israel.\n\nTuesday's agreement follows an earlier round of talks between Hamas and Fatah hosted by Beijing in April.\n\nSince the start of the war in Gaza, China - which has looked to bolster its influence and ties in the Middle East in recent years - has presented itself as a leading voice for countries across the Global South decrying Israel's war in the enclave and calling for Palestinian statehood.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping in May called for an international peace conference during meetings with leaders from Arab nations and has also dispatched a special envoy to the Middle East to meet with diplomats and officials.\n\nObservers have questioned the extent of Beijing's geopolitical clout in a region where the US has long been a dominant power, but China surprised many last March when it played a role in brokering a rapprochement between longtime rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\nThose efforts have been broadly seen as part of Beijing's push to position itself as a geopolitical heavyweight with a different vision for the world from the United States.\n\nTuesday's agreement was also inked as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in the US for a highly anticipated visit in which he will meet top US officials and address Congress.\n\nIsrael launched its military operations in Gaza following Hamas' October 7 attack that killed more than 1,100 people and saw roughly 250 others kidnapped. Around 39,000 Palestinians have died in the conflict, which has triggered a mass humanitarian crisis and widespread destruction.\n\nHamas and Fatah signed a reconciliation agreement in Cairo in October 2017 under pressure from the Arab states, led by Egypt. Under the deal, a new unity government was supposed to take administrative control of Gaza two months later, ending a decade of rivalry that began when Hamas violently evicted the Palestinian Authority from Gaza in 2007.\n\nBut the deal's lofty aspirations quickly collapsed. When Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah visited Gaza in March 2018, he was the target of an assassination attempt when a bomb detonated near his convoy. Hamdallah's Fatah party immediately blamed Hamas for the attack. -- CNN", "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "dataType": "news", "title": "Saudi Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Our people are rising up in their efforts to struggle,\" he said, according to a translation provided by China's Foreign Ministry.\n\nChina is not one of the traditional diplomatic brokers in the Israel-Palestine conflict, and has not been closely involved in efforts to end the current war in Gaza. The state media's reporting indicates it is trying to insert itself into the conflict resolution effort without fully joining the multilateral negotiations underway, which have yet to achieve a lasting ceasefire.\n\nThe Chinese story broke as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, which will halt fighting and release Israeli hostages, is \"inside the 10-yard line\".\n\nFatah, formally known as the Palestinian National Liberation Movement, is one of the two main Palestinian political parties in Palestine.\n\nFatah and Hamas have been rivals since Hamas violently routed forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah in Gaza in 2007, taking over the impoverished coastal enclave. The Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, headed by Abbas, administers parts of the occupied West Bank.\n\nIt is widely viewed by the Palestinian public as corrupt, out of touch, and a subcontractor for Israel because of their joint security coordination.\n\nHamas and the Palestinian Authority have had multiple rounds of unity talks, but each time efforts have failed due to the factions' own bitter rivalry over power and the West's refusal to accept any government that includes Hamas unless it expressly recognises Israel.\n\nIn 2006, after Hamas won Palestinian legislative elections, it entered talks with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to try and form a unity government.\n\nThe two sides eventually reached a deal under which the unity government, including Hamas, would \"respect\" the Palestinian Authority's 1993 peace agreements with Israel.\n\nBut Israel and the US refused to recognise the unity government and imposed economic sanctions. The government quickly collapsed amid fighting between Hamas and Abbas' Fatah faction, ending with Hamas' violent takeover of Gaza in 2007 in which Fatah was routed from the territory entirely.\n\nA similar process occurred in the West Bank, with Fatah-supporting fighters driving out armed Hamas followers.\n\nFatah has since retained control of the Palestinian National Authority in the West Bank and also controls Palestinian refugee camps in the territory.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fatah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Abbas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mahmoud Abbas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_occupation_of_the_West_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli occupation of the West Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_State_of_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of the State of Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilateralism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multilateralism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of the Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_unity_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National unity government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/59/58/98/1200x675_cmsv2_36502849-c4b2-543a-99f7-38034473984b-8595898.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749919", "eventUri": "eng-9749919", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Photo: AFP>\n\nThe Chinese foreign ministry said the agreement was a first step to promote a \"comprehensive, durable and sustainable ceasefire\" in the Gaza Strip that would eventually lead to Palestine being admitted to the United Nations as a fully fledged member and becoming an independent state.\n\nForeign Minister Wang Yi on Tuesday said the signing of the agreement was \"an important, historic moment in the Palestinian cause\".\n\nHe said that under the deal the rival groups had agreed to set up an \"interim national reconciliation government\" to govern post-war Gaza.\n\nSignatories included senior Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk and Fatah envoy Mahmoud al-Aloul along with emissaries from 12 other Palestinian groups.\n\nThe Chinese foreign ministry said it was the first time the 14 rival groups had gathered together in Beijing for reconciliation talks.\n\n\"Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community,\" Wang said.\n\nHe added that China was keen to \"play a constructive role in safeguarding peace and stability in the Middle East\".\n\nHamas and the Palestinian Authority - the two dominant Palestinian political parties in the Palestinian territories - have held multiple rounds of unity talks since Hamas defeated President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party in parliamentary elections in 2006.\n\nIn 2007 Hamas became de facto ruler in the Gaza Strip while Fatah led the Palestinian Authority in the Israel-controlled West Bank.\n\nBut reconciliation efforts have floundered, with tensions between Fatah and Hamas escalating and spilling over in the region.\n\nHamas and Fatah have tried and failed several times to reach an agreement to unite the two separate Palestinian territories under one governance, with a 2017 agreement brokered by Egypt quickly falling apart. A 2022 agreement to hold elections within a year was not followed through.\n\nThe West has refused to accept any government that includes Hamas unless it expressly recognises Israel.\n\nTuesday's agreement comes as China has sought to position itself as a mediator in Gaza after it brokered a peace deal between Middle East rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia in March last year.\n\nIt is also trying to mediate in Russia's war in Ukraine. Ukrainian Foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba is in Beijing this week to discuss China's role in ending the war as well as economic cooperation.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Previous declarations have failed, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution. It comes as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the nine-month war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. But even after a deal is signed, the vision for a postwar Gaza remains in doubt, with Israel vehemently opposed to any role by Hamas in governing Gaza.\n\nSince the current war broke out in Gaza, Hamas officials have said that the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and the group has called for formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nThe two groups signed the Beijing Declaration on \"ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity,\" according to state broadcaster CCTV.\n\nThe two rival Palestinian groups, along with 12 other political factions, met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, concluding talks that started Sunday, according to a post on social media platform Weibo from Chinese TV network CGTN.\n\nA joint statement issued after the most recent talks in Beijing gave no details on how or when the government would be formed, saying only that it would be done \"by agreement among the factions.\"\n\nFatah and Hamas have been rivals since Hamas violently routed forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah in Gaza in 2007, taking over the impoverished coastal enclave. The Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, headed by Abbas, administers parts of the occupied West Bank. It is widely viewed by the Palestinian public as corrupt, out of touch, and a subcontractor for Israel because of their joint security coordination.\n\nRepeated attempts at mending the rift have failed, wrecked by the factions' own bitter rivalry over power and the West's refusal to accept any government that includes Hamas unless it expressly recognizes Israel.\n\nUnited States President Joe Biden's administration envisions a revamped Palestinian Authority to rule postwar Gaza and has sought a series of reforms that might make it a viable presence in the war-ravaged territory. Israel rejected that idea, but has not put forward a credible alternative for who will govern Gaza.\n\nThe Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group allied with Hamas, issued a statement Tuesday after the talks saying that it still \"rejects any formula that includes recognition of Israel explicitly or implicitly\" and that it had \"demanded the withdrawal of the Palestine Liberation Organization's recognition of Israel.\"\n\nGoldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel; Wu reported from Bangkok.", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima

The declaration was signed in Beijing after three days of talks.\n\n\"The core achievement is to make it clear that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people,\" Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, referring to the West Bank administration run by Fatah. \"The most prominent highlight has been the agreement on forming an interim national reconciliation government around the post-war governance of Gaza. The strongest call is for the realization of a truly independent Palestinian nation in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions.\"\n\nPrevious efforts by Arab countries to reconcile Fatah and Hamas, who rule over Gaza and sparked the ongoing war in the territory with their Oct. 7 attack on Israel, have failed. The long-term standoff between the groups has weakened political aspirations for Palestinian statehood.\n\nIt was unclear whether the deal announced by China's state-run media, referred to as The Beijing Declaration, would survive the realities on the ground.\n\nIt was also unclear what role Hamas might play in an interim unity government, if any, as it is not part of the PLO and as both Israel and the United States have long deemed it a terrorist group.\n\nIsrael has made destroying Hamas one of the primary goals of its war in Gaza and, despite offering little to answer huge pressure from Washington and even Israel's own military calling for a post-war Gaza plan, the Israeli government has thus far ruled out any Hamas participation in a future Palestinian administration.\n\nHamas and its allied Gaza group Islamic Jihad have demanded that any agreement on a unity government include holding an election for the PLO parliament, which could secure their inclusion, according to the Reuters news agency.\n\nThe declaration \"creates a formidable barrier against all regional and international interventions that seek to impose realities against our people's interests in managing Palestinian affairs post-war,\" senior Hamas official Hussam Badran told Reuters. He said a unity government would oversee reconstruction in Gaza, manage the affairs of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza and prepare the conditions for elections.\n\n\"Instead of rejecting terrorism, [Fatah leader] Mahmoud Abbas embraces the murderers and rapists of Hamas, revealing his true face. In reality, this won't happen because Hamas' rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar,\" Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said Tuesday in a social media post, adding: \"Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands.\"\n\nThe declaration appeared to be the latest attempt by Beijing to exert its growing influence in the Middle East.

It also comes as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the nine-month war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nCardinals' TV ratings on record-low pace amid continuing distribution problems: Media Views Tammie Holland, longtime St. Louis radio personality, dies at 53 New St. Louis Public Schools communications chief also lives in Texas Third bear sighting reported in southern Illinois, sheriff says St. Louis Public Schools halts hiring over questions on new administrator from Texas Former St. Louis Rams lineman ordered to pay $500,000 to injured worker O'Fallon, Mo., woman charged with making politically motivated false child sex abuse claim Grades for Cardinals position players: the good, bad and ugly Creve Coeur-based nursing home operator files for bankruptcy O'Fallon, Mo., firm to expand, add jobs with millions in federal dollars for semiconductor push BenFred: Smart contract stance lets Cardinals be nimble as Goldschmidt tries to salvage season Ankle injury interrupts Tommy Edman's rehab games, delays his return: Cardinals Extra Messenger: A disturbing twist in the case of security guards who tackled BJC patient MSD's recently retired CEO was paid more than $100,000 for unused vacation, sick time Kohn's Kosher Deli facing lawsuit of nearly $150,000\n\nStill, the future of Gaza is undecided, with Israel vehemently opposed to any role by Hamas in governing Gaza. It has also rejected calls from the United States for the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority to run Gaza after the war ends. The lack of a postwar vision for running the Gaza Strip has complicated negotiations over a cease-fire.\n\nSince the current war broke out in Gaza almost 10 months ago, Hamas officials have said that the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and the group has called for formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nThe two groups signed the Beijing Declaration on \"ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity,\" according to state broadcaster CCTV.\n\nIsrael's Foreign Minister, Israel Katz, swiftly rejected the agreement Tuesday, stating that no joint governance between Hamas and Fatah in Gaza will take place \"because Hamas's rule will be crushed.\"\n\nThe two rival Palestinian groups, along with 12 other political factions, met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, concluding talks that started Sunday, according to a post on social media platform Weibo from Chinese TV network CGTN.\n\nThe agreement also underscores China's growing role in Middle East diplomacy, with success in the restoration of relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\n\"But to be sure, China is still the process of trying to earn credibility as a global mediator,\" said James Char, a research fellow at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n\nA joint statement issued after the most recent talks in Beijing gave no details on how or when the government would be formed, saying only that it would be done \"by agreement among the factions.\" According to the joint statement, the two groups are committed to the creation of a Palestinian state on lands Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.\n\nThe deal does not appear to bridge the two group's diverging position on Israel. Hamas previously said it would accept a state based on 1967 borders, while also refusing to officially recognize Israel. The Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, abides by interim peace agreements with Israel signed in the early 1990s.\n\nThe agreement signed by the Palestinian factions promised to follow up on previous reconciliation agreements signed in both 2011 and 2022.\n\n\"The understanding in China is based on widening the scope of the membership on the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) to include other factions who have not joined it\" including Hamas, said Jamal Nazzal, a Fatah spokesperson.\n\n\"It's a long way ahead, and most of it will be implemented after a possible cease-fire,\" he added.\n\nFatah and Hamas have been rivals since Hamas violently routed forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah in Gaza in 2007, taking over the impoverished coastal enclave. The Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, headed by Abbas, administers parts of the occupied West Bank. It is widely viewed by the Palestinian public as corrupt, out of touch, and a subcontractor for Israel because of their joint security coordination.\n\nHamas members have never been part of PLO, the Palestinian government body responsible for international affairs. In a statement, Husam Badran, a Hamas political official based in Qatar, praised the agreement, describing it as a further \"positive step towards achieving Palestinian national unity.\"\n\nBut Tuesday's deal doesn't have a hard timeline.\n\n\"There is an opportunity ... but it is not big, because it lacks a specific timetable for implementation,\" said Hani Al-Masry, an expert on Palestinian reconciliation affairs.\n\nRepeated attempts at mending the rift have failed, wrecked by the factions' own bitter rivalry over power and the West's refusal to accept any government that includes Hamas unless it expressly recognizes Israel.\n\nUnited States President Joe Biden's administration envisions a revamped Palestinian Authority to rule postwar Gaza and has sought a series of reforms that might make it a viable presence in the war-ravaged territory. Israel rejected that idea, but has not put forward a credible alternative for who will govern Gaza.\n\nThe Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group allied with Hamas, issued a statement Tuesday after the talks saying that it still \"rejects any formula that includes recognition of Israel explicitly or implicitly\" and that it had \"demanded the withdrawal of the Palestine Liberation Organization's recognition of Israel.\"\n\nGoldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel; Wu reported from Bangkok.

This move, announced by Chinese state media on Tuesday, comes as the Gaza conflict continues and international efforts for a cease-fire intensify.\n\nThe declaration, reached during talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, marks an important step towards resolving the deep divide between the two major Palestinian political groups.However, previous attempts at reconciliation have faltered, including a similar deal in 2011, raising questions about whether this latest China-sponsored negotiation will succeed.\n\nThe agreement was made as Israel and Hamas consider an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that could end the nine-month war and secure the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Yet, the future governance of Gaza remains uncertain, with Israel opposing any role for Hamas and rejecting US calls for the Fatah-dominated Palestinian authority to take over Gaza post-war.\n\nHamas said that it does not wish to return to ruling Gaza and advocates for a technocratic government to be formed by various Palestinian factions. This government would oversee elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, aiming for a unified Palestinian administration.\n\nThe Beijing Declaration on \"ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity\" was signed by the two factions and 12 other political groups. The joint statement from the talks did not specify the details or timing of the new government formation but affirmed commitment to establishing a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders.\n\nFatah and Hamas have been at odds since 2007 when Hamas took control of Gaza by force, leaving Fatah in charge of parts of the West Bank. Efforts to mend the rift have repeatedly failed due to power struggles and international conditions. The US administration under President Joe Biden has proposed reforms for a revamped Palestinian authority to govern postwar Gaza, but this has been rejected by Israel and is yet to find a viable alternative.\n\nThe Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller group allied with Hamas, has condemned any agreement involving recognition of Israel and demanded the withdrawal of the Palestine Liberation Organization's recognition of Israel.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Representatives from 12 other Palestinian groups also participated in these talks.\n\nThis agreement emerges against the backdrop of a severe conflict triggered by Hamas's attack on southern Israel in October, which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, and the abduction of 251 hostages, with 116 still in Gaza and 44 presumed dead. Israel's retaliatory actions have claimed over 39,000 lives in Gaza, predominantly civilians, according to the Gaza health ministry.\n\nChina has positioned itself as a mediator in the ongoing conflict between Hamas, which governs Gaza, and Fatah, which administers parts of the West Bank. The Israeli government remains determined to continue its military campaign until Hamas is defeated. Meanwhile, global powers, including the United States, are considering governance options for Gaza following the war.\n\nFollowing the \"Beijing declaration,\" Wang Yi highlighted the necessity of \"reconciliation\" and announced the creation of an interim national reconciliation government for Gaza post-war. He stressed that reconciliation will require international support and called for a comprehensive ceasefire and the recognition of a Palestinian state by the UN.\n\nHamas and Fatah have been in conflict since 2006, when Hamas won a decisive electoral victory and subsequently displaced Fatah from Gaza. Despite several attempts at reconciliation, the recent war has heightened the push for unity.

The Islamist terrorist groups are at odds with the current PLO over peace accords with Israel.\n\n\"This declaration comes at an important time as our people are facing a genocidal war, especially in the Gaza Strip,\" a statement quoted Badran as saying.\n\nRival factions Hamas and Fatah first met in Beijing in April to discuss reconciliation efforts to end around 17 years of disputes, the first

AP\n\nFatah and Hamas, the rival factions of Palestine, signed a declaration on Tuesday to form a unity government amid the Israel war.\n\nThe two groups reached a deal after negotiations in China, ending decades-old rift between them. The Beijing Declaration was signed at the closing ceremony of a reconciliation dialogue among 14 Palestinian factions held in China's capital from July 21-23.\n\nThe development comes after several reconciliatory efforts by Egypt and other Arab nations failed to bring Fatah and Hamas together. However, it is still not sure if this deal will change the reality on ground.\n\nSenior Hamas official Hussam Badran said the most important point of the Beijing Declaration was to form a Palestinian national unity government to manage the affairs of Palestinians.\n\nWhat does the declaration say?\n\nAccording to the document seen by NBC News, by signing the declaration, both sides have agreed to the \"formation of a temporary national unity government by agreement of the Palestinian factions.\"\n\nThe unity government has been empowered to exercise powers over all Palestinian regions while it will also be able to have jurisdiction over the entire territory that has been facing the brunt of the war. The government will also have to start preparing to hold general elections.\n\nHamas and Fataj have also agreed to \"resist and thwart attempts to displace our people\" from the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and Jerusalem \"and affirm the illegality of settlement and settlement expansion in accordance with the resolutions of the UN Security Council, the UN General Assembly, and the opinion of the International Court of Justice.\"\n\nWhat's behind Hamas and Fatah's rift?\n\nIn 2007, the Palestinian terror group that is engaged in war with Israel took over control of the Gaza Strip following an election in 2006.\n\nSince then, the two groups have been in conflict with Fatah governing only parts of the West Bank.\n\nMaria Papageorgiou, a lecturer in politics and international relations at the University of Exeter in the UK says, \"The historical divide between Hamas and Fatah is deep, with years of hostility and ideological differences.\"", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType":

He said that was happening because of the fierce military pressure Israel was putting on Hamas and gave no further details.\n\nDespite a potential agreement, the future governance of Gaza remains uncertain, with Israel firmly opposing any involvement of Hamas.\n\nSince the onset of the current conflict, Hamas officials have expressed a desire not to return to their previous role in governing Gaza. Instead, they advocate for the establishment of a technocratic government agreed upon by various Palestinian factions, paving the way for elections in both Gaza and the West Bank to form a unified administration.\n\nThe Beijing Declaration, as reported by state broadcaster CCTV, focuses on \"ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity.\" The deal was reached following discussions between the two rival factions and twelve other political groups, facilitated by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

The News Center has no plans at present to produce its own version.\n\nCHINA PALESTINIANS ACCORD\n\nHEADLINE: China announces agreement between Palestinian rivals Hamas and Fatah\n\nTEASER: Two main factions sign declaration in Beijing vowing to form a unity government\n\nChinese state media announced Tuesday that rival Palestinian factions Fatah and Hamas have signed a declaration to end years of discord and unite to form a national unity government.\n\nChinese television network CGTN said in a social media post the accord was signed in Beijing after a two-day forum overseen by Foreign Minister Wang Yi. The talks included 12 other smaller Palestinian factions along with the two main rivals. Chinese state broadcaster CCTV did not provide further details on the agreement.\n\nThe talks in Beijing were aimed at creating a possible roadmap for a postwar Gaza once a ceasefire is reached between Israel and Hamas that would end the nine-month war in Gaza. The war was sparked by the October 7 terror attack on southern Israel by Hamas fighters who killed 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages.\n\nIsrael responded with unrelenting air and ground attacks that have killed at least 38,500 people and injured more than 88,800 more, according to Gaza's health ministry.\n\nFatah and Hamas have been at odds for decades over their respective stance towards Israel. Fatah dominates the Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the West Bank and has signed interim peace accords with Israel, while Hamas refuses to officially recognize the Jewish state.\n\nOver the past 17 years, there have been efforts by Egypt and other Arab countries to reconcile Hamas and Fatah. It remains to be seen whether the deal reached in Beijing will survive the realities on the ground.\n\nThe two sides violently split when Hamas fighters drove out Fatah forces out of Gaza in 2007 and seized control of the coastal enclave.\n\nThe accord also represents China's growing influence in the Middle East, after having brokered a peace agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of America"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fatah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_unity_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National unity government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Yi_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wang Yi (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Central_Television", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China Central Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel\u2013United_Arab_Emirates_normalization_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel\u2013United Arab Emirates normalization agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jewish state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arab world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://gdb.voanews.com/2D70368C-D70A-436D-9D33-4F2AADB25BDF.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749919", "eventUri": "eng-9749919", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1092, "textEnd": 1101}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Previous declarations have failed, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution. It comes as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the nine-month war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. But even after a deal is signed, the vision for a postwar Gaza remains in doubt, with Israel vehemently opposed to any role by Hamas in governing Gaza.\n\nSince the current war broke out in Gaza, Hamas officials have said that the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and the group has called for formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nThe two groups signed the Beijing Declaration on \"ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity,\" according to state broadcaster CCTV.\n\nThe two rival Palestinian groups, along with 12 other political factions, met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, concluding talks that started Sunday, according to a post on social media platform Weibo from Chinese TV network CGTN.\n\nA joint statement issued after the most recent talks in Beijing gave no details on how or when the government would be formed, saying only that it would be done \"by agreement among the factions.\"\n\nFatah and Hamas have been rivals since Hamas violently routed forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah in Gaza in 2007, taking over the impoverished coastal enclave. The Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, headed by Abbas, administers parts of the occupied West Bank. It is widely viewed by the Palestinian public as corrupt, out of touch, and a subcontractor for Israel because of their joint security coordination.\n\nRepeated attempts at mending the rift have failed, wrecked by the factions' own bitter rivalry over power and the West's refusal to accept any government that includes Hamas unless it expressly recognizes Israel.\n\nUnited States President Joe Biden's administration envisions a revamped Palestinian Authority to rule postwar Gaza and has sought a series of reforms that might make it a viable presence in the war-ravaged territory. Israel rejected that idea, but has not put forward a credible alternative for who will govern Gaza.\n\nThe Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group allied with Hamas, issued a statement Tuesday after the talks saying that it still \"rejects any formula that includes recognition of Israel explicitly or implicitly\" and that it had \"demanded the withdrawal of the Palestine Liberation Organization's recognition of Israel.\"\n\nGoldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel; Wu reported from Bangkok.\n\nMore from this section\n\nExodus United Global Signs Multi-Year Agreement to Bring Indian Films and TV shows to the U.S.\n\nMost airlines except one are recovering from the CrowdStrike tech outage.

We are in a historical moment recorded by the struggle of our people, whom we salute,\" Abu Marzuk said during the signing.\n\nFatah and Hamas were locked in a bitter war from 2006 to 2007. Hamas controls the Gaza Strip while Fatah holds the Palestinian Authority (PA) government with partial control of the West Bank.\n\nAlgeria had gathered the Palestinian factions in October 2022 in previous attempt to resolve the long division between the different sides.\n\nThe meeting resulted in the Algeria Declaration, which included provisions on the development of the PLO structure while forming its national council.\n\nEgypt, a current mediator between Israel and Hamas, hosted a separate meeting in the Egyptian city of El-Alamein in July last year after numerous efforts to broker an agreement between both sides.\n\nPalestine's President Mahmoud Abbas chaired the talks and met with the leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, on the sidelines of the meeting in Egypt. Similarly, the meeting resulted in the establishment of a \"reconciliation committee.\"\n\nQatar, a central mediator between Israel and Hamas, had also attempted to mediate between Fatah and Hamas in October 2006.\n\nIn 2012, Qatar brokered the Fatah-Hamas Doha Agreement, though internal disputes between the two parties have remained.\n\nThen, in 2016, Qatar hosted dialogue between Fatah and Hamas in an effort to discuss the implementation of a 2014 agreement that had stipulated the formation of a Palestinian unity government to oversee legislative and presidential elections.\n\nCommenting on the latest declaration, Mustafa Barghouti, secretary-general of the Palestinian National Initiative, told Al Jazeera that it goes \"much further\" than previous ones.\n\nHe noted that the formation of a unity government is particularly important as it \"blocks Israeli efforts to create some sort of collaborative structure against Palestinian interests\".\n\nThe timing of the agreement is also a crucial factor, as it came nearly 10 months into the Israeli war in the Gaza Strip, where more than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed.\n\nThe declaration angered Israel, given its opposition to Hamas playing any role in Gaza. In a post on X, Israel's Minister of Foreign Affairs Israel Katz maintained his rejection of any Palestinian control over Gaza.\n\n\"Instead of rejecting terrorism, Mahmoud Abbas embraces the murderers and rapists of Hamas, revealing his true face,\" Katz claimed. \"In reality, this won't happen because Hamas's rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands.\"", "source": {"uri": "dohanews.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Doha News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "asmahan_qarjouli@dohanews.co", "name":

Mahmoud al-Aloul, the deputy leader of Fatah, showered praise on China for standing beside the Palestinian people.\n\nTheir joint statement supports the formation of a temporary government for Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank that all parties agree upon. But for many Palestinians, without concrete steps to make that plan a reality, the gathering in the Chinese capital was little more than a performance -- and one they had seen before.\n\n\"What happened in China isn't significant,\" said Jehad Harb, an analyst of Palestinian affairs. \"There aren't any indications that Hamas and Fatah intend to end the split between them.\"\n\nHamas and Fatah have been deeply divided for years, each trying to present itself as the legitimate leader of the Palestinian people and wary that the other will undermine its power. In 2007, the parties engaged in a civil war in which Hamas forcibly took over Gaza from the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, which retains limited autonomy over parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nMultiple past attempts to broker unity between the rival parties have resulted in joint statements and agreements, but all of those efforts have failed.\n\n\"These statements aren't worth the ink needed to write them,\" said Abd Al-Rahman Basem al-Masri, 25, a resident of Deir al Balah in central Gaza. \"We've seen these things before and we've lost hope in them.\"\n\nThe joint statement on Tuesday, which was also signed by other smaller Palestinian factions, said the new government should begin working on uniting Palestinian institutions in the West Bank and Gaza, reconstructing Gaza and preparing for national elections, though it does not lay out a clear timeline.\n\nMohammad Shtayyeh, a senior Fatah official and the former prime minister of the Palestinian Authority, said he thought the statement was \"serious,\" but he emphasized that more discussions were required to advance reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah.\n\n\"There's no alternative to Palestinian unity,\" he said in an interview. \"What has happened in China is stating the obvious.\"\n\n\"It's a matter of principles,\" he said, adding that \"a lot of talks and details\" were needed for implementation.\n\nPalestinian experts have said cooperation between Hamas and Fatah was critical to discussions about a postwar future in Gaza. If they can form a government of independent figures without formal ties to Hamas, it could make it easier for much of the Western world to participate in rebuilding the territory. The United States, Britain and other nations consider Hamas a terrorist group.\n\nThe statement does not address a key sticking point: security control over Gaza. Fatah has demanded that all weapons be under the authority of one unified security force and government, while Hamas has said it will not dismantle its military wing, the Qassam Brigades.Mr. Shtayyeh, who stepped down as prime minister in March, acknowledged frustration among Palestinians, describing the division between Hamas and Fatah as a \"black chapter in the history of Palestine.\"\n\n\"Palestinians on the street are very angry and disappointed that these talks have been ongoing for 17 years now,\" he said. \"The general public wants results, they don't want papers. They want practical steps in the right direction.\"\n\nFor China, meanwhile, bringing Hamas and Fatah together represented an opportunity to promote its image as a peace broker and an important player in the Middle East. The declaration on Tuesday followed Beijing's success in negotiating a deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran last year. It also comes as China has deepened its financial ties in the region in areas like technology and artificial intelligence.\n\nOfficial Chinese state media hailed the meeting, saying it was \"bringing precious hope to the suffering of the Palestinian people.\"\n\nThe Palestinian factions attended the meeting mostly to placate China, Mr. Harb said, noting that they want to be in the good graces of a world power.\n\nThe images of China as a key international actor were not just for an overseas audience.\n\n\"The Chinese government does put significant weight on symbolic interactions, and certainly they are trying to lay out a tableau for everyone to look at domestically to say, 'Yes, the Chinese government is important and is a force for good in the world,\" said William J. Hurst, a professor of Chinese politics at the University of Cambridge.\n\nZixu Wang contributed reporting from Hong Kong.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York

Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands,\" Katz emphasised.\n\nIn March last year, China brokered a peace deal between arch-rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia which enabled the two countries to establish diplomatic relations.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba is also visiting Beijing this week to discuss China's role in ending the Russia-Ukraine war as well as economic cooperation, Hong Kong-based South China Post reported.

Between Hamas and Fatah", "body": "The good news is that China has brokered a peace agreement. (Everyone is supposed to support peace over war, right?) But it's not an agreement between Israel and Gaza. It's not even a deal between Ukraine and Russia, though China now has enough influence over Russia that they should be able to do so if they want. No, this is a peace agreement between Hamas and Fatah, the two primary Palestinian factions that have been at odds for decades. The world is all too familiar with Hamas by this point, with its current remnants being all that remains of the official government of the Gaza Strip. Fatah (formerly the Palestinian National Liberation Movement) is the party of Mahmoud Abbas and largely represents the Palestinians in the West Bank. If this tentative peace agreement sounds like good news to you, rest assured that it's not. (Associated Press)\n\nPalestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration in Beijing on ending a yearslong rift, the groups said Tuesday, taking a step toward resolving a deep divide which has lingered for years despite repeated attempts at unifying the sides.\n\nThe two heavyweights of Palestinian politics signed the Beijing Declaration on \"ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity,\" according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV, pledging to form a unity government for the Palestinian territories. But previous such declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution.\n\nThe declaration comes at a sensitive time, as the war in Gaza rages on into its 10th month and as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nThere is no guarantee that this peace agreement will hold up or be honored by the majority of Palestinians from either party. Similar agreements have been made in the past couple of decades and they have all fallen apart rather rapidly. But the war in Gaza has changed the situation in many ways and deadly conflicts, just as with politics sometimes make for strange bedfellows. It's not totally inconceivable that they might be ready to bury the hatchet, at least for the foreseeable future, in the interest of securing themselves against a common set of enemies.\n\nSo why would any sort of peace agreement between the rival factions be problematic? Primarily because the ongoing conflict between Hamas and Fatah has proven beneficial to Israel in multiple ways. The two groups haven't been technically at war with each other, though Hamas does launch the occasional attack against the West Bank. But the two factions have been bitter rivals ever since Hamas was elected to govern the Gaza Strip in 2007, almost immediately after which they launched a purge of the region, eliminating most of Fatah's people in the process.\n\nKeeping the two parties divided and at each other's throats has allowed Israel a measure of peace compared to what they would be facing if all of the Palestinians were united against them. Hamas has consistently refused to recognize Israel's right to exist and launched attacks against them, culminating in the October 7 terror attacks. Fatah still opposes the presence of Israel in the region but has been willing to negotiate and mostly - though not always - attempted to maintain some semblance of peace in the West Bank. It's an imperfect situation to put it mildly, but it was better than the alternative.\n\nAny sort of serious peace and kinship between Fatah and Hamas could also complicate the ongoing plans for peace and what to do about the Gaza Strip after the war. For more than a year, the Palestinian Authority firmly stated that they wanted no responsibility for governing the Strip after the war. But some of their leaders recently seemed to relent a bit and showed an interest in a three-stage solution where they would be part of a coalition government in Gaza. Hamas has rejected that idea entirely. But if they are now coming into alignment because of China's negotiations, that type of plan could move forward. Rather than destroying Hamas entirely as Israel has vowed to do, they could wind up handing at least some of the control of the Strip right back to the remnants of Hamas. This is far from ideal.\n\nWith that in mind, we have every right to question China's motivation for negotiating this peace agreement.

We are committed to national unity and we call for it,\" Abu Marzuk said after meeting Wang and the other envoys.\n\nThe announcement comes more than nine months into a war sparked by October attack on southern Israel.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people, mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Gaza.\n\nThe relentless fighting has plunged Gaza into a severe humanitarian crisis. China has sought to play a mediator role in the conflict between Palestinian groups in the Gaza Strip, and in the occupied West Bank.\n\nWhile it is unclear whether the deal announced in Beijing on Tuesday can hold, it does indicate that the only world power that can engineer a rapprochement between the Palestinians is China.\n\nAs Tuesday's meeting wrapped up in Beijing, Wang said the groups had committed to \"reconciliation\".\n\n\"The most prominent highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government around the governance of post-war Gaza,\" Wang said after the factions signed the \"Beijing declaration\" in the Chinese capital.\n\n\"Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community,\" Wang said.\n\nFatah official Mahmoud al-Aloul thanked China for its \"unending support\" for the Palestinian cause. \"To China, you have our love, you have all our friendship, from all the Palestinian people,\" he said.\n\nAlso present at Tuesday's meeting were envoys from Egypt, Algeria and Russia, according to Wang. Egypt, which neighbours Israel and Gaza, is a key mediator in the conflict. Algeria is a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, and has drafted resolutions on the war.\n\nChina, Wang said, was keen to \"play a constructive role in safeguarding peace and stability in the Middle East\". He also called for a \"comprehensive, lasting and sustainable ceasefire\", as well as efforts to promote Palestinian self-governance and full recognition of a Palestinian state at the UN. -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "omanobserver.om", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oman Observer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Yi_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wang Yi (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fatah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_occupation_of_the_West_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli occupation of the West Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.omanobserver.om/omanobserver/uploads/images/2024/07/23/thumbs/600x600/2725578.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749919", "eventUri": "eng-9749919", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The talks included 12 other smaller Palestinian factions along with the two main rivals. Chinese state broadcaster CCTV did not provide further details on the agreement.\n\nThe talks in Beijing were aimed at creating a possible roadmap for a postwar Gaza once a ceasefire is reached between Israel and Hamas that would end the nine-month war in Gaza. The war was sparked by the October 7 terror attack on southern Israel by Hamas fighters who killed 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages.\n\nIsrael responded with unrelenting air and ground attacks that have killed at least 38,500 people and injured more than 88,800 more, according to Gaza's health ministry.\n\nFatah and Hamas have been at odds for decades over their respective stance towards Israel. Fatah dominates the Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the West Bank and has signed interim peace accords with Israel, while Hamas refuses to officially recognize the Jewish state.\n\nOver the past 17 years, there have been efforts by Egypt and other Arab countries to reconcile Hamas and Fatah. It remains to be seen whether the deal reached in Beijing will survive the realities on the ground.\n\nThe two sides violently split when Hamas fighters drove out Fatah forces out of Gaza in 2007 and seized control of the coastal enclave.\n\nThe accord also represents China's growing influence in the Middle East, after having brokered a peace agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\nThe Voice of America provides news and information in more than 40 languages to an estimated weekly audience of over 326 million people.

The Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, abides by interim peace agreements with Israel signed in the early 1990s.\n\nFatah and Hamas have been rivals since Hamas violently routed forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah in Gaza in 2007, taking over the impoverished coastal enclave. The Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, headed by Abbas, administers parts of the occupied West Bank. It is widely viewed by the Palestinian public as corrupt, out of touch, and a subcontractor for Israel because of their joint security coordination.\n\nRepeated attempts at mending the rift have failed, wrecked by the factions' own bitter rivalry over power and the West's refusal to accept any government that includes Hamas unless it expressly recognizes Israel.\n\nUnited States President Joe Biden's administration envisions a revamped Palestinian Authority to rule postwar Gaza and has sought a series of reforms that might make it a viable presence in the war-ravaged territory. Israel rejected that idea, but has not put forward a credible alternative for who will govern Gaza.\n\nThe Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militant group allied with Hamas, issued a statement Tuesday after the talks saying that it still \"rejects any formula that includes recognition of Israel explicitly or implicitly\" and that it had \"demanded the withdrawal of the Palestine Liberation Organization's recognition of Israel.\"", "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@newindianexpress.com",

DW 20/07/2024 - ExBulletin", "body": "Representatives from Hamas and Fatah are due to meet in China next week for the second round of talks hosted by Beijing since April, as the vision for a post-war Gaza is widely seen as dependent on reconciliation between the rival Palestinian factions.\n\nThe last time Hamas and Fatah representatives met in China, Chinese officials did not announce the date of the meeting, and according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, the main takeaway was that the two sides \"agreed to continue this process of dialogue and strive to achieve Palestinian unity at an early date.\"\n\nThis time, the stakes may be higher in the context of ongoing ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas.\n\nA recent report in the Washington Post The latest round of ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas indicated that both sides had agreed in principle to an \"interim governance\" plan for control of Gaza, with a security control force \"drawn from a core group of approximately 2,500 Palestinian Authority supporters in Gaza who have already been selected by Israel.\"\n\nHamas, the Islamist group currently at war with Israel in Gaza following the October 7 terrorist attacks, has been in conflict with Fatah since 2007, after Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip. Fatah is the largest faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which controls Palestinian politics in the occupied West Bank, and is internationally recognized as the representative of the Palestinian people.\n\nFatah leader and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has criticized Hamas in the past for the Gaza war, while Hamas has accused Abbas of siding with Israel. Hamas is considered a terrorist organization by the United States, Israel and several other countries.\n\n\"China is certainly realistic enough to see that the two factions have been hostile to each other for so many years and that a complete reconciliation cannot happen overnight,\" Bjrn Alpermann, chair of contemporary Chinese studies at Germany's University of W\u00fcrzburg, told DW.\n\n\"There are of course ideological and political factors behind this, so I think it is already a success for China if the two factions are discussing and negotiating with each other in a somewhat civilized manner,\" he added.\n\nAny progress in bringing Hamas and Fatah closer together, however far-fetched, would be a major diplomatic victory for China, which is seeking to position itself as a global peace broker, particularly as an alternative to the United States.\n\n\"Beijing wants to present itself as a peacemaker and counterbalance its constructive role with what it sees as a destabilizing role by the United States,\" Bonnie S. Glaser, managing director of the German Marshall Fund's Indo-Pacific program, told DW. \"That's the primary goal. The Chinese probably don't expect a breakthrough,\" she added.\n\nIn recent years, the Middle East has been an arena where China has scored some diplomatic successes. In April 2023, Beijing brokered the restoration of relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia, with the two countries' foreign ministers holding their first meeting in seven years in China.\n\nShortly after, the Chinese Foreign Ministry urged Israel to resume peace negotiations with the Palestinians in favor of a two-state solution. This was several months before the October 7 terrorist attacks.\n\nChina, however, has a long tradition of supporting Arab countries. During the Cold War, it declared solidarity with its Arab allies and often voted against Israel at the United Nations. It was not until 1992 that China and Israel formally established diplomatic relations.\n\nSince establishing formal diplomatic relations with Israel, China has primarily viewed the latter as a trading partner. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was scheduled to visit China in October 2023, with the main goal of concluding a free trade agreement, but the trip was canceled after the October 7 terrorist attacks.\n\nSinologist Alpermann said that in the case of Israel and the Palestinians, China \"is never completely neutral, but very clearly on the side of the Palestinians.\"\n\n\"The Chinese government traditionally sees itself as being on the side of the oppressed in such conflicts,\" he said, adding that China has moved closer to the Palestinians in recent years.\n\n\"I interpret this as an attempt by China to position itself more strongly in the Middle East and around the world as an alternative to the US-led world order,\" he said.\n\nBeijing does not maintain regular contact with the Islamist terrorist organization Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip. However, it does maintain ties with the leaders of the Palestinian Authority.\n\nFollowing talks between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Palestinian Authority President Abbas in June 2023, China said it would support the establishment of a Palestinian state, reiterating its long-standing support for Palestinian statehood, which Israel opposes.\n\nIn May 2024, Chinese President Xi Jinping said the same thing again at a conference of Arab leaders in Beijing, while lamenting the suffering caused by the Gaza war.\n\n\"War must not continue indefinitely. Justice must not be absent forever,\" Xi said.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

If the Palestinian groups agree to more unity under China's guidance, it could put Israel in a difficult position. This is because it would enable the backers of Hamas, such as Russia, Turkey, and Qatar, to push for Hamas to play a larger role in the West Bank.\n\nChina's Xinhua media said that \"at the invitation of the Chinese side, high-level representatives of 14 Palestinian factions held a reconciliation dialogue in Beijing from July 21 to 23, and the Palestinian factions inked a declaration on ending the division and strengthening unity.\"\n\nThe report further added that \"it is the first time that 14 Palestinian factions have gathered in Beijing for a reconciliation dialogue, bringing precious hope to the suffering Palestinian people.\"\n\nThe Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement (PIJ) said that some leaks to the media about the meetings in Beijing had incorrectly made it seem that PIJ would recognize Israel. PIJ is backed by Iran and is seen as an Iranian proxy. It has numerous members in Gaza and the West Bank, particularly in Jenin.\n\nAccording to the pro-Iran Al-Mayadeen media, a member of the Political Bureau of Islamic Jihad, Ihsan Ataya, said that the group did not agree to any formula that stipulates international resolutions that would lead to recognition of the legitimacy of the \"entity,\" meaning Israel. In fact, PIJ wants the PLO to withdraw recognition of Israel. PIJ demanded in Beijing to create an \"emergency committee\" to \"manage the battle\" against Israel.\n\nOther reports about the meeting indicated that Hamas and Fatah had agreed to end decades of divisions at the meeting. This kind of talk about them ending divisions has happened in the past. However, there are long memories about how Hamas forced Fatah out of Gaza in 2007.\n\nIn 2007, Hamas killed Fatah members and carried out a coup in Gaza, setting the stage for 16 years of destructive rule in Gaza and endless wars that led to the October 7 attack. According to Reuters, senior Hamas official Hussam Badran praised the Beijing meeting and asserted that it could lead to a united government for the Palestinian Authority. This would be a major challenge for Israel because it would essentially bring Hamas to power in the West Bank. This is the situation that loomed back in 2006 after the Palestinian legislative elections.\n\nAccording to CNN, \"Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the agreement was 'dedicated to the great reconciliation and unity of all 14 factions.'\" He went on to say that \"the core outcome is that the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) is the sole legitimate representative of all Palestinian people...an agreement has been reached on post-Gaza war governance and the establishment of a provisional national reconciliation government.\"\n\nThe CNN report also said that Hamas representative Mousa Abu Marzook also spotlighted the \"course of reconciliation.\" He said, \"We're at a historic junction. Our people are rising up in their efforts to struggle...[October 7] changed a lot, both in the international and regional landscape.\"\n\nHamas's goals of finding a greater role in the West Bank\n\nThis illustrates that Hamas is using the meetings in China in order to work its way into a greater role in the West Bank while continuing to see October 7 as a victory. It's important to note, as the CNN article helpfully does, that \"Beijing has not explicitly condemned Hamas for its October 7 attack on Israel.\"\n\nThe Beijing meetings have, so far, been greeted with only minimal interest in the wider region. Iran doesn't appear to be playing up the meetings, and neither do the Gulf countries. That could change if Iran and the Gulf states think that this meeting has a real chance of success. It is likely that many countries in the region are cynical about the chances for real reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah.\n\nIn addition, many countries quietly oppose Hamas, and those that back Hamas, like Iran, may have other goals for the West Bank. Iran, for instance, has sought to destabilize Jordan during this current war. Overall, it is clear the goal of Iran, Qatar, and Turkey is to bring Hamas to power in the West Bank.\n\nThey each have different ways of going about that goal. Iran would prefer to feed the growing lawlessness in the northern West Bank that could lead the Palestinian Authority to further erode there. For instance, clashes in Tulkarm on July 23 show how terrorist groups, such as Hamas, are seeking a greater foothold in the West Bank.\n\nSince October 7, there has been a lot of maneuvering behind the scenes to see how Hamas and other groups might use the attacks to further their goals in the West Bank. The clashes in Tulkarm and other battles in the West Bank over the last year illustrate that Iran-backed groups are gaining strength there.\n\nThey are seeking to stockpile explosives for use in improvised explosive devices, and they are acquiring large numbers of weapons, especially M-4 or M-16 style rifles. These are increasingly seen at marches and memorials, and there are increased threats to Israel.\n\nThe goal of October 7, in the eyes of the countries that back Hamas, is to bring Hamas to power in the West Bank. Israel's goal since 2007 has been to keep Gaza and the West Bank separate and isolate Hamas in Gaza. The war since October has not resulted in Hamas being defeated or removed from power in Gaza. This is why the Beijing meetings are important. In the absence of Israel defeating Hamas, it will continue to leverage support from Beijing, Ankara, Tehran, and Doha to grow its power and seek a larger regional role.\n\nHamas leaders reside in Doha and easily fly back and forth around the region. Hamas has not been isolated due to the atrocities of October 7, rather it has been strengthened in some ways. The Beijing meetings were an example of this strength and clout.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Previous attempts to mediate between Hamas and Fatah -- including a meeting in Beijing in April -- failed to produce tangible results. The two groups have a fraught history and have been at loggerheads for years, each trying to present itself as the legitimate leader of the Palestinian people and wary that the other will undermine its power.\n\nThe meetings in Beijing instead appear to be a move by China to position itself as a peace broker after its success negotiating a deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran last year. Beijing is not involved in the cease-fire talks between Israel and Hamas that are being led by Qatar, Egypt, and the United States, but Palestinian experts have said cooperation between Hamas and Fatah is critical to discussions about a postwar future in Gaza.\n\nHamas and Fatah both dispatched top officials to the Chinese capital for the meetings, as did other smaller Palestinian factions.\n\nEarlier this month, Mousa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas official, said Ismail Haniyeh, the chairman of Hamas's political office, would be attending the meetings, but participants said Mr. Haniyeh was not present.\n\nMustafa Barghouti, the chairman of the Palestinian National Initiative, one of the smaller factions, said progress had made been achieved at the meetings in Beijing, but he cautioned that the real test would be whether Hamas and Fatah take steps to improve cooperation on the ground.\n\nWang Yi, China's top diplomat, was expected to meet with Hamas and Fatah on Tuesday. China's Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. In response to questions about the meetings at a news conference on Monday, a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry said, \"China has always firmly supported the just cause of the Palestinian people to restore their legitimate national rights,\" adding that details of the meetings would be released \"in due course.\"\n\nChinese diplomats are unlikely to take any bold steps that could risk exposing the limits of their own clout, said Robert Mogielnicki, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.\n\n\"Chinese officials will offer an international platform for their regional partners,\" he said. \"But the overarching goal here is to enhance Beijing's global stature.\"\n\nPalestinian analysts were similarly pessimistic, citing significant obstacles.\n\nHamas and Fatah traveled to Beijing merely to placate their Chinese hosts, said Akram Atallah, a Palestinian columnist for Al-Ayyam, a Ramallah-based newspaper.\n\n\"They're not going to China to make deals, develop cooperation and build a political partnership,\" he said. \"They're going to honor China's role.\"\n\nZixu Wang contributed reporting from Hong Kong.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com",

Our people are rising up in their efforts to struggle,\" said Abu Marzook who claimed the agreement was the culmination of a \"course of reconciliation.\"\n\nHowever, uncertainty remained over what Hamas' function would be and what impact the deal might have given the question marks over how the war might affect the future governance of Palestinian territories and Israel's stated aim of wiping out Hamas.\n\nChina backs statehood for the Palestinians and has provided emergency humanitarian aid to Gaza during the conflict and pledged post-war reconstruction assistance.\n\nTuesday's agreement came a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking in Washington ahead of a meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden, said a deal to free hostages being held in Gaza was looking more hopeful.\n\nHis comments came after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas was within the \"10-yard line.\"", "source": {"uri": "sacbee.com",

The parties agreed on strengthening \"Palestinian unity\", in a joint communiqu\u00e9. Chinese state channel CCTV rushed to report the declaration, with the aim of demonstrating China's influence on the Middle East and on Palestinian affairs.\n\nAltogether, fourteen factions, including senior people from Fatah and Hamas, met at the conference hosted by Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, the CGTN agency reported. This was a continuation of a meeting of Fatah and Hamas representatives in China in April, with the aim of ending the split dating from the violent takeover of the Gaza Strip by Hamas in 2007. The fourteen factions have now agreed on \"national unity\", the joint declaration states.\n\nWang Yi welcomed the \"unity government\" of the Palestinian Authority. Fatah was represented by Mahmoud al-Aloul, deputy to Palestinian Authority chairperson Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) , while the Hamas delegation was led by Mousa Abu Marzook. So far, however, the subject of a Palestinian unity government has been mentioned only by Chinese reports, and not by any senior representatives of Fatah or Hamas. Moreover, similar events in the past did not in fact change the poor state of relations between the two movements.\n\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara have met the families of Israeli hostages held in the Gaza Strip and also representatives of the hostages in the US, in the course of the prime minister's diplomatic visit to Washington DC. \"We are determined to bring them all back,\" Netanyahu said. \"The conditions have matured, for the simple reason that we are applying very strong pressure on Hamas. We are seeing the enemy's spirit starting to break.\"\n\nNetanyahu is due to address the US Congress tomorrow (Wednesday). An aide to the Democratic Party's probable presidential candidate in the election in November, Vice President Kamala Harris, told N12 that she would hold a meeting with Netanyahu in the White House, separately from his meeting with President Joe Biden. Because of a prearranged trip, however, the vice president will not be present at Netanyahu's speech in Congress. The aide also said that Harris had been committed to the security of Israel throughout her career, and that that remained the case.", "source": {"uri": "en.globes.co.il", "dataType": "news", "title": "Globes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fatah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Abbas", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mahmoud Abbas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Yi_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wang Yi (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Central_Television", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China Central Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_unity_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National unity government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mousa_Mohammed_Abu_Marzook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/globes/image/upload/t_800X392/v1719408394/direct/shutterstock_2364947735_jtnzc5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749919", "eventUri": "eng-9749919", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

A meeting was held in Communist China that brought together representatives of 14 Palestinian terror groups to sign something called the Beijing Declaration creating a national unity government in Palestine. There is so much end times stuff happening in this one event that we will talk about it on our Tuesday night Bible study this evening.\n\n\"The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.\" Acts 4:26 (KJB)\n\nIf you've ever watched the movie 'The Godfather' and saw the scene about the meeting of the 5 crime families, then you know what's happening here. Communist China has formed this alliance with Palestinian terror groups because all of them seek the destruction of the nation of Israel. At some point Russia will jump into the action as well. Things are moving very quickly now, Christian, as this next giant step on the end times timeline takes place.\n\nFROM THE JERUSALEM POST: Various Palestinian factions including rivals Hamas and Fatah agreed to end their divisions and form a national unity government during negotiations in China that ended Tuesday, according to Chinese state media.\n\nThe Beijing Declaration was signed at the closing ceremony of a reconciliation dialogue among the factions held in China's capital from July 21-23, state broadcaster CCTV said.\n\nSenior Hamas official Hussam Badran said the most important point of the Beijing Declaration was to form a Palestinian national unity government to manage the affairs of Palestinians. In a statement to their Telegram, Hamas claimed that the Beijing Declaration was a positive step towards achieving Palestinian national unity, thanking the host country China \"with its international weight and its firm position in support of the Palestinian cause.\"\n\nThe statement criticized the US, saying, \"The American administration stands against any internal Palestinian national consensus and is completely biased and even partners with the occupation in its crimes against our people.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his goal is to destroy Hamas, an Iranian-backed terror group, and opposes it having any role in a post-war Gaza administration. Foreign Affairs Minister Israel Katz responded to the deal between the factions in a post to X, stating, \"Hamas and Fatah signed an agreement in China for joint control of Gaza after the war.\"\n\n\"Instead of rejecting terrorism, Mahmoud Abbas embraces the murderers and rapists of Hamas, revealing his true face. In reality, this won't happen because Hamas's rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands.\"\n\nA total of 14 Palestinian factions, including the leaders of Fatah and Hamas, also met with the media, with China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi present, CGTN said in a social media post.\n\nThe agreement marks a diplomatic coup for Beijing and its growing influence in the Middle East. Last year, Beijing brokered a breakthrough peace deal between longstanding regional foes Saudi Arabia and Iran. Badran praised China in a statement for its significant effort to host the talks and reach such a declaration. READ MORE\n\nHamas and Fatah have signed an agreement in Beijing to form a national unity government and govern Gaza post-war. China, hosting the talks, emphasized the importance of a ceasefire and humanitarian aid. This move strengthens China's role as a mediator in the Middle East following its successful mediation between Iran and Saudi Arabia in 2023.\n\nWhen you contribute to this fundraising effort, you are helping us to do what the Lord called us to do.

He's heading to Beijing for talks with Fatah, the Palestinian group that controls the West Bank. The Chinese government is trying to mediate between the rival groups. They will speak with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi today and Tuesday.\n\nThis is not the first time Hamas and Fatah have engaged in talks. There have been several meetings in the Middle East in recent years. But the fact that they are traveling to China to talk to each other is new. The first meeting was held in Beijing in April, but reportedly yielded no results. China hopes the Palestinians will now move closer to each other, though it is not clear what they will actually have to offer.\n\nReconciliation could offer a way out of the war in Gaza, which has already left nearly 40,000 people dead. The international community hopes that Fatah will resume its role in governing Gaza when the war ends. That is also the focus of negotiations for a truce. Hamas is said to be willing to allow Fatah-led Palestinian Authority security forces into Gaza, a US source said last week. New York times.\n\n\"This summit in China is very important,\" says Middle East expert Brigitte Hermans, a researcher at the Center for Human Rights at Ghent University. \"Previous talks have always failed. Since Hamas took power in Gaza in 2007, there has been a complete rift between Hamas and Fatah. They are fighting for power in the Palestinian territories. But it is especially important now that they agree on what will happen after the war.\"\n\nHerremans says Israel does not want Hamas to remain administratively responsible for enforcing the law in Gaza. \"But Fatah absolutely does not want to return to Gaza without reaching an agreement with Hamas. Then Hamas will do everything it can to undermine that.\"\n\nObservers are skeptical that a deal can be reached in Beijing. But the participants are taking the talks seriously. \"Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh is coming to Beijing, and Fatah is sending its chief negotiator Mahmoud al-Aloul,\" says Herremans, a Middle East expert. \"They are giving it top priority. Now that China is showing more international ambitions, the Palestinians will think: we have to take advantage of this.\"\n\nThe Chinese government did not publicize the meeting in Beijing. It was reported to The New York Times after Hamas and Fatah confirmed it.\n\nA Chinese government spokesman said more details would be released \"in due course.\"", "source": {"uri": "houstonianonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "houstonianonline.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fatah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Yi_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wang Yi (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_leader", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramount leader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749919", "eventUri": "eng-9749919", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

It comes just over a year after China helped broker an agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia that saw them restore diplomatic relations after years of soaring tensions between the Middle Eastern powerhouses, unnerving many in Washington.\n\nThe eight-point declaration states that both sides will agree to the \"formation of a temporary national unity government by agreement of the Palestinian factions,\" according to a copy of the document seen by NBC News.\n\nIt adds that \"the formed government shall exercise its powers and jurisdictions over all Palestinian territories, affirming the unity of the West Bank, Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, with the government starting the unification of all Palestinian institutions in the territories and the preparation for holding general elections.\"\n\nThe signatories have also agreed to \"resist and thwart attempts to displace our people\" from the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and Jerusalem \"and affirm the illegality of settlement and settlement expansion in accordance with the resolutions of the U.N. Security Council, the U.N. General Assembly, and the opinion of the International Court of Justice.\"\n\nA Palestinian official familiar with the declaration told NBC News, \"the implementation on the ground\" is what matters now.\n\n\"The preferred way out for Hamas would be to embed itself in some post-partisan Palestinian governance structure,\" Jon Alterman, the director of the Middle East program at the Washington based Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, told NBC News on the eve of Palestinian talks.\n\n\"Whether it's going to be acceptable to others -- the United States, Israel, Europe -- I don't know,\" he added.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration has proposed a plan that would ultimately lead to a permanent cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, as well as the release of all hostages and major post-war reconstruction. It also envisions a revamped Palestinian Authority to rule Gaza once the conflict ends. Israel rejected that idea, but has not put forward a credible alternative for how Gaza will be governed and by who.\n\nChina is not directly involved in the U.S.-led efforts between Israel and Hamas toward a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, but is looking to stake out a role in post-war reconstruction. China has also made no secret of its desire to hold an international peace conference, and hosting Palestinian unity talks is seen as a diplomatic step toward that.\n\n\"There is nothing to lose (for China) by hosting such an event,\" Fariz Mehdawi, the Palestinian Authority's ambassador to China, said in a recent interview with NBC News in Beijing, \"In diplomacy either you do some good political moves, or it will be considered a failure for you.\"\n\nAfter a first round of meetings in April ended with little progress, China waited until the participants had left the country before it announced the talks had taken place. A second round planned last month was scrapped after Hamas and Fatah pulled out at the last minute.\n\nPower struggles have long split Fatah and Hamas, a divide that deepened in 2007 with Hamas' violent takeover of the Gaza Strip following elections the year before.\n\nThe rupture has since left the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority, governing only parts of the occupied West Bank and increasingly criticized as having eroding legitimacy, according to studies by Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research. Israel has exercised power over both the West Bank and Gaza in different ways.\n\nThe bitter divisions and the West's refusal to accept any government that includes Hamas unless it expressly recognizes Israel has thwarted repeated attempts at healing the rift.\n\n\"The historical divide between Hamas and Fatah is deep, with years of hostility and ideological differences,\" said Maria Papageorgiou, a lecturer in politics and international relations at the University of Exeter in the U.K.\n\nShe added that successfully mediating between the different factions would be \"a major diplomatic win\" for China.\n\nMehdawi, the Palestinian ambassador, said Beijing \"cannot call for a peace conference where the Palestinians themselves are not fixing their home.\"\n\nThe outcome of the agreement would see Hamas come under the umbrella of the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Liberation Organization, and for the PLO to be \"the sole legitimate representative of all Palestinian people,\" said Wang Yi, according to Chinese state media.\n\nChina has \"a strong national interest in being at the grownups table for international diplomacy,\" said Alterman.\n\n\"China wants to be a part of whatever grand diplomatic jamboree ends this conflict and it would like to be a prominent part of that,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC

Beijing is not directly involved in the U.S.-led efforts between Israel and Hamas toward a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip. However, by hosting Palestinian unity talks, China can present itself as an alternative player in the region with less of a diplomatic gamble.\n\n\"There is nothing to lose by hosting such an event,\" said Fariz Mehdawi, the Palestinian Authority's ambassador to China, in an interview with NBC News in Beijing.\n\n\"The issue is not why,\" he said. \"The question for China is: Why not?\"\n\nMehdawi, who has served as the Palestinian ambassador to China since 2016, says China regards Palestinian unity talks as useful groundwork toward its ultimate objective: the prestige of hosting an international peace conference.\n\nChina has made no secret of that goal. In May, Chinese leader Xi Jinping told a meeting of diplomats from China and Arab states here that \"war should not continue indefinitely.\" Xi reiterated Beijing's support for a \"broad-based, authoritative and effective international peace conference,\" as well as China's call for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.\n\nChina is also expected to seek out a role in postwar Gaza to help rebuild infrastructure. Diplomats including Cao Xiaolin, China's ambassador to Qatar, and envoy Wang Kejian met in March with Hamas' political leader, Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nHamas released a statement stating that Chinese officials told Haniyeh, \"Hamas is part of the Palestinian national fabric and China is keen on relations with it.\"\n\nIt is a delicate balance for China as it also has diplomatic relations and trade ties with Israel, though officially Beijing has never condemned the Oct. 7 attacks.\n\n\"China is not proffering itself as mediator between anybody and anybody else,\" said Mehdawi. China \"cannot call for a peace conference where the Palestinians themselves are not fixing their home.\"\n\nBeing the potential guarantor of a Palestinian unity agreement would be a win for China, after joining Oman and Iraq to broker a deal last year between Saudi Arabia and Iran that restored full diplomatic ties between the rivals. There was no U.S. or European involvement.\n\n\"China wants to be a part of whatever grand diplomatic jamboree ends this conflict, and it would like to be a prominent part of that,\" said Jon Alterman, senior vice president and director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\"For the most part, China sees this as a relatively inexpensive way to do something,\" he said. \"If it works, it is prestigious, and if it doesn't work, it's no harm, no foul.\"\n\nPalestinian unity has been elusive. Power struggles have long split Fatah and Hamas, a divide that deepened in 2007 with Hamas' chaotic takeover of the Gaza Strip following elections the year before. The rupture has since left the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority governing only parts of the West Bank and doing so amid complaints by Palestinians of eroding legitimacy, according to a 2023 study by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, an independent think tank in Ramallah. Israel has exercised power over both the West Bank and Gaza in different ways.\n\nThe talks in Beijing will be held at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, a sprawling compound of gardens, lakes, buildings and a hotel where the Communist Party receives foreign dignitaries. It will bring together a delegation of senior officials from Fatah including its deputy chairman, Mahmoud Aloul, with Hamas counterparts led by Haniyeh.\n\nChina's Foreign Minister Wang Yi will meet with both sides, a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said when they confirmed the meetings. The factions will also meet without Wang, who is China's top diplomat, but there is a plan for him to rejoin on the last day, according to Palestinian officials familiar with the schedule.\n\nAcknowledging the talks in advance, for China, suggests a different level of confidence in what they might yield. A first round of meetings took place here in April with little progress, and China announced them only after the participants had finished and left the country. The Beijing discussion followed a similar meeting in Moscow in February.\n\nWhen the time came for Chinese officials to host the planned second round of unity talks here on June 24, Hamas and Fatah pulled out at the last minute. Both factions issued statements that blamed the other for rejecting the meeting and expressed \"appreciation\" to their Chinese hosts.\n\n\"The historical divide between Hamas and Fatah is deep,\" said Maria Papageorgiou, a lecturer in politics and international relations at the University of Exeter, \"China's direct influence on Palestinian politics remains limited compared to other players.\"\n\nChina's relations with Palestinians date back to the 1960s, when the government under Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong provided food, weapons, training and support to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).\n\nIn 1988, China was among the first countries in the world to recognize a Palestinian state, and its representative office in Beijing was converted to embassy level in 1974. These days, Palestinians rely on China primarily for diplomatic support at the United Nations, according to officials.\n\nThose PLO ties have long been entwined with China's push into the Middle East, driven mainly by economic interests that have expanded its foreign policy influence, too. Much of Beijing's crude oil imports come from the region, and Chinese investment has funded billions of dollars in infrastructure projects including ports, highways and skyscrapers.\n\n\"Although China has gained significant economic presence in the Middle East, its [diplomatic] credibility does not always match its influence,\" said Papageorgiou, adding that China's now-strained relations with Israel over the conflict will make it difficult to facilitate conversations between Palestinians and Israelis without U.S. involvement.\n\nIn a statement to NBC News, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs maintained China has \"always firmly supported the just cause of the Palestinian people.\" Without naming the U.S., it went on to say, \"China calls on influential major countries to 'take off their tinted glass' and abandon 'double standards' when dealing with regional affairs.\"\n\n\"China's worldview is not that you have a strong international community that advances common interests,\" said Alterman. \"China's preference is to engage one by one, so to the extent that China undermines this broader effort to encourage multilateralism, I think the United States considers that to be unhelpful.\"\n\nMehdawi, the Palestinian ambassador, does not see China vying to replace the U.S. as the dominant power in the region when it comes to diplomacy. Instead, he regards China's involvement with unity talks as filling a role the U.S. is unable to undertake given its support for Israel.\n\n\"Chinese foreign policy is not so ambitious,\" he said. \"They know their limitations. Failures of the U.S. are making it appear that China is doing more.\"\n\n\"When you leave a space, somebody will take it.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"},

But even after a deal is signed, the vision for a postwar Gaza remains in doubt, with Israel vehemently opposed to any role by Hamas in governing Gaza.\n\nSince the current war broke out in Gaza, Hamas officials have said that the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and the group has called for formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nThe two groups signed the Beijing Declaration on \"ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity,\" according to state broadcaster CCTV.", "source": {"uri": "lethbridgenewsnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lethbridge News Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fatah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramallah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ramallah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ramallah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Central_Television", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China Central Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://d2ksr9467jthww.cloudfront.net/20240723090748/669f7c60023d1607a07bcfaejpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749919", "eventUri": "eng-9749919", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Beijing is not directly involved in the U.S.-led efforts between Israel and Hamas toward a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip. However, by hosting Palestinian unity talks, China can present itself as an alternative player in the region with less of a diplomatic gamble.\n\n\"There is nothing to lose by hosting such an event,\" said Fariz Mehdawi, the Palestinian Authority's ambassador to China, in an interview with NBC News in Beijing.\n\n\"The issue is not why,\" he said. \"The question for China is: Why not?\"\n\nMehdawi, who has served as the Palestinian ambassador to China since 2016, says China regards Palestinian unity talks as useful groundwork toward its ultimate objective: the prestige of hosting an international peace conference.\n\nChina has made no secret of that goal. In May, Chinese leader Xi Jinping told a meeting of diplomats from China and Arab states here that \"war should not continue indefinitely.\" Xi reiterated Beijing's support for a \"broad-based, authoritative and effective international peace conference,\" as well as China's call for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.\n\nChina is also expected to seek out a role in postwar Gaza to help rebuild infrastructure. Diplomats including Cao Xiaolin, China's ambassador to Qatar, and envoy Wang Kejian met in March with Hamas' political leader, Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nHamas released a statement stating that Chinese officials told Haniyeh, \"Hamas is part of the Palestinian national fabric and China is keen on relations with it.\"\n\nIt is a delicate balance for China as it also has diplomatic relations and trade ties with Israel, though officially Beijing has never condemned the Oct. 7 attacks.\n\n\"China is not proffering itself as mediator between anybody and anybody else,\" said Mehdawi. China \"cannot call for a peace conference where the Palestinians themselves are not fixing their home.\"\n\nBeing the potential guarantor of a Palestinian unity agreement would be a win for China, after joining Oman and Iraq to broker a deal last year between Saudi Arabia and Iran that restored full diplomatic ties between the rivals. There was no U.S. or European involvement.\n\n\"China wants to be a part of whatever grand diplomatic jamboree ends this conflict, and it would like to be a prominent part of that,\" said Jon Alterman, senior vice president and director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\"For the most part, China sees this as a relatively inexpensive way to do something,\" he said. \"If it works, it is prestigious, and if it doesn't work, it's no harm, no foul.\"\n\nPalestinian unity has been elusive. Power struggles have long split Fatah and Hamas, a divide that deepened in 2007 with Hamas' chaotic takeover of the Gaza Strip following elections the year before. The rupture has since left the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority governing only parts of the West Bank and doing so amid complaints by Palestinians of eroding legitimacy, according to a 2023 study by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, an independent think tank in Ramallah. Israel has exercised power over both the West Bank and Gaza in different ways.\n\nThe talks in Beijing will be held at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, a sprawling compound of gardens, lakes, buildings and a hotel where the Communist Party receives foreign dignitaries. It will bring together a delegation of senior officials from Fatah including its deputy chairman, Mahmoud Aloul, with Hamas counterparts led by Haniyeh.\n\nChina's Foreign Minister Wang Yi will meet with both sides, a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said when they confirmed the meetings. The factions will also meet without Wang, who is China's top diplomat, but there is a plan for him to rejoin on the last day, according to Palestinian officials familiar with the schedule.\n\nAcknowledging the talks in advance, for China, suggests a different level of confidence in what they might yield. A first round of meetings took place here in April with little progress, and China announced them only after the participants had finished and left the country. The Beijing discussion followed a similar meeting in Moscow in February.\n\nWhen the time came for Chinese officials to host the planned second round of unity talks here on June 24, Hamas and Fatah pulled out at the last minute. Both factions issued statements that blamed the other for rejecting the meeting and expressed \"appreciation\" to their Chinese hosts.\n\n\"The historical divide between Hamas and Fatah is deep,\" said Maria Papageorgiou, a lecturer in politics and international relations at the University of Exeter, \"China's direct influence on Palestinian politics remains limited compared to other players.\"\n\nChina's relations with Palestinians date back to the 1960s, when the government under Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong provided food, weapons, training and support to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).\n\nIn 1988, China was among the first countries in the world to recognize a Palestinian state, and its representative office in Beijing was converted to embassy level in 1974. These days, Palestinians rely on China primarily for diplomatic support at the United Nations, according to officials.\n\nThose PLO ties have long been entwined with China's push into the Middle East, driven mainly by economic interests that have expanded its foreign policy influence, too. Much of Beijing's crude oil imports come from the region, and Chinese investment has funded billions of dollars in infrastructure projects including ports, highways and skyscrapers.\n\n\"Although China has gained significant economic presence in the Middle East, its [diplomatic] credibility does not always match its influence,\" said Papageorgiou, adding that China's now-strained relations with Israel over the conflict will make it difficult to facilitate conversations between Palestinians and Israelis without U.S. involvement.\n\nIn a statement to NBC News, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs maintained China has \"always firmly supported the just cause of the Palestinian people.\" Without naming the U.S., it went on to say, \"China calls on influential major countries to 'take off their tinted glass' and abandon 'double standards' when dealing with regional affairs.\"\n\n\"China's worldview is not that you have a strong international community that advances common interests,\" said Alterman. \"China's preference is to engage one by one, so to the extent that China undermines this broader effort to encourage multilateralism, I think the United States considers that to be unhelpful.\"\n\nMehdawi, the Palestinian ambassador, does not see China vying to replace the U.S. as the dominant power in the region when it comes to diplomacy. Instead, he regards China's involvement with unity talks as filling a role the U.S. is unable to undertake given its support for Israel.\n\n\"Chinese foreign policy is not so ambitious,\" he said. \"They know their limitations. Failures of the U.S. are making it appear that China is doing more.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The two factions have been at odds since 2006, leading to Hamas seizing control of Gaza.\n\nThe new deal aims to bridge the deep divide and create a unified front for Palestinian governance.\n\nAs the talks of post-war Gaza continue, the reality for the thousands of Palestinians suffering in the besieged enclave is that the end of massacres by Israeli forces seems to be nowhere in sight. The Gaza health ministry recently announced that the death toll has reached a staggering 39,090, although British journal The Lancet predicts the true number to be closer to 186,000 once those still missing under the rubble are accounted for.\n\n\u00a9 Morocco World News.

You may follow him at Twitter @FidelRahmati\n\nForeign media report that negotiations among at least fourteen Palestinian groups, including Hamas and Fatah, in Beijing, China, have led to the signing of an agreement to form a national unity government in Gaza.\n\nAccording to a report by the Associated Press published today, Tuesday, July 23, the Palestinian groups Hamas and Fatah have signed an agreement in Beijing that ends years of division and is seen as a step toward potentially resolving the deep rift between the parties.\n\nThe formation of a \"national unity\" government in Gaza following the war is one of the terms of the \"agreement to end division and strengthen Palestinian unity,\" which was signed by delegations from Hamas and Fatah during the Beijing negotiations.\n\nThe joint statement from Hamas and Fatah indicates that the formation of a national unity government for the Palestinian territories is the outcome of recent talks aimed at uniting the factions.\n\nThe main parties in this negotiation have a long history of conflict, spanning over 15 years, and have reached a fragile agreement with China's mediation, as previous negotiations and efforts to unite Palestinian groups had failed.\n\nThe current conflict in Gaza has escalated significantly, with intense hostilities between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants causing widespread devastation. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is dire, with substantial loss of life, extensive damage to infrastructure, and severe shortages of essential supplies.\n\nReports indicate that both sides have suffered heavy casualties, with civilian areas in Gaza facing the brunt of the violence. International organizations have raised alarms about the deteriorating conditions and the urgent need for humanitarian aid.\n\nThe global community continues to call for an immediate ceasefire and increased humanitarian assistance to address the crisis.

Forces are exchanging fire,\" the army said.\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet - delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!\n\nIt has been reported the IDF used a ruse to lure the terrorists - which included an armed female combatant dressed up as a medic - to the location, where it was easier to target them.\n\nIsrael's military released footage of the strike in which these top commanders and several gunmen were killed. Ground troops also engaged terrorists in gun battles immediately prior to the strike. They also successfully destroyed several IEDs planted under roads.\n\nThe IDF raid in Tulkarem Tuesday, was part of a series of operations against terrorist activity in northern Samarian refugee camps, which has grown increasingly restive since Hamas' Oct. 7 onslaught against southern Israel - and the ensuing war which followed it.\n\nIsrael's military claimed Nafeh was responsible for preparing and planting explosive devices to be detonated against troops as well as participating in other attacks. He was also thought to be involved with recruiting fighters to Hamas, as well as having contact with the group's operatives abroad.\n\nMeanwhile, Muhammad Awad - also known as Abu Abdo - was said to be involved in several shooting attacks, as well as fundraising for terrorist attacks.\n\nFatah-Hamas rapprochement in Beijing?\n\nIn further evidence of China's growing involvement in the Middle East, the Chinese Communist Party brought together several Palestinian factions to Beijing - including Fatah and Hamas - inducing them to agree to end their disagreements and come together to form a \"government of reconciliation,\" according to Chinese media and reported on Israel's Ynet.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi hosted the talks. He described the agreement as the \"most significant development,\" noting an interim government would be established.\n\nIsrael's Foreign Minister Israel Katz blasted the move and accused Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) the Palestinian Authority President and Fatah chairman - now in the eighteenth year of his four-year term - for \"embracing murderers and rapists.\"\n\nSenior Hamas official Musa Abu Marzuk announced the terror group signed a national unity declaration with other Palestinian groups, including rivals Fatah.\n\n\"Today we sign an agreement for national unity and we say that the path to completing this journey is national unity. We are committed to national unity and we call for it,\" Abu Marzuk said.\n\nFatah itself - which heretofore has been an implacable enemy of Hamas - poured scorn on the Chinese initiative with an official saying, \"This is a Chinese public relations effort imposed by China. They are trying to influence the Middle East, but the rift between Fatah and Hamas cannot be bridged.\"\n\nThis seems to contradict statements earlier in the year, which suggested a thawing of relations between the two Palestinian factions\n\nFollowing Israel's unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005, Fatah and Hamas fought a bloody campaign for control over the coastal enclave - with Hamas eventually coming out on top. The fighting was vicious - Hamas combatants were known to have tossed Fatah opponents from rooftops. And since the misguided 2007 election, which Hamas infamously won, it has ruled the Gaza Strip with a rod of iron.\n\nWhile Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority in Judea and Samaria, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad have grown increasingly bold - especially since Oct. 7 - and seem to enjoy more widespread support than the 88-year-old Abbas. Indeed, according to recent polls, 89% of Palestinians support establishing a government including or led by Hamas. Only around 8.5% said they favor one controlled exclusively by Fatah, reported the Jewish News Syndicate.\n\nHaving fought a war now deep into its tenth month against Hamas, the prospect of the terrorist organization being involved in any way in the governance of the Palestinian parts of Judea and Samaria is not something any Israeli government or Israelis themselves could countenance. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also made it clear he does not view a path to the Palestinian Authority governing Gaza as part of the \"day after\" plan.\n\n\"I will not allow us to replace Hamastan with Fatahstan, that we replace Khan Yunis with Jenin,\" he said. \"I will not allow the State of Israel to repeat the fateful mistake of Oslo, which brought to the heart of our country and to Gaza the most extreme elements in the Arab world, which are committed to the destruction of the State of Israel and who educate their children to this end.\"\n\nAs the U.S. has increasingly withdrawn from the region, China and other state actors - including Russia - have increasingly filled the vacuum the American absence has left.\n\nBeijing was instrumental in the restoration of diplomatic ties between the two competing Islamic giants of the Middle East - Iran and Saudi Arabia - in a deal brokered in Beijing in 2023. Although the two had not directly come to blows, the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen launched waves of drones and missiles against the Saudi mainland, including the key Aramco refinery in 2019, and again in 2022.\n\nEvidence of greater Russian involvement could be seen in February, as the country hosted a two-day \"national dialogue\" on forming a unity government under the auspices of the Russian Foreign Ministry.\n\nContent created by the WND News Center is available for re-publication without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Netanyahu is in Washington, where he is to address Congress.\n\nThe Israeli military has ordered the evacuation of part of a crowded area in the Gaza Strip it had designated a humanitarian zone,. The Health Ministry in Gaza says over 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in the nine-month war.\n\nEgypt, Qatar and the United States are pushing Israel and Hamas toward a phased deal that would stop the fighting and free remaining hostages. Netanyahu's office has said a negotiating team will be sent to continue talks Thursday.\n\nIn China, Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration on forming a unity government and ending a long rift. But previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nIsraeli raid in a Palestinian city in the West Bank kills 5, including 3 militants\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israeli forces raided a Palestinian city in the occupied West Bank killing at least five people, including three militants, the Israeli military, Hamas and the Palestinian Health Ministry said Tuesday. The ministry said two women were among the dead.\n\nThe military said a drone struck militants in the area of the northern West Bank city of Tulkarem overnight, killing Ashraf Nafa, who the military called a local senior Hamas operative. It said another alleged militant, Mohammed Awad, was also killed, and said both had been behind attacks on Israeli soldiers. The Israeli statement did not mention the women.\n\nHamas identified Nafa as a member and said two other militants with the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, including Awad, were also killed.\n\nFor several years, the Israeli military has been carrying out near nightly raids in the West Bank that intensified when the war in Gaza erupted. The Palestinian Health Ministry says more than 500 Palestinians have been killed in the ensuing violence, many of them in clashes with Israeli soldiers but others while throwing stones or protesting. People not involved in confrontations have also been killed.\n\nPalestinian attacks against Israelis have been on the rise in the territory.\n\nA top WHO official is worried about possible polio and other disease outbreaks in Gaza\n\nGENEVA -- A top World Health Organization official in Palestinian areas said Tuesday he's \"extremely worried\" about polio and other outbreaks of communicable diseases in Gaza after traces of the virus turned up in sewage samples in the territory.\n\nDr. Ayadil Saparbekov, team lead for health emergencies at WHO in the occupied Palestinian territory, said test results and a risk assessment were expected this week about how people and medical officials should respond to a possible outbreak.\n\nThere have been no confirmed human cases of polio in Gaza, but six of seven sewage samples tested positive for vaccine-derived polio virus, he said. That means that one or more people who got a polio vaccine jab have shed the virus in the environment.\n\n\"I am extremely worried about an outbreak happening in Gaza. And this is not only polio -- the different outbreaks of the communicable diseases that may happen,\" he told a United Nations briefing in Geneva by video, alluding to a hepatitis outbreak there in 2023.\n\nSaparbekov said lack of water, sanitation, and access to health care could lead to more people dying of communicable diseases than from injury related conditions.\n\nRolando Gomez, a United Nations spokesperson in Geneva, said Israel \"as the occupying power\" has a responsibility \"to ensure assistance reaches those in need in Gaza\" and to \"create an enabling environment for the U.N. and our partners to operate.\"\n\nIsrael has announced plans to vaccinate its soldiers operating in Gaza against polio.\n\nPalestinian factions sign a declaration in the latest attempt to clear the way for a unity government as the war in Gaza rages on\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank -- Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration in Beijing on ending a yearslong rift, Chinese state state broadcaster CCTV said Tuesday, taking a step toward potentially resolving the deep divide between the sides as the war in Gaza rages on.\n\nThe declaration by the two heavyweights of Palestinian politics -- and other smaller Palestinian groups -- to form a unity government for the Palestinian territories is the result of the latest in a series of talks meant to unite the sides.\n\nBut previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution. It also comes as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the nine-month war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nStill, the future of Gaza is undecided, with Israel vehemently opposed to any role by Hamas in governing Gaza. It has also rejected calls from the United States for the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority to run Gaza after the war ends. The lack of a postwar vision for running the Gaza Strip has complicated negotiations over a cease-fire.\n\nSince the current war broke out in Gaza almost 10 months ago, Hamas officials have said that the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and the group has called for formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nConditions for a cease-fire deal that would release hostages from captivity in Gaza are 'ripening,' Israel's Netanyahu says\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has signaled that a cease-fire deal that would free dozens of hostages from captivity in Gaza could be taking shape.\n\nIn a meeting late Monday in Washington with families of hostages, Netanyahu said the conditions to bring the captives back were \"ripening,\" according to a statement from his office. He said that was happening because of the fierce military pressure Israel was putting on Hamas.\n\nHe gave no further details on the deal's progress.\n\nFor weeks, Israel and Hamas have been weighing a United States-backed cease-fire deal that would bring a halt to the nine-month war and free the roughly 120 hostages taken by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack. About a third of the hostages are said to be dead, and Israel's military announced Monday that two more died in captivity.\n\nNetanyahu faces intense pressure from a broad swath of Israelis to agree to the deal. He has vowed to defeat Hamas before stopping the war, a term that has been a main sticking point throughout the negotiations.\n\nThe families of hostages had demanded that Netanyahu nail down a deal before flying to Washington, where he will address Congress and is expected to meet President Joe Biden.\n\nBill labeling UN Palestinian aid agency as a 'terror group' moves forward in Israel's parliament\n\nJERUSALEM, Israel -- An Israeli parliamentary bill that seeks to label the main provider of aid for Palestinians in Gaza a terrorist group is moving ahead.\n\nLegislators voted 50-10 in favor of the bill in a preliminary vote in Israel's parliament Monday. The bill requires two more votes before becoming law.\n\nThe bill is the product of increasingly tense relations between Israel and the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. Israel has accused the agency of militant links, claiming that hundreds of its employees are members of militant groups, including some who allegedly participated in Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel. Those accusations led to a global cascade of funding cuts to the agency.\n\nUNRWA employs thousands of workers and provides vital aid and services to millions of people across the Middle East. In Gaza, it has been the main supplier of food, water and shelter to civilians during the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe bill moving through parliament would brand the agency as a \"terror group,\" saying that the employees' alleged involvement in the Hamas assault shows that \"it is a terror organization that is no different from the Hamas terror organization.\" The bill also seeks to cut diplomatic ties between Israel and the agency.\n\nJuliette Touma, director of communications for UNRWA, said she wasn't entirely sure how the bill, if made law, would affect the agency, but said it would likely complicate its work. She said UNRWA is in contact with Israeli authorities on a daily basis, something the law would limit.\n\nThe European Union, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have all previously expressed concern about the bill, saying it would hobble the agency's work.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Netanyahu is in Washington, where he is to address Congress.\n\nThe Israeli military has ordered the evacuation of part of a crowded area in the Gaza Strip it had designated a humanitarian zone,. The Health Ministry in Gaza says over 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in the nine-month war.\n\nEgypt, Qatar and the United States are pushing Israel and Hamas toward a phased deal that would stop the fighting and free remaining hostages. Netanyahu's office has said a negotiating team will be sent to continue talks Thursday.\n\nIn China, Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration on forming a unity government and ending a long rift. But previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israeli forces raided a Palestinian city in the occupied West Bank killing at least five people, including three militants, the Israeli military, Hamas and the Palestinian Health Ministry said Tuesday. The ministry said two women were among the dead.\n\nThe military said a drone struck militants in the area of the northern West Bank city of Tulkarem overnight, killing Ashraf Nafa, who the military called a local senior Hamas operative. It said another alleged militant, Mohammed Awad, was also killed, and said both had been behind attacks on Israeli soldiers. The Israeli statement did not mention the women.\n\nHamas identified Nafa as a member and said two other militants with the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, including Awad, were also killed.\n\nFor several years, the Israeli military has been carrying out near nightly raids in the West Bank that intensified when the war in Gaza erupted. The Palestinian Health Ministry says more than 500 Palestinians have been killed in the ensuing violence, many of them in clashes with Israeli soldiers but others while throwing stones or protesting. People not involved in confrontations have also been killed.\n\nPalestinian attacks against Israelis have been on the rise in the territory.\n\nGENEVA -- A top World Health Organization official in Palestinian areas said Tuesday he's \"extremely worried\" about polio and other outbreaks of communicable diseases in Gaza after traces of the virus turned up in sewage samples in the territory.\n\nDr. Ayadil Saparbekov, team lead for health emergencies at WHO in the occupied Palestinian territory, said test results and a risk assessment were expected this week about how people and medical officials should respond to a possible outbreak.\n\nThere have been no confirmed human cases of polio in Gaza, but six of seven sewage samples tested positive for vaccine-derived polio virus, he said. That means that one or more people who got a polio vaccine jab have shed the virus in the environment.\n\n\"I am extremely worried about an outbreak happening in Gaza. And this is not only polio -- the different outbreaks of the communicable diseases that may happen,\" he told a United Nations briefing in Geneva by video, alluding to a hepatitis outbreak there in 2023.\n\nSaparbekov said lack of water, sanitation, and access to health care could lead to more people dying of communicable diseases than from injury related conditions.\n\nRolando Gomez, a United Nations spokesperson in Geneva, said Israel \"as the occupying power\" has a responsibility \"to ensure assistance reaches those in need in Gaza\" and to \"create an enabling environment for the U.N. and our partners to operate.\"\n\nIsrael has announced plans to vaccinate its soldiers operating in Gaza against polio.\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank -- Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration in Beijing on ending a yearslong rift, Chinese state state broadcaster CCTV said Tuesday, taking a step toward potentially resolving the deep divide between the sides as the war in Gaza rages on.\n\nThe declaration by the two heavyweights of Palestinian politics -- and other smaller Palestinian groups -- to form a unity government for the Palestinian territories is the result of the latest in a series of talks meant to unite the sides.\n\nBut previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution. It also comes as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the nine-month war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nStill, the future of Gaza is undecided, with Israel vehemently opposed to any role by Hamas in governing Gaza. It has also rejected calls from the United States for the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority to run Gaza after the war ends. The lack of a postwar vision for running the Gaza Strip has complicated negotiations over a cease-fire.\n\nSince the current war broke out in Gaza almost 10 months ago, Hamas officials have said that the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and the group has called for formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has signaled that a cease-fire deal that would free dozens of hostages from captivity in Gaza could be taking shape.\n\nIn a meeting late Monday in Washington with families of hostages, Netanyahu said the conditions to bring the captives back were \"ripening,\" according to a statement from his office. He said that was happening because of the fierce military pressure Israel was putting on Hamas.\n\nHe gave no further details on the deal's progress.\n\nFor weeks, Israel and Hamas have been weighing a United States-backed cease-fire deal that would bring a halt to the nine-month war and free the roughly 120 hostages taken by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack. About a third of the hostages are said to be dead, and Israel's military announced Monday that two more died in captivity.\n\nNetanyahu faces intense pressure from a broad swath of Israelis to agree to the deal. He has vowed to defeat Hamas before stopping the war, a term that has been a main sticking point throughout the negotiations.\n\nThe families of hostages had demanded that Netanyahu nail down a deal before flying to Washington, where he will address Congress and is expected to meet President Joe Biden.\n\nJERUSALEM, Israel -- An Israeli parliamentary bill that seeks to label the main provider of aid for Palestinians in Gaza a terrorist group is moving ahead.\n\nLegislators voted 50-10 in favor of the bill in a preliminary vote in Israel's parliament Monday. The bill requires two more votes before becoming law.\n\nThe bill is the product of increasingly tense relations between Israel and the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. Israel has accused the agency of militant links, claiming that hundreds of its employees are members of militant groups, including some who allegedly participated in Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel. Those accusations led to a global cascade of funding cuts to the agency.\n\nUNRWA employs thousands of workers and provides vital aid and services to millions of people across the Middle East. In Gaza, it has been the main supplier of food, water and shelter to civilians during the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe bill moving through parliament would brand the agency as a \"terror group,\" saying that the employees' alleged involvement in the Hamas assault shows that \"it is a terror organization that is no different from the Hamas terror organization.\" The bill also seeks to cut diplomatic ties between Israel and the agency.\n\nJuliette Touma, director of communications for UNRWA, said she wasn't entirely sure how the bill, if made law, would affect the agency, but said it would likely further complicate its work. She said UNRWA is in contact with Israeli authorities on a daily basis. The bill could make that more challenging if passed.\n\nThe European Union, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have all previously expressed concern about the bill, saying it would hobble the agency's work.",

Netanyahu is in Washington, where he was to meet with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe Israeli military ordered the evacuation of part of a crowded area in the Gaza Strip it had designated a humanitarian zone, while the Health Ministry in Gaza says over 39,000 Palestinians have now been killed in the nine-month war.\n\nEgypt, Qatar and the United States are pushing Israel and Hamas toward a phased deal that would stop the fighting and free the remaining hostages. Netanyahu's office has said a negotiating team will be sent to continue talks Thursday.\n\nIn China, Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration on forming a unity government and ending a yearslong rift. But previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israeli forces raided a Palestinian city in the occupied West Bank, the military said Tuesday, killing what it said were two militants. The Palestinian Health Ministry said a woman was killed.\n\nThe military said a drone struck militants in the area of the northern West Bank city of Tulkarem overnight into Tuesday, killing Ashraf Nafa, who the military said was a local senior Hamas operative. It said another alleged militant, Mohammed Awad, was also killed in the raid, and said both had been behind attacks on Israeli soldiers. The Israeli military statement did not mention the woman killed.\n\nThere was no immediate claim from Hamas or other militant groups surrounding the men's affiliations.\n\nFor several years, the Israeli military has been carrying out near nightly raids in the West Bank that intensified when the war in Gaza erupted. The Palestinian Health Ministry says more than 500 Palestinians have been killed in the ensuing violence, many of them in clashes with Israeli soldiers but others while throwing stones or protesting. People not involved in confrontations have also been killed.\n\nPalestinian attacks against Israelis have been on the rise in the territory.\n\nGENEVA -- A top World Health Organization official in Palestinian areas said Tuesday he's \"extremely worried\" about polio and other outbreaks of communicable diseases in Gaza after traces of the virus turned up in sewage samples in the territory.\n\nDr. Ayadil Saparbekov, team lead for health emergencies at WHO in the occupied Palestinian territory, said test results and a risk assessment were expected this week about how people and medical officials should respond to a possible outbreak.\n\nThere have been no confirmed human cases of polio in Gaza, but six of seven sewage samples tested positive for vaccine-derived polio virus, he said. That means that one or more people who got a polio vaccine jab have shed the virus in the environment.\n\n\"I am extremely worried about an outbreak happening in Gaza. And this is not only polio -- the different outbreaks of the communicable diseases that may happen,\" he told a United Nations briefing in Geneva by video, alluding to a hepatitis outbreak there in 2023.\n\nSaparbekov said lack of water, sanitation, and access to health care could lead to more people dying of communicable diseases than from injury related conditions.\n\nRolando Gomez, a United Nations spokesperson in Geneva, said Israel \"as the occupying power\" has a responsibility \"to ensure assistance reaches those in need in Gaza\" and to \"create an enabling environment for the U.N. and our partners to operate.\"\n\nIsrael has announced plans to vaccinate its soldiers operating in Gaza against polio.\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank -- Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration in Beijing on ending a yearslong rift, Chinese state state broadcaster CCTV said Tuesday, taking a step toward potentially resolving the deep divide between the sides as the war in Gaza rages on.\n\nThe declaration by the two heavyweights of Palestinian politics -- and other smaller Palestinian groups -- to form a unity government for the Palestinian territories is the result of the latest in a series of talks meant to unite the sides.\n\nBut previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution. It also comes as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the nine-month war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nStill, the future of Gaza is undecided, with Israel vehemently opposed to any role by Hamas in governing Gaza. It has also rejected calls from the United States for the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority to run Gaza after the war ends. The lack of a postwar vision for running the Gaza Strip has complicated negotiations over a cease-fire.\n\nSince the current war broke out in Gaza almost 10 months ago, Hamas officials have said that the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and the group has called for formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has signaled that a cease-fire deal that would free dozens of hostages from captivity in Gaza could be taking shape.\n\nIn a meeting late Monday in Washington with families of hostages, Netanyahu said the conditions to bring the captives back were \"ripening,\" according to a statement from his office. He said that was happening because of the fierce military pressure Israel was putting on Hamas.\n\nHe gave no further details on the deal's progress.\n\nFor weeks, Israel and Hamas have been weighing a United States-backed cease-fire deal that would bring a halt to the nine-month war and free the roughly 120 hostages taken by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack. About a third of the hostages are said to be dead, and Israel's military announced Monday that two more died in captivity.\n\nNetanyahu faces intense pressure from a broad swath of Israelis to agree to the deal. He has vowed to defeat Hamas before stopping the war, a term that has been a main sticking point throughout the negotiations.\n\nThe families of hostages had demanded that Netanyahu nail down a deal before flying to Washington, where he will address Congress and is expected to meet President Joe Biden.\n\nJERUSALEM, Israel -- An Israeli parliamentary bill that seeks to label the main provider of aid for Palestinians in Gaza a terrorist group is moving ahead.\n\nLegislators voted 50-10 in favor of the bill in a preliminary vote in Israel's parliament Monday. The bill requires two more votes before becoming law.\n\nThe bill is the product of increasingly tense relations between Israel and the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. Israel has accused the agency of militant links, claiming that hundreds of its employees are members of militant groups, including some who allegedly participated in Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel. Those accusations led to a global cascade of funding cuts to the agency.\n\nUNRWA employs thousands of workers and provides vital aid and services to millions of people across the Middle East. In Gaza, it has been the main supplier of food, water and shelter to civilians during the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe bill moving through parliament would brand the agency as a \"terror group,\" saying that the employees' alleged involvement in the Hamas assault shows that \"it is a terror organization that is no different from the Hamas terror organization.\" The bill also seeks to cut diplomatic ties between Israel and the agency.\n\nJuliette Touma, director of communications for UNRWA, said she wasn't entirely sure how the bill, if made law, would affect the agency, but said it would likely complicate its work. She said UNRWA is in contact with Israeli authorities on a daily basis, something the law would limit.\n\nThe European Union, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have all previously expressed concern about the bill, saying it would hobble the agency's work.", "source": {"uri": "seattlepi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Seattle Pi"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@seattlepi.com", "name":

Hours after it ordered civilians to evacuate parts of Khan Yunis, including areas that had been declared part of a humanitarian safe zone, its jets pounded the city.\n\nThe Gaza health ministry said that 73 people had been killed and more than 200 wounded in the area, while thousands fled.\n\nThe Israeli military did not comment on the toll when asked by AFP. But in a statement, the military said its fighter jets and tanks \"struck and eliminated terrorists in the area\".\n\nOn Tuesday, it said its jets struck \"over 50 terror infrastructure sites\" as part of the Khan Yunis operation.\n\nHassan Qudayh, a resident forced to evacuate, said: \"Gaza is over, Gaza is dead, Gaza has gone. There is nothing left, nothing\".\n\nAFP correspondents reported air strikes in Gaza City and Jabalia in the north of the territory, as well as Khan Yunis, while the Israeli military also said its troops had killed militants in \"aerial strikes and close-quarters combat\" in Rafah in the far south.\n\nMore than nine months of war have obliterated much of the territory's healthcare capacity, with what remains under immense pressure.\n\nMohammed Zaqout, director of Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis told AFP: \"There is no space for more patients. There's no space in the operating theatres. There is a lack of medical supplies, so we cannot save our patients.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization said up to 14,000 people needed medical evacuation from Gaza and that it was \"extremely worried\" that diseases could cause more deaths than war injuries after poliovirus was detected in the territory's sewage.\n\nThe war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 44 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,090 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health

who will meet Netanyahu on Thursday, vowed to continue working to find a solution during his final six months in office, after announcing his withdrawal from the US presidential race.\n\nTalks aimed at securing a truce are set to continue with an Israeli delegation due to travel to Doha on Thursday, a source with knowledge of the talks said.\n\nEgypt, Qatar and the United States have been working

Netanyahu is in Washington, where he was to meet with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe Israeli military ordered the evacuation of part of a crowded area in the Gaza Strip it had designated a humanitarian zone, while the Health Ministry in Gaza says over 39,000 Palestinians have now been killed in the nine-month war.\n\nEgypt, Qatar and the United States are pushing Israel and Hamas toward a phased deal that would stop the fighting and free the remaining hostages. Netanyahu's office has said a negotiating team will be sent to continue talks Thursday.\n\nIn China, Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration on forming a unity government and ending a yearslong rift. But previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nIsraeli forces raid a Palestinian city in the West Bank, killing multiple people\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israeli forces raided a Palestinian city in the occupied West Bank, the military said Tuesday, killing what it said were two militants. The Palestinian Health Ministry said a woman was killed.\n\nThe military said a drone struck militants in the area of the northern West Bank city of Tulkarem overnight into Tuesday, killing Ashraf Nafa, who the military said was a local senior Hamas operative. It said another alleged militant, Mohammed Awad, was also killed in the raid, and said both had been behind attacks on Israeli soldiers. The Israeli military statement did not mention the woman killed.\n\nThere was no immediate claim from Hamas or other militant groups surrounding the men's affiliations.\n\nFor several years, the Israeli military has been carrying out near nightly raids in the West Bank that intensified when the war in Gaza erupted. The Palestinian Health Ministry says more than 500 Palestinians have been killed in the ensuing violence, many of them in clashes with Israeli soldiers but others while throwing stones or protesting. People not involved in confrontations have also been killed.\n\nPalestinian attacks against Israelis have been on the rise in the territory.\n\nA top WHO official is worried about possible polio and other disease outbreaks in Gaza\n\nGENEVA -- A top World Health Organization official in Palestinian areas said Tuesday he's \"extremely worried\" about polio and other outbreaks of communicable diseases in Gaza after traces of the virus turned up in sewage samples in the territory.\n\nDr. Ayadil Saparbekov, team lead for health emergencies at WHO in the occupied Palestinian territory, said test results and a risk assessment were expected this week about how people and medical officials should respond to a possible outbreak.\n\nThere have been no confirmed human cases of polio in Gaza, but six of seven sewage samples tested positive for vaccine-derived polio virus, he said. That means that one or more people who got a polio vaccine jab have shed the virus in the environment.\n\n\"I am extremely worried about an outbreak happening in Gaza. And this is not only polio -- the different outbreaks of the communicable diseases that may happen,\" he told a United Nations briefing in Geneva by video, alluding to a hepatitis outbreak there in 2023.\n\nSaparbekov said lack of water, sanitation, and access to health care could lead to more people dying of communicable diseases than from injury related conditions.\n\nRolando Gomez, a United Nations spokesperson in Geneva, said Israel \"as the occupying power\" has a responsibility \"to ensure assistance reaches those in need in Gaza\" and to \"create an enabling environment for the U.N. and our partners to operate.\"\n\nIsrael has announced plans to vaccinate its soldiers operating in Gaza against polio.\n\nPalestinian factions sign a declaration in the latest attempt to clear the way for a unity government as the war in Gaza rages on\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank -- Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration in Beijing on ending a yearslong rift, Chinese state state broadcaster CCTV said Tuesday, taking a step toward potentially resolving the deep divide between the sides as the war in Gaza rages on.\n\nThe declaration by the two heavyweights of Palestinian politics -- and other smaller Palestinian groups -- to form a unity government for the Palestinian territories is the result of the latest in a series of talks meant to unite the sides.\n\nBut previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution. It also comes as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the nine-month war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nStill, the future of Gaza is undecided, with Israel vehemently opposed to any role by Hamas in governing Gaza. It has also rejected calls from the United States for the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority to run Gaza after the war ends. The lack of a postwar vision for running the Gaza Strip has complicated negotiations over a cease-fire.\n\nSince the current war broke out in Gaza almost 10 months ago, Hamas officials have said that the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and the group has called for formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nConditions for a cease-fire deal that would release hostages from captivity in Gaza are 'ripening,' Israel's Netanyahu says\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has signaled that a cease-fire deal that would free dozens of hostages from captivity in Gaza could be taking shape.\n\nIn a meeting late Monday in Washington with families of hostages, Netanyahu said the conditions to bring the captives back were \"ripening,\" according to a statement from his office. He said that was happening because of the fierce military pressure Israel was putting on Hamas.\n\nHe gave no further details on the deal's progress.\n\nFor weeks, Israel and Hamas have been weighing a United States-backed cease-fire deal that would bring a halt to the nine-month war and free the roughly 120 hostages taken by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack. About a third of the hostages are said to be dead, and Israel's military announced Monday that two more died in captivity.\n\nNetanyahu faces intense pressure from a broad swath of Israelis to agree to the deal. He has vowed to defeat Hamas before stopping the war, a term that has been a main sticking point throughout the negotiations.\n\nThe families of hostages had demanded that Netanyahu nail down a deal before flying to Washington, where he will address Congress and is expected to meet President Joe Biden.\n\nBill labeling UN Palestinian aid agency as a 'terror group' moves forward in Israel's parliament\n\nJERUSALEM, Israel -- An Israeli parliamentary bill that seeks to label the main provider of aid for Palestinians in Gaza a terrorist group is moving ahead.\n\nLegislators voted 50-10 in favor of the bill in a preliminary vote in Israel's parliament Monday. The bill requires two more votes before becoming law.\n\nThe bill is the product of increasingly tense relations between Israel and the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. Israel has accused the agency of militant links, claiming that hundreds of its employees are members of militant groups, including some who allegedly participated in Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel. Those accusations led to a global cascade of funding cuts to the agency.\n\nUNRWA employs thousands of workers and provides vital aid and services to millions of people across the Middle East. In Gaza, it has been the main supplier of food, water and shelter to civilians during the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe bill moving through parliament would brand the agency as a \"terror group,\" saying that the employees' alleged involvement in the Hamas assault shows that \"it is a terror organization that is no different from the Hamas terror organization.\" The bill also seeks to cut diplomatic ties between Israel and the agency.\n\nJuliette Touma, director of communications for UNRWA, said she wasn't entirely sure how the bill, if made law, would affect the agency, but said it would likely complicate its work. She said UNRWA is in contact with Israeli authorities on a daily basis, something the law would limit.\n\nThe European Union, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have all previously expressed concern about the bill, saying it would hobble the agency's work.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@aol.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type":

Netanyahu is expected to meet President Joe Biden and today and address the US Congress on Wednesday.\n\nThe two primary political groups in Palestine, Fatah, according to Al Jazeera, controls Palestinian Authority with \"partial administrative control\" of West Bank while Hamas controls Gaza.\n\nBeijing Declaration\n\nChinese foreign minister Wang Yi hosted senior Hamas official Musa Abu Marzouk and Fatah's Mahmud al-Aloul besides representatives from dozen other groups for three days of closed-door negotiations to arrive at the deal.\n\n\"This marks the first time that representatives from 14 Palestinian factions have gathered in Beijing for reconciliation dialogue, bringing valuable hope to the long-suffering Palestinian people,\" Mao Ning, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, said at a regular press conference in Beijing on Tuesday.\n\n\"It (the declaration) emphasises the need to convene a broad and fully authorised international conference under the auspices of the UN, with regional and international participation,\" Mao was quoted as saying in Chinese state media.\n\n\"The most core outcome is to make it clear that the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. The most prominent highlight is the consensus reached on post-war governance of Gaza and the establishment of a provisional national reconciliation government. The strongest call is to achieve true independence for Palestine in accordance with relevant UN resolutions,\" Mao said.\n\n\"Today we sign an agreement for national unity and we say that the path to completing this journey is national unity. We are committed to national unity and we call for it,\" Marzouk was quoted as saying by news agency, AFP.\n\nBeijing has projected itself as an international broker of peace after bringing hostile Tehran and Riyadh together for talks in March last year. Beijing brokered an agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia on March 10, following five days of negotiations in Beijing, to restore diplomatic ties after a seven-year snap.\n\nThe unexpected trilateral talks, which reflected China's expanding influence in West Asia, seemingly caught the US unawares and is being seen as a sign of Washington's erosion of sway in the region.\n\n\"Saudi Arabia and Iran have agreed to restore diplomatic relations and reopen their embassies and missions within a period not exceeding two months, and agreed to hold talks between foreign ministers to arrange for the exchange of ambassadors and explore ways to strengthen bilateral relations,\" the trilateral joint statement said on March 10 last year.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com",

By June 2024, it had been recognized as a sovereign state by nearly 150 countries, with China among the first to do so.\n\nWang Yi addresses the closing meeting of the reconciliation dialogue among Palestinian factions in Beijing, China, July 23, 2024. /Chinese Foreign Ministry\n\nChina's peace efforts\n\nThe latest round of talks came after Fatah, the Palestinian National Liberation Movement and the largest faction of the multi-party PLO, and Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement that runs Gaza, held talks on promoting intra-Palestinian reconciliation in Beijing at the end of April.\n\nIt also marked the first time that the 14 Palestinian factions gathered in Beijing for a reconciliation dialogue. At Tuesday's closing meeting, Mahmoud al-Aloul, Fatah's deputy chief and head of its delegation, and Moussa Abu Marzouk, who leads the Hamas delegation, gave speeches.\n\nIt is not easy logistically for representatives of all 14 factions to meet in Beijing since they reside in different places, some in the West Bank and others overseas, according to Yu.\n\n\"At present, I believe only China is able to bring together these factions, whose stances vary,\" he said.\n\nYet it is only natural for China to make the get-together happen because Beijing has long been sincerely pushing for peace among different Palestinian factions, with an eye on the resolution of the Palestine issue, Yu added.\n\nIn the Beijing Declaration, the factions also expressed their appreciation for China's sincere efforts to support the rights of the Palestinian people, end Palestine's division and accommodate different stances.\n\n\"That speaks volumes for China's image,\" said Yu. \"China seeks no interests for itself when it comes to Middle East issues.\"\n\nIt shows the world once again that China, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a responsible major country, is practicing the concept of building a community with a shared future for mankind and the Global Security Initiative in the Middle East with real actions, he said.\n\nChina is contributing to the lasting security and peace in the Middle East and to the region's development in the future, said Yu.", "source": {"uri": "chinanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "China News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The two movements have been irreconcilable since 2007, when Hamas literally drove Fatah, and thus the Palestinian National Authority, out of the Gaza Strip after the last elections in 2006, won by Hamas, and the ensuing clashes and political turbulence that ensued throughout that year.\n\nChinese diplomacy sees itself as the architect of the rapprochement and reconciliation between the two, although the war, provoked by the massacre carried out by Hamas in its raid and attack on 7 October, has undoubtedly had much to do with the war, which has since been responded to by Israel with incessant bombing and mopping-up operations \"to completely eradicate Hamas\".\n\nThe achievement of this document of reconciliation of all Palestinian factions is also part of China's diplomatic strategy, which over the last year has strengthened its commercial and political ties with several countries in the Middle East, with special interest and emphasis on those traditionally considered to be under US influence.\n\nWang Yi used the media appearance to reaffirm that \"while reconciliation is an internal matter that concerns only the Palestinians themselves, it would not be possible without the support of the international community\", and that for its part, \"China is limited to playing a constructive role in maintaining peace and stability in the Middle East\".", "source":

Today, 14 Palestinian factions are meeting in Beijing with the common good of their nation in mind. This is an important historical moment in the Palestinian liberation cause. China appreciates the reconciliation efforts made by all factions and congratulates them on the success of the Beijing Dialogue and the signing of the Beijing Declaration.\n\nWang Yi stressed that only when the Palestinian factions speak with one voice can the voice of justice be loud and clear, and only by joining hands and walking side by side can they succeed in their cause of national liberation. The most important consensus of the Beijing talks is to achieve reconciliation and unity among the 14 factions; the essential outcome is the affirmation of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the sole legitimate representative of all the Palestinian people; the highlight is the agreement on the establishment of an interim government of national reconciliation focused on the post-conflict reconstruction of Gaza; and the strongest call is the establishment of a genuine independent State of Palestine in accordance with relevant UN resolutions. The key to the Palestinian reconciliation process is to build trust, stay on the right track and make gradual progress. Only by making continuous efforts to build consensus and put it into practice can the reconciliation process produce more and more substantial progress and greater unity. Reconciliation is the internal affair of the Palestinian factions and cannot be achieved without international support. On the path of reconciliation, China shares the same direction and destination as Arab and Islamic countries.\n\nWang Yi stressed that the Palestinian issue is the core of the Middle East issue. China has never had any selfish interests on the Palestinian issue. China was one of the first countries to recognize the PLO and the State of Palestine. China has always firmly supported the Palestinian people in restoring their legitimate national rights. We value fairness and advocate justice. At present, the Gaza conflict is dragging on, its spillover effects continue to spread, and multiple regional conflicts are interconnected. To help break the current conflict and predicament, China proposes a three-step initiative:\n\nThe first step is to achieve a comprehensive and lasting ceasefire in the Gaza Strip as soon as possible and to ensure access for humanitarian aid and relief on the ground. The international community must create more synergies to end hostilities and establish a ceasefire.\n\nThe second step is to make joint efforts to ensure the post-conflict governance of Gaza, based on the principle of Palestinian governance by Palestinians. Gaza is an integral and inseparable part of Palestine. Relaunching post-conflict reconstruction as quickly as possible is an urgent priority. The international community must support the Palestinian factions in establishing an interim national consensus government and in the effective management of Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nThe third step is to help Palestine become a full member state of the United Nations and implement the two-state solution. It is important to support the convening of a broader, more authoritative and more effective international peace conference to develop a timetable and road map for the two-state solution.\n\nThe ceasefire and humanitarian assistance are urgent priorities. Palestinian governance of Palestine is the basic principle of post-conflict governance in Gaza. The two-state solution is the fundamental way forward. The international community must support the parties in taking these three steps seriously.\n\nWang Yi stressed that reconciliation between Palestinians will bring hope and a future to the Palestinian people. It is an important step toward resolving the Palestinian issue and establishing peace and stability in the Middle East. Unswerving efforts should be made to this end. China sincerely hopes that the Palestinian factions will achieve reconciliation and, on this basis, establish an independent state at an early date. We will strengthen communication and coordination with relevant parties and make joint efforts to implement the Beijing Declaration.\n\nFatah delegation head Mahmoud al-Alou and Hamas delegation head Musa Abu Marzouk delivered speeches on behalf of the Palestinian factions. They noted that China holds an important place in the hearts of the Palestinian people and expressed their sincere gratitude to President Xi Jinping and China for their consistent and firm support and selfless assistance to Palestine over a long period. They praised China's behavior as a responsible major country and its upholding of justice for Palestine at international forums. They expressed their deep gratitude for China's firm support for intra-Palestinian dialogue and reconciliation. They expressed their willingness to implement consensus, strengthen unity among factions, advance the reconciliation process and work for an early solution to the question of Palestine.\n\nDiplomatic envoys to China or their representatives from Egypt, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Russia and Turkey, as well as representatives of 14 major Palestinian factions, attended the closing ceremony.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki",

There have been many failed attempts to bring the two factions together.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said in a statement on Tuesday that \"instead of rejecting terrorism, Mahmoud Abbas embraces the murderers and rapists of Hamas, revealing his true face.\n\n\"In reality, this won't happen because Hamas's rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands,\" Jerusalem's top diplomat added.\n\nIn February, Abbas traveled to Doha to discuss ways to incorporate Hamas into a P.A.-led government for Judea, Samaria and Gaza.\n\nThe same month, sources in Ramallah told Sky News Arabia that Hamas had approved a three-phase plan leading to \"complete reconciliation [with Fatah]\" and the Gaza-based terror group joining the Palestine Liberation Organization, which controls the Palestinian Authority, under a \"unified Palestinian-Arab vision.\"\n\nAlso in February, Fatah and Hamas officials converged on Moscow for a two-day \"national dialogue\" on forming a unity government under the auspices of the Russian Foreign Ministry. Other rounds of talks were held in the past in Egypt, Turkey and Algeria.\n\nThe Islamist group reportedly also gave its blessing to P.A. chief Abbas's proposal to establish a \"government of technocrats\" whose primary purpose would be the reconstruction of Gaza after the war prompted by Hamas's murder of some 1,200 people in Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nHamas is an \"essential part of the Palestinian political mosaic,\" then-P.A. Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh told world leaders gathered in Qatar in December.\n\n\"We want a situation in which Palestinians are united. ... I think it is time that Hamas call the Palestinian president and tell him we're all united behind you, and you are the legitimate authority of the Palestinian people and we are ready to engage,\" Shtayyeh stated at the Doha Forum.\n\nAmid the unity talks, Shtayyeh submitted the collective resignation of his government last month. Abbas then appointed Fatah loyalist Mohammad Mustafa to fill the prime minister's role.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has insisted that an \"effective and revitalized Palestinian Authority\" should ultimately govern Gaza.\n\nDuring a Jan. 10 meeting in Ramallah, Blinken pressed Abbas on \"administrative reforms, which, if implemented, would benefit the Palestinian people.\" Sky News Arabia described the t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate as \"tense\" and marked by \"arguments.\"\n\nThe Biden administration wants the P.A. to assume control of the Strip after Israel's war against Hamas ends, a move that Jerusalem rejects because of Ramallah's overt support for terrorism.\n\nOn Jan. 27, Abbas's spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeineh told Al Arabiya that the P.A. is prepared to hand over the reins to Hamas if it won a general election. Ramallah is \"prepared to hold general elections, and if Hamas wins, the president will hand over the Authority,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. State Department has refused to rule out Hamas retaining power in Gaza or even joining a P.A.-led governing body that would also have jurisdiction in Judea and Samaria.\n\nAccording to recent polls, 89% of Palestinians support establishing a government that includes or is led by Hamas. Only around 8.5% said they favor one controlled exclusively by Fatah.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly emphasized his opposition to the P.A. taking over Gaza in a post-Hamas world.\n\n\"There will not be any element that educates for terrorism, finances terrorism and dispatches terrorism\" in the Strip, said Netanyahu.\n\n\"I will not allow us to replace Hamastan with Fatahstan, that we replace Khan Yunis with Jenin,\" he continued. \"I will not allow the State of Israel to repeat the fateful mistake of Oslo, which brought to the heart of our country and to Gaza the most extreme elements in the Arab world, which are committed to the destruction of the State of Israel and who educate their children to this end.\"\n\nThe Jewish News Syndicate granted permission

Netanyahu's office has said a negotiating team will be sent to continue talks Thursday.\n\nIn China, Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration on forming a unity government and ending a yearslong rift. But previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israeli forces raided a Palestinian city in the occupied West Bank and killed three militants, the military and Hamas said Tuesday. The Palestinian Health Ministry said a woman was also killed.\n\nThe military said a drone struck militants in the area of the northern West Bank city of Tulkarem overnight into Tuesday, killing Ashraf Nafa, who the military said was a local senior Hamas operative. It said another alleged militant, Mohammed Awad, was also killed in the raid, and said both had been behind attacks on Israeli soldiers. The Israeli military statement did not mention the woman killed.\n\nHamas identified Nafa as a member and said two other militants with the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, including Awad, were also killed. The woman's identity was not immediately clear.\n\nFor several years, the Israeli military has been carrying out near nightly raids in the West Bank that intensified when the war in Gaza erupted. The Palestinian Health Ministry says more than 500 Palestinians have been killed in the ensuing violence, many of them in clashes with Israeli soldiers but others while throwing stones or protesting. People not involved in confrontations have also been killed.\n\nPalestinian attacks against Israelis have been on the rise in the territory.\n\nGENEVA -- A top World Health Organization official in Palestinian areas said Tuesday he's \"extremely worried\" about polio and other outbreaks of communicable diseases in Gaza after traces of the virus turned up in sewage samples in the territory.\n\nDr. Ayadil Saparbekov, team lead for health emergencies at WHO in the occupied Palestinian territory, said test results and a risk assessment were expected this week about how people and medical officials should respond to a possible outbreak.\n\nThere have been no confirmed human cases of polio in Gaza, but six of seven sewage samples tested positive for vaccine-derived polio virus, he said. That means that one or more people who got a polio vaccine jab have shed the virus in the environment.\n\n\"I am extremely worried about an outbreak happening in Gaza. And this is not only polio -- the different outbreaks of the communicable diseases that may happen,\" he told a United Nations briefing in Geneva by video, alluding to a hepatitis outbreak there in 2023.\n\nSaparbekov said lack of water, sanitation, and access to health care could lead to more people dying of communicable diseases than from injury related conditions.\n\nRolando Gomez, a United Nations spokesperson in Geneva, said Israel \"as the occupying power\" has a responsibility \"to ensure assistance reaches those in need in Gaza\" and to \"create an enabling environment for the U.N. and our partners to operate.\"\n\nIsrael has announced plans to vaccinate its soldiers operating in Gaza against polio.\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank -- Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration in Beijing on ending a yearslong rift, Chinese state state broadcaster CCTV said Tuesday, taking a step toward potentially resolving the deep divide between the sides as the war in Gaza rages on.\n\nThe declaration by the two heavyweights of Palestinian politics -- and other smaller Palestinian groups -- to form a unity government for the Palestinian territories is the result of the latest in a series of talks meant to unite the sides.\n\nBut previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution. It also comes as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the nine-month war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nStill, the future of Gaza is undecided, with Israel vehemently opposed to any role by Hamas in governing Gaza. It has also rejected calls from the United States for the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority to run Gaza after the war ends. The lack of a postwar vision for running the Gaza Strip has complicated negotiations over a cease-fire.\n\nSince the current war broke out in Gaza almost 10 months ago, Hamas officials have said that the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and the group has called for formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has signaled that a cease-fire deal that would free dozens of hostages from captivity in Gaza could be taking shape.\n\nIn a meeting late Monday in Washington with families of hostages, Netanyahu said the conditions to bring the captives back were \"ripening,\" according to a statement from his office. He said that was happening because of the fierce military pressure Israel was putting on Hamas.\n\nHe gave no further details on the deal's progress.\n\nFor weeks, Israel and Hamas have been weighing a United States-backed cease-fire deal that would bring a halt to the nine-month war and free the roughly 120 hostages taken by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack. About a third of the hostages are said to be dead, and Israel's military announced Monday that two more died in captivity.\n\nNetanyahu faces intense pressure from a broad swath of Israelis to agree to the deal. He has vowed to defeat Hamas before stopping the war, a term that has been a main sticking point throughout the negotiations.\n\nThe families of hostages had demanded that Netanyahu nail down a deal before flying to Washington, where he will address Congress and is expected to meet President Joe Biden.\n\nJERUSALEM, Israel -- An Israeli parliamentary bill that seeks to label the main provider of aid for Palestinians in Gaza a terrorist group is moving ahead.\n\nLegislators voted 50-10 in favor of the bill in a preliminary vote in Israel's parliament Monday. The bill requires two more votes before becoming law.\n\nThe bill is the product of increasingly tense relations between Israel and the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. Israel has accused the agency of militant links, claiming that hundreds of its employees are members of militant groups, including some who allegedly participated in Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel. Those accusations led to a global cascade of funding cuts to the agency.\n\nUNRWA employs thousands of workers and provides vital aid and services to millions of people across the Middle East. In Gaza, it has been the main supplier of food, water and shelter to civilians during the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe bill moving through parliament would brand the agency as a \"terror group,\" saying that the employees' alleged involvement in the Hamas assault shows that \"it is a terror organization that is no different from the Hamas terror organization.\" The bill also seeks to cut diplomatic ties between Israel and the agency.\n\nJuliette Touma, director of communications for UNRWA, said she wasn't entirely sure how the bill, if made law, would affect the agency, but said it would likely complicate its work. She said UNRWA is in contact with Israeli authorities on a daily basis, something the law would limit.\n\nThe European Union, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have all previously expressed concern about the bill, saying it would hobble the agency's work.", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dayton Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Netanyahu is in Washington, where he is to address Congress.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has signaled that a cease-fire deal that would free dozens of hostages in Gaza could be taking shape. Netanyahu is in Washington, where he is to address Congress.\n\nThe Israeli military has ordered the evacuation of part of a crowded area in the Gaza Strip it had designated a humanitarian zone,. The Health Ministry in Gaza says over 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in the nine-month war.\n\nEgypt, Qatar and the United States are pushing Israel and Hamas toward a phased deal that would stop the fighting and free remaining hostages. Netanyahu's office has said a negotiating team will be sent to continue talks Thursday.\n\nIn China, Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration on forming a unity government and ending a long rift. But previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israeli forces raided a Palestinian city in the occupied West Bank killing at least five people, including three militants, the Israeli military, Hamas and the Palestinian Health Ministry said Tuesday. The ministry said two women were among the dead.\n\nThe military said a drone struck militants in the area of the northern West Bank city of Tulkarem overnight, killing Ashraf Nafa, who the military called a local senior Hamas operative. It said another alleged militant, Mohammed Awad, was also killed, and said both had been behind attacks on Israeli soldiers. The Israeli statement did not mention the women.\n\nHamas identified Nafa as a member and said two other militants with the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, including Awad, were also killed.\n\nFor several years, the Israeli military has been carrying out near nightly raids in the West Bank that intensified when the war in Gaza erupted. The Palestinian Health Ministry says more than 500 Palestinians have been killed in the ensuing violence, many of them in clashes with Israeli soldiers but others while throwing stones or protesting. People not involved in confrontations have also been killed.\n\nPalestinian attacks against Israelis have been on the rise in the territory.\n\nGENEVA -- A top World Health Organization official in Palestinian areas said Tuesday he's \"extremely worried\" about polio and other outbreaks of communicable diseases in Gaza after traces of the virus turned up in sewage samples in the territory.\n\nDr. Ayadil Saparbekov, team lead for health emergencies at WHO in the occupied Palestinian territory, said test results and a risk assessment were expected this week about how people and medical officials should respond to a possible outbreak.\n\nThere have been no confirmed human cases of polio in Gaza, but six of seven sewage samples tested positive for vaccine-derived polio virus, he said. That means that one or more people who got a polio vaccine jab have shed the virus in the environment.\n\n\"I am extremely worried about an outbreak happening in Gaza. And this is not only polio -- the different outbreaks of the communicable diseases that may happen,\" he told a United Nations briefing in Geneva by video, alluding to a hepatitis outbreak there in 2023.\n\nSaparbekov said lack of water, sanitation, and access to health care could lead to more people dying of communicable diseases than from injury related conditions.\n\nRolando Gomez, a United Nations spokesperson in Geneva, said Israel \"as the occupying power\" has a responsibility \"to ensure assistance reaches those in need in Gaza\" and to \"create an enabling environment for the U.N. and our partners to operate.\"\n\nIsrael has announced plans to vaccinate its soldiers operating in Gaza against polio.\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank -- Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration in Beijing on ending a yearslong rift, Chinese state state broadcaster CCTV said Tuesday, taking a step toward potentially resolving the deep divide between the sides as the war in Gaza rages on.\n\nThe declaration by the two heavyweights of Palestinian politics -- and other smaller Palestinian groups -- to form a unity government for the Palestinian territories is the result of the latest in a series of talks meant to unite the sides.\n\nBut previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution. It also comes as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the nine-month war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nStill, the future of Gaza is undecided, with Israel vehemently opposed to any role by Hamas in governing Gaza. It has also rejected calls from the United States for the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority to run Gaza after the war ends. The lack of a postwar vision for running the Gaza Strip has complicated negotiations over a cease-fire.\n\nSince the current war broke out in Gaza almost 10 months ago, Hamas officials have said that the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and the group has called for formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has signaled that a cease-fire deal that would free dozens of hostages from captivity in Gaza could be taking shape.\n\nIn a meeting late Monday in Washington with families of hostages, Netanyahu said the conditions to bring the captives back were \"ripening,\" according to a statement from his office. He said that was happening because of the fierce military pressure Israel was putting on Hamas.\n\nHe gave no further details on the deal's progress.\n\nFor weeks, Israel and Hamas have been weighing a United States-backed cease-fire deal that would bring a halt to the nine-month war and free the roughly 120 hostages taken by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack. About a third of the hostages are said to be dead, and Israel's military announced Monday that two more died in captivity.\n\nNetanyahu faces intense pressure from a broad swath of Israelis to agree to the deal. He has vowed to defeat Hamas before stopping the war, a term that has been a main sticking point throughout the negotiations.\n\nThe families of hostages had demanded that Netanyahu nail down a deal before flying to Washington, where he will address Congress and is expected to meet President Joe Biden.\n\nJERUSALEM, Israel -- An Israeli parliamentary bill that seeks to label the main provider of aid for Palestinians in Gaza a terrorist group is moving ahead.\n\nLegislators voted 50-10 in favor of the bill in a preliminary vote in Israel's parliament Monday. The bill requires two more votes before becoming law.\n\nThe bill is the product of increasingly tense relations between Israel and the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. Israel has accused the agency of militant links, claiming that hundreds of its employees are members of militant groups, including some who allegedly participated in Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel. Those accusations led to a global cascade of funding cuts to the agency.\n\nUNRWA employs thousands of workers and provides vital aid and services to millions of people across the Middle East. In Gaza, it has been the main supplier of food, water and shelter to civilians during the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe bill moving through parliament would brand the agency as a \"terror group,\" saying that the employees' alleged involvement in the Hamas assault shows that \"it is a terror organization that is no different from the Hamas terror organization.\" The bill also seeks to cut diplomatic ties between Israel and the agency.\n\nJuliette Touma, director of communications for UNRWA, said she wasn't entirely sure how the bill, if made law, would affect the agency, but said it would likely complicate its work. She said UNRWA is in contact with Israeli authorities on a daily basis, something the law would limit.\n\nThe European Union, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have all previously expressed concern about the bill, saying it would hobble the agency's work.", "source": {"uri": "wral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WRAL"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio", "type":

It appears that the Hamas-Fatah reconciliation is a sign that Palestinians are willing to choose their political future themselves while seeing China as a trustworthy mediator, as per the expert.It's not the first time that Beijing has played the role of the regional peace broker: in March 2023, top Iranian and Saudi security officials met in Beijing to restore diplomatic ties after years of tensions.Unsurprisingly, Israel subjected the Palestinian agreement to criticism, vowing to eliminate Hamas. The US press rushed to downplay the China-brokered deal between Hamas and Fatah, claiming that the plan is lacking a clear roadmap.The signing of the Beijing Declaration is a historic moment that will promote reconciliation within Palestine, stated Musa Abu Marzouk, the head of the Hamas delegation, during the summit. He stressed the importance of implementing the plan to \"create an independent state of Palestine with its capital in Jerusalem.\"", "source": {"uri": "sputnikglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sputnik International"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ekaterina_blinova@sputnikglobe.com", "name": "Ekaterina Blinova", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fatah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_State_of_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of the State of Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Abbas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mahmoud Abbas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_unity_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National unity government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethnic cleansing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/images/sharing/article/eng/1119473091.jpg?10311106241721749087", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749919", "eventUri": "eng-9749919", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-21", "dateEnd": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 329, "textEnd": 339}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

We are committed to national unity, and we call for it,\" said Abu Marzouk.\n\nThe \"Beijing declaration\" was signed by 14 Palestinian factions that took part in negotiations hosted by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.\n\nFatah, based in Ramallah, and Hamas have been split since 2007 following the latter's violent takeover of Gaza. There have been many failed attempts to bring the two factions together.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said in a statement on Tuesday that \"instead of rejecting terrorism, Mahmoud Abbas embraces the murderers and rapists of Hamas, revealing his true face.\n\n\"In reality, this won't happen because Hamas's rule will be crushed, and Abbas will be watching Gaza from afar. Israel's security will remain solely in Israel's hands,\" Jerusalem's top diplomat added.\n\nIn February, Abbas traveled to Doha to discuss ways to incorporate Hamas into a P.A.-led government for Judea, Samaria and Gaza.\n\nThe same month, sources in Ramallah told Sky News Arabia that Hamas had approved a three-phase plan leading to \"complete reconciliation [with Fatah]\" and the Gaza-based terror group joining the Palestine Liberation Organization, which controls the Palestinian Authority, under a \"unified Palestinian-Arab vision.\"\n\nAlso in February, Fatah and Hamas officials converged on Moscow for a two-day \"national dialogue\" on forming a unity government under the auspices of the Russian Foreign Ministry. Other rounds of talks were held in the past in Egypt, Turkey and Algeria.\n\nThe Islamist group reportedly also gave its blessing to P.A. chief Abbas's proposal to establish a \"government of technocrats\" whose primary purpose would be the reconstruction of Gaza after the war prompted by Hamas's murder of some 1,200 people in Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nHamas is an \"essential part of the Palestinian political mosaic,\" then-P.A. Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh told world leaders gathered in Qatar in December.\n\n\"We want a situation in which Palestinians are united. ... I think it is time that Hamas call the Palestinian president and tell him we're all united behind you, and you are the legitimate authority of the Palestinian people and we are ready to engage,\" Shtayyeh stated at the Doha Forum.\n\nAmid the unity talks, Shtayyeh submitted the collective resignation of his government last month. Abbas then appointed Fatah loyalist Mohammad Mustafa to fill the prime minister's role.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has insisted that an \"effective and revitalized Palestinian Authority\" should ultimately govern Gaza.\n\nDuring a Jan. 10 meeting in Ramallah, Blinken pressed Abbas on \"administrative reforms, which, if implemented, would benefit the Palestinian people.\" Sky News Arabia described the t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate as \"tense\" and marked by \"arguments.\"\n\nThe Biden administration wants the P.A. to assume control of the Strip after Israel's war against Hamas ends, a move that Jerusalem rejects because of Ramallah's overt support for terrorism.\n\nOn Jan. 27, Abbas's spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeineh told Al Arabiya that the P.A. is prepared to hand over the reins to Hamas if it won a general election. Ramallah is \"prepared to hold general elections, and if Hamas wins, the president will hand over the Authority,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. State Department has refused to rule out Hamas retaining power in Gaza or even joining a P.A.-led governing body that would also have jurisdiction in Judea and Samaria.\n\nAccording to recent polls, 89% of Palestinians support establishing a government that includes or is led by Hamas. Only around 8.5% said they favor one controlled exclusively by Fatah.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly emphasized his opposition to the P.A. taking over Gaza in a post-Hamas world.\n\n\"There will not be any element that educates for terrorism, finances terrorism and dispatches terrorism\" in the Strip, said Netanyahu.\n\n\"I will not allow us to replace Hamastan with Fatahstan, that we replace Khan Yunis with Jenin,\" he continued. \"I will not allow the State of Israel to repeat the fateful mistake of Oslo, which brought to the heart of our country and to Gaza the most extreme elements in the Arab world, which are committed to the destruction of the State of Israel and who educate their children to this end.\"", "source": {"uri": "israel365news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Israel365 News | Latest News.

This is an important historic moment in the cause of Palestinian liberation, when 14 Palestinian factions gather in Beijing in the spirit of national righteousness. The Chinese side appreciates the efforts made by all parties to reconcile and congratulates the successful Beijing dialogue and the signing of the Beijing Declaration.\n\nWang Yi pointed out that only when all Palestinian factions speak with one voice can the voice of justice be louder, and only by joining hands and advancing side by side can the cause of national liberation succeed. The most important consensus reached by the Palestinian factions at the Beijing dialogue is to achieve great reconciliation and unity among the 14 factions, the core result is to make it clear that the PLO is the sole legitimate representative of all the Palestinian people, the most prominent highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government around the post-war governance of Gaza, and the strongest call is to realize the true independent state of Palestine in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions. The key to the process of internal reconciliation among the Palestinian factions is to strengthen confidence, grasp the direction and proceed in an orderly and gradual manner. Only by continuously building consensus and putting it into practice can the reconciliation process become more solid and more united. Reconciliation is an internal affair for all Palestinian factions, and it cannot be separated from the support of the international community. On the road to promoting reconciliation, China and the vast number of Arab and Islamic countries share the same direction and goal.\n\nWang Yi said that the Palestinian issue is the core of the Middle East issue. China has never had any selfish interests on the question of Palestine, and was one of the first countries to recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization and the State of Palestine. What we value is morality, and what we advocate is justice. At present, the conflict in Gaza is still prolonged, the spillover impact is spreading, and the regional conflict resonates at multiple points. In order to get out of the current conflict, China proposes a \"three-step approach\":\n\nThe first step is to promote a comprehensive, durable and sustainable ceasefire in the Gaza Strip as soon as possible and to ensure humanitarian assistance and access. The international community should further unite on the issue of a ceasefire and an end to hostilities.\n\nThe second step is to uphold the principle of \"Palestinians governing Pakistan\" and work together to promote post-war governance in Gaza. Gaza is an inseparable and important part of Palestine, and the urgent need to start post-war reconstruction as soon as possible has become an urgent issue in the next phase. The international community should support the Palestinian factions in forming an interim Government of National Consensus to exercise effective control over Gaza Jordan and the West Bank.\n\nThe third step is to promote Palestine as a full Member of the United Nations and to begin the implementation of the two-State solution. The convening of a larger, more authoritative and more effective international peace conference should be supported, and a timetable and road map should be drawn up in this regard.\n\nA ceasefire and humanitarian relief are imperative. \"Palestinians governing Pakistan\" is the basic principle of Gaza's post-war reconstruction. The two-state solution is the fundamental way forward. The international community should support the parties concerned in implementing the \"three-step approach\" in a serious manner.\n\nWang Yi said that the realization of internal reconciliation in Palestine will bring hope and a future to the Palestinian people, and is also an important step in promoting the settlement of the Palestinian issue and achieving peace and stability in the Middle East. China sincerely hopes that all Palestinian factions will achieve an independent Palestinian state on the basis of internal reconciliation at an early date, and is ready to strengthen communication and coordination with all parties concerned and make joint efforts to implement the Beijing Declaration reached today.\n\nAlul, head of the Fatah delegation, and Moussa, head of the Hamas delegation, delivered speeches on behalf of all Palestinian factions, emphasizing that China has a special and important position in the minds of the Palestinian people, and sincerely thanked President Xi Jinping and China for their long-term unwavering support and selfless assistance to Palestine. We highly appreciate China's commitment as a major country and uphold justice and justice for Palestine in the international community, and express our deep gratitude to China for its strong support for intra-Palestinian reconciliation and dialogue.\n\nRepresentatives of 14 major Palestinian factions, as well as envoys or representatives of Egypt, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Russia and Turkey attended the closing ceremony.", "source": {"uri": "sonna.so", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wakaaladda Wararka Soomaaliyeed"}, "authors": [{"uri": "khadar_aweys@sonna.so",

Netanyahu is in Washington, where he was to meet with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe Israeli military ordered the evacuation of part of a crowded area in the Gaza Strip it had designated a humanitarian zone, while the Health Ministry in Gaza says over 39,000 Palestinians have now been killed in the nine-month war.\n\nEgypt, Qatar and the United States are pushing Israel and Hamas toward a phased deal that would stop the fighting and free the remaining hostages. Netanyahu's office has said a negotiating team will be sent to continue talks Thursday.\n\nIn China, Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration on forming a unity government and ending a yearslong rift. But previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nIsraeli forces raid a Palestinian city in the West Bank, killing at least 3 militants\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israeli forces raided a Palestinian city in the occupied West Bank and killed three militants, the military and Hamas said Tuesday. The Palestinian Health Ministry said a woman was also killed.\n\nThe military said a drone struck militants in the area of the northern West Bank city of Tulkarem overnight into Tuesday, killing Ashraf Nafa, who the military said was a local senior Hamas operative. It said another alleged militant, Mohammed Awad, was also killed in the raid, and said both had been behind attacks on Israeli soldiers. The Israeli military statement did not mention the woman killed.\n\nHamas identified Nafa as a member and said two other militants with the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, including Awad, were also killed. The woman's identity was not immediately clear.\n\nFor several years, the Israeli military has been carrying out near nightly raids in the West Bank that intensified when the war in Gaza erupted. The Palestinian Health Ministry says more than 500 Palestinians have been killed in the ensuing violence, many of them in clashes with Israeli soldiers but others while throwing stones or protesting. People not involved in confrontations have also been killed.\n\nPalestinian attacks against Israelis have been on the rise in the territory.\n\nA top WHO official is worried about possible polio and other disease outbreaks in Gaza\n\nGENEVA -- A top World Health Organization official in Palestinian areas said Tuesday he's \"extremely worried\" about polio and other outbreaks of communicable diseases in Gaza after traces of the virus turned up in sewage samples in the territory.\n\nDr. Ayadil Saparbekov, team lead for health emergencies at WHO in the occupied Palestinian territory, said test results and a risk assessment were expected this week about how people and medical officials should respond to a possible outbreak.\n\nThere have been no confirmed human cases of polio in Gaza, but six of seven sewage samples tested positive for vaccine-derived polio virus, he said. That means that one or more people who got a polio vaccine jab have shed the virus in the environment.\n\n\"I am extremely worried about an outbreak happening in Gaza. And this is not only polio -- the different outbreaks of the communicable diseases that may happen,\" he told a United Nations briefing in Geneva by video, alluding to a hepatitis outbreak there in 2023.\n\nSaparbekov said lack of water, sanitation, and access to health care could lead to more people dying of communicable diseases than from injury related conditions.\n\nRolando Gomez, a United Nations spokesperson in Geneva, said Israel \"as the occupying power\" has a responsibility \"to ensure assistance reaches those in need in Gaza\" and to \"create an enabling environment for the U.N. and our partners to operate.\"\n\nIsrael has announced plans to vaccinate its soldiers operating in Gaza against polio.\n\nPalestinian factions sign a declaration in the latest attempt to clear the way for a unity government as the war in Gaza rages on\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank -- Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration in Beijing on ending a yearslong rift, Chinese state state broadcaster CCTV said Tuesday, taking a step toward potentially resolving the deep divide between the sides as the war in Gaza rages on.\n\nThe declaration by the two heavyweights of Palestinian politics -- and other smaller Palestinian groups -- to form a unity government for the Palestinian territories is the result of the latest in a series of talks meant to unite the sides.\n\nBut previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution. It also comes as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the nine-month war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nStill, the future of Gaza is undecided, with Israel vehemently opposed to any role by Hamas in governing Gaza. It has also rejected calls from the United States for the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority to run Gaza after the war ends. The lack of a postwar vision for running the Gaza Strip has complicated negotiations over a cease-fire.\n\nSince the current war broke out in Gaza almost 10 months ago, Hamas officials have said that the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and the group has called for formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nConditions for a cease-fire deal that would release hostages from captivity in Gaza are 'ripening,' Israel's Netanyahu says\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has signaled that a cease-fire deal that would free dozens of hostages from captivity in Gaza could be taking shape.\n\nIn a meeting late Monday in Washington with families of hostages, Netanyahu said the conditions to bring the captives back were \"ripening,\" according to a statement from his office. He said that was happening because of the fierce military pressure Israel was putting on Hamas.\n\nHe gave no further details on the deal's progress.\n\nFor weeks, Israel and Hamas have been weighing a United States-backed cease-fire deal that would bring a halt to the nine-month war and free the roughly 120 hostages taken by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack. About a third of the hostages are said to be dead, and Israel's military announced Monday that two more died in captivity.\n\nNetanyahu faces intense pressure from a broad swath of Israelis to agree to the deal. He has vowed to defeat Hamas before stopping the war, a term that has been a main sticking point throughout the negotiations.\n\nThe families of hostages had demanded that Netanyahu nail down a deal before flying to Washington, where he will address Congress and is expected to meet President Joe Biden.\n\nBill labeling UN Palestinian aid agency as a 'terror group' moves forward in Israel's parliament\n\nJERUSALEM, Israel -- An Israeli parliamentary bill that seeks to label the main provider of aid for Palestinians in Gaza a terrorist group is moving ahead.\n\nLegislators voted 50-10 in favor of the bill in a preliminary vote in Israel's parliament Monday. The bill requires two more votes before becoming law.\n\nThe bill is the product of increasingly tense relations between Israel and the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. Israel has accused the agency of militant links, claiming that hundreds of its employees are members of militant groups, including some who allegedly participated in Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel. Those accusations led to a global cascade of funding cuts to the agency.\n\nUNRWA employs thousands of workers and provides vital aid and services to millions of people across the Middle East. In Gaza, it has been the main supplier of food, water and shelter to civilians during the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe bill moving through parliament would brand the agency as a \"terror group,\" saying that the employees' alleged involvement in the Hamas assault shows that \"it is a terror organization that is no different from the Hamas terror organization.\" The bill also seeks to cut diplomatic ties between Israel and the agency.\n\nJuliette Touma, director of communications for UNRWA, said she wasn't entirely sure how the bill, if made law, would affect the agency, but said it would likely complicate its work. She said UNRWA is in contact with Israeli authorities on a daily basis, something the law would limit.\n\nThe European Union, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have all previously expressed concern about the bill, saying it would hobble the agency's work.", "source": {"uri": "winnipegfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Winnipeg Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The agreement aims to establish a unified Palestinian government to rule Gaza after Israel's war on war concludes.\n\n\"Today we sign an agreement for national unity and we say that the path to completing this journey is national unity,\" said senior Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk at a news conference in Beijing.\n\nMustafa Barghouti, secretary-general of the Palestinian National Initiative, according to the Al-Jazeera report, stated that the \"Beijing Declaration,\" finalised after three days of intense talks, outlines a major techniques for Palestinian unity:\n\n1. Interim National Unity Government: An interim government will be formed, bringing together representatives from various factions, to govern post-war Gaza.\n\n2. Unified Palestinian Leadership: The agreement paves the way for the formation of a united Palestinian leadership, setting the stage for future elections.\n\n3. Free Election of a New Palestinian National Council: This pivotal step aims to establish a democratically elected body to represent Palestinian interests.\n\n4. Unified Resistance against Israeli Attacks: The factions have declared their commitment to united resistance against ongoing Israeli aggression.\n\n\"We're at a historic junction,\" Abu Marzouk said, according to CNN. \"Our people are rising up in their efforts to struggle.\"\n\nThe move towards unity comes at a crucial time, as the war in Gaza drags on and international pressure mounts for a ceasefire and a political solution to the Israel-Hamas war. The agreement, seen as a significant development, could potentially block Israeli attempts to manipulate internal Palestinian divisions.\n\nSpeaking to the media, Barghouti mentioned that 14 parties signed the unification agreement going \" much further\" than previous deals between the factions operating in the war-torn region.\n\nChina, which has played an active mediating role in the conflict, has welcomed the agreement and called for an \"international peace conference\" to end the war. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi emphasised the importance of international support for the Palestinian reconciliation process, reiterating China's commitment to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian war. \"Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community,\" Wang was quoted by AL Jazeera.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "junaid_dar@news9live.com", "name": "Junaid Dar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Initiative", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Initiative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Barghouti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mustafa Barghouti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al Jazeera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fatah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_unity_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National unity government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Yi_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wang Yi (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Germany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arab League"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Two-state solution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_reunification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "German reunification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Palestine.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749919", "eventUri": "eng-9749919", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Netanyahu is in Washington, where he was to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe Israeli military ordered the evacuation of part of a crowded area in the Gaza Strip it had designated a humanitarian zone, while the Health Ministry in Gaza says over 39,000 Palestinians have now been killed in the nine-month war.\n\nEgypt, Qatar and the United States are pushing Israel and Hamas toward a phased deal that would stop the fighting and free the remaining hostages.

But previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israeli forces raided a Palestinian city in the occupied West Bank, the military said Tuesday, killing what it said were two militants. The Palestinian Health Ministry said a woman was killed.\n\nThe military said a drone struck militants in the area of the northern West Bank city of Tulkarem overnight into Tuesday, killing Ashraf Nafa, who the military said was a local senior Hamas operative. It said another alleged militant, Mohammed Awad, was also killed in the raid, and said both had been behind attacks on Israeli soldiers. The Israeli military statement did not mention the woman killed.\n\nThere was no immediate claim from Hamas or other militant groups surrounding the men's affiliations.\n\nFor several years, the Israeli military has been carrying out near-nightly raids in the West Bank that intensified when the war in Gaza erupted. The Palestinian Health Ministry says more than 500 Palestinians have been killed in the ensuing violence, many of them in clashes with Israeli soldiers but others while throwing stones or protesting. People not involved in confrontations have also been killed.\n\nPalestinian attacks against Israelis have been on the rise in the territory.\n\nGENEVA -- A top World Health Organization official in Palestinian areas said Tuesday he's \"extremely worried\" about polio and other outbreaks of communicable diseases in Gaza after traces of the virus turned up in sewage samples in the territory.\n\nDr. Ayadil Saparbekov, team lead for health emergencies at WHO in the occupied Palestinian territory, said test results and a risk assessment were expected this week about how people and medical officials should respond to a possible outbreak.\n\nThere have been no confirmed human cases of polio in Gaza, but six of seven sewage samples tested positive for vaccine-derived polio virus, he said. That means that one or more people who got a polio vaccine jab have shed the virus in the environment.\n\n\"I am extremely worried about an outbreak happening in Gaza. And this is not only polio -- the different outbreaks of the communicable diseases that may happen,\" he told a United Nations briefing in Geneva by video, alluding to a hepatitis outbreak there in 2023.\n\nSaparbekov said lack of water, sanitation, and access to health care could lead to more people dying of communicable diseases than from injury-related conditions.\n\nRolando Gomez, a United Nations spokesperson in Geneva, said Israel \"as the occupying power\" has a responsibility \"to ensure assistance reaches those in need in Gaza\" and to \"create an enabling environment for the U.N. and our partners to operate.\"\n\nIsrael has announced plans to vaccinate its soldiers operating in Gaza against polio.\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank -- Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration in Beijing on ending a years-long rift, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said Tuesday, taking a step toward potentially resolving the deep divide between the sides as the war in Gaza rages on.\n\nThe declaration by the two heavyweights of Palestinian politics -- and other smaller Palestinian groups -- to form a unity government for the Palestinian territories is the result of the latest in a series of talks meant to unite the sides.\n\nBut previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution. It also comes as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed ceasefire proposal that would wind down the nine-month war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nStill, the future of Gaza is undecided, with Israel vehemently opposed to any role by Hamas in governing Gaza. It has also rejected calls from the United States for the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority to run Gaza after the war ends. The lack of a post-war vision for running the Gaza Strip has complicated negotiations over a ceasefire.\n\nSince the current war broke out in Gaza almost 10 months ago, Hamas officials have said that the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and the group has called for formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nIsraeli soldiers move near the Israeli-Gaza border, as seen from southern Israel, Monday, July 8, 2024. (AP Photo/Leo Correa)\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has signalled that a ceasefire deal that would free dozens of hostages from captivity in Gaza could be taking shape.\n\nIn a meeting late Monday in Washington with families of hostages, Netanyahu said the conditions to bring the captives back were \"ripening,\" according to a statement from his office. He said that was happening because of the fierce military pressure Israel was putting on Hamas.\n\nHe gave no further details on the deal's progress.\n\nFor weeks, Israel and Hamas have been weighing a United States-backed ceasefire deal that would bring a halt to the nine-month war and free the roughly 120 hostages taken by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack. About a third of the hostages are said to be dead, and Israel's military announced Monday that two more died in captivity.\n\nNetanyahu faces intense pressure from a broad swath of Israelis to agree to the deal. He has vowed to defeat Hamas before stopping the war, a term that has been a main sticking point throughout the negotiations.\n\nThe families of hostages had demanded that Netanyahu nail down a deal before flying to Washington, where he will address Congress and is expected to meet President Joe Biden.\n\nJERUSALEM, Israel -- An Israeli parliamentary bill that seeks to label the main provider of aid for Palestinians in Gaza a terrorist group is moving ahead.\n\nLegislators voted 50-10 in favour of the bill in a preliminary vote in Israel's parliament Monday. The bill requires two more votes before becoming law.\n\nThe bill is the product of increasingly tense relations between Israel and the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. Israel has accused the agency of militant links, claiming that hundreds of its employees are members of militant groups, including some who allegedly participated in Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel. Those accusations led to a global cascade of funding cuts to the agency.\n\nUNRWA employs thousands of workers and provides vital aid and services to millions of people across the Middle East. In Gaza, it has been the main supplier of food, water and shelter to civilians during the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe bill moving through parliament would brand the agency as a \"terror group,\" saying that the employees' alleged involvement in the Hamas assault shows that \"it is a terror organization that is no different from the Hamas terror organization.\" The bill also seeks to cut diplomatic ties between Israel and the agency.\n\nJuliette Touma, director of communications for UNRWA, said she wasn't entirely sure how the bill, if made law, would affect the agency, but said it would likely complicate its work. She said UNRWA is in contact with Israeli authorities on a daily basis, something the law would limit.\n\nThe European Union, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have all previously expressed concern about the bill, saying it would hobble the agency's work.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio",

He stressed that while reconciliation is an internal matter for Palestinians, international support is crucial for its success.\n\nWang Yi also reiterated China's call for a \"general, lasting, and viable ceasefire\" in Gaza, advocating for unhindered access to humanitarian aid.\n\n\"No excuse can justify the continued suffering and injury of civilians,\" he asserted, highlighting the urgent need for peace and stability in the region.\n\nChina's recent diplomatic endeavors have included facilitating rapprochement between regional rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia and hosting prior discussions between Hamas and Fatah in April. These moves are part of Beijing's broader strategy to influence peace and stability in the Middle East.\n\n\"China will continue to play a constructive role in promoting peace and stability in the Middle East,\" Wang Yi emphasized, highlighting Beijing's commitment to a diplomatic solution for Gaza's post-war governance and the broader Israeli war on besieged Palestinian regions.\n\nAccording to Gaza's Health Ministry, the war has resulted in over 39,000 deaths, predominantly civilians, although British journal The Lancet predicts the true number could be 186,00 accounting for all of those still missing under the rubble.

Netanyahu is in Washington, where he was to meet with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe Israeli military ordered the evacuation of part of a crowded area in the Gaza Strip it had designated a humanitarian zone, while the Health Ministry in Gaza says over 39,000 Palestinians have now been killed in the nine-month war.\n\nEgypt, Qatar and the United States are pushing Israel and Hamas toward a phased deal that would stop the fighting and free the remaining hostages. Netanyahu's office has said a negotiating team will be sent to continue talks Thursday.\n\nIn China, Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration on forming a unity government and ending a yearslong rift. But previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nIsraeli forces raid a Palestinian city in the West Bank, killing multiple people\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israeli forces raided a Palestinian city in the occupied West Bank, the military said Tuesday, killing what it said were two militants. The Palestinian Health Ministry said a woman was killed.\n\nThe military said a drone struck militants in the area of the northern West Bank city of Tulkarem overnight into Tuesday, killing Ashraf Nafa, who the military said was a local senior Hamas operative. It said another alleged militant, Mohammed Awad, was also killed in the raid, and said both had been behind attacks on Israeli soldiers. The Israeli military statement did not mention the woman killed.\n\nThere was no immediate claim from Hamas or other militant groups surrounding the men's affiliations.\n\nFor several years, the Israeli military has been carrying out near nightly raids in the West Bank that intensified when the war in Gaza erupted. The Palestinian Health Ministry says more than 500 Palestinians have been killed in the ensuing violence, many of them in clashes with Israeli soldiers but others while throwing stones or protesting. People not involved in confrontations have also been killed.\n\nPalestinian attacks against Israelis have been on the rise in the territory.\n\nA top WHO official is worried about possible polio and other disease outbreaks in Gaza\n\nGENEVA -- A top World Health Organization official in Palestinian areas said Tuesday he's \"extremely worried\" about polio and other outbreaks of communicable diseases in Gaza after traces of the virus turned up in sewage samples in the territory.\n\nDr. Ayadil Saparbekov, team lead for health emergencies at WHO in the occupied Palestinian territory, said test results and a risk assessment were expected this week about how people and medical officials should respond to a possible outbreak.\n\nThere have been no confirmed human cases of polio in Gaza, but six of seven sewage samples tested positive for vaccine-derived polio virus, he said. That means that one or more people who got a polio vaccine jab have shed the virus in the environment.\n\n\"I am extremely worried about an outbreak happening in Gaza. And this is not only polio -- the different outbreaks of the communicable diseases that may happen,\" he told a United Nations briefing in Geneva by video, alluding to a hepatitis outbreak there in 2023.\n\nSaparbekov said lack of water, sanitation, and access to health care could lead to more people dying of communicable diseases than from injury related conditions.\n\nRolando Gomez, a United Nations spokesperson in Geneva, said Israel \"as the occupying power\" has a responsibility \"to ensure assistance reaches those in need in Gaza\" and to \"create an enabling environment for the U.N. and our partners to operate.\"\n\nIsrael has announced plans to vaccinate its soldiers operating in Gaza against polio.\n\nPalestinian factions sign a declaration in the latest attempt to clear the way for a unity government as the war in Gaza rages on\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank -- Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration in Beijing on ending a yearslong rift, Chinese state state broadcaster CCTV said Tuesday, taking a step toward potentially resolving the deep divide between the sides as the war in Gaza rages on.\n\nThe declaration by the two heavyweights of Palestinian politics -- and other smaller Palestinian groups -- to form a unity government for the Palestinian territories is the result of the latest in a series of talks meant to unite the sides.\n\nBut previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution. It also comes as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the nine-month war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nStill, the future of Gaza is undecided, with Israel vehemently opposed to any role by Hamas in governing Gaza. It has also rejected calls from the United States for the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority to run Gaza after the war ends. The lack of a postwar vision for running the Gaza Strip has complicated negotiations over a cease-fire.\n\nSince the current war broke out in Gaza almost 10 months ago, Hamas officials have said that the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and the group has called for formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nConditions for a cease-fire deal that would release hostages from captivity in Gaza are 'ripening,' Israel's Netanyahu says\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has signaled that a cease-fire deal that would free dozens of hostages from captivity in Gaza could be taking shape.\n\nIn a meeting late Monday in Washington with families of hostages, Netanyahu said the conditions to bring the captives back were \"ripening,\" according to a statement from his office. He said that was happening because of the fierce military pressure Israel was putting on Hamas.\n\nHe gave no further details on the deal's progress.\n\nFor weeks, Israel and Hamas have been weighing a United States-backed cease-fire deal that would bring a halt to the nine-month war and free the roughly 120 hostages taken by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack. About a third of the hostages are said to be dead, and Israel's military announced Monday that two more died in captivity.\n\nNetanyahu faces intense pressure from a broad swath of Israelis to agree to the deal. He has vowed to defeat Hamas before stopping the war, a term that has been a main sticking point throughout the negotiations.\n\nThe families of hostages had demanded that Netanyahu nail down a deal before flying to Washington, where he will address Congress and is expected to meet President Joe Biden.\n\nBill labeling UN Palestinian aid agency as a 'terror group' moves forward in Israel's parliament\n\nJERUSALEM, Israel -- An Israeli parliamentary bill that seeks to label the main provider of aid for Palestinians in Gaza a terrorist group is moving ahead.\n\nLegislators voted 50-10 in favor of the bill in a preliminary vote in Israel's parliament Monday. The bill requires two more votes before becoming law.\n\nThe bill is the product of increasingly tense relations between Israel and the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. Israel has accused the agency of militant links, claiming that hundreds of its employees are members of militant groups, including some who allegedly participated in Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel. Those accusations led to a global cascade of funding cuts to the agency.\n\nUNRWA employs thousands of workers and provides vital aid and services to millions of people across the Middle East. In Gaza, it has been the main supplier of food, water and shelter to civilians during the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe bill moving through parliament would brand the agency as a \"terror group,\" saying that the employees' alleged involvement in the Hamas assault shows that \"it is a terror organization that is no different from the Hamas terror organization.\" The bill also seeks to cut diplomatic ties between Israel and the agency.\n\nJuliette Touma, director of communications for UNRWA, said she wasn't entirely sure how the bill, if made law, would affect the agency, but said it would likely complicate its work. She said UNRWA is in contact with Israeli authorities on a daily basis, something the law would limit.\n\nThe European Union, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have all previously expressed concern about the bill, saying it would hobble the agency's work.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Netanyahu is in Washington, where he was to meet with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe Israeli military ordered the evacuation of part of a crowded area in the Gaza Strip it had designated a humanitarian zone, while the Health Ministry in Gaza says over 39,000 Palestinians have now been killed in the nine-month war.\n\nEgypt, Qatar and the United States are pushing Israel and Hamas toward a phased deal that would stop the fighting and free the remaining hostages. Netanyahu's office has said a negotiating team will be sent to continue talks Thursday.\n\nIn China, Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration on forming a unity government and ending a yearslong rift. But previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nIsraeli forces raid a Palestinian city in the West Bank, killing multiple people\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israeli forces raided a Palestinian city in the occupied West Bank, the military said Tuesday, killing what it said were two militants. The Palestinian Health Ministry said a woman was killed.\n\nThe military said a drone struck militants in the area of the northern West Bank city of Tulkarem overnight into Tuesday, killing Ashraf Nafa, who the military said was a local senior Hamas operative. It said another alleged militant, Mohammed Awad, was also killed in the raid, and said both had been behind attacks on Israeli soldiers. The Israeli military statement did not mention the woman killed.\n\nThere was no immediate claim from Hamas or other militant groups surrounding the men's affiliations.\n\nFor several years, the Israeli military has been carrying out near nightly raids in the West Bank that intensified when the war in Gaza erupted. The Palestinian Health Ministry says more than 500 Palestinians have been killed in the ensuing violence, many of them in clashes with Israeli soldiers but others while throwing stones or protesting. People not involved in confrontations have also been killed.\n\nPalestinian attacks against Israelis have been on the rise in the territory.\n\nA top WHO official is worried about possible polio and other disease outbreaks in Gaza\n\nGENEVA -- A top World Health Organization official in Palestinian areas said Tuesday he's \"extremely worried\" about polio and other outbreaks of communicable diseases in Gaza after traces of the virus turned up in sewage samples in the territory.\n\nDr. Ayadil Saparbekov, team lead for health emergencies at WHO in the occupied Palestinian territory, said test results and a risk assessment were expected this week about how people and medical officials should respond to a possible outbreak.\n\nThere have been no confirmed human cases of polio in Gaza, but six of seven sewage samples tested positive for vaccine-derived polio virus, he said. That means that one or more people who got a polio vaccine jab have shed the virus in the environment.\n\n\"I am extremely worried about an outbreak happening in Gaza. And this is not only polio -- the different outbreaks of the communicable diseases that may happen,\" he told a United Nations briefing in Geneva by video, alluding to a hepatitis outbreak there in 2023.\n\nSaparbekov said lack of water, sanitation, and access to health care could lead to more people dying of communicable diseases than from injury related conditions.\n\nRolando Gomez, a United Nations spokesperson in Geneva, said Israel \"as the occupying power\" has a responsibility \"to ensure assistance reaches those in need in Gaza\" and to \"create an enabling environment for the U.N. and our partners to operate.\"\n\nIsrael has announced plans to vaccinate its soldiers operating in Gaza against polio.\n\nPalestinian factions sign a declaration in the latest attempt to clear the way for a unity government as the war in Gaza rages on\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank -- Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration in Beijing on ending a yearslong rift, Chinese state state broadcaster CCTV said Tuesday, taking a step toward potentially resolving the deep divide between the sides as the war in Gaza rages on.\n\nThe declaration by the two heavyweights of Palestinian politics -- and other smaller Palestinian groups -- to form a unity government for the Palestinian territories is the result of the latest in a series of talks meant to unite the sides.\n\nBut previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution. It also comes as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the nine-month war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nStill, the future of Gaza is undecided, with Israel vehemently opposed to any role by Hamas in governing Gaza. It has also rejected calls from the United States for the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority to run Gaza after the war ends. The lack of a postwar vision for running the Gaza Strip has complicated negotiations over a cease-fire.\n\nSince the current war broke out in Gaza almost 10 months ago, Hamas officials have said that the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and the group has called for formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nConditions for a cease-fire deal that would release hostages from captivity in Gaza are 'ripening,' Israel's Netanyahu says\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has signaled that a cease-fire deal that would free dozens of hostages from captivity in Gaza could be taking shape.\n\nIn a meeting late Monday in Washington with families of hostages, Netanyahu said the conditions to bring the captives back were \"ripening,\" according to a statement from his office. He said that was happening because of the fierce military pressure Israel was putting on Hamas.\n\nHe gave no further details on the deal's progress.\n\nFor weeks, Israel and Hamas have been weighing a United States-backed cease-fire deal that would bring a halt to the nine-month war and free the roughly 120 hostages taken by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack. About a third of the hostages are said to be dead, and Israel's military announced Monday that two more died in captivity.\n\nNetanyahu faces intense pressure from a broad swath of Israelis to agree to the deal. He has vowed to defeat Hamas before stopping the war, a term that has been a main sticking point throughout the negotiations.\n\nThe families of hostages had demanded that Netanyahu nail down a deal before flying to Washington, where he will address Congress and is expected to meet President Joe Biden.\n\nBill labeling UN Palestinian aid agency as a 'terror group' moves forward in Israel's parliament\n\nJERUSALEM, Israel -- An Israeli parliamentary bill that seeks to label the main provider of aid for Palestinians in Gaza a terrorist group is moving ahead.\n\nLegislators voted 50-10 in favor of the bill in a preliminary vote in Israel's parliament Monday. The bill requires two more votes before becoming law.\n\nThe bill is the product of increasingly tense relations between Israel and the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. Israel has accused the agency of militant links, claiming that hundreds of its employees are members of militant groups, including some who allegedly participated in Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel. Those accusations led to a global cascade of funding cuts to the agency.\n\nUNRWA employs thousands of workers and provides vital aid and services to millions of people across the Middle East. In Gaza, it has been the main supplier of food, water and shelter to civilians during the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe bill moving through parliament would brand the agency as a \"terror group,\" saying that the employees' alleged involvement in the Hamas assault shows that \"it is a terror organization that is no different from the Hamas terror organization.\" The bill also seeks to cut diplomatic ties between Israel and the agency.\n\nJuliette Touma, director of communications for UNRWA, said she wasn't entirely sure how the bill, if made law, would affect the agency, but said it would likely complicate its work. She said UNRWA is in contact with Israeli authorities on a daily basis, something the law would limit.\n\nThe European Union, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have all previously expressed concern about the bill, saying it would hobble the agency's work.", "source": {"uri": "winnipegfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Winnipeg Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This would be followed on 21 July with a meeting for all the factions to resume the intra-Palestinian dialogue around reconciliation.\n\nAzzam al-Ahmad, a member of the PLO's Executive Committee as well as Fatah's Central Committee, said to Anadolu Agency that his movement would \"take part in the China meeting with an open mind and is serious about reaching an end to the division\".\n\nFor his part, senior Hamas official Husam Badran said to Anadolu Agency that Hamas was approaching China's invitation \"with a positive spirit and patriotic responsibility\" as the movement was \"eager to achieve national unity\".\n\nLin Jian, a spokesperson at China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in a press briefing last week that China would work with all parties in Palestine to strengthen reconciliation efforts.\n\nHe asserted that Beijing had always supported the Palestinian factions in achieving reconciliation and solidarity through dialogue and consultation, and stood ready to provide platforms and opportunities to all the Palestinian factions to carry out dialogue with the aim of reconciliation.\n\nThe most recent round of China-sponsored Fatah-Hamas talks took place in Beijing in April, but yielded no practical solutions around ending the bitter divide which has continued for around 17 years.\n\nLikewise, Arab states have made efforts to promote a rapprochement, none of which have succeeded in bringing the divergent perspectives of the two sides together or advancing an end to the crisis.\n\nChina's efforts spring from its belief that the key to the solution to the most pressing issue today in the Middle East in the wake of the Gaza war \"is achieving internal unity as a first step to paving the way towards building an independent state on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital,\" said Lin Wei, a researcher at the Jiangxi Institute of Political Studies in China.\n\nHe said Beijing realizes that continuing Palestinian division has become a cover for the continuation of the Israeli killing machine in Gaza.\n\n\"Despite the depth of the divide, China is acting as a responsible state and is banking on its capability to influence the relevant parties, as it enjoys strong relations with all Palestinian factions, including Hamas and Fatah\", he said.\n\nHe also pointed out that China \"knows well it won't be easy to reap the fruits of these efforts through just one or two sessions, due to the differing approaches every side takes with regards to resolving the Palestinian issue\", in reference to the peace process versus armed resistance.\n\nBut Li Yang, a professor at Tseung Kwan Institute of Studies and Research (based in Hong Kong), believes Beijing's decision to host a new round of talks, despite the failure of all previous rounds over a decade and a half, is futile and doomed to failure.\n\nHe says there is no doubt Beijing has its own aims - linked to promoting its image on the world stage as a sponsor of peace, after failing to achieve any breakthrough in the Ukrainian crisis.\n\nYang pointed out that China had intensified its efforts regarding Palestinian reconciliation and started up the Fatah-Hamas talks after its successful mediation between Tehran and Riyadh in March 2023.\n\nHe thinks this is because it hopes to secure more breakthroughs and play a greater role in solving the crises of the Middle East in a way that will serve its strategic interests in the region.\n\nHowever, he believes China's approach to the Palestinian issue and Fatah-Hamas reconciliation is marred by many weaknesses that prevent it from being able to replicate its experience in the Saudi-Iranian issue.\n\nIn his view, the biggest obstacle is ignoring the pivotal role of the US in this issue, due to the direct and powerful influence it wields over all parties to the conflict, including Israel and the Palestinian Authority itself, led by Fatah.", "source": {"uri": "newarab.com", "dataType": "news",

In May, Chinese leader Xi Jinping told a meeting of Chinese and Arab diplomats in Beijing that the war should not continue indefinitely. Xi reiterated Beijing's support for a broad-based, authoritative and effective international peace conference, as well as China's call for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.\n\nChina is also expected to seek a role in the post-war Gaza Strip to help rebuild infrastructure. Diplomats including Cao Xiaolin, China's ambassador to Qatar, and envoy Wang Kejian met with Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in March.\n\nHamas issued a statement saying Chinese officials had told Haniyeh that Hamas was part of the Palestinian national fabric and that China wanted to maintain relations with it.\n\nIt is a delicate balance for China because it also maintains diplomatic and trade relations with Israel, even though Beijing has never officially condemned the October 7 attacks.\n\nChina does not offer itself as a mediator between anyone, Mehdawi said. China cannot call for a peace conference while the Palestinians themselves are not repairing their home.\n\nChina could act as a guarantor for a Palestinian unity deal, having joined Oman and Iraq in brokering a deal last year between Saudi Arabia and Iran that restored diplomatic ties between the two rivals. The United States and Europe were not involved in that process.\n\nChina wants to be part of any major diplomatic gathering that ends this conflict, and it would like to play a significant role in it, said Jon Alterman, senior vice president and director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nOverall, China sees this as a relatively inexpensive way to do something, he said. If it works, it's prestigious, and if it doesn't, it's not a bad thing, not a fault.\n\nPalestinian unity is elusive. Power struggles have long divided Fatah and Hamas, a rift that deepened in 2007 with Hamas's chaotic takeover of the Gaza Strip after elections the previous year. That rift has since led the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority to govern only parts of the West Bank, while Palestinians complain of diminishing legitimacy, according to a 2023 study by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, an independent think tank based in Ramallah. Israel has exercised its power over the West Bank and Gaza in different ways.\n\nThe Beijing talks will be held at the Diaoyutai State Guest House, a sprawling complex of gardens, lakes, buildings and a hotel where the Communist Party hosts foreign dignitaries. It will bring together a delegation of senior Fatah officials, including its vice chairman, Mahmoud Aloul, with their Hamas counterparts led by Haniyeh.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi will meet with both sides, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said when confirming the meetings. The two factions will also meet without Wang, who is China's top diplomat, but he is expected to join the two sides on the last day, according to Palestinian officials familiar with the schedule.\n\nChina's advance acknowledgement of the talks suggests a different level of confidence in the results they could deliver. A first round of meetings was held in April, with little progress, and China only announced the talks after participants had left the country. The Beijing talks followed a similar meeting in Moscow in February.\n\nWhen it came time for Chinese officials to host the second round of unity talks scheduled here on June 24, Hamas and Fatah pulled out at the last minute. Both factions issued statements accusing the other of rejecting the meeting and expressing gratitude to their Chinese hosts.\n\nThe historical divide between Hamas and Fatah is deep, said Maria Papageorgiou, professor of politics and international relations at the University of Exeter, but China's direct influence on Palestinian politics remains limited compared to other actors.\n\nChina's relations with the Palestinians date back to the 1960s, when the government of Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong provided food, weapons, training and support to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).\n\nIn 1988, China was one of the first countries in the world to recognize a Palestinian state, and its representative office in Beijing was upgraded to an embassy in 1974. Today, the Palestinians rely primarily on China for diplomatic support at the United Nations, officials say.\n\nThese ties to the PLO have long been closely tied to China's advance in the Middle East, driven primarily by economic interests that have also expanded its foreign policy influence. Much of Beijing's crude oil imports come from the region, and Chinese investment has funded billions of dollars in infrastructure projects including ports, highways and skyscrapers.\n\nAlthough China has acquired a significant economic presence in the Middle East, its [diplomatic] Credibility does not always correspond to influence, Papageorgiou said, adding that China's now strained relations with Israel over the conflict will make it difficult to facilitate conversations between Palestinians and Israelis without U.S. involvement.\n\nIn a statement to NBC News, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said China has always firmly supported the just cause of the Palestinian people. Without naming the United States, it added that China calls on major influential countries to remove their tinted glass and abandon double standards when dealing with regional affairs.\n\nAccording to Alterman, the Chinese worldview is not based on a strong international community that defends common interests. China prefers to engage one at a time, so to the extent that it undermines this broader effort to encourage multilateralism, I think the United States sees it as pointless.\n\nPalestinian Ambassador Mehdawi does not see China competing to replace the United States as the dominant power in the region in terms of diplomacy. Rather, he sees China's involvement in the unity negotiations as fulfilling a role that the United States is unable to assume because of its support for Israel.\n\nChinese foreign policy is not that ambitious, he said. The Chinese know their limits. The failures of the United States suggest that China is doing more.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Palestinians' seeming inability to manage internal divisions and control the frictions has been a regular pretext for Western and Israeli opposition to immediate statehood for the Palestinians.\n\nBy hosting a fresh round of interfactional talks among Palestine's major political actors, Beijing is taking a proactive step to push for Palestinian national reconciliation, and ultimately Palestinian statehood. The talks also represent a new attempt by Palestine to introduce order at home.\n\nAs Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning stated, the Chinese side has persistently shown solid support for the factions in Palestine to achieve reconciliation and unity through consultation and to build an independent state as soon as possible. The latest Beijing talks are a part of those efforts.\n\nThe second round of reconciliation negotiations going on in Beijing reportedly feature 14 Palestinian political factions, including the Palestinian National Liberation Movement (Fatah) and the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas). While the meeting is an endorsement of Chinese enthusiasm for the Palestinians' pursuit of statehood, a more important driver behind it is the Palestinian recognition that reconciliation is necessary for a stable state. A Fatah official was quoted by a Turkish news agency as saying his organization would \"participate in the meeting in Beijing with an open mind, and seriously consider ending division\". It also quoted a member of the Hamas Political Bureau as saying they would accept Beijing's invitation, because they \"yearn to accomplish national unity\". Representatives of the two factions held their first consultation in Beijing in April, which was widely viewed as a promising start for the journey toward reconciliation among the various Palestinian factions.\n\nWhat Beijing has contributed to that process has not been limited to moral support. According to the Foreign Ministry, Beijing's position has been fully reflected in the advisory opinions issued by the International Court of Justice calling for Israel to immediately end its illegal occupation of Palestinian land.\n\nIf, as some international observers have reported, China could offer a framework for the talks to be productive, that would certainly be a greater contribution.\n\nSince Palestinian divisions suit the agendas of Israel and the United States, Tel Aviv and Washington have been trying to distort Beijing's good intentions and undermine and obstruct its efforts to promote Palestinian reconciliation. Doing so leaves them at odds with the conscience of the world. China stands firmly on the side of peace and justice and it will continue to do what it can to promote the settlement of the Palestinian issue.", "source": {"uri": "chinadaily.com.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "China Daily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fatah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mao Zedong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli settlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politburo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202407/23/669f8dafa31095c551b5a4ae.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749919", "eventUri": "eng-9749919", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Abbas, himself, is increasingly perceived as an autocrat determined to reject vital reforms, and the authority of the courts has diminished, with their rulings constrained by the Chairman's decrees, sparking growing unrest among lawyers' groups and trade unions...\n\n\"Mahmoud Abbas and his fellow PA leaders refrained from condemning the massacres carried out by Hamas on October 7. Some even justified the acts. The PA also continues to pay monthly allowances to the families of Palestinians who perpetrated attacks against Israelis, a move perceived in Israel as encouraging terrorism.\"\n\nInstead of starting a \"reform process\" within the PA, as the Biden administration has demanded, Abbas and his top officials are still pursuing unity and reconciliation with Hamas, whose members carried out the October 7 atrocities against thousands of Israelis. It is hard to see how such an alliance between the two Palestinian parties would even begin to benefit the Palestinians or advance peace and security in the Middle East.\n\nPalestinians living under the rule of the PA and Hamas have long been complaining about financial and administrative corruption, as well as repression and human rights violations. Here is what Human Rights Watch had to say about the status of human rights under the PA and Hamas:\n\n\"Both the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority (PA) in the West Bank and the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in Gaza have in recent years carried out scores of arbitrary arrests for peaceful criticism of the authorities, particularly on social media, among independent journalists, on university campuses, and at demonstrations. As the Fatah-Hamas feud deepened despite attempts at reconciliation, PA security services have targeted supporters of Hamas and vice versa. Relying primarily on overly broad laws that criminalize activity such as causing 'sectarian strife' or insulting 'higher authorities,' the PA and Hamas use detention to punish critics and deter them and others from further activism. In detention, security forces routinely taunt, threaten, beat, and force detainees into painful stress positions for hours at a time.\"\n\nSince October 7, Abbas's ruling Fatah faction and Hamas have been holding talks to discuss ways of achieving unity and reconciliation. Most of the negotiations have been taking place in China, which appears to be vying for a bigger role in the Middle East.\n\nThe Biden administration has so far refrained from demanding that the PA halt its efforts to form a partnership with Hamas, which is designated by the US as a foreign terrorist group.\n\nThe Biden administration should instead be encouraging Palestinians to get rid of Hamas rather than seeking unity and reconciliation with a terrorist group responsible for the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust.\n\nIn mid-July, China again invited Fatah and Hamas officials to pursue the unity and reconciliation talks in Beijing. Fatah and Hamas representatives welcomed the Chinese invitation.\n\nSenior Hamas official Hussam Badran stated that his group \"dealt with this invitation in a positive spirit and with national responsibility in order to achieve national unity.\"\n\nThe Hamas delegation will be headed by Ismail Haniyeh, while the Fatah team will be headed by Mahmoud al-Aloul, Deputy Chairman of Fatah.\n\nIn a statement carried by the PA's official news agency Wafa, Fatah renewed its \"great appreciation for China, which hosted the national dialogue between Fatah and Hamas, and its desire to ensure the success of the Chinese efforts.\"\n\nAzzam al-Ahmad, a member of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Fatah Central Committee, told the Turkish Anadolu Agency that his faction \"will participate in the China meeting, and is serious about ending the dispute [with Hamas].\"\n\nAnother Fatah official, Abdel Fattah Dawla, said:\n\n\"We in Fatah are open to resolving and removing all obstacles in the way of reconciliation in light of the difficult circumstances that the Palestinian cause is going through.\"\n\nOn the eve of the resumption of the Fatah-Hamas unity talks, Jibril Rajoub, secretary-general of Fatah, justified Hamas's October 7 attack during which 1,200 Israelis were murdered, raped, tortured and burned alive, and more than 240 others were kidnapped to the Gaza Strip.\n\nRajoub, who previously served as head of the PA's Preventive Security Force in the West Bank, described the atrocities as a \"defensive operation.\" He boasted that the October 7 attack had \"thwarted attempts to liquidate the Palestinian issue, as well as efforts to achieve normalization [between Israel and Saudi Arabia].\"\n\nHamas and its patrons in Iran have previously stated that one of the goals of the October 7 massacre was to thwart US efforts to achieve normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nSuch statements show why there is basically no difference between the PA and Hamas. Both organizations believe that murdering Jews helps the Palestinians and advances their objective of preventing Israel and the Arab states from normalizing relations with each other.\n\nThe PA is lying when it states that it supports a two-state solution. How can the PA advocate for a two-state solution while its leaders are praising the October 7 atrocities and working to form an alliance with Hamas, an Islamist terrorist group whose charter openly calls for the elimination of Israel?\n\nThe PA has always stated that it prefers a one-state solution: a state of Palestine replacing all of Israel.", "source": {"uri": "ruthfullyyours.com",

In May, Chinese leader Xi Jinping told a meeting of diplomats from China and Arab states here that \"war should not continue indefinitely.\" Xi reiterated Beijing's support for a \"broad-based, authoritative and effective international peace conference,\" as well as China's call for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.\n\nChina is also expected to seek out a role in postwar Gaza to help rebuild infrastructure. Diplomats including Cao Xiaolin, China's ambassador to Qatar, and envoy Wang Kejian met in March with Hamas' political leader, Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nHamas released a statement stating that Chinese officials told Haniyeh, \"Hamas is part of the Palestinian national fabric and China is keen on relations with it.\"\n\nIt is a delicate balance for China as it also has diplomatic relations and trade ties with Israel, though officially Beijing has never condemned the Oct. 7 attacks.\n\n\"China is not proffering itself as mediator between anybody and anybody else,\" said Mehdawi. China \"cannot call for a peace conference where the Palestinians themselves are not fixing their home.\"\n\nBeing the potential guarantor of a Palestinian unity agreement would be a win for China, after joining Oman and Iraq to broker a deal last year between Saudi Arabia and Iran that restored full diplomatic ties between the rivals. There was no U.S. or European involvement.\n\n\"China wants to be a part of whatever grand diplomatic jamboree ends this conflict, and it would like to be a prominent part of that,\" said Jon Alterman, senior vice president and director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\"For the most part, China sees this as a relatively inexpensive way to do something,\" he said. \"If it works, it is prestigious, and if it doesn't work, it's no harm, no foul.\"\n\nPalestinian unity has been elusive. Power struggles have long split Fatah and Hamas, a divide that deepened in 2007 with Hamas' chaotic takeover of the Gaza Strip following elections the year before. The rupture has since left the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority governing only parts of the West Bank and doing so amid complaints by Palestinians of eroding legitimacy, according to a 2023 study by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, an independent think tank in Ramallah. Israel has exercised power over both the West Bank and Gaza in different ways.\n\nThe talks in Beijing will be held at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, a sprawling compound of gardens, lakes, buildings and a hotel where the Communist Party receives foreign dignitaries. It will bring together a delegation of senior officials from Fatah including its deputy chairman, Mahmoud Aloul, with Hamas counterparts led by Haniyeh.\n\nChina's Foreign Minister Wang Yi will meet with both sides, a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said when they confirmed the meetings. The factions will also meet without Wang, who is China's top diplomat, but there is a plan for him to rejoin on the last day, according to Palestinian officials familiar with the schedule.\n\nAcknowledging the talks in advance, for China, suggests a different level of confidence in what they might yield. A first round of meetings took place here in April with little progress, and China announced them only after the participants had finished and left the country. The Beijing discussion followed a similar meeting in Moscow in February.\n\nWhen the time came for Chinese officials to host the planned second round of unity talks here on June 24, Hamas and Fatah pulled out at the last minute. Both factions issued statements that blamed the other for rejecting the meeting and expressed \"appreciation\" to their Chinese hosts.\n\n\"The historical divide between Hamas and Fatah is deep,\" said Maria Papageorgiou, a lecturer in politics and international relations at the University of Exeter, \"China's direct influence on Palestinian politics remains limited compared to other players.\"\n\nChina's relations with Palestinians date back to the 1960s, when the government under Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong provided food, weapons, training and support to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).\n\nIn 1988, China was among the first countries in the world to recognize a Palestinian state, and its representative office in Beijing was converted to embassy level in 1974. These days, Palestinians rely on China primarily for diplomatic support at the United Nations, according to officials.\n\nThose PLO ties have long been entwined with China's push into the Middle East, driven mainly by economic interests that have expanded its foreign policy influence, too. Much of Beijing's crude oil imports come from the region, and Chinese investment has funded billions of dollars in infrastructure projects including ports, highways and skyscrapers.\n\n\"Although China has gained significant economic presence in the Middle East, its [diplomatic] credibility does not always match its influence,\" said Papageorgiou, adding that China's now-strained relations with Israel over the conflict will make it difficult to facilitate conversations between Palestinians and Israelis without U.S. involvement.\n\nIn a statement to NBC News, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs maintained China has \"always firmly supported the just cause of the Palestinian people.\" Without naming the U.S., it went on to say, \"China calls on influential major countries to 'take off their tinted glass' and abandon 'double standards' when dealing with regional affairs.\"\n\n\"China's worldview is not that you have a strong international community that advances common interests,\" said Alterman. \"China's preference is to engage one by one, so to the extent that China undermines this broader effort to encourage multilateralism, I think the United States considers that to be unhelpful.\"\n\nMehdawi, the Palestinian ambassador, does not see China vying to replace the U.S. as the dominant power in the region when it comes to diplomacy.

The Palestinian Health Ministry said a woman was killed.\n\nThe military said a drone struck militants in the area of the northern West Bank city of Tulkarem overnight into Tuesday, killing Ashraf Nafa, who the military said was a local senior Hamas operative. It said another alleged militant, Mohammed Awad, was also killed in the raid, and said both had been behind attacks on Israeli soldiers. The Israeli military statement did not mention the woman killed.\n\nThere was no immediate claim from Hamas or other militant groups surrounding the men's affiliations.\n\nFor several years, the Israeli military has been carrying out near nightly raids in the West Bank that intensified when the war in Gaza erupted. The Palestinian Health Ministry says more than 500 Palestinians have been killed in the ensuing violence, many of them in clashes with Israeli soldiers but others while throwing stones or protesting. People not involved in confrontations have also been killed.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nPalestinian attacks against Israelis have been on the rise in the territory.\n\nA top WHO official is worried about possible polio and other disease outbreaks in Gaza\n\nGENEVA -- A top World Health Organization official in Palestinian areas said Tuesday he's \"extremely worried\" about polio and other outbreaks of communicable diseases in Gaza after traces of the virus turned up in sewage samples in the territory.\n\nDr. Ayadil Saparbekov, team lead for health emergencies at WHO in the occupied Palestinian territory, said test results and a risk assessment were expected this week about how people and medical officials should respond to a possible outbreak.\n\nThere have been no confirmed human cases of polio in Gaza, but six of seven sewage samples tested positive for vaccine-derived polio virus, he said. That means that one or more people who got a polio vaccine jab have shed the virus in the environment.\n\n\"I am extremely worried about an outbreak happening in Gaza. And this is not only polio -- the different outbreaks of the communicable diseases that may happen,\" he told a United Nations briefing in Geneva by video, alluding to a hepatitis outbreak there in 2023.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSaparbekov said lack of water, sanitation, and access to health care could lead to more people dying of communicable diseases than from injury related conditions.\n\nRolando Gomez, a United Nations spokesperson in Geneva, said Israel \"as the occupying power\" has a responsibility \"to ensure assistance reaches those in need in Gaza\" and to \"create an enabling environment for the U.N. and our partners to operate.\"\n\nIsrael has announced plans to vaccinate its soldiers operating in Gaza against polio.\n\nPalestinian factions sign a declaration in the latest attempt to clear the way for a unity government as the war in Gaza rages on\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank -- Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration in Beijing on ending a yearslong rift, Chinese state state broadcaster CCTV said Tuesday, taking a step toward potentially resolving the deep divide between the sides as the war in Gaza rages on.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe declaration by the two heavyweights of Palestinian politics -- and other smaller Palestinian groups -- to form a unity government for the Palestinian territories is the result of the latest in a series of talks meant to unite the sides.\n\nBut previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution. It also comes as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the nine-month war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nStill, the future of Gaza is undecided, with Israel vehemently opposed to any role by Hamas in governing Gaza. It has also rejected calls from the United States for the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority to run Gaza after the war ends. The lack of a postwar vision for running the Gaza Strip has complicated negotiations over a cease-fire.\n\nSince the current war broke out in Gaza almost 10 months ago, Hamas officials have said that the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and the group has called for formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nConditions for a cease-fire deal that would release hostages from captivity in Gaza are 'ripening,' Israel's Netanyahu says\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has signaled that a cease-fire deal that would free dozens of hostages from captivity in Gaza could be taking shape.\n\nIn a meeting late Monday in Washington with families of hostages, Netanyahu said the conditions to bring the captives back were \"ripening,\" according to a statement from his office. He said that was happening because of the fierce military pressure Israel was putting on Hamas.\n\nHe gave no further details on the deal's progress.\n\nFor weeks, Israel and Hamas have been weighing a United States-backed cease-fire deal that would bring a halt to the nine-month war and free the roughly 120 hostages taken by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack. About a third of the hostages are said to be dead, and Israel's military announced Monday that two more died in captivity.\n\nNetanyahu faces intense pressure from a broad swath of Israelis to agree to the deal. He has vowed to defeat Hamas before stopping the war, a term that has been a main sticking point throughout the negotiations.\n\nThe families of hostages had demanded that Netanyahu nail down a deal before flying to Washington, where he will address Congress and is expected to meet President Joe Biden.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBill labeling UN Palestinian aid agency as a 'terror group' moves forward in Israel's parliament\n\nJERUSALEM, Israel -- An Israeli parliamentary bill that seeks to label the main provider of aid for Palestinians in Gaza a terrorist group is moving ahead.\n\nLegislators voted 50-10 in favor of the bill in a preliminary vote in Israel's parliament Monday. The bill requires two more votes before becoming law.\n\nThe bill is the product of increasingly tense relations between Israel and the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. Israel has accused the agency of militant links, claiming that hundreds of its employees are members of militant groups, including some who allegedly participated in Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel. Those accusations led to a global cascade of funding cuts to the agency.\n\nUNRWA employs thousands of workers and provides vital aid and services to millions of people across the Middle East. In Gaza, it has been the main supplier of food, water and shelter to civilians during the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe bill moving through parliament would brand the agency as a \"terror group,\" saying that the employees' alleged involvement in the Hamas assault shows that \"it is a terror organization that is no different from the Hamas terror organization.\" The bill also seeks to cut diplomatic ties between Israel and the agency.\n\nJuliette Touma, director of communications for UNRWA, said she wasn't entirely sure how the bill, if made law, would affect the agency, but said it would likely complicate its work. She said UNRWA is in contact with Israeli authorities on a daily basis, something the law would limit.\n\nThe European Union, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have all previously expressed concern about the bill, saying it would hobble the agency's work.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@thestar.com", "name": "Associated

In May, Chinese leader Xi Jinping told a meeting of diplomats from China and Arab states here that \"war should not continue indefinitely.\" Xi reiterated Beijing's support for a \"broad-based, authoritative and effective international peace conference,\" as well as China's call for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.\n\nChina is also expected to seek out a role in postwar Gaza to help rebuild infrastructure. Diplomats including Cao Xiaolin, China's ambassador to Qatar, and envoy Wang Kejian met in March with Hamas' political leader, Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nHamas released a statement stating that Chinese officials told Haniyeh, \"Hamas is part of the Palestinian national fabric and China is keen on relations with it.\"\n\nIt is a delicate balance for China as it also has diplomatic relations and trade ties with Israel, though officially Beijing has never condemned the Oct. 7 attacks.\n\n\"China is not proffering itself as mediator between anybody and anybody else,\" said Mehdawi. China \"cannot call for a peace conference where the Palestinians themselves are not fixing their home.\"\n\nBeing the potential guarantor of a Palestinian unity agreement would be a win for China, after joining Oman and Iraq to broker a deal last year between Saudi Arabia and Iran that restored full diplomatic ties between the rivals. There was no U.S. or European involvement.\n\n\"China wants to be a part of whatever grand diplomatic jamboree ends this conflict, and it would like to be a prominent part of that,\" said Jon Alterman, senior vice president and director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\"For the most part, China sees this as a relatively inexpensive way to do something,\" he said. \"If it works, it is prestigious, and if it doesn't work, it's no harm, no foul.\"\n\nPalestinian unity has been elusive. Power struggles have long split Fatah and Hamas, a divide that deepened in 2007 with Hamas' chaotic takeover of the Gaza Strip following elections the year before. The rupture has since left the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority governing only parts of the West Bank and doing so amid complaints by Palestinians of eroding legitimacy, according to a 2023 study by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, an independent think tank in Ramallah. Israel has exercised power over both the West Bank and Gaza in different ways.\n\nThe talks in Beijing will be held at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, a sprawling compound of gardens, lakes, buildings and a hotel where the Communist Party receives foreign dignitaries. It will bring together a delegation of senior officials from Fatah including its deputy chairman, Mahmoud Aloul, with Hamas counterparts led by Haniyeh.\n\nChina's Foreign Minister Wang Yi will meet with both sides, a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said when they confirmed the meetings. The factions will also meet without Wang, who is China's top diplomat, but there is a plan for him to rejoin on the last day, according to Palestinian officials familiar with the schedule.\n\nAcknowledging the talks in advance, for China, suggests a different level of confidence in what they might yield. A first round of meetings took place here in April with little progress, and China announced them only after the participants had finished and left the country. The Beijing discussion followed a similar meeting in Moscow in February.\n\nWhen the time came for Chinese officials to host the planned second round of unity talks here on June 24, Hamas and Fatah pulled out at the last minute. Both factions issued statements that blamed the other for rejecting the meeting and expressed \"appreciation\" to their Chinese hosts.\n\n\"The historical divide between Hamas and Fatah is deep,\" said Maria Papageorgiou, a lecturer in politics and international relations at the University of Exeter, \"China's direct influence on Palestinian politics remains limited compared to other players.\"\n\nChina's relations with Palestinians date back to the 1960s, when the government under Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong provided food, weapons, training and support to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).\n\nIn 1988, China was among the first countries in the world to recognize a Palestinian state, and its representative office in Beijing was converted to embassy level in 1974. These days, Palestinians rely on China primarily for diplomatic support at the United Nations, according to officials.\n\nThose PLO ties have long been entwined with China's push into the Middle East, driven mainly by economic interests that have expanded its foreign policy influence, too. Much of Beijing's crude oil imports come from the region, and Chinese investment has funded billions of dollars in infrastructure projects including ports, highways and skyscrapers.\n\n\"Although China has gained significant economic presence in the Middle East, its [diplomatic] credibility does not always match its influence,\" said Papageorgiou, adding that China's now-strained relations with Israel over the conflict will make it difficult to facilitate conversations between Palestinians and Israelis without U.S. involvement.\n\nIn a statement to NBC News, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs maintained China has \"always firmly supported the just cause of the Palestinian people.\" Without naming the U.S., it went on to say, \"China calls on influential major countries to 'take off their tinted glass' and abandon 'double standards' when dealing with regional affairs.\"\n\n\"China's worldview is not that you have a strong international community that advances common interests,\" said Alterman. \"China's preference is to engage one by one, so to the extent that China undermines this broader effort to encourage multilateralism, I think the United States considers that to be unhelpful.\"\n\nMehdawi, the Palestinian ambassador, does not see China vying to replace the U.S. as the dominant power in the region when it comes to diplomacy. Instead, he regards China's involvement with unity talks as filling a role the U.S. is unable to undertake given its support for Israel.\n\n\"Chinese foreign policy is not so ambitious,\" he said. \"They know their limitations. Failures of the U.S. are making it appear that China is doing more.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Netanyahu's office has said a negotiating team will be sent to continue talks Thursday.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank -- Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration in Beijing on ending a yearslong rift, Chinese state state broadcaster CCTV said Tuesday, taking a step toward potentially resolving the deep divide between the sides as the war in Gaza rages on.\n\nThe declaration by the two heavyweights of Palestinian politics -- and other smaller Palestinian groups -- to form a unity government for the Palestinian territories is the result of the latest in a series of talks meant to unite the sides.\n\nBut previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution. It also comes as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the nine-month war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nStill, the future of Gaza is undecided, with Israel vehemently opposed to any role by Hamas in governing Gaza. It has also rejected calls from the United States for the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority to run Gaza after the war ends. The lack of a postwar vision for running the Gaza Strip has complicated negotiations over a cease-fire.\n\nSince the current war broke out in Gaza almost 10 months ago, Hamas officials have said that the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and the group has called for formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has signaled that a cease-fire deal that would free dozens of hostages from captivity in Gaza could be taking shape.\n\nIn a meeting late Monday in Washington with families of hostages, Netanyahu said the conditions to bring the captives back were \"ripening,\" according to a statement from his office. He said that was happening because of the fierce military pressure Israel was putting on Hamas.\n\nHe gave no further details on the deal's progress.\n\nFor weeks, Israel and Hamas have been weighing a United States-backed cease-fire deal that would bring a halt to the nine-month war and free the roughly 120 hostages taken by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack. About a third of the hostages are said to be dead, and Israel's military announced Monday that two more died in captivity.\n\nNetanyahu faces intense pressure from a broad swath of Israelis to agree to the deal. He has vowed to defeat Hamas before stopping the war, a term that has been a main sticking point throughout the negotiations.\n\nThe families of hostages had demanded that Netanyahu nail down a deal before flying to Washington, where he will address Congress and is expected to meet President Joe Biden.\n\nJERUSALEM, Israel -- An Israeli parliamentary bill that seeks to label the main provider of aid for Palestinians in Gaza a terrorist group is moving ahead.\n\nLegislators voted 50-10 in favor of the bill in a preliminary vote in Israel's parliament Monday. The bill requires two more votes before becoming law.\n\nThe bill is the product of increasingly tense relations between Israel and the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. Israel has accused the agency of militant links, claiming that hundreds of its employees are members of militant groups, including some who allegedly participated in Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel. Those accusations led to a global cascade of funding cuts to the agency.\n\nUNRWA employs thousands of workers and provides vital aid and services to millions of people across the Middle East. In Gaza, it has been the main supplier of food, water and shelter to civilians during the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe bill moving through parliament would brand the agency as a \"terror group,\" saying that the employees' alleged involvement in the Hamas assault shows that \"it is a terror organization that is no different from the Hamas terror organization.\" The bill also seeks to cut diplomatic ties between Israel and the agency.\n\nJuliette Touma, director of communications for UNRWA, said she wasn't entirely sure how the bill, if made law, would affect the agency, but said it would likely complicate its work. She said UNRWA is in contact with Israeli authorities on a daily basis, something the law would limit.\n\nThe European Union, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have all previously expressed concern about the bill, saying it would hobble the agency's work.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Netanyahu is in Washington, where he was to meet with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe Israeli military ordered the evacuation of part of a crowded area in the Gaza Strip it had designated a humanitarian zone, while the Health Ministry in Gaza says over 39,000 Palestinians have now been killed in the nine-month war.\n\nEgypt, Qatar and the United States are pushing Israel and Hamas toward a phased deal that would stop the fighting and free the remaining hostages. Netanyahu's office has said a negotiating team will be sent to continue talks Thursday.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nPalestinian factions sign a declaration in the latest attempt to clear the way for a unity government as the war in Gaza rages on\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank -- Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration in Beijing on ending a yearslong rift, Chinese state state broadcaster CCTV said Tuesday, taking a step toward potentially resolving the deep divide between the sides as the war in Gaza rages on.\n\nThe declaration by the two heavyweights of Palestinian politics -- and other smaller Palestinian groups -- to form a unity government for the Palestinian territories is the result of the latest in a series of talks meant to unite the sides.\n\nBut previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution. It also comes as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the nine-month war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nStill, the future of Gaza is undecided, with Israel vehemently opposed to any role by Hamas in governing Gaza. It has also rejected calls from the United States for the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority to run Gaza after the war ends. The lack of a postwar vision for running the Gaza Strip has complicated negotiations over a cease-fire.\n\nSince the current war broke out in Gaza almost 10 months ago, Hamas officials have said that the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and the group has called for formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nConditions for a cease-fire deal that would release hostages from captivity in Gaza are 'ripening,' Israel's Netanyahu says\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has signaled that a cease-fire deal that would free dozens of hostages from captivity in Gaza could be taking shape.\n\nIn a meeting late Monday in Washington with families of hostages, Netanyahu said the conditions to bring the captives back were \"ripening,\" according to a statement from his office. He said that was happening because of the fierce military pressure Israel was putting on Hamas.\n\nHe gave no further details on the deal's progress.\n\nFor weeks, Israel and Hamas have been weighing a United States-backed cease-fire deal that would bring a halt to the nine-month war and free the roughly 120 hostages taken by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack. About a third of the hostages are said to be dead, and Israel's military announced Monday that two more died in captivity.\n\nNetanyahu faces intense pressure from a broad swath of Israelis to agree to the deal. He has vowed to defeat Hamas before stopping the war, a term that has been a main sticking point throughout the negotiations.\n\nThe families of hostages had demanded that Netanyahu nail down a deal before flying to Washington, where he will address Congress and is expected to meet President Joe Biden.\n\nBill labeling UN Palestinian aid agency as a 'terror group' moves forward in Israel's parliament\n\nJERUSALEM, Israel -- An Israeli parliamentary bill that seeks to label the main provider of aid for Palestinians in Gaza a terrorist group is moving ahead.\n\nLegislators voted 50-10 in favor of the bill in a preliminary vote in Israel's parliament Monday. The bill requires two more votes before becoming law.\n\nThe bill is the product of increasingly tense relations between Israel and the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. Israel has accused the agency of militant links, claiming that hundreds of its employees are members of militant groups, including some who allegedly participated in Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel. Those accusations led to a global cascade of funding cuts to the agency.\n\nUNRWA employs thousands of workers and provides vital aid and services to millions of people across the Middle East. In Gaza, it has been the main supplier of food, water and shelter to civilians during the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe bill moving through parliament would brand the agency as a \"terror group,\" saying that the employees' alleged involvement in the Hamas assault shows that \"it is a terror organization that is no different from the Hamas terror organization.\" The bill also seeks to cut diplomatic ties between Israel and the agency.\n\nJuliette Touma, director of communications for UNRWA, said she wasn't entirely sure how the bill, if made law, would affect the agency, but said it would likely complicate its work. She said UNRWA is in contact with Israeli authorities on a daily basis, something the law would limit.\n\nThe European Union, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have all previously expressed concern about the bill, saying it would hobble the agency's work.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Netanyahu is in Washington, where he was to meet with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe Israeli military ordered the evacuation of part of a crowded area in the Gaza Strip it had designated a humanitarian zone, while the Health Ministry in Gaza says over 39,000 Palestinians have now been killed in the nine-month war.\n\nEgypt, Qatar and the United States are pushing Israel and Hamas toward a phased deal that would stop the fighting and free the remaining hostages. Netanyahu's office has said a negotiating team will be sent to continue talks Thursday.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nPalestinian factions sign a declaration in the latest attempt to clear the way for a unity government as the war in Gaza rages on\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank -- Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration in Beijing on ending a yearslong rift, Chinese state state broadcaster CCTV said Tuesday, taking a step toward potentially resolving the deep divide between the sides as the war in Gaza rages on.\n\nThe declaration by the two heavyweights of Palestinian politics -- and other smaller Palestinian groups -- to form a unity government for the Palestinian territories is the result of the latest in a series of talks meant to unite the sides.\n\nBut previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution. It also comes as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the nine-month war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nStill, the future of Gaza is undecided, with Israel vehemently opposed to any role by Hamas in governing Gaza. It has also rejected calls from the United States for the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority to run Gaza after the war ends. The lack of a postwar vision for running the Gaza Strip has complicated negotiations over a cease-fire.\n\nSince the current war broke out in Gaza almost 10 months ago, Hamas officials have said that the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and the group has called for formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nConditions for a cease-fire deal that would release hostages from captivity in Gaza are 'ripening,' Israel's Netanyahu says\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has signaled that a cease-fire deal that would free dozens of hostages from captivity in Gaza could be taking shape.\n\nIn a meeting late Monday in Washington with families of hostages, Netanyahu said the conditions to bring the captives back were \"ripening,\" according to a statement from his office. He said that was happening because of the fierce military pressure Israel was putting on Hamas.\n\nHe gave no further details on the deal's progress.\n\nFor weeks, Israel and Hamas have been weighing a United States-backed cease-fire deal that would bring a halt to the nine-month war and free the roughly 120 hostages taken by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack. About a third of the hostages are said to be dead, and Israel's military announced Monday that two more died in captivity.\n\nNetanyahu faces intense pressure from a broad swath of Israelis to agree to the deal. He has vowed to defeat Hamas before stopping the war, a term that has been a main sticking point throughout the negotiations.\n\nThe families of hostages had demanded that Netanyahu nail down a deal before flying to Washington, where he will address Congress and is expected to meet President Joe Biden.\n\nBill labeling UN Palestinian aid agency as a 'terror group' moves forward in Israel's parliament\n\nJERUSALEM, Israel -- An Israeli parliamentary bill that seeks to label the main provider of aid for Palestinians in Gaza a terrorist group is moving ahead.\n\nLegislators voted 50-10 in favor of the bill in a preliminary vote in Israel's parliament Monday. The bill requires two more votes before becoming law.\n\nThe bill is the product of increasingly tense relations between Israel and the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. Israel has accused the agency of militant links, claiming that hundreds of its employees are members of militant groups, including some who allegedly participated in Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel. Those accusations led to a global cascade of funding cuts to the agency.\n\nUNRWA employs thousands of workers and provides vital aid and services to millions of people across the Middle East. In Gaza, it has been the main supplier of food, water and shelter to civilians during the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe bill moving through parliament would brand the agency as a \"terror group,\" saying that the employees' alleged involvement in the Hamas assault shows that \"it is a terror organization that is no different from the Hamas terror organization.\" The bill also seeks to cut diplomatic ties between Israel and the agency.\n\nJuliette Touma, director of communications for UNRWA, said she wasn't entirely sure how the bill, if made law, would affect the agency, but said it would likely complicate its work. She said UNRWA is in contact with Israeli authorities on a daily basis, something the law would limit.\n\nThe European Union, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have all previously expressed concern about the bill, saying it would hobble the agency's work.\n\nMore from this section\n\n2024 Election Latest: Biden ends reelection bid, endorses VP Harris for Democratic nomination\n\nExodus United Global Signs Multi-Year Agreement to Bring Indian Films and TV shows to the U.S.\n\nMost airlines except one are recovering from the CrowdStrike tech outage.

Netanyahu is in Washington, where he was to meet with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe Israeli military ordered the evacuation of part of a crowded area in the Gaza Strip it had designated a humanitarian zone, while the Health Ministry in Gaza says over 39,000 Palestinians have now been killed in the nine-month war.\n\nEgypt, Qatar and the United States are pushing Israel and Hamas toward a phased deal that would stop the fighting and free the remaining hostages. Netanyahu's office has said a negotiating team will be sent to continue talks Thursday.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank -- Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration in Beijing on ending a yearslong rift, Chinese state state broadcaster CCTV said Tuesday, taking a step toward potentially resolving the deep divide between the sides as the war in Gaza rages on.\n\nThe declaration by the two heavyweights of Palestinian politics -- and other smaller Palestinian groups -- to form a unity government for the Palestinian territories is the result of the latest in a series of talks meant to unite the sides.\n\nBut previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution. It also comes as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the nine-month war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nStill, the future of Gaza is undecided, with Israel vehemently opposed to any role by Hamas in governing Gaza. It has also rejected calls from the United States for the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority to run Gaza after the war ends. The lack of a postwar vision for running the Gaza Strip has complicated negotiations over a cease-fire.\n\nSince the current war broke out in Gaza almost 10 months ago, Hamas officials have said that the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and the group has called for formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has signaled that a cease-fire deal that would free dozens of hostages from captivity in Gaza could be taking shape.\n\nIn a meeting late Monday in Washington with families of hostages, Netanyahu said the conditions to bring the captives back were \"ripening,\" according to a statement from his office. He said that was happening because of the fierce military pressure Israel was putting on Hamas.\n\nHe gave no further details on the deal's progress.\n\nFor weeks, Israel and Hamas have been weighing a United States-backed cease-fire deal that would bring a halt to the nine-month war and free the roughly 120 hostages taken by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack. About a third of the hostages are said to be dead, and Israel's military announced Monday that two more died in captivity.\n\nNetanyahu faces intense pressure from a broad swath of Israelis to agree to the deal. He has vowed to defeat Hamas before stopping the war, a term that has been a main sticking point throughout the negotiations.\n\nThe families of hostages had demanded that Netanyahu nail down a deal before flying to Washington, where he will address Congress and is expected to meet President Joe Biden.\n\nJERUSALEM, Israel -- An Israeli parliamentary bill that seeks to label the main provider of aid for Palestinians in Gaza a terrorist group is moving ahead.\n\nLegislators voted 50-10 in favor of the bill in a preliminary vote in Israel's parliament Monday. The bill requires two more votes before becoming law.\n\nThe bill is the product of increasingly tense relations between Israel and the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. Israel has accused the agency of militant links, claiming that hundreds of its employees are members of militant groups, including some who allegedly participated in Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel. Those accusations led to a global cascade of funding cuts to the agency.\n\nUNRWA employs thousands of workers and provides vital aid and services to millions of people across the Middle East. In Gaza, it has been the main supplier of food, water and shelter to civilians during the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe bill moving through parliament would brand the agency as a \"terror group,\" saying that the employees' alleged involvement in the Hamas assault shows that \"it is a terror organization that is no different from the Hamas terror organization.\" The bill also seeks to cut diplomatic ties between Israel and the agency.\n\nJuliette Touma, director of communications for UNRWA, said she wasn't entirely sure how the bill, if made law, would affect the agency, but said it would likely complicate its work. She said UNRWA is in contact with Israeli authorities on a daily basis, something the law would limit.\n\nThe European Union, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have all previously expressed concern about the bill, saying it would hobble the agency's work.", "source": {"uri": "sfgate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Francisco Gate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@sfgate.com", "name":

Netanyahu is in Washington, where he was to meet with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe Israeli military ordered the evacuation of part of a crowded area in the Gaza Strip it had designated a humanitarian zone, while the Health Ministry in Gaza says over 39,000 Palestinians have now been killed in the nine-month war.\n\nEgypt, Qatar and the United States are pushing Israel and Hamas toward a phased deal that would stop the fighting and free the remaining hostages. Netanyahu's office has said a negotiating team will be sent to continue talks Thursday.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nPalestinian factions sign a declaration in the latest attempt to clear the way for a unity government as the war in Gaza rages on\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank -- Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration in Beijing on ending a yearslong rift, Chinese state state broadcaster CCTV said Tuesday, taking a step toward potentially resolving the deep divide between the sides as the war in Gaza rages on.\n\nThe declaration by the two heavyweights of Palestinian politics -- and other smaller Palestinian groups -- to form a unity government for the Palestinian territories is the result of the latest in a series of talks meant to unite the sides.\n\nBut previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution. It also comes as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the nine-month war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nStill, the future of Gaza is undecided, with Israel vehemently opposed to any role by Hamas in governing Gaza. It has also rejected calls from the United States for the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority to run Gaza after the war ends. The lack of a postwar vision for running the Gaza Strip has complicated negotiations over a cease-fire.\n\nSince the current war broke out in Gaza almost 10 months ago, Hamas officials have said that the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and the group has called for formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nConditions for a cease-fire deal that would release hostages from captivity in Gaza are 'ripening,' Israel's Netanyahu says\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has signaled that a cease-fire deal that would free dozens of hostages from captivity in Gaza could be taking shape.\n\nIn a meeting late Monday in Washington with families of hostages, Netanyahu said the conditions to bring the captives back were \"ripening,\" according to a statement from his office. He said that was happening because of the fierce military pressure Israel was putting on Hamas.\n\nHe gave no further details on the deal's progress.\n\nFor weeks, Israel and Hamas have been weighing a United States-backed cease-fire deal that would bring a halt to the nine-month war and free the roughly 120 hostages taken by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack. About a third of the hostages are said to be dead, and Israel's military announced Monday that two more died in captivity.\n\nNetanyahu faces intense pressure from a broad swath of Israelis to agree to the deal. He has vowed to defeat Hamas before stopping the war, a term that has been a main sticking point throughout the negotiations.\n\nThe families of hostages had demanded that Netanyahu nail down a deal before flying to Washington, where he will address Congress and is expected to meet President Joe Biden.\n\nBill labeling UN Palestinian aid agency as a 'terror group' moves forward in Israel's parliament\n\nJERUSALEM, Israel -- An Israeli parliamentary bill that seeks to label the main provider of aid for Palestinians in Gaza a terrorist group is moving ahead.\n\nLegislators voted 50-10 in favor of the bill in a preliminary vote in Israel's parliament Monday. The bill requires two more votes before becoming law.\n\nThe bill is the product of increasingly tense relations between Israel and the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. Israel has accused the agency of militant links, claiming that hundreds of its employees are members of militant groups, including some who allegedly participated in Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel. Those accusations led to a global cascade of funding cuts to the agency.\n\nUNRWA employs thousands of workers and provides vital aid and services to millions of people across the Middle East. In Gaza, it has been the main supplier of food, water and shelter to civilians during the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe bill moving through parliament would brand the agency as a \"terror group,\" saying that the employees' alleged involvement in the Hamas assault shows that \"it is a terror organization that is no different from the Hamas terror organization.\" The bill also seeks to cut diplomatic ties between Israel and the agency.\n\nJuliette Touma, director of communications for UNRWA, said she wasn't entirely sure how the bill, if made law, would affect the agency, but said it would likely complicate its work. She said UNRWA is in contact with Israeli authorities on a daily basis, something the law would limit.\n\nThe European Union, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have all previously expressed concern about the bill, saying it would hobble the agency's work.", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Santa Maria Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The statement calls for the formation of a unity government to manage the Palestinian territories, as well as a temporary government to oversee Gaza once the Israel-Hamas war ends. (Washington Post & AP)\n\nThere are two aspects of this development that are worth examining, the first being the declaration itself. The fault lines between Hamas and Fatah have for decades been the biggest obstacle to creating a unified Palestinian government. That has not only been a significant impediment to negotiating toward the creation of a Palestinian state but has also been a convenient excuse for Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu to avoid meaningfully engaging with talks toward a two-state solution.\n\nIt is notable that Hamas and Fatah signed this declaration, then. But this is also not the first time they have done so -- similar deals signed in 2011 and 2022 both failed. It remains to be seen if the war in Gaza has changed the circumstances for the Palestinian movement enough for this to be the deal that is actually implemented.\n\nBut even if the agreement does hold up, it may not matter. The Palestinian Authority, or PA, has lost virtually all of its credibility in the West Bank, where it governs, due to its corrupt mismanagement and its security cooperation with Israeli authorities in targeting Palestinian militant factions. That would undermine any unity government's ability to speak for Palestinians in negotiations with Israel, to the extent the two-state solution remains viable. Meanwhile, Netanyahu has repeatedly made it clear that Israel won't tolerate any Palestinian administration in Gaza that includes Hamas, making the unity government a nonstarter in any postwar governance arrangement there.\n\nThe second aspect worth examining is China's role in bringing this agreement to fruition. Much like the 2022 reconciliation statement between Saudi Arabia and Iran, this agreement was mediated in China -- authorities hailed it as the \"Beijing Declaration\" -- but it's not clear to what extent it was mediated by China. In the case of Saudi Arabia and Iran, the two sides had already taken some meaningful steps toward reconciliation before China's involvement, which could be the case here.\n\nEither way, though, this is an easy diplomatic win for China. The implementation of a unity government is such a longshot that none of the parties involved have anything to lose by signing the declaration. Meanwhile, China gains the positive publicity from announcing the agreement, but can easily distance itself from any fallout if the deal does collapse.\n\nFor more context:\n\nColombian President Gustavo Petro signed a bill Monday that bans bullfighting in the country. The controversial practice is already forbidden in several Latin American countries and parts of Spain.\n\nThe ban is just the latest blow to bullfighting, which has been steadily losing popularity everywhere -- especially among the young -- and faces increasing political and social pressure. As Kevin Duffy wrote in 2022, the bullfighting industry could very well be irreversibly hobbled by its recent losses.\n\nA director of New Zealand's pharmaceutical funding agency Pharmac resigned after a government directive instructed the agency to no longer consider the Treaty of Waitangi, an 1840 document that upholds rights for the Indigenous Maori, in its funding decisions. The previous Labour government had told Pharmac in 2022 to embed the treaty into its processes.\n\nThe directive is the latest attempt by New Zealand's conservative government to roll back reforms on Maori rights. Until the current government was formed last year, New Zealand had been considered an example of progress for protecting Indigenous rights and working toward addressing historical wrongs, as Cathrin Schaer wrote in 2021.\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is looking to shore up the support of the armed forces ahead of the country's June 28 presidential election, which although heavily managed represents the biggest threat to his power in a decade. As Kristina Mani wrote in a briefing last week, there are compelling reasons to believe the military will not stand by Maduro if he tries to steal the election.\n\nIraq wants U.S.-led forces in the country to begin withdrawing in September and formally end their work by September 2025, Reuters reports.

Netanyahu is in Washington, where he was to meet with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe Israeli military ordered the evacuation of part of a crowded area in the Gaza Strip it had designated a humanitarian zone, while the Health Ministry in Gaza says over 39,000 Palestinians have now been killed in the nine-month war.\n\nEgypt, Qatar and the United States are pushing Israel and Hamas toward a phased deal that would stop the fighting and free the remaining hostages. Netanyahu's office has said a negotiating team will be sent to continue talks Thursday.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank -- Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration in Beijing on ending a yearslong rift, Chinese state state broadcaster CCTV said Tuesday, taking a step toward potentially resolving the deep divide between the sides as the war in Gaza rages on.\n\nThe declaration by the two heavyweights of Palestinian politics -- and other smaller Palestinian groups -- to form a unity government for the Palestinian territories is the result of the latest in a series of talks meant to unite the sides.\n\nBut previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution. It also comes as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the nine-month war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nStill, the future of Gaza is undecided, with Israel vehemently opposed to any role by Hamas in governing Gaza. It has also rejected calls from the United States for the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority to run Gaza after the war ends. The lack of a postwar vision for running the Gaza Strip has complicated negotiations over a cease-fire.\n\nSince the current war broke out in Gaza almost 10 months ago, Hamas officials have said that the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and the group has called for formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has signaled that a cease-fire deal that would free dozens of hostages from captivity in Gaza could be taking shape.\n\nIn a meeting late Monday in Washington with families of hostages, Netanyahu said the conditions to bring the captives back were \"ripening,\" according to a statement from his office. He said that was happening because of the fierce military pressure Israel was putting on Hamas.\n\nHe gave no further details on the deal's progress.\n\nFor weeks, Israel and Hamas have been weighing a United States-backed cease-fire deal that would bring a halt to the nine-month war and free the roughly 120 hostages taken by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack. About a third of the hostages are said to be dead, and Israel's military announced Monday that two more died in captivity.\n\nNetanyahu faces intense pressure from a broad swath of Israelis to agree to the deal. He has vowed to defeat Hamas before stopping the war, a term that has been a main sticking point throughout the negotiations.\n\nThe families of hostages had demanded that Netanyahu nail down a deal before flying to Washington, where he will address Congress and is expected to meet President Joe Biden.\n\nJERUSALEM, Israel -- An Israeli parliamentary bill that seeks to label the main provider of aid for Palestinians in Gaza a terrorist group is moving ahead.\n\nLegislators voted 50-10 in favor of the bill in a preliminary vote in Israel's parliament Monday. The bill requires two more votes before becoming law.\n\nThe bill is the product of increasingly tense relations between Israel and the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA. Israel has accused the agency of militant links, claiming that hundreds of its employees are members of militant groups, including some who allegedly participated in Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel. Those accusations led to a global cascade of funding cuts to the agency.\n\nUNRWA employs thousands of workers and provides vital aid and services to millions of people across the Middle East. In Gaza, it has been the main supplier of food, water and shelter to civilians during the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe bill moving through parliament would brand the agency as a \"terror group,\" saying that the employees' alleged involvement in the Hamas assault shows that \"it is a terror organization that is no different from the Hamas terror organization.\" The bill also seeks to cut diplomatic ties between Israel and the agency.\n\nJuliette Touma, director of communications for UNRWA, said she wasn't entirely sure how the bill, if made law, would affect the agency, but said it would likely complicate its work. She said UNRWA is in contact with Israeli authorities on a daily basis, something the law would limit.\n\nThe European Union, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have all previously expressed concern about the bill, saying it would hobble the agency's work.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

Experts said that promoting reconciliation within Palestine is a key factor in resolving the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and China can play a positive role in this process where the US cannot.\n\nHamas, which runs Gaza, and the Fatah movement, which has partial administrative control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, have been locked in bitter rivalry since Palestinian legislative elections in 2006. The two groups, under Chinese reconciliation efforts, agreed to meet in Beijing from Saturday to Sunday for peace talks, according to AFP.\n\nVarious reconciliation bids have failed over the years, but calls have been growing since the start of the latest Palestinian-Israeli conflict in October last year which set off a new round of chaos in the Middle East, with violence also soaring in the West Bank where Fatah is based, media said.\n\nThe Hamas delegation is headed by its Qatar-based political chief Ismail Haniyeh, while the Fatah representation is led by deputy head Mahmud Alul, according to Fatah sources, AFP reported.\n\nSabri Saidam, Fatah's central committee deputy secretary general, told media prior to the meeting that the goal is \"to end the state of division with a commitment to past agreements and agreeing on a relationship between the Palestinian groups in the next stage.\"\n\nPromoting reconciliation within Palestine is one of the key factors in resolving the Israel-Palestine crisis, Zhu Yongbiao, executive director of the Research Center for the Belt and Road at Lanzhou University, told the Global Times on Sunday.\n\n\"Facilitating talks between the two sides is strategically important even if Israel withdraws from Gaza. The problem still cannot be fundamentally resolved without addressing Palestine's internal rifts,\" Zhu said.\n\nBeijing's provision of a platform for talks suggests that China emphasizes addressing the issue at its root and has taken proactive actions to offer an environment conducive to peace, which is particularly valuable in the current complex situation, Zhu noted.\n\nA Middle Eastern media commentary said that China's invitation to the two conflicting factions to attend talks in Beijing \"highlights China's confidence and strength,\" the commentary stated. \"Regardless of whether it will be successful or not, this diplomatic move by China demonstrates its responsibility as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, which is truly remarkable.\"\n\nIsrael continued bombardments across the Gaza Strip on Saturday, which claimed dozens of Palestinian lives in the southern, central and northern parts of the besieged territory, including local journalist, Al Jazeera reported.\n\nMeanwhile in Yemen, at least three people were killed and 87 were wounded in Saturday's Israeli air attacks that targeted an oil storage facility and power plant in the port city of Hodeidah, officials said. Israeli raids also caused injuries in southern Lebanon, according to media reports.\n\nExperts suggested that China can play a constructive role in promoting dialogue in the Middle East where the US cannot. Due to the US' indulgence of Israel, it cannot engage in dialogue with Hamas while China, which has always maintained a fair and neutral stance, is able to talk with both sides as well as with intra-Palestinian groups.\n\n\"Although results have yet to be seen, China has already played a positive role by putting the two groups back on the same table. In contrast, the US turned out to be more destructive and destabilizing, and failed to follow through on its promises,\" Zhu noted.\n\nThe experts further stressed that if China and the US along with other major countries can work together and form a united stance on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the crisis could be resolved more quickly and effectively. Unfortunately, despite China's repeated calls for such cooperation, certain countries are reluctant to do so, which is one of the major causes of the prolonged existence of this problem, experts noted.", "source": {"uri": "globalsecurity.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "GlobalSecurity.org"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_pike@globalsecurity.org", "name": "John Pike", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fatah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_occupation_of_the_West_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli occupation of the West Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Global Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanzhou", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lanzhou"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lanzhou"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_members_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Jazeera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 60}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749919", "eventUri": "eng-9749919", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

The declaration was signed by 14 terrorist factions in the Chinese capital following a two-day summit, hosted by Wang Yi, the Chinese foreign minister, in an attempt to \"end the Palestinian national division,\" agreeing: \"We must unite nationally to resist Israeli aggression and stop the genocide.\"\n\nWang called the meeting a \"historic moment for the cause of Palestine's liberation,\" and noted that \"The standout highlight is consensus around establishing an interim national reconciliation government to manage Gaza after the war.\"\n\nWang reiterated China's wish for a \"comprehensive, lasing and sustainable ceasefire,\" and reaching a two-state solution via a large-scale \"international peace conference.\"\n\nThe Chinese government released photos showing Wang in conversation with senior Fatah official Mahmoud al-Aloul, and senior Hamas member Mussa Abu Marzuk. Also on hand were the ambassadors of Russia, Egypt, Russia, and Algeria.\n\nHAMAS AND THE PLO\n\nThe PLO's decision to align with Hamas after it carried out the October 7 atrocities represents another decline in its relationship with Israel. Several PA officials have brazenly stated that soon they, too, would engage in their own October 7 attack, and unlike Hamas, they are much closer to Israel's soft belly: Tel Aviv and the Sharon Valley.\n\nThe relationship between Hamas and the PLO has been marked by periods of cooperation, competition, and conflict. The PLO, founded in 1964, has long been recognized internationally as the \"sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\" Hamas, established in 1987 during the First Intifada, emerged as an Islamist alternative to the secular PLO. Unlike the PLO, which is making an effort to show it tolerates the Jewish State, Hamas rejected recognition of Israel from the start and advocated armed resistance. This fundamental difference has been a source of tension between the two terrorist organizations.\n\nIn 2006, Hamas won a majority in the Palestinian legislative elections, challenging the PLO's political dominance. This led to a power struggle culminating in a violent civil war in Gaza in 2007, with Hamas taking control of the strip while the PLO-affiliated Palestinian Authority retained control in Judea and Samaria.\n\nSince then, there have been several attempts at reconciliation between Hamas and the PLO/Fatah, with agreements signed in 2011, 2014, and 2017. However, implementation has been limited due to ongoing disagreements over power-sharing, security arrangements, and strategic vision regarding the right time to eliminate the \"Zionist entity.\"\n\nIn recent years, there have been signs of potential rapprochement, with both sides recognizing the need for unity to advance their \"national\" interests. However, significant ideological and practical differences remain, and a full reconciliation appears distant. The Hamas-PLO relationship continues to be a critical factor in PA Arab politics.\n\nCHINA AND ISRAEL\n\nIsrael and China have developed significant trade and military ties over the past few decades, with Israel becoming an important supplier of advanced military technology to China. Here's a revised overview of their relationship:\n\nIsrael has emerged as a major arms supplier to China, second only to Russia. Their exports include sophisticated military equipment like communications satellites. This relationship has been crucial for China, allowing it to access military technologies it cannot obtain from the United States, European Union, or Russia due to various restrictions.\n\nThe economic ties between the two nations have grown substantially. China is now Israel's third-largest global trading partner and its largest in East Asia. Trade volume expanded dramatically from $50 million in 1992 to over $10 billion by 2013. A significant portion of this trade involves advanced military equipment.\n\nDiplomatic relations have also strengthened. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited China in 2013, resulting in the establishment of five joint task forces focusing on high-tech, environmental protection, energy, agriculture, and financing. Netanyahu made another visit in 2017 to commemorate 25 years of diplomatic relations.\n\nHowever, Israel's military exports to China have occasionally caused tension with the United States. A notable example occurred in 2002 when the U.S. administration under President George W. Bush pressured Israel to cancel a planned sale of the Phalcon airborne early-warning radar system to China.", "source": {"uri": "jewishpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jewish Press -

The representatives of the factions jointly signed the Beijing declaration on ending division and strengthening national unity of Palestine. Can you share the details of the talks?\n\nMao Ning: At China's invitation, senior representatives of 14 Palestinian factions held reconciliation talks in Beijing from July 21 to 23. This morning, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended and addressed the closing session of the talks. The Palestinian factions signed the Beijing declaration on ending division and strengthening Palestinian national unity.\n\nThis is the first time that all 14 Palestinian factions gathered in Beijing and held talks for reconciliation. It brings precious hope for the Palestinian people who have suffered for too long. The declaration commends China's sincere effort to support the rights of the Palestinians, end division and bring about a unified position among the Palestinian factions. The declaration stresses the need to hold, under the auspices of the UN, an international conference with a full mandate and broad-based participation from the region and beyond. According to the declaration, parties believe that the Beijing talks demonstrated a positive and constructive spirit, and agree to realize national unity among all factions under the framework of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. The declaration reaffirms commitment to establishing an independent State of Palestine with Jerusalem as the capital city based on relevant UN resolutions and ensuring the integrity of Palestinian territory including the West Bank, Jerusalem and Gaza. Parties are ready to, in line with the consensus of Palestinian factions and the existing basic law of Palestine, establish an interim national reconciliation government, carry out reconstruction in Gaza and prepare and hold a general election as soon as possible in accordance with the adopted election laws. Parties stressed the need to take practical steps to form a new Palestinian national council in line with the adopted election laws. Parties unanimously agreed to activate the provisional Unified Leadership framework which will function institutionally, and jointly carry out political decision-making. Parties agreed to set up a collective mechanism to fully implement the provisions of the declaration and create a timetable for the implementation process.\n\nAs Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in his remarks, the most important consensus of the talks is to achieve reconciliation and unity among all 14 factions, the most central outcome is the reaffirmation of the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, the most outstanding highlight is the consensus on post-conflict governance in Gaza and forming an interim national reconciliation government, and the strongest aspiration is to realize true independent statehood of Palestine in accordance with relevant UN resolutions.\n\nIn his remarks, Foreign Minister Wang Yi put forward China's three-step initiative regarding the ongoing Gaza conflict. First step: achieving comprehensive, lasting and sustainable ceasefire in the Gaza Strip as soon as possible, and ensuring unimpeded access to humanitarian aid and rescue on the ground. Second step: making joint efforts toward post-conflict governance of Gaza under the principle of \"the Palestinians governing Palestine.\" Third step: making Palestine a full UN member state and beginning to implement the two-State solution. These three steps are interlocked and all of them are indispensable.\n\nChina and Palestine are each other's trusted brothers and partners. China looks forward to the day when Palestinian factions achieve internal reconciliation and, on that basis, realize national unity and independent statehood as early as possible. We will continue to work relentlessly to this end with the relevant parties.\n\nCCTV: You just announced Foreign Minister Wang Yi will attend the ASEAN Plus Foreign Ministers' Meetings. How does China view the current East Asian cooperation? What's China's expectation for the meetings?\n\nMao Ning: Despite the global economic slowdown and ongoing geopolitical conflicts, East Asia has been generally stable, and regional economic integration is making steady progress. To let this region remain an engine of development and champion of cooperation is a shared desire of people from countries across the region.\n\nChina hopes the upcoming ASEAN Plus Foreign Ministers' Meetings will help further build up consensus and prepare the political ground and the deliverables for the leaders' meetings on East Asian cooperation in October. We stand ready to work with other regional countries to promote the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and contribute to regional peace, stability, development, and prosperity; accelerate negotiations on the China-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement 3.0, galvanize high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, make the China-ASEAN Year of People-to-People Exchanges a success, and foster a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future; promote the high-quality implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, keep regional industrial and supply chains stable and unimpeded, expand cooperation in emerging industries, advance regional economic integration, and advocate a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization; firmly support ASEAN unity and ASEAN Community building, uphold an open and inclusive regional architecture with ASEAN at its center, promote an equal and orderly multipolar world, properly address hotspot and sensitive issues, and inject more stability and positive energy into the region.\n\nAFP: The US Pentagon yesterday released a report warning that the Arctic region faces more competition and increasing collaboration between China and Russia in the field of commerce and military. Did the Foreign Ministry notice this report and what's China's response?\n\nMao Ning: China is an important stakeholder in Arctic affairs and always follows the basic principles of respect, cooperation, win-win result and sustainability in engaging in Arctic affairs and enhancing cooperation with various parties. We are always committed to promoting peace, stability and sustainable development of the Arctic. The US misrepresented China's Arctic policy and pointed fingers at China's normal activities in the Arctic conducted in full compliance with international law. This is not conducive to peace, stability and cooperation in the Arctic. China firmly opposes it.\n\nTASS: On Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba's visit to China from July 23 to 26, what's the Foreign Ministry's expectations and comment regarding the visit? Has there been any positive change recently in Ukraine's stance on the Ukraine crisis and the prospects of the peaceful settlement of the conflict?\n\nMao Ning: During Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba's visit to China, Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi will have talks with him. The two foreign ministers will exchange views on implementing the common understandings of the two presidents, promoting China-Ukraine cooperation and issues of mutual concern.\n\nWhen it comes to the Ukraine crisis, China always believes that an early ceasefire and a political settlement is in the interest of all parties. China will continue to stand on the side of peace and dialogue and support the international community in building up more consensus and jointly looking for viable ways to achieve a political settlement of the crisis.\n\nCRI: We noted that Rwanda's National Electoral Commission released the final results of presidential elections, and President Paul Kagame has been reelected. What's China's comment on it and expectation for the future of China-Rwanda relations?\n\nMao Ning: President Xi Jinping has sent a congratulatory message to President Paul Kagame through the diplomatic channel on his reelection. We believe that under the leadership of President Kagame, Rwanda will make even greater achievements in national development and revitalization.\n\nChina always values its traditional friendship with Rwanda and stands ready to work with Rwanda to deepen bilateral exchanges and cooperation in various fields, elevate China-Rwanda relations, and deliver more for the two peoples.\n\nPhoenix TV: US State Department spokesperson, when responding to a question, said that the Taiwan region \"has been purchasing military equipment from the United States to the tune of billions of dollars, and the military equipment that they have purchased supports American manufacturing, industry, and technology. It has not been in any way charity from the United States.\" What's your comment?\n\nMao Ning: The US keeps stressing the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, while making tons and tons of money out of the pockets of people in Taiwan. Taiwan is China's Taiwan, not a chess piece for the US to interfere in China's internal affairs. US arms sales to Taiwan violate the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqu\u00e9s. China firmly opposes it.\n\nShenzhen TV: To follow up on the announcement of Foreign Minister Wang Yi's visit to Laos, could you share more details about the program and China's expectation for the visit?\n\nMao Ning: This year marks the 15th anniversary of China-Laos comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership and is the first year of implementing the new action plan on building a community with a shared future between the two countries, and Laos has assumed the rotating presidency of ASEAN, which all provide China and Laos with new opportunities to deepen bilateral cooperation in various fields. During the visit, Foreign Minister Wang Yi will meet with Lao leaders. He will have talks with Lao Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Saleumxay Kommasith and exchange views with him on implementing the common understandings of the top leaders of the two countries and parties, and on advancing exchanges and cooperation in various fields.\n\nChina and Laos are traditional friendly neighbors and the two countries have been at the forefront of advancing a community with a shared future. Under the strategic guidance of General Secretary and President Xi Jinping, and General Secretary and President Thongloun Sisoulith, the relations between the two parties and countries have scaled new heights. China looks forward to working with Laos through this visit to deepen the China-Laos community with a shared future, translate high-level common understandings into concrete outcomes of cooperation, deliver benefits to the two peoples, and make greater contribution to regional peace, stability and prosperity.\n\nCCTV: It's reported that the spokesperson of the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs said yesterday that the arrangement between China and the Philippines was concluded with the clear understanding that it will not prejudice the two sides' respective positions, China's statement regarding prior notification and on-site confirmation is inaccurate, and the Philippines will continue to assert its rights and jurisdiction in its maritime zones, and nonetheless, remains ready to implement the arrangement it reached with China. What's China's comment on that?\n\nMao Ning: Based on the principled position of China on dealing with the current situation at Ren'ai Jiao, China reached provisional arrangement with the Philippines on resupplying humanitarian necessities. This is an active effort China made to keep the situation under control. The Chinese side will continue to firmly defend China's sovereignty and rights and interests. We take note that the Philippine side said it's ready to implement the arrangement it reached with China. We hope the Philippines will keep its word. We call on the Philippines to not to backpedal, not to create problems, and not to do anything that would complicate the situation.\n\nXinhua News Agency: On July 22, the Preparatory Committee for the Eleventh Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) held its second session in Geneva, Switzerland. What's China's expectation for the session?\n\nMao Ning: The Preparatory Committee for the Eleventh Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT is holding its second session in Geneva. The treaty is the cornerstone of the international nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation regime, and the important pillar of the global governance system of security and development. As a party to the treaty, China stays firmly committed to the goals and purposes of the treaty, faithfully observes obligations under the treaty, and stands for advancing nuclear non-proliferation, nuclear disarmament and peaceful use of nuclear energy -- the three goals of the NPT -- in a comprehensive and balanced manner.\n\nThe Chinese delegation will take the building of a community with a shared future for mankind proposed by President Xi Jinping as the fundamental guidance, promote the common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security vision, and work with other parties to play an active and constructive role, strengthen the universality, authority and effectiveness of the NPT, and contribute to world peace, security, and development.\n\nDragon TV: To follow up on the second session of the Preparatory Committee for the Eleventh Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT, China submitted four working papers to the session. Can you brief us on that?\n\nMao Ning: With deterioration of the global strategic security environment and rising risks of nuclear conflict and war, China has actively advanced the Global Security Initiative, and, in line with the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, submitted four working papers to the session on the No-first-use of Nuclear Weapons Initiative, security assurances, nuclear arms control and the US-UK-Australia nuclear submarine cooperation. You can find the documents on our ministry's website.\n\nChina's core proposition in the documents is as follows. Nuclear weapon states need to earnestly respond to the concerns and requests of non-nuclear weapon states, and conclude a treaty or issue a political statement on no-first-use of nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapon states need to support the Conference on Disarmament to conclude an international legal instrument as soon as possible on not using or threatening to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or nuclear weapon-free-zones. All countries need to follow the principle of \"maintaining global strategic stability\" and \"undiminished security for all,\" and advance international nuclear disarmament under the step-by-step approach and promote cooperation on reducing nuclear risks. In the meantime, countries need to categorically oppose double standard in the field of nuclear non-proliferation and the act of putting geopolitical selfish interests above international nuclear non-proliferation regime.\n\nThese four working papers are China's proposal for making progress in NPT review, effectively strengthening the universality, authority and effectiveness of the NPT, and solving security challenges facing the world today. China hopes that the documents can receive active support from all sides and be included in the final document of the session to contribute to a better international security environment and lasting peace and common security of our world.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz",

Harris has raised more than $100 million since Sunday afternoon, and scored the backing of Democratic officials and political groups.\n\nTuesday's visit was scheduled before Biden ended his campaign, but took on new resonance as Harris prepared to take up the mantle of her party against Trump and looks to project calm and confidence after weeks of Democratic Party confusion over Biden's political future.\n\nThe visit comes a week after the Republican National Convention wrapped up in the city, and as Harris works to sharpen her message against the GOP nominee with just over 100 days until Election Day. Wisconsin is part of the Democrats' \"blue wall\" of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that is critical to their 2024 plans.\n\nThe vice president previewed the themes that will be prominent in her campaign against Trump on Monday during a stop at her campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, contrasting her time as a prosecutor with Trump's felony convictions -- \"I know Donald Trump's type,\" she said -- and casting herself as a defender of economic opportunity and abortion access.\n\nBiden passed that torch slowly, hanging on until the wheels finally came off\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- As the formulaic \"pass the torch\" drumbeat thumped on from lawmakers wanting him to quit the race, President Joe Biden maintained a brave face. Publicly, he vowed he was all in, until the day he got out.\n\nBut there were telling indications he was listening to that beat long before he ended his campaign for reelection. One sign was over a week ago, when Chuck Schumer visited his Delaware beach house as an emissary of gloom.\n\nThe Senate majority leader had spoken with Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and the House Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries, a few days earlier. He had heard from nearly every Democratic senator, pinging him over the last three weeks on his old-school flip phone.\n\nHe wasn't speaking for all of them, but for many.\n\nThink about what's bound to happen to Democrats in Congress, Schumer implored the president. Think about the generations-long impact of a Supreme Court with Donald Trump in the White House. Think about your legacy.\n\nBiden aims for more achievements despite the bane of lame-duck presidents: diminished relevance\n\nREHOBOTH BEACH, Del. (AP) -- President Joe Biden says he's \"determined to get as much done\" as he possibly can in his final six months in the White House as he tries to beat back a defining force that his lame-duck predecessors struggled to vanquish: diminished relevance.\n\nBiden hopes to keep the spigot flowing with hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funding from a series of major legislative wins early in his term -- signature policy victories that could be undone should Republican Donald Trump return to the White House.\n\nHe also badly wants Israel and Hamas to agree to his proposed three-phase cease-fire deal to bring home remaining Israeli hostages and potentially pave the way for an end to the nine-month-old war in Gaza. That would require no small measure of risk by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas leadership.\n\nBiden also will press to quickly fill federal judiciary vacancies -- currently there are 48 openings -- and make other federal agency appointments, but he will undoubtedly face pushback from Senate Republicans who want to keep Biden from notching any end-of-term wins.\n\nBiden, in short, is rallying his team to help him defy political gravity.\n\nHamas and Fatah sign declaration in Beijing on ending yearslong rift as war rages in Gaza\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed a declaration in Beijing on ending a yearslong rift, Chinese state media said Tuesday, taking a step toward potentially resolving the deep divide between the sides as the war in Gaza rages on.\n\nThe declaration by the two heavyweights of Palestinian politics -- and other smaller Palestinian groups -- to form a unity government for the Palestinian territories is the result of the latest in a series of talks meant to unite the sides.\n\nBut previous declarations have failed, including a similar deal in 2011, casting doubt over whether the China-sponsored negotiations might actually lead to a resolution. It also comes as Israel and Hamas are weighing an internationally backed cease-fire proposal that would wind down the nine-month war and free dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nStill, the future of Gaza is undecided, with Israel vehemently opposed to any role by Hamas in governing Gaza. It has also rejected calls from the United States for the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority to run Gaza after the war ends. The lack of a postwar vision for running the Gaza Strip has complicated negotiations over a cease-fire.\n\nSince the current war broke out in Gaza almost 10 months ago, Hamas officials have said that the party does not want to return to ruling Gaza as it did before the conflict, and the group has called for formation of a government of technocrats to be agreed upon by the various Palestinian factions, which would prepare the way for elections for both Gaza and the West Bank, with the intention of forming a unified government.\n\nIsraeli government quietly sends millions to unauthorized West Bank settler outposts\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli government has budgeted millions of dollars to protect small, unauthorized Jewish farms in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, underwriting tiny outposts meant to grow into full-fledged settlements, according to an anti-settlement monitoring group.\n\nDocuments uncovered by Peace Now illustrate how Israel's pro-settler government has quietly poured money into the unauthorized outposts, which are separate from its more than 100 officially recognized settlements. Some of those outposts have been linked to settler violence against Palestinians and are sanctioned by the U.S.\n\nPalestinians and the international community say all settlements are illegal or illegitimate and undermine hopes for a two-state solution.\n\nThe Ministry of Settlements and National Mission, which is headed by a far-right settler leader, confirmed it budgeted 75 million shekels ($20.5 million) last year for security equipment for \"young settlements\" -- the term it uses for unauthorized Jewish farms and outposts in the West Bank. The money was quietly authorized in December while the country's attention was focused on the war against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nPeace Now said the funds have been used for vehicles, drones, cameras, generators, electric gates, fences and new roads that reach some of the more remote farms.\n\nDeath toll in southern Ethiopia mudslides rises to at least 157 as search operations continue\n\nADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- At least 157 people were killed in mudslides in a remote part of Ethiopia that has been hit with heavy rainfall, many of them as they tried to rescue survivors of an earlier mudslide, local authorities said Tuesday.\n\nYoung children and pregnant women were among the victims of the mudslides in the Kencho Shacha Gozdi district of southern Ethiopia, said Dagmawi Ayele, a local administrator.\n\nThe death toll rose from 55 late Monday to 157 on Tuesday as search operations continued in the area, said Kassahun Abayneh, head of the Gofa Zone communications office. Gofa Zone is the administrative area where the mudslides occurred.\n\nMost of the victims were buried in a mudslide on Monday morning as rescue workers searched the steep terrain for survivors of another mudslide the previous day.\n\nAt least five people have been pulled alive from the mud, Ayele said.\n\nSecret Service director, grilled by lawmakers on the Trump assassination attempt, says 'we failed'\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle said Monday that her agency failed in its mission to protect former President Donald Trump, as lawmakers of both major political parties demanded during a highly contentious congressional hearing that she resign over security failures that allowed a gunman to scale a roof and open fire at a campaign rally.\n\nCheatle was berated for hours by Republicans and Democrats, repeatedly angering lawmakers by evading questions about the investigation during the first hearing over the July 13 assassination attempt. Cheatle called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades, and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\n\"The Secret Service's solemn mission is to protect our nation's leaders. On July 13th, we failed,\" she told lawmakers on the House Oversight and Accountability Committee.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally. Cheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nYet Cheatle remained defiant that she was the \"right person\" to lead the Secret Service, even as she said she takes full responsibility the security lapses. When Republican Rep. Nancy Mace suggested Cheatle begin drafting her resignation letter from the hearing room, Cheatle responded, \"No, thank you.\"\n\nBodycam video reveals chaotic scene of deputy fatally shooting Sonya Massey, who called 911 for help\n\nSPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Sonya Massey ducked and apologized to an Illinois sheriff's deputy seconds before he shot the Black woman three times in her home, with one fatal blow to the head, as seen in body camera video released Monday.\n\nAn Illinois grand jury indicted former Sangamon County Sheriff's Deputy Sean Grayson, 30, who is white, last week. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct.\n\nThe video confirmed prosecutors' earlier account of the tense moment when Grayson yelled from across a counter at Massey to set down a pot of hot water. He then threatened to shoot her, Massey ducked, briefly rose, and Grayson fired his pistol at her.\n\nAuthorities said Massey, 36, had called 911 earlier to report a suspected prowler. The video shows the two deputies responded just before 1 a.m. on July 6 at her home in Springfield, 200 miles (322 kilometers) southwest of Chicago. They first walked around the house and found a black SUV with broken windows in the driveway.\n\nIt took Massey three minutes to open the door after the deputies knocked, and she immediately said, \"Don't hurt me.\"\n\nBiles, Osaka and Phelps spoke up about mental health. Has anything changed for the Paris Olympics?\n\nLydia Jacoby was a breakout star in the pool for the United States at the last Summer Games, earning a gold medal in the 100-meter breaststroke and a relay silver. Part of what comes to mind from those heady days in Tokyo? \"People talking about post-Olympic depression,\" she said.\n\nShe was 17 at the time, and her initial response when other athletes brought up the topic was: \"Well, that doesn't apply to me.\"\n\n\"I essentially did not understand the topic of depression,\" she said. \"It wasn't until after the Games that I was like, 'Oh. ... OK. Yeah, I'm feeling this a little.'\"\n\nJacoby, who didn't qualify for the 2024 Olympics, is now fully aware of the phenomenon, went through it, moved past it and discusses it casually, all of which points to the way things have changed in just a few years when it comes to mental health.\n\nAs the Paris Games open on Friday, followed by the Paralympics beginning Aug. 28, athletes have more access than ever to resources in that once-taboo realm and sound more willing than ever to use them. That seems particularly significant given that Jessica Bartley, the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee's senior director of psychological services, says about half of the country's athletes at the past two Olympiads were flagged for at least one of the following: anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, eating disorders, substance use or abuse.\n\nAs doctors leave Puerto Rico in droves, a rapper tries to fill the gaps\n\nSAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- On a recent morning in an Afro-Caribbean community in northeast Puerto Rico, Dr. Pedro Juan V\u00e1zquez went door-to-door as part of his medical rounds. He greeted the elderly residents the town with a cheerful \"Good afternoon!\" and a smile and casually asked if they'd like their vitals taken.\n\nMany were surprised at being approached with an offer of medical care. A man in a gray tank top opened his screen door and said, \"Of course,\" and took a seat on his porch to be checked out.\n\nThough a physician, V\u00e1zquez is better known in Puerto Rico as a rapper who uses the stage name PJ Sin Suela.\n\nThe 34-year-old is trying to fulfill his passion for music while helping those in need -- and raise awareness about a health crisis on the island of 3.2 million residents. The U.S. territory is facing power outages as well as a shortage of medical professionals, with many having fled to the U.S. mainland for better wages.\n\nPuerto Rico lost over 8,600 doctors out of nearly 18,800 in just over a decade, according to a 2023 report by the think tank The Center for a New Economy. The problem is expected to grow more dire in coming years.", "source": {"uri": "idahostatejournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Idaho State Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The column clarifies emerging issues and better defines the news agenda, offering a Chinese perspective on the latest global events.\n\nAt China's mediation, a total of 14 Palestine factions including the leaders of rival groups Fatah and Hamas signed the Beijing Declaration on Tuesday.\n\nHaving been at loggerheads for years, the factions have agreed to end their divisions and strengthen Palestinian unity. With the death toll still growing in Gaza, the internal reconciliation of Palestine is vital for a postwar future and the realization of a \"two-state solution,\" thus paving the way for lasting peace in the region.\n\nFor decades, the Middle East has been dubbed as a \"powder keg\" as a result of complex religious, ethnic, and territorial disputes, as well as interventions by external forces. Against this backdrop, the China-mediated Declaration has demonstrated the country's responsibility as a major power and its determination for global peace and stability.\n\nSaudi Arabia's Al Arabiya TV reported China's diplomatic move as \"remarkable\" and \"admirable.\" The dialogue in Beijing shows that China's role as a major power on the global arena has been recognized by Palestinian factions, Lebanon's Elnashra news website commented.\n\nIn sharp contrast to certain Western powers adept at using the Israel-Palestine conflict as a tool for geopolitical gains in the Middle East, China stands on the side of peace and human conscience, prioritizing people's lives over geopolitical calculations. To this end, the Chinese government has been actively creating platforms and a positive environment for dialogues and consultations among factions.\n\nThis is not the first time that Beijing has offered opportunities for Palestinian factions to talk for reconciliation. In April, Fatah and Hamas representatives - at the invitation of China - came to Beijing and held in-depth and candid talks on advancing intra-Palestine reconciliation. Although no agreement was reached back then, the dialogue paved the way for Tuesday's Beijing Declaration.\n\n\"China can make a significant contribution to the peace process, given its vision for resolving conflicts in the world, based on finding fair solutions,\" Samer Khair Ahmed, a Jordanian writer and expert on Arab-China relations said, adding that \"the Palestinian issue needs this Chinese contribution, which achieves balance and opens up real opportunities for establishing peace.\"\n\nJust as China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi stressed, on the question of Palestine, China stands on the side of peace, justice, international law, shared aspirations of the majority of countries in the world, and human conscience.\n\nThis is why China is trusted and its diplomatic mediation model has repeatedly turned out to be effective in addressing faraway conflicts. Last year, China brokered a d\u00e9tente between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which eventually resulted in the two previous hostile powers' decision to restore diplomatic relations.", "source": {"uri": "news.cgtn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "news.cgtn.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "first_voice@news.cgtn.com", "name": "First Voice", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-state solution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fatah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Arabiya", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Arabiya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Yi_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wang Yi (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_peace_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D\u00e9tente", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "D\u00e9tente"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://news.cgtn.com/news/2024-07-23/Why-China-s-mediation-model-is-trusted-1vtl4wu85s4/img/e9ed1fe59fb34026aceb03bb5af5a1e1/e9ed1fe59fb34026aceb03bb5af5a1e1-1280.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749919", "eventUri": "eng-9749919", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

The October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel -- led by the Iran-backed Sunni Islamist group Hamas (a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization) -- and subsequent conflict in Gaza have raised new challenges for U.S. policy in the region.\n\nPalestinian issues that had arguably faded as a priority since the 2010s for the United States and many Arab states have returned to the forefront. Post-conflict governance in Gaza is one crucial question, along with potentially interrelated developments regarding political outcomes in the West Bank, the status of Jerusalem, risks of a broader regional war with Iran and its allies, and Israel's efforts to improve its security and relations with Arab states.\n\nSuccessive U.S. Presidents and Congresses have helped shape developments on Palestinian issues, including through humanitarian, economic, and non-lethal security assistance. Since the mid-1990s, U.S. officials have sought to actively facilitate a negotiated Israeli-Palestinian peace. Most U.S. Administrations since the early 2000s have voiced support for an eventual independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, with a capital in East Jerusalem (and then-President Trump's 2020 plan arguably allowed for a variation on the idea).\n\nThe ongoing conflict has reportedly resulted in more than 1,500 Israeli and (according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry in Gaza) 38,000 Palestinian deaths, with some 120 hostages reportedly held by Hamas or other militants in Gaza. As Israel seeks to recover hostages and eliminateHamas's military and governing capabilities, life has been upended for Gaza's citizens -- with around 90% displaced, and most facing threats from the fighting, overcrowding, and acute shortages of food, water, and medical care. While U.S. officials have provided material support for Israel'soperations against Hamas, they have pushed for a cease-fire and hostage release, and urged Israel to minimize threats to civilians in Gaza and increase humanitarian access.\n\nThe duration and intensity of Israeli military operations and the issue of who manages Gaza's security and governance remain open questions. U.S. officials support the idea of a revamped Palestinian Authority (PA) -- which currently exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank -- returning to power in Gaza, despite public opposition from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and PA insistence that any return be linked with progress toward a two-state solution. Hamas forcibly seized Gaza from the PA in 2007.\n\nAbout 3 million Palestinians live in the West Bank, plus an estimated 2.1 million in Gaza. Around 98% are Sunni Muslim, with a small Christian minority. Another estimated 1.9 million Palestinians live in Israel as citizens. Of the Palestinians living in the Middle East, about 5.9 million are registered refugees (in the West Bank, Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria) whose claims to land in present-day Israel constitute a major issue of Israeli-Palestinian dispute. The U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) -- funded mostly by voluntary contributions from the United States and other countries -- is mandated by the U.N. General Assembly to provide protection and services to these registered refugees.\n\nPalestinian domestic politics are dominated by two factions. Fatah, a secular Arab nationalist faction, is the driving force within the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which represents Palestinians internationally. Hamas has not accepted PLO recognition of Israel and constitutes the main opposition to Fatah. The United States and other Western countries have generally sought to bolster the Fatah-led PA vis-\u00e0-vis Hamas and support PA-Israel cooperation. The economy in the West Bank faces challenges related to unrest and violence, as well as considerable Israeli movement, access, and land use restrictions.\n\n1993-1995: Israel-PLO mutual recognition, and their establishment of the PA with limited self-rule (subject to overall Israeli control) in the Gaza Strip and specified areas of the West Bank.\n\n2000-2005: Second Palestinian intifada affects prospects for Israeli-Palestinian peace, and leads to tightened Israeli security in the West Bank.\n\n2004-2005: PLO Chairman/PA President Yasser Arafat dies; Mahmoud Abbas succeeds him.\n\nS005: Israel unilaterally disengages from Gaza, but remains in control of airspace and land/maritime access points.\n\n2006: Hamas wins majority in Palestinian Legislative Council and leads new PA cabinet; Israel, United States, and European Union confine relations to PA President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\n2007: West Bank-Gaza split: Hamas seizes control of Gaza Strip; Abbas reorganizes PA cabinet to lead West Bank; Israel and Egypt establish tight controls on goods and people transiting Gaza; this remains the status quo to date.\n\n2007 - Present: Various rounds of U.S.-brokered Israeli- Palestinian peace negotiations (the last in 2013-2014) end unsuccessfully; PLO/PA increases efforts to gain membership in or support from international organizations.\n\n2017: Trump Administration recognizes Jerusalem as Israel's capital (without specifying the boundaries of Israeli sovereignty).\n\n2022 - Present: Another round of Israel-West Bank violence -- which increased after the October 2023 outbreak of Israel-Hamas war -- is accompanied by rising (and partly Iran- backed) Palestinian militancy, Jewish ultra- nationalist influence in the Israeli government, and Israeli settler attacks on Palestinians.\n\n2023 - Present: Hamas-led attacks in October 2023 trigger Israeli counteroffensive. PLO/PA supports cases against Israel in international courts and Israel increases economic restrictions on the PA while threatening others.\n\nSince the Hamas victory in 2006 PA legislative elections, the PA has ruled by presidential decree, and has drawn some international criticism for alleged violations of the rule of law and civil liberties. Given the West Bank-Gaza split in 2007, it is unclear if elections will take place again. While PA President Mahmoud Abbas did not directly denounce the October 7 attacks, he has been cited as saying that he rejects the killing or abusing of civilians \"on both sides,\" and has blamed Hamas for providing Israel with \"pretexts\" for war. Polls show a spike in West Bank Palestinian support for Hamas that may stem from Hamas's military actions, prisoner releases it has secured, and civilian suffering in Gaza. A new PA government took office in March 2024, but Abbas retains ultimate authority.\n\nAbbas's age (b. 1935) has contributed to speculation about leadership succession in the PLO and PA. Top advisers Hussein al Sheikh (on political affairs) and Majid Faraj (on security) have major profiles internationally, but limited domestic popular support. Marwan Barghouti attracts significant popular support; he has been imprisoned by Israel since 2002. Muhammad Dahlan, who was expelled from Fatah in 2011, was a former PA security chief in Gaza and enjoys support from some Arab states.\n\nAmid ongoing conflict, Hamas's future in Gaza is unclear. Hamas has controlled Gaza through its security forces and obtained resources from smuggling, informal \"taxes,\" and reported external assistance from Iran and private entities operating from some other regional countries. Yahya Sinwar has been Hamas's leader for Gaza since 2017, and was a driving force behind the October 2023 attacks in Israel. Hamas also maintains a presence in the West Bank. Qatar-based Ismail Haniyeh is the leader of the political bureau that conducts Hamas's worldwide dealings.\n\nBefore the ongoing conflict, Hamas engaged in major escalations with Israel in 2008-2009, 2012, 2014, and 2021. Hamas also constructed a vast network of tunnels -- some under civilian areas -- that apparently pose major challenges to dislodging it. In the previous conflicts and the present one, Hamas and other Gaza-based militants launched rockets toward Israeli population centers, and Israeli military strikes largely decimated Gaza's infrastructure. Before October 2023, with key actors unsure of how to allow assistance for Gazans without bolstering Hamas's capabilities, Israel permitted Qatar to provide certain types of funding to Gaza. Some observers have asserted that Israeli officials accepted the status quo with Hamas ruling Gaza, partly to avoid Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations.\n\nBiden Administration officials publicly support a pathway toward a two-state solution, and oppose unilateral Israeli or Palestinian actions that incite violence or could obstruct peace efforts -- including Israeli settlement building and Palestinian initiatives in international fora. Regarding U.S. bilateral aid (see Figure 1), via the Taylor Force Act (Div. S, Title X of P.L. 115-141) Congress has prohibited most Economic Support Fund (ESF) aid directly benefitting the PA unless the PLO/PA were to curtail domestically popular payments that arguably incentivize acts of terror.\n\nThe Biden Administration plans to allocate $1 billion in enacted FY2024 supplemental humanitarian aid for Gaza, but Congress has placed prohibitions on U.S. funding for UNRWA until March 25, 2025, after allegations surfaced in January 2024 that some UNRWA staff may have participated in the October 2023 attacks.\n\nThe U.S. proposal to have a revamped PA extend its rule into Gaza faces various challenges, including:\n\n* Hamas's deep roots and long-standing presence in Gaza. * Israeli leaders' potential entrenchment of forces in Gaza and current resistance to a future Palestinian state.\n\n* Questions about possible PA leadership reform.\n\n* Israeli actions that have arguably threatened West Bank stability -- including settler violence against Palestinians and a reduction in PA revenues. The Administration has imposed sanctions on some extremist Israeli actors, and has opposed Israeli measures harming PA finances.", "source": {"uri": "eurasiareview.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Yehezkeli addressed the agreement between the terrorist organizations Hamas and Fatah and spoke about China's increasing involvement in the region, particularly its central role in mediating efforts between the two organizations.\n\nYehezkeli began, \"The Chinese, who have maintained a strict stance throughout the war, are looking to establish dominance here. Such events have occurred throughout Palestinian history. They want to make a connection before one of the sides is erased, or a reality emerges that will not allow this.\"\n\nHe further added, \"Hamas, which is on the verge of being wiped out, is somehow being thrown a lifeline and being told, 'Before you are erased, concede and let Mahmoud Abbas take control of the Strip.' To Abbas, they are saying, 'Don't wait for Hamas to be wiped out. Join a unity government.' However, in terms of the agreement, it is very limited. We've seen such things before.\"\n\nThe bad blood between Hamas and Fatah\n\nYehezkeli continued, \"The bad blood between Fatah and Hamas is no simple matter. Abbas already understands that he is going to be the owner of the Strip in all respects. This agreement is being woven with the Chinese to act as a lifeline for Hamas. The US is not involved here.\"\n\n\"It is possible that Hamas is now on its knees, in such a terrible and difficult state, nearing its end, so it is ready to accept any agreement. There is no chance because these factions quarrel among themselves. They are essentially enemies, and enemies do not come together because of such interests. If Abbas waits, he will receive the Strip even without a temporary government,\" Yehezkeli emphasized.\n\nHe then explained the reasoning behind Fatah's outreach.\n\n\"He needs to wait, and Hamas will disappear,\" Yehezkeli said. \"He is reaching out to Hamas. Why? Because a government will come at a price in Judea and Samaria. I doubt this will come to fruition. It's just to appease the Chinese. The Chinese have proven they want to intervene in recent years.\"\n\nDespite this, Yehezkeli expressed skepticism about whether cooperation between the sides would ultimately materialize.\n\n\"There is no weight to this. A Fatah member asked, 'What is our interest in getting into this? Why would we give Hamas a lifeline?' Giving Hamas a government with Mahmoud Abbas in the Strip will not happen. They see Abbas as an occupier. The Chinese see an opening and are stepping in, and they comply because Hamas is under pressure and needs help. There is no chance this will happen because Abbas wants to see Hamas erased.

The first possibility appears to be more likely.\n\nIt seems that Biden does not want the American people to be aware that most Palestinians in the West Bank are enthusiastic supporters of Hamas, as that would discourage them from endorsing his idea of creating a Palestinian state there.\n\nThe broad support Hamas enjoys among the Palestinians, including those who live in the West Bank, means that a Palestinian state would be ruled by the same terrorists who masterminded and carried out the October 7 atrocities against Israelis.\n\nBiden appears to be convinced that hiding the fact that most Palestinian people support Hamas from the American people will make it easier for him to promote the insane idea of pressuring Israel to accept a state that is controlled by Hamas and other Iran proxies, such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah.\n\nHamas is not only deeply committed to refusing Israel's right to exist, it has also openly announced that it will use a Palestinian state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Jerusalem as a springboard to eliminate Israel and murder as many Jews as possible. Senior Hamas official Ghazi Hamad has threatened that his group will carry out more October 7-style attacks on Israel:\n\n\"The Al-Aqsa Flood [the name Hamas gave to the October 7 attack] is just the first time, and there will be a second, third, and fourth.... Israel is a country that has no place on our land. We must remove that country because it constitutes a security, military, and political catastrophe to the Arab and Islamic nation, and must be finished. We are not ashamed to say this, with full force.\"\n\nBiden's claim that Hamas is \"not popular\" among the Palestinians in the West Bank actually contradicts analysis by US intelligence agencies showing that Hamas's popularity has significantly grown after the terrorist group's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which resulted in the murder of 1,200 Israelis and the wounding of thousands of others. In addition, hundreds of Israelis were raped, tortured, burned alive and kidnapped to the Gaza Strip by the Hamas terrorists and thousands of \"ordinary\" Palestinians who rushed into Israel to participate in the atrocities.\n\nNow, especially in the West Bank, Hamas is increasingly \"viewed as the one group actually doing something about Israeli occupation,\" said Jonathan Panikoff, a former US intelligence official specializing in the Middle East.\n\nIn December 2023, CNN reported:\n\n\"A flurry of new analysis by US intelligence agencies has warned that Hamas' credibility and influence has grown dramatically in the two months since the October 7 terror attack...\n\n\"Before October 7, a senior [Biden] administration official said, 'Hamas [was] not a wildly popular organization. Today it's more popular.'\"\n\nA poll conducted by the Arab World for Research & Development (AWRAD) between October 31 and November 7, 2023 found that strong support for the Hamas-led attack on Israel was much higher among Palestinians in the West Bank at 68%, compared to the Gaza Strip at 47%.\n\nSince the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war, the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PSR) has also conducted a number of polls indicating strong support for Hamas among the Palestinians, particularly those residing in the West Bank.\n\nThe latest poll, released on July 10, 2024, showed that since the October 7 attack, satisfaction among the Palestinians in the West Bank with the \"performance\" of Hamas murderers and rapists has risen to 82%.\n\nHamas arch-terrorist Yahya Sinwar, one of the masterminds of the October 7 massacres, enjoys the support of 76% of the Palestinians in the West Bank compared to 50% in the Gaza Strip, where he lives, according to the PSR poll.\n\nWhen asked who the public would prefer to control the Gaza Strip after the current war, 71% of Palestinians in the West Bank chose Hamas, compared to 46% in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn March 2024, PSR published the findings of another poll that showed that a majority of Palestinians in the West Bank (64%) support Hamas and would like to see the terrorist group continue ruling the Gaza Strip after the war. The poll also found that 75% of Palestinians in the West Bank are satisfied with the performance of Hamas.\n\nBiden needs to be reminded that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has long refused to hold general elections for the wholly justified fear that Hamas would win in a landslide. In 2021, Abbas called off planned elections for the presidency and parliament after reaching the conclusion that his fractured and corruption-riddled Fatah faction would be defeated by Hamas.\n\nThe Biden administration also needs to be reminded of the countless demonstrations that have taken place in the West Bank over the past few years in support of Hamas and its leaders. Two days after the October 7 massacres, hundreds of Palestinians in Ramallah, the de facto capital of the Palestinians in the West Bank, took to the streets to chant slogans in support of another Hamas arch-terrorist, Mohammed Deif.\n\nFurther evidence that Hamas has always been popular among the Palestinians in the West Bank: the terrorist group's victory in elections for student councils at major universities there. In 2022, Hamas-affiliated students won the vote at Birzeit University. A year later, Hamas supporters won a majority of votes in the elections at An-Najah University, the largest academic institution in the West Bank.\n\nEvery Palestinian child knows that Hamas would easily win if elections were held today for the Palestinian presidency and parliament. The reason Hamas has such high popularity among Palestinians is because it seeks to destroy Israel though jihad (holy war).\n\nHamas enjoys immense popularity among the Palestinians because it has been waging terrorist attacks against Israel and Jews since its founding more than 35 years ago.\n\nWith respect, President Biden, it was after its members murdered, sexually assaulted, tortured, and abducted hundreds of Israelis on October 7, that Hamas became even more popular among the Palestinians.\n\nIt is time for Biden and his administration to come clean with the American people about the Palestinians: the majority of them favor destroying Israel and murdering Jews.", "source": {"uri": "jewishpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jewish Press - JewishPress.com"}, "authors":

Gaza is an inseparable and important part of Palestine, and starting post-war reconstruction as soon as possible has become an urgent issue in the next stage.

A number of European countries, including Spain, Ireland, and Norway, decided to officially recognize the Palestinian state, partly satisfying the demands of demonstrators and showing that the authorities are listening to public opinion.\n\nSome countries have taken a tougher stance on Israel's actions. In December 2023, South Africa filed a lawsuit against Israel at the International Court of Justice of the UN for a possible violation of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. On January 26 of this year, the court ruled that the Jewish state must take all necessary measures to prevent genocide in the Palestinian enclave. Iran, Turkey, Indonesia, Algeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, several Latin American countries, and others have taken a firm pro-Palestinian stance, demanding an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of armed forces from Gaza.\n\nMost regional and global players are still striving to resolve the conflict, but so far, no visible results have been observed. Russia, as part of the Middle East Quartet on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict resolution, had repeatedly called for negotiations and a settlement based on UN Security Council resolutions even before the events of October 7. Moscow still declares that peace is only possible through establishing political dialogue and creating a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders. Russia has also repeatedly held high-level meetings between Hamas and Fatah, the two main Palestinian political parties. A unified political representation of the Palestinian people is necessary to formulate a main position and represent it in negotiations with Israel, but all Russian initiatives have often been blocked by the US and the EU, who are also part of the Middle East Quartet.\n\nChina, in its quest to cement its status as a global player, intervenes diplomatically in international and regional conflicts, particularly noticeable in the Middle East. In 2023, Beijing facilitated a landmark agreement to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran. This effort underscores China's growing interest in playing a mediatory role in protracted and complex disputes, such as the Palestinian issue.\n\nThe 'One Belt, One Road' initiative encompasses Middle Eastern countries where stability is critically important for the success of strategies aimed at creating new trade corridors and investment flows. Resolving the Palestinian issue would ensure predictability and security necessary for protecting and attracting Chinese investments.\n\nChina's peace plan for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, proposed last November, marks a significant shift in its foreign policy by aiming to establish two independent states as a resolution to this enduring conflict. This proposal is an integral part of Beijing's broader vision to play a constructive role in global geopolitical issues, leveraging its growing influence.\n\nThe Chinese peace initiative is structured around several foundational principles. First, it promotes mutual recognition, encouraging both Israel and Palestine to acknowledge each other's sovereignty and independent status. This acknowledgment is vital for affirming their right to exist and coexist peacefully. The plan also supports returning to the 1967 borders, with adjustments through mutually agreed land swaps to accommodate the current realities and needs of both sides.\n\nSecurity is another critical component of the plan. It includes robust security guarantees for both states to address Israel's concerns about safety and to provide mechanisms that ensure Palestine can maintain order within its borders and prevent acts of aggression. This balanced approach aims to foster a durable peace by addressing the core concerns of both parties, setting a foundation for future stability and cooperation in the region.\n\nIn January of this year, China, in collaboration with the Arab League, initiated the idea of organizing a major peace conference aimed at stabilizing the situation in Gaza, affirming Beijing's serious intentions. Next week, China will host representatives from Hamas and Fatah for negotiations, highlighting Beijing's active role in attempting to normalize relations between key Palestinian factions and contributing to the overall peace process.\n\nThese efforts by China not only highlight its global ambitions but also advance its economic interests in the Middle East, strengthening Beijing's position on the international stage. However, despite progress in the Palestinian issue, current initiatives may face challenges due to cooling relations with Israel and strengthening ties between the Jewish state and other strategic partners, such as India. These factors introduce uncertainty into the dialogue and may complicate the achievement of long-term peace.\n\nThe administration of US President Joe Biden is actively involved in efforts to resolve the long-standing conflict. Despite strong strategic and military ties with Israel, the US has opposed a ground operation by Israel in Gaza, pressuring Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to exercise restraint and seek peaceful solutions. This is not surprising, as Washington does not need additional tension in the Middle East while it is actively confronting Russia, fueling the conflict in Ukraine, and containing China. The US may lack the resources for another \"big war\" to defend Israel.\n\nTherefore, at the onset of the conflict's escalation, the US, along with Egypt and Qatar, took steps toward de-escalation. However, as history shows, even years of effort have not led to a stable ceasefire. At the beginning of this month, it was announced that a preliminary agreement had been reached between Israel and Hamas, including a ceasefire and a hostage exchange. President Biden, noting this on social media, emphasized that, despite the agreements reached, there is still much work to be done.\n\nThe Biden administration has proposed a comprehensive plan aimed at gradually resolving the conflict. The first phase of the plan includes establishing a ceasefire, an initial exchange of hostages, increasing the volume of humanitarian aid, and starting negotiations for a complete cessation of hostilities. The second phase involves the withdrawal of Israeli military forces from Gaza and the release of the remaining hostages by Palestinian groups. The third phase is focused on initiating projects to rebuild Gaza with the support of the international community, which includes investments in infrastructure and vital institutions of the region.\n\nImplementing this ambitious plan will require significant efforts and careful coordination at the international level. The success of the agreement between Israel and Hamas could be an important step toward long-term peace, but it requires the support of all interested parties, including active participation by regional powers and international organizations.\n\nThe US, while maintaining its role as a committed ally of Israel and continuing to provide military support, faces the need to balance strategic interests with the desire for a peaceful resolution of the conflict. This complex balance requires Washington to continue seeking ways to stabilize the region, reduce tensions, and support the peace dialogue process. However, against the backdrop of the Biden administration's \"cool\" relations with Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister's unwillingness to cater to Washington's dictates, and a fierce election race in the States themselves, the real possibilities for the US to facilitate peace in Gaza are approaching zero.\n\nThe conflict in Gaza continues to deepen despite international efforts to resolve it. Recently, on July 13, the Palestinian Ministry of Health reported the tragic consequences of an Israeli attack in the Al-Mawasi area of Khan Yunis, where 71 people were killed and 289 were injured. The attack was allegedly targeting Muhammad Deif, the leader of Hamas' military wing, although his elimination has not been confirmed.\n\nDecades of conflict have led to radicalization on both the Israeli and Palestinian sides. Relations between Israel and Hamas, which governs Gaza, are complicated by deep political disagreements: Israel considers Hamas a terrorist organization, while Hamas does not recognize the legitimacy of Israel. These fundamental differences create significant obstacles to peaceful dialogue, exacerbated by security issues, rocket fire, and the Israeli blockade of Gaza, which causes serious humanitarian problems and international condemnation.\n\nAdditionally, the sides' views on a long-term political solution to the conflict radically diverge. Israel demands security guarantees, while Hamas insists on ending the Israeli occupation and recognizing Palestinian rights. These conflicting positions complicate the search for compromises.\n\nThe situation is further complicated by the hardline policy of Netanyahu's government, which aims to completely destroy Hamas. Despite prolonged military action, Hamas has not been fully eliminated, and support for its ideology is growing among Palestinians, especially in the West Bank, traditionally considered a Fatah stronghold.\n\nAn internal political crisis in Israel, exacerbated by attempts at judicial reform and mass protests against the government before the conflict began, also adds tension. The economic situation, weakened by the pandemic and worsened by the conflict, has led to the threat of thousands of businesses closing.\n\nThese circumstances lead to accusations against Netanyahu that he does not aim to end the conflict, as it could lead to his resignation and the activation of legal investigations against him. It is possible that the conflict will continue until the potential return of Donald Trump to the White House, and all current attempts at resolution may prove futile.\n\nBut the problem is not only with the Israeli authorities. The conflict between Hamas and Fatah is one of the key internal factors complicating the process of resolving the Palestinian issue. These two main Palestinian factions have different ideological roots, political platforms, and strategies regarding Israel, which significantly affect the political landscape of Palestine.\n\nFatah, a traditionally moderate and secular organization founded by Yasser Arafat in 1959, has long dominated the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Fatah focuses on negotiations and the political process as a means to achieve Palestinian statehood and recognition.\n\nOn the other hand, Hamas, which emerged in the late 1980s during the First Intifada, is an Islamist group that aims to liberate Palestine from Israeli occupation through armed resistance and social work among the population. Hamas believes that ceasing military action against Israel is a betrayal of the Palestinian cause.\n\nRelations between Hamas and Fatah are complicated by periodic outbreaks of violence. The most vivid manifestation of this was the bloody confrontation in 2007 when Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip as a result of an armed conflict, while Fatah retained power on the West Bank of the Jordan River. This division has deepened the geographical and political fragmentation of the Palestinian territories, complicating efforts for national unity.\n\nThe division between Hamas and Fatah and the lack of a unified Palestinian national strategy seriously hinder negotiations with Israel. The international community, including countries supporting the peace process, often has to choose whom to conduct dialogue with, creating additional contradictions and mistrust.\n\nHamas, controlling Gaza, rejects current peace initiatives as too conciliatory, while Fatah, more open to dialogue, faces criticism from its supporters for being willing to compromise, which can be perceived as betraying Palestinian interests.\n\nTo achieve sustainable peace, internal reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah is necessary, requiring significant efforts from both sides and support from the international community. Only by forming a united Palestinian front can a compromise be reached that satisfies the basic demands of all parties and leads to long-term peaceful resolution.\n\nThus, it is possible that the activities of global mediators may lead to a ceasefire in Gaza, although the likelihood of such an outcome at this stage is extremely low. For a sustainable and final resolution of the Middle East conflict, primarily, the consolidation of the Palestinians and Israelis themselves is necessary with the intention to end the years-long war and coexist in harmony.", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

A number of European countries, including Spain, Ireland, and Norway, decided to officially recognize the Palestinian state, partly satisfying the demands of demonstrators and showing that the authorities are listening to public opinion.\n\nSome countries have taken a tougher stance on Israel's actions. In December 2023, South Africa filed a lawsuit against Israel at the International Court of Justice of the UN for a possible violation of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. On January 26 of this year, the court ruled that the Jewish state must take all necessary measures to prevent genocide in the Palestinian enclave. Iran, Turkey, Indonesia, Algeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, several Latin American countries, and others have taken a firm pro-Palestinian stance, demanding an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of armed forces from Gaza.\n\nMost regional and global players are still striving to resolve the conflict, but so far, no visible results have been observed. Russia, as part of the Middle East Quartet on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict resolution, had repeatedly called for negotiations and a settlement based on UN Security Council resolutions even before the events of October 7. Moscow still declares that peace is only possible through establishing political dialogue and creating a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders. Russia has also repeatedly held high-level meetings between Hamas and Fatah, the two main Palestinian political parties. A unified political representation of the Palestinian people is necessary to formulate a main position and represent it in negotiations with Israel, but all Russian initiatives have often been blocked by the US and the EU, who are also part of the Middle East Quartet.\n\nChina, in its quest to cement its status as a global player, intervenes diplomatically in international and regional conflicts, particularly noticeable in the Middle East. In 2023, Beijing facilitated a landmark agreement to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran. This effort underscores China's growing interest in playing a mediatory role in protracted and complex disputes, such as the Palestinian issue.\n\nThe 'One Belt, One Road' initiative encompasses Middle Eastern countries where stability is critically important for the success of strategies aimed at creating new trade corridors and investment flows. Resolving the Palestinian issue would ensure predictability and security necessary for protecting and attracting Chinese investments.\n\nChina's peace plan for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, proposed last November, marks a significant shift in its foreign policy by aiming to establish two independent states as a resolution to this enduring conflict. This proposal is an integral part of Beijing's broader vision to play a constructive role in global geopolitical issues, leveraging its growing influence.\n\nThe Chinese peace initiative is structured around several foundational principles. First, it promotes mutual recognition, encouraging both Israel and Palestine to acknowledge each other's sovereignty and independent status. This acknowledgment is vital for affirming their right to exist and coexist peacefully. The plan also supports returning to the 1967 borders, with adjustments through mutually agreed land swaps to accommodate the current realities and needs of both sides.\n\nSecurity is another critical component of the plan. It includes robust security guarantees for both states to address Israel's concerns about safety and to provide mechanisms that ensure Palestine can maintain order within its borders and prevent acts of aggression. This balanced approach aims to foster a durable peace by addressing the core concerns of both parties, setting a foundation for future stability and cooperation in the region.\n\nIn January of this year, China, in collaboration with the Arab League, initiated the idea of organizing a major peace conference aimed at stabilizing the situation in Gaza, affirming Beijing's serious intentions. Next week, China will host representatives from Hamas and Fatah for negotiations, highlighting Beijing's active role in attempting to normalize relations between key Palestinian factions and contributing to the overall peace process.\n\nThese efforts by China not only highlight its global ambitions but also advance its economic interests in the Middle East, strengthening Beijing's position on the international stage. However, despite progress in the Palestinian issue, current initiatives may face challenges due to cooling relations with Israel and strengthening ties between the Jewish state and other strategic partners, such as India. These factors introduce uncertainty into the dialogue and may complicate the achievement of long-term peace.\n\nThe administration of US President Joe Biden is actively involved in efforts to resolve the long-standing conflict. Despite strong strategic and military ties with Israel, the US has opposed a ground operation by Israel in Gaza, pressuring Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to exercise restraint and seek peaceful solutions. This is not surprising, as Washington does not need additional tension in the Middle East while it is actively confronting Russia, fueling the conflict in Ukraine, and containing China. The US may lack the resources for another \"big war\" to defend Israel.\n\nTherefore, at the onset of the conflict's escalation, the US, along with Egypt and Qatar, took steps toward de-escalation. However, as history shows, even years of effort have not led to a stable ceasefire. At the beginning of this month, it was announced that a preliminary agreement had been reached between Israel and Hamas, including a ceasefire and a hostage exchange. President Biden, noting this on social media, emphasized that, despite the agreements reached, there is still much work to be done.\n\nThe Biden administration has proposed a comprehensive plan aimed at gradually resolving the conflict. The first phase of the plan includes establishing a ceasefire, an initial exchange of hostages, increasing the volume of humanitarian aid, and starting negotiations for a complete cessation of hostilities. The second phase involves the withdrawal of Israeli military forces from Gaza and the release of the remaining hostages by Palestinian groups. The third phase is focused on initiating projects to rebuild Gaza with the support of the international community, which includes investments in infrastructure and vital institutions of the region.\n\nImplementing this ambitious plan will require significant efforts and careful coordination at the international level. The success of the agreement between Israel and Hamas could be an important step toward long-term peace, but it requires the support of all interested parties, including active participation by regional powers and international organizations.\n\nThe US, while maintaining its role as a committed ally of Israel and continuing to provide military support, faces the need to balance strategic interests with the desire for a peaceful resolution of the conflict. This complex balance requires Washington to continue seeking ways to stabilize the region, reduce tensions, and support the peace dialogue process. However, against the backdrop of the Biden administration's \"cool\" relations with Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister's unwillingness to cater to Washington's dictates, and a fierce election race in the States themselves, the real possibilities for the US to facilitate peace in Gaza are approaching zero.\n\nThe conflict in Gaza continues to deepen despite international efforts to resolve it. Recently, on July 13, the Palestinian Ministry of Health reported the tragic consequences of an Israeli attack in the Al-Mawasi area of Khan Yunis, where 71 people were killed and 289 were injured. The attack was allegedly targeting Muhammad Deif, the leader of Hamas' military wing, although his elimination has not been confirmed.\n\nDecades of conflict have led to radicalization on both the Israeli and Palestinian sides. Relations between Israel and Hamas, which governs Gaza, are complicated by deep political disagreements: Israel considers Hamas a terrorist organization, while Hamas does not recognize the legitimacy of Israel. These fundamental differences create significant obstacles to peaceful dialogue, exacerbated by security issues, rocket fire, and the Israeli blockade of Gaza, which causes serious humanitarian problems and international condemnation.\n\nAdditionally, the sides' views on a long-term political solution to the conflict radically diverge. Israel demands security guarantees, while Hamas insists on ending the Israeli occupation and recognizing Palestinian rights. These conflicting positions complicate the search for compromises.\n\nThe situation is further complicated by the hardline policy of Netanyahu's government, which aims to completely destroy Hamas. Despite prolonged military action, Hamas has not been fully eliminated, and support for its ideology is growing among Palestinians, especially in the West Bank, traditionally considered a Fatah stronghold.\n\nAn internal political crisis in Israel, exacerbated by attempts at judicial reform and mass protests against the government before the conflict began, also adds tension. The economic situation, weakened by the pandemic and worsened by the conflict, has led to the threat of thousands of businesses closing.\n\nThese circumstances lead to accusations against Netanyahu that he does not aim to end the conflict, as it could lead to his resignation and the activation of legal investigations against him. It is possible that the conflict will continue until the potential return of Donald Trump to the White House, and all current attempts at resolution may prove futile.\n\nBut the problem is not only with the Israeli authorities. The conflict between Hamas and Fatah is one of the key internal factors complicating the process of resolving the Palestinian issue. These two main Palestinian factions have different ideological roots, political platforms, and strategies regarding Israel, which significantly affect the political landscape of Palestine.\n\nFatah, a traditionally moderate and secular organization founded by Yasser Arafat in 1959, has long dominated the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Fatah focuses on negotiations and the political process as a means to achieve Palestinian statehood and recognition.\n\nOn the other hand, Hamas, which emerged in the late 1980s during the First Intifada, is an Islamist group that aims to liberate Palestine from Israeli occupation through armed resistance and social work among the population. Hamas believes that ceasing military action against Israel is a betrayal of the Palestinian cause.\n\nRelations between Hamas and Fatah are complicated by periodic outbreaks of violence. The most vivid manifestation of this was the bloody confrontation in 2007 when Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip as a result of an armed conflict, while Fatah retained power on the West Bank of the Jordan River. This division has deepened the geographical and political fragmentation of the Palestinian territories, complicating efforts for national unity.\n\nThe division between Hamas and Fatah and the lack of a unified Palestinian national strategy seriously hinder negotiations with Israel. The international community, including countries supporting the peace process, often has to choose whom to conduct dialogue with, creating additional contradictions and mistrust.\n\nHamas, controlling Gaza, rejects current peace initiatives as too conciliatory, while Fatah, more open to dialogue, faces criticism from its supporters for being willing to compromise, which can be perceived as betraying Palestinian interests.\n\nTo achieve sustainable peace, internal reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah is necessary, requiring significant efforts from both sides and support from the international community. Only by forming a united Palestinian front can a compromise be reached that satisfies the basic demands of all parties and leads to long-term peaceful resolution.\n\nThus, it is possible that the activities of global mediators may lead to a ceasefire in Gaza, although the likelihood of such an outcome at this stage is extremely low. For a sustainable and final resolution of the Middle East conflict, primarily, the consolidation of the Palestinians and Israelis themselves is necessary with the intention to end the years-long war and coexist in harmony.", "source": {"uri": "europesun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "europesun.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type":

Muhammad Shabana, who commands Hamas forces in Rafah, the terror group's last stronghold, is under Sinwar.\n\nHaddad carries great prestige within Hamas, who commanded the terrorists who seized the body of Israeli soldier Oron Shaul during fighting in Shejaya in July 2014. Since being appointed commander of northern Gaza, he has focused his efforts on restoring Hamas military and administrative infrastructure in the areas of Shejaya, Zeitoun, Beit Lahia, Beit Hanoun and Jabaliya.\n\nOne of the attempts was thwarted when Israeli forces surprised Hamas with an operation at Shifa Hospital, where Hamas tried to establish a makeshift government center in March. Hamas established a small government administration center inside the hospital compound. On the day that Israeli forces entered the compound, Hamas was about to pay salaries to hundreds of civil servants and terrorists.\n\nMoreover, Israel has managed to cut off northern and southern Gaza from each other by taking control of the Netzarim Corridor, a 6.5-km-road running from east to west, just south of Gaza City.\n\n\"It turns out that the Netzarim Corridor has become a tourniquet right around the neck of Hamas in Gaza,\" an Israeli security official told TPS-IL in June.\n\nHamas has become extremely cautious with its field security rules, and its operatives are wary of being tracked not only by Israeli intelligence but by Fatah operatives and Palestinian Authority loyalists. This is because Hamas fears a significant intelligence achievement for Israel, particularly while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is visiting the US. Netanyahu departed for Washington on Monday. He is scheduled to meet with President Joe Biden and address a joint session of Congress.\n\nIsraeli security officials stress that Hamas is trying to adapt to the new situation, but has been unable to strengthen itself since the IDF took control of the Philadelphia Corridor. This buffer zone running the length of the 14-kilometer Egypt-Gaza border was created to prevent weapons smuggling after Israel disengaged from Gaza in 2006. Hamas violently seized control of Gaza the following year.\n\nAt least 1,200 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas's attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 116 remaining hostages, more than 44 have been declared dead.", "source": {"uri": "jewishpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jewish Press - JewishPress.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

IDF units are operating simultaneously both above ground and in the tunnels underneath. Maintaining coordination in such an operation is difficult because of communications difficulties (the deep tunnels prevent the use of wireless communications with units above ground).\n\nAccording to the latest reports, approximately 1,000 Hamas personnel have been killed in the Rafah area since the beginning of the Israeli offensive there, about half that figure since the last update. Though there is quite a bit of fighting, the Hamas units are not so much defending territory as conducting \"hit and run\" actions. They are hunted by some IDF units while other units focus on destroying Hamas infrastructure.\n\nThe IDF has also continued to conduct raids into northern Gaza and Khan Yunis whenever concentrations of returning Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists are discovered, as well as into the Nusayrat area between Gaza City and Khan Yunis.\n\nOver the past two weeks, the IDF conducted raids mostly into northern Gaza, while this past week it increased its efforts to cause the remaining population in that area to evacuate south. In response to the IDF's original calls to evacuate in October-November 2023, about 80% of the population of northern Gaza evacuated the area. More have left since then, and videos on Palestinian social media show the movement of more people on the routes shown in IDF leaflets.\n\nThe Israeli raids are aimed at concentrations of Hamas and other militant personnel who are attempting to reassert control and rebuild capabilities in northern Gaza and Khan Yunis. Each raid ends within a few days to a couple of weeks, after the Hamas personnel have been killed or captured or have fled the area. Reports indicate that since the last update, a couple of hundred terrorists have been killed in these raids.\n\nSixteen Israeli soldiers have been killed in the fighting in Gaza since my last update, and a few hundred wounded (some severely, but mostly with light wounds).\n\nThe IDF has also conducted several focused air strikes on high-ranking Hamas personnel and concentrations of Hamas personnel in areas where its ground forces are not present. In each case, Hamas has claimed the deaths of dozens of civilians, whereas the IDF has claimed that most if not all the casualties were combatants.\n\nIn some instances, Hamas personnel were detected in or adjacent to UNRWA sites or similar sites (schools, hospitals, mosques). Two possible casualties in the Israeli strikes include the Hamas supreme military commander, Muhammad Deif, and the brigade commander for Khan Yunis. They were attacked based on intelligence information on their whereabouts. The death of the brigade commander has been confirmed, but that of Deif has not. Hamas insists that he survived but has provided no proof. The bodies of the people killed in that strike have been collected.\n\nIn a rare statement, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas criticized Hamas for using civilians as human shields in Gaza.\n\nOccasionally, Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad manages to fire a few rockets at Israeli villages near the border and (more rarely) at towns further away. No casualties have been reported so far, as most of the villages are still empty following the October 7 Hamas massacre. Other rockets have either missed or were intercepted..\n\nBelow are a sampling of the weapons found in an UNRWA compound: Rocket sections, remote-controlled bombs, a drone being assembled, equipment for planting and controlling bombs, and an infantryman's equipment vest:\n\nAfter spending an estimated $320 million on building a floating pier to provide humanitarian supplies for Gaza (that was as of mid-June; the figure is probably higher by now given the need to repair sections and operate tugs and other equipment since then), it is reported that the US will permanently dismantle the pier, as it proved incapable of withstanding the buffeting of the waves. It broke apart once, and the pieces were towed to an Israeli port for repair and to await the calming of the sea. Once repaired, the pier was returned to the Gaza coast, but when the sea conditions worsened once again, the Americans pulled it out a second time. The pier was apparently returned to the Gaza shore but will be permanently dismantled and removed in the coming days or weeks.\n\nAs noted in the last update, the total amount of supplies that actually landed in Gaza via the American pier was minimal -- about 9,000 tons in three months. Supplies brought in via the Israeli ground entrances, on the other hand, have grown to 5,000 to 6,000 tons each day.\n\nThe main problem with getting supplies to Gazans is not the Israelis. The problem is the distribution of the supplies once they are inside Gaza in areas that Israel does not control. Supplies are piling up and not being distributed. A report on the Palestinian Sawa Foundation website quotes UN sources as saying there are more than 1,300 trucks standing on the Gaza side of the Kerem Shalom crossing that are loaded and waiting to be distributed.\n\nFurthermore, trucks carrying supplies and occasionally storage areas are attacked and looted by Hamas personnel (for their own use or for sale in the marketplace), by criminal gangs (for sale), and in some cases by the general population itself. UNRWA and the other humanitarian organizations are simply not up to the task of policing this problem.\n\nOver the past month, there have been reports of increased fighting among Palestinian factions inside Gaza, though this is still occurring on a small scale. It includes political rivalries as well as clan and personal rivalries as well as criminal enterprises fighting either each other or Hamas over sources of revenue. In one case, a social activist was kidnapped and had both legs and arms broken by Hamas personnel for publishing criticism on Facebook about Hamas' management of the war and blaming Hamas for the suffering of the Palestinian population.", "source": {"uri": "algemeiner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Algemeiner"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas",

After Hamas invaded Israel on October 7, murdering 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages, Israel's war cabinet directed the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to destroy Hamas's military and governing capabilities, free all hostages, and ensure that Gaza would no longer pose a threat to Israel. Limiting the goal to merely preventing another October 7 is not enough. No sovereign state would allow a genocidal terrorist organization to exist on its border.\n\nNumerous studies, including my own, have shown that targeted killing is effective in mitigating Palestinian terrorism. Targeted killing against Hamas, however, is necessary but insufficient. Applying military pressure -- or \"military repression,\" as Cronin refers to it -- is also required. That is what Israel is doing, and it is doing so carefully and precisely. \"Israel has done more to prevent civilian casualties in war than any military in history,\" John Spencer, the chair of urban warfare studies at West Point, has observed, \"setting a standard that will be both hard and potentially problematic to repeat.\"\n\nIsrael seeks to minimize civilian casualties. That is an integral part of its counterterrorism policy. Hamas seeks to maximize civilian casualties. That is an integral part of its propaganda strategy, and too many people are falling for it. The war in Gaza might have ended long ago had Israel applied indiscriminate force, akin to the force the Allies applied in Dresden during World War II or the force Russia applied in Chechnya in the first decade of this century. And of course, this war could end immediately if Hamas laid down its arms, agreed to an unconditional surrender, and released the hostages.\n\nAs of this writing, in July, the IDF has dismantled about 22 of Hamas's 24 battalions, including their stronghold and crucial infrastructure in Rafah. It has killed over 17,000 Hamas terrorists, incapacitated a similar number, and captured about 5,000. The unfortunate deaths of civilians, used by Hamas as human shields, are Hamas's responsibility. Israel has enabled over 30,000 trucks carrying humanitarian aid, including 500,000 tons of food and medicine, to enter Gaza. That is far more than the \"trickle\" Cronin suggests.\n\nIn light of the unique challenges of this war -- including Hamas's extensive tunnel network, the number of hostages held by Hamas in civilian settings, and the refusal of Egypt to provide temporary refuge for Palestinian civilians -- these achievements are phenomenal. More is needed, but Israel's objectives are within reach.\n\nHamas will not end on its own, but it will end. Israel will prevail.\n\nMy article laid out a strategic pathway to ending Hamas by turning its weaknesses against it. That is a much more ambitious aim than merely preventing another attack akin to the one the group carried out on October 7.\n\nIf Israel's targeted killings had been strategically effective in mitigating Hamas's terrorism, the October 7 attack would not have happened. Instead, since the 1990s, targeted killings have often boosted the group's recruitment efforts, deepened its networks, and replaced weaker leaders with more extreme ones.\n\nHamas showed callous disdain for the welfare of Palestinians by launching the October 7 massacre of innocent Israelis. When Israel responded with military force, Hamas protected its leaders and fighters underground as hundreds of thousands of Palestinian civilians suffered and starved on the surface -- and tens of thousands died. But Hamas's conduct does not absolve Israel of its responsibility to safeguard Palestinian civilians during military operations, including by ensuring they have enough to eat. According to The Wall Street Journal, the Hamas military leader Yahya Sinwar has called the deaths of Palestinian civilians \"necessary sacrifices.\" If the horrific plight of Palestinian civilians is indeed an integral part of Hamas's propaganda strategy, as Ophir Falk argues, then apparently the Israeli government is playing right into the group's hands.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.com",

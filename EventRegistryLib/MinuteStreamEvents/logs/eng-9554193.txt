Former Canadian Centre For Ethics in Sport chair Andrew Pipe and the Canadian Centre for Child Protection's director of education Noni Classen will be Maisonneuve's advisers. \"The appointees are really going to have to be bold,\" said Amelia Cline, managing director of Athletes Empowered, which was formerly Gymnasts For Change. \"They don't have the backing of a national inquiry. They don't have the mechanisms that would give them the power to compel testimony and documents. \"We know how allergic the sports system is to accountability, so this commission is probably going to live and die by the commissioner's willingness to dig and to expose where they aren't being provided with the adequate information they're seeking.\" Cline was among several former athletes who testified in parliamentary committee hearings in 2022 and early 2023 about the physical, mental and sexual abuse they experienced in their sport. MPs were told the pressure on national sports organizations to produce medals, and get funding to do that, contributed to toxic environments in which athlete welfare took a back seat. Qualtrough continued to be questioned Thursday on her refusal to establish a public inquiry. An inquiry operates under terms set in the Inquiries Act and requires cabinet approval. Often led by judges, commissioners have power to subpoena witnesses, take evidence under oath and request documents. \"Compelling victims to tell their story was not \"| a trauma-informed approach,\" Qualtrough said. \"Having a full-blown public inquiry would have resulted in months and months of negotiation with provinces to agree on terms of references, that ultimately, I did not have the confidence we could arrive at.\" Cline believed an inquiry could avoid re-traumatizing survivors. \"There's nothing in the Inquiries Act that prevents that from being a trauma-informed, empowering process for people,\" she said. \"It's actually survivors who have been asking for an inquiry because we know just how reticent the sports system is.\" Qualtrough compares the sport commission's work to that of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which between 2007 and 2015 investigated harm caused by residential schools, and proposed both solutions to that harm and prevention of further abuse of Indigenous Peoples. She was reappointed sports minister in 2023 after her first stint in the portfolio between 2015 and 2017. Qualtrough opened Thursday's press conference with an apology to athletes and sport participants who have been abused, particularly those maltreated as children. \"I'm sorry this happened to you,\" Qualtrough said. \"I'm sorry the sport system didn't protect you or hold to account those who hurt you. What you experienced should not have happened.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 9, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@medicinehatnews.com", "name": "Canadian Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carla_Qualtrough", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carla Qualtrough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief Justice of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascale_St-Onge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pascale St-Onge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_inquiry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public inquiry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canadian_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Canadian Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Centre_for_Child_Protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Centre for Child Protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirsty_Duncan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kirsty Duncan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timmins", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Timmins"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Timmins"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_and_Reconciliation_Commission_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Indian residential school system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Provinces and territories of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Canada"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Wheelchair", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Wheelchair", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Blind", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Blind", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://medicinehatnews.com/wp-content/uploads/cp/20240509110544-7135dee1232ac14cc4c9ec6181bafad847f2f0072b5ca09b5916a30f14804e54.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554193", "eventUri": "eng-9554193", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nIt's the first update since Qualtrough announced the creation of the new commission last December. Led by former Chief Justice of the Ontario Court of Justice Lise Maisonneuve as the independent commissioner and two special advisers Noni Classen and Dr. Andrew Pipe, the commission will spend the next 18 months reviewing Canada's sport system by interviewing victims and survivors of maltreatment in sport as well as sport organizations, stakeholders and experts.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"We have an opportunity to ensure that all athletes and participants in the world of sport have a safe and positive sport experience,\" Qualtrough said at a press conference Thursday.\n\nThe minister urged all Canadians to participate in the commission, which will operate on a voluntary level, to come forward to share their \"perspectives, approaches and solutions.\"\n\n\"The quality of the results of this process depends on the quality of the contributions received.\"\n\nThe federal government proposed $10.6 million over two years, starting in 2024, to support the operations of the commission. It is expected to release two reports and convene a national summit to allow participants to deliberate on its preliminary findings and recommendations at the conclusion of its review.\n\n\"We are committed to examining carefully the sport system in Canada and identifying the structures and processes that will support a values-based safe sports system for all,\" said Maisonneuve, adding it is too early to say how they will approach their mandate.\n\n\"We appreciate the powerful role of sport in our society, the need to ensure it receives thoughtful stewardship and that the well-being of all participants is paramount.\"\n\nJoining Maisonneuve is Classen, the director of education and support services at the Canadian Centre for Child Protection. She has worked with youth who have experienced complex trauma and child sexual abuse, as well as trauma prevention and protection, according to a statement released Thursday.\n\nDr. Pipe, a clinician scientist at the Ottawa Heart Institute and a professor at the University of Ottawa, has been a team doctor at 12 Olympic Games and was a chief medical officer for Olympic, Pan-Am and Commonwealth teams, the statement said.\n\nA public inquiry into abuse in Canada's sport system has been called for in recent years by athletes, sport advocates and MPs, including former minister of sport Kirsty Duncan. Last year, athletes' testimony before the heritage and status of women committees led to calls for a public inquiry into abuse in sports.\n\nAdvocates argue a public inquiry would have judicial standing to subpoena witnesses, compel evidence and hold sport organizations accountable, unlike the voluntary nature of a commission.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHowever, Qualtrough has said the commission will not be a public inquiry, citing concerns over whether an inquiry could be trauma informed and provide a \"safe place for victims and survivors.\" She said while the ability to compel organizations to provide evidence was a worry, the commission will be a \"forward looking process\" that deals with \"individuals who had been victimized, traumatized and not protected by a system.\"\n\nQualtrough said the safe sport commission will resemble the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which looked into abuse in Canada's Residential School System and released 94 \"calls to action\" in 2015.\n\nWhile there has been criticism by residential school survivors that Ottawa has moved too slowly on those calls to action, Qualtrough said the federal government has committed to respond to the sport commission's recommendations within six months.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri":

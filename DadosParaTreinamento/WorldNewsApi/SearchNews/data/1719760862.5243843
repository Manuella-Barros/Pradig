Among this trio, the two SUVs seem to offer a similar proposition. They both have a similar footprint, are immensely capable, and are even underpinned by the same platform and powered by the same iForce MAX hybrid powertrain. The 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser has already proven its capabilities, while the upcoming 2025 Toyota 4Runner looks exceptionally promising. So then, what are the individualistic traits of these two rugged SUVs that differentiate them from each other? Let\u2019s look into it. 2025 Toyota 4Runner Vs 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser Toyota The 2025 Toyota 4Runner Offers A Non-Hybrid Base Engine Option The 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser is powered by a sole powertrain option, which is a hybrid setup comprising a 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder motor and an electric motor. The same powertrain dubbed iForce MAX is standard in the high-end trims and optional for the mid-level trims of the upcoming 2025 4Runner. This hybrid setup produces a total max output of 326 horsepower and 465 lb-ft of torque in both of these SUVs. But what the 2025 4Runner offers extra is a base, non-hybrid powertrain. It is again a turbocharged 2.4-liter 4-cylinder motor but without any hybrid assist. Called simply \u201ciForce\u201d, this turbo motor is the standard powertrain in the SR5, TRD Sport, TRD Off-Road, and Limited trims of the 2025 Toyota 4Runner. It puts out a healthy 278 horsepower and 317 lb-ft of torque, which is still higher than the outgoing generation 4Runner\u2019s 270-hp V6. 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser Jason Bax / Toyota Land Cruiser Dominating Off-Road with Full-Time 4WD, While 2025 4Runner Offers Multiple Configurations Just like its predecessor, the upcoming 4Runner is also offered in a rear-wheel-drive configuration. Toyota has confirmed that the 2025 4Runner will be available in 2WD, part-time 4WD, and full-time 4WD variants. Both 2WD and 4WD models will feature an automatic limited-slip differential. However, the latter will also be equipped with an electronically controlled two-speed transfer case with high/low range gearing. Also, an electronic locking rear differential is standard on TRD Off-Road, TRD Pro, and Trailhunter grades. On the other hand, all models of the 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser are equipped with a full-time four-wheel drivetrain with center and rear locking differentials. This means that regardless of the trim you choose, the Land Cruiser comes locked and loaded to conquer any terrain with ease. Conversely, if you\u2019re not seeking such a hardcore off-roader, you can settle for the 2WD or part-time 4WD versions of the upcoming 4Runner. 2025 Toyota 4Runner Toyota MORE FOR YOU Trump Trial Prosecutor Ends Closing Argument After Nearly 5 Hours\u2014Jury Instructions Set For Wednesday Gas Explosion In Downtown Youngstown Ohio Injures At Least 7 Trump Lashes Out At Robert De Niro After Actor Calls Him A \u2018Tyrant\u2019 Outside Courthouse The 2025 Toyota 4Runner Will Be Available In Nine Trim Levels, While The 2024 Land Cruiser Is Limited To Three The 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser lineup is fairly simple. You have the option to choose from three available trims, the Land Cruiser 1958, the Land Cruiser itself, and the range-topping First Edition. The 1958 trim is a retro approach to the SUV, featuring rounded headlamps and a fairly basic feature set. The Land Cruiser trim gets rectangular headlamps and a lot more interior features. The First Edition takes it up a notch by adding exclusive features such as leather-trimmed seats, a 14-speaker JBL premium audio system, driver memory settings, and more. That is the end of it. You don\u2019t have to be confused because there are very few options to pick from. The 2025 4Runner on the other hand has a more diverse roster of trims. At the bottom end, there are the SR5 and TRD Sport trims, followed by the mid-spec TRD Sport Premium, TRD Off Road, and TRD Off Road Premium grades. At the top end of the 4Runner food chain resides the Limited, Platinum, TRD Pro, and Trailhunter models. The newest addition to the family is the Trailhuter, which is a manufacturer-developed overlanding rig. The amount of versatility offered by the 4Runner range cannot be matched by the Land Cruiser. Also, the Land Cruiser has a base price of $57,345. The 4Runner is sure to undercut it by a fair margin, considering its bigger lineup, smaller base engine option, and the availability of 2WD models.

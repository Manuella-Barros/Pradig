This unique artifact was unearthed at the ancient site of Satala in G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane during the 2020 excavation season.\n\nThe restoration project was spearheaded by T\u00fcrkiye's Ministry of Culture and Tourism. Initially discovered and removed from the site with the support of the Ankara Regional Laboratory, the armor was later transported to the Erzurum Restoration and Conservation Regional Laboratory in 2021. Detailed analysis, including X-ray and tomography, was conducted at Erzurum Atat\u00fcrk University to document the armor in its soil-encrusted state.\n\nAccording to the ministry's statement, the armor dates back to the Late Roman Period. It is a significant example of the Lorica Squamata type, noted for being the first known to the world. X-ray examinations revealed that the armor was nearly intact. The meticulous restoration involved micro-CT imaging of three edge plates to determine their precise measurements and metallurgical properties.\n\n\"Such armor rarely survives to the present day,\" the statement highlighted. \"The detailed X-ray results indicated that the armor was almost entirely intact.

When beyond repair, they were melted down and repurposed, which is why surviving examples are so rare today.\n\nLorica Squamata, or \"scale armor,\" was a distinctive personal armor used extensively by Roman soldiers and predominantly worn by higher-ranking soldiers, including officers, standard bearers (signifiers), musicians and some cavalry units. Unlike the more commonly known Lorica Segmentata, which was made of large, rigid plates, Lorica Squamata was composed of numerous small, overlapping metal scales sewn onto fabric or leather backing. Each scale, typically crafted from bronze or iron, had small holes punched into it, allowing it to be wired or stitched in overlapping rows. This construction method provided a unique balance of flexibility and protection, enabling greater freedom of movement for the wearer while still offering significant defensive capabilities.\n\nThe armor's design made it highly adaptable for various roles within the Roman military. Its flexibility allowed soldiers to move more freely compared to those encased in rigid plate armor, which was a crucial advantage in dynamic combat situations. However, this flexibility came at a cost: Lorica Squamata required careful maintenance to prevent rust and damage, and the numerous scales made it relatively heavy.

Although we couldn't get our hands on all of the new armor sets in the game, we did find a fair number of really good ones. So, here are the best armors in the Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree that we found during the early preview access.\n\nFire Knights Armor set is my favorite armor set in the Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree. It is one of the best-looking armor sets in the game and comes with some really good features. The Fire Knight helm slightly increases the maximum HP, stamina, and maximum equip load.\n\nThis armor set has really good Fire damage reduction and is one of the top choices when facing Messmer the Impaler. You can obtain the Fire Knights Armor set by defeating Fire Knights in the Shadow Keep.\n\nVerdigris armor set is the latest addition of heavy armor, and it is comparable to Lionel's armor from the base game. The complete set sets the poise to 100, which makes this armor the best Poise armor in the Elden Ring. If you struggling with enemies or invaders breaking your poise and stun-locking you, then all you need is Verdigris Armor.\n\nPair the armor with the Verdigris Talisman, which increases defense with a higher equipment load, making you set to tank through any hit in the DLC. This armor set is dropped by Moore after winning the battle royal against the followers of Miquella in late game.\n\nAnother beautiful armor set with some really good niche build possibilities is the Dancer's Armor set. This armor set is beautiful and every piece of this armor set enhances the power of dancing attacks.\n\nPair it with the Dancing Blades of Ranah, invest in dex, and you have a new unique Dancer build ready for PvP. This armor set can be found by defeating the Dancer of Ranah in the Southern Nameless Mausoleum on the Cerulean Coast.\n\nFreyja is one of the followers of Miquella and her armor set has been one of my favorites ever since I set my eyes on it in the Realm of Shadows. The redmane armor of Freyja is very stylish and is light weight with better stats compared to many other heavy armor in the game.\n\nComplete with her greatsword and shield, this armor set is perfect for role playing as one of Radahn's most distinguished knights. This armor set can also be attained by winning the battle royal against the followers of Miquella in late game.\n\nMessmer's armor set is not the prettiest of the bunch, but it sure has its uses. Messmer's helm slightly enhances the incantations of Messmer's Fire, as well as Fire Knight skills. Players who are interested in using Messmer's incantations will find this armor set very useful.\n\nAlso, this armor set has better elemental defense stats compared to the Fire Knight armor, however, it does lack a little in the physical damage reduction section. You can purchase Messmer's armor from the Finger Reader in the Round Table Hold after defeating Messmer the Impaler.\n\nAnother gorgeous armor set added in the Shadow of the Erdtree is Rellana's armor. The set looks pristine and is perfect for Spell Blade or Carian Knight builds. The armor is lighter compared to most other medium armors and provides good defense stats.\n\nThis armor set is also one of the best in its weight ratio. You can purchase Rellana's armor set from the Finger Reader in the Round Table Hold after defeating her in Castle Ensis.\n\nGaius's is another new heavy armor added to the Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, and it has a very unique look with really good stats. This armor is comparatively much lighter to the other heavy armor in the game. Paired with the Sword Lance of Commander Gaius, it is easily one of favorite favorite-looking armor sets in the game.\n\nYou can purchase Gaius's armor from the Finger Reader in the Round Table Hold after defeating him in Scaduview. However, his greaves can only be found in the Albinauri'c Shack, also located in Scaduview.\n\nAnother really good heavy armor in the Realm of Shadows is the Solitude Armor set. This armor set is easily one of the best early-game armor in the Realm of Shadows. The armor set gives off a very sophisticated knight's look, covering the entire body with steel plates and adorning a cool black cloak.\n\nThis armor set also gives a ridiculous boost to the Focus stat, making it one of the best picks for the Midir, Lord of the Frenzied Flames boss fight. This armor set can be found in the Western Nameless Mausoleum, west of Scorched Ruins.\n\nSo, those were the 8 best armors in Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree.

Shortly after the Buffalo supermarket shooting, the New York legislature introduced a bill to ban body armor in the Empire State. On June 6, 2022, the bill passed. Less than a month later, on July 1, Governor Cathy Hochul signed the bill into law. A week later, on July 6, the law went into effect. Although the law banned body armor for civilians, there are exceptions. Police officers, military personnel, and certain security professionals were still allowed to own body armor. Who qualifies to own body armor fell to the sole discretion of the New York Department of State.\n\n\"The right to 'bear arms' refers to the right to 'wear, bear, or carry . . . upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose . . . of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in a case of conflict with another person,'\" the suit reads.\n\nThe case also points out that the Second Amendment applies to keeping and bearing arms as well as the ability to acquire arms. By banning the sale of body armor in the state, New York could be violating the Second and Fourteenth Amendments. Before the Fourteenth Amendment, states argued that the Constitution only applied to the federal government. The Fourteenth Amendment cleared up the argument. It affirmed that the Constitution bound the states.\n\nArmor Republic states that any law on arms must be consistent with the text, tradition, and history of the Second Amendment. Under the Bruen framework, New York State must provide historical analogs from the founding era that show that the body armor ban is consistent with the Second Amendment. The state will have a hard time finding any examples.\n\nNew York State will probably argue that body armor technology didn't exist during the founding era. To head off this argument, Armor Republic lists a history of body armor dating back to 1181. The breakdown is extensive and convincing. The argument shows that body armor during the founding era was known and in wide circulation. These facts show that the founders chose not to ban body armor and thus created a tradition of civilian-owned body armor.\n\nJohn is an NRA instructor and a constitutional activist.

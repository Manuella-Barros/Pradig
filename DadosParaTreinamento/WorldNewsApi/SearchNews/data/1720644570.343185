He argued that dispatching specialists to do training work inside Ukrainian shouldn\u2019t provoke a Russian response. \u201cWe are not at war with Russia,\u201d Macron added. \u201cWe do not want an escalation, but we want to do everything in our power to help Ukraine resist. Is it an escalation if Ukraine asks us to train mobilized soldiers on its soil? No, that does not mean deploying people \u2013 European or allied soldiers \u2013 on the front line.\u201d Macron made his comments after hosting a visit by Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky. He announced on Thursday that France will send Mirage 2000 fighter jets to Kiev and train Ukrainian pilots. It will reportedly take until around the end of this year to have pilots ready to fly the warplanes. French forces have already trained around 10,000 Ukrainian troops in France and other NATO countries. Lithuania and Estonia have also publicly suggested that they would be willing to deploy instructors inside Ukraine. In fact, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said last month that NATO trainers were already operating in the battle-torn state. Russian officials have repeatedly warned that any foreign military personnel in Ukraine would be considered legitimate targets for attack, regardless of their duties and locations. The Russian Foreign Ministry said Macron\u2019s \u201cbelligerent rhetoric\u201d and provocative statements had escalated the Ukraine crisis. Macron began making public comments about the possibility of troop deployments to Ukraine in February, triggering pushback from some NATO allies and a Kremlin warning that such a step would inevitably lead to a direct conflict with Russia. US President Joe Biden reportedly rejected Macron\u2019s proposal to send instructors to Kiev, citing concern that those troops could be in the line of fire and spark an escalation.", "summary": "<p><img src=\"https://ifpnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/00000000000000000000.jpg\" style=\"display: block; margin: 1em auto\"></p>\n<p>French President Emmanuel Macron went beyond merely talking about the possibility of deploying NATO troops in Ukraine, taking steps to form a coalition of military trainers who would work inside the former Soviet republic preparing Kiev\u2019s soldiers to fight Russian forces.</p>", "url": "https://ifpnews.com/france-coalition-military-trainers-ukraine/", "image": "https://ifpnews.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=rank_math_overlay_thumb&id=281352&type=iran-front-page&hash=761feb9463ae80a0042de6ec283b02d1", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:40:28", "author": "Ifp Media Wire", "authors": ["Ifp Media Wire"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "IR", "sentiment": -0.253}

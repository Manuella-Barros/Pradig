But in the world of gaming peripherals and gear, the industry can seem vast and confusing with some big brands dominating the space. With gaming chairs we all know the popular brands. Secret Lab, Corsair and Razer are some of the brands we can name \u2013 but there\u2019s one brand you might have not have heard about. Boulies is a brand we\u2019ve never really heard before but decided to try them out to see how they faired when it came to comfort and quality \u2013 and we can certainly say that if you\u2019re in the market for a new gaming chair \u2013 or even office chair \u2013 the Boulies Master Series should be on your radar. Set-up Set-up for gaming chairs can see extremely time-consuming, depending on how they are constructed. One of the joys of the Boulies Master Series is how quick it was to put together with all the parts supplied for me to sort. The box the chair comes in is big so prepare for it to take up a lot of space. Nothing is assembled so you have to put it together from scratch but it\u2019s not as complicated as you might think. Instructions with the chair are very easy to follow, compared to some chairs we\u2019ve assembled in the past. All of the steps are coloured and very easy to follow which is refreshing compared to some brands. You\u2019ll also get an Allen key set included with bolt cushions which you are directed to use with the instructions. There\u2019s even some spare parts that you can use to We managed to construct the whole chair \u2013 by ourself \u2013 in around 35 minutes but it could easily be quicker with two people. Quality and comfort The most important thing about a gaming chair is the quality and the comfort, of course. And this is some the Boulies manages to accomplish extremely well. Quality-wise, we noticed that while constructing the chair the armrests and the base of the chair seemed extremely well put together and constructed. One of our favourite features of chair is the aluminium embossing of the 4D armrests. They look extremely well-built and during our testing they stayed firm and stable while gaming and typing with the ability to adjust them perfectly to our preference. There\u2019s even little indentations that your arms can fall into, making the chair just that more comfortable when typing or gaming. The chair also shows off what appears to be careful stitching throughout the cushions as well as the Boulies logo proudly embossed on the top of the head rest. Everything screams quality and craftsmanship with the Boulies Master and we were very impressed with it. Comfort-wise, I weigh around 15 stone at a height of 6ft 2\u2019 and I found the comfort of the Boulies to be very good \u2013 but I would advise that you might want a bigger chair at my size. During my initial impressions, I felt that the Boulies was a bit tight around my lower area and buttocks. Whether or not that was a result of the cushioning or the material, we don\u2019t know. The Master Series chair comes with a seat width of 31cm and is meant for people with a height of 5ft 1\u2019 to 5ft 11\u2019 so it was probably a bit small for me. The good news is that after a few weeks of sitting and wearing the tightness of the cushions and the upholstery out, we found the chair become far more comfortable as it molded to our shape and weight. The back cushion provided a great support for my back when I needed to sit up straight to get some work done but also plenty of comfort when I wanted to lay back enjoying some of my favourite video games. The armrests also adjust extremely smoothly when we needed them to adjust to work or play and as we mentioned above, they didn\u2019t wiggle or move while under stress (which our old gaming chair seemed to suffer from). There\u2019s also in-built lumbar support to keep your back from feeling strained and the tilt mechanism works very smoothly when we\u2019re adjusting the tilt of the back cushion, but it does occasionally snap when we pull it which is a bit of a bug bare. Over the past few weeks, we\u2019ve noticed that the Boulies Master Series has become a fine wine when it comes to gaming chairs. We initially thought that the chair would be uncomfortable due to the initial stiffness of the cushion but over time, everything has adjusted to our weight and shape and the chair is a delight to play and work in. However, if you are a taller or heavier person, we suggest going for the Master Max which is perfect if you need that little bit more comfort or wiggle room. Price and conclusion When you look at the Boulies Master Series, they aren\u2019t cheap. But when you compare it to the competition, the chair is very reasonable for the quality, and we think you would be better spending less on the Boulies chair than going with some of the bigger brands. The Master Series starts at \u00a3309 on Amazon which is a great price considering a Secret Lab might set you back more than \u00a3400. You can buy the Master Max series for \u00a3374.99 which is still cheaper than some well-known brands. So price-wise, it\u2019s actually cheaper than most popular brands and you might find that the quality and comfort is much better. In conclusion, the Boulies Master Series is a brilliant gaming chair and has replaced our old Noblechairs gaming chair thanks to its quality, comfort and design. It\u2019s a contender for one of the best gaming chairs we have sat in and tested and something you should consider if you want to invest in a great chair for gaming and if you work from home as well.", "summary": "The Boulies Master Series is a brilliant gaming and office chair that provides amazing comfort and build quality", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/shopping-deals/boulies-master-series-gaming-chair-32973246", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32973286.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_boulies-chair.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:04:47", "author": "Christopher Harper,Christopher-Harper", "authors": ["Christopher Harper", "Christopher-Harper"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.634}

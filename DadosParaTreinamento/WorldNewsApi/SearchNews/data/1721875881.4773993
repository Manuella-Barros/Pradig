The cuddly, brown stuffed animal has a red bandana around its neck and wears an oversized blue and white Braves cap. Atlanta is 5-1 since the bear\u2019s dugout debut in a 9-2 win over Tampa Bay on June 15. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Snitker said when asked whether there was any correlation. \u201cI should have bought the damn thing two months ago.\u201d Snitker wasn\u2019t sure how the bear first arrived in the clubhouse. He said he initially asked a clubhouse attendant to open the package and then followed a suggestion to place the bear in the dugout as a spectator. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what it was,\u201d Snitker said after Friday night\u2019s 8-1 win at Yankee Stadium. \u201cI didn\u2019t want a tarantula to jump out at me or something. It was a bear and I thought, what the hell, why not? He said, put this in the dugout and keep the big bear company.\u201d Jarred Kelenic is 9 for 28 (.321) in six games since moving up to the leadoff spot and is on a modest seven-game hitting streak. \u201cSo far it\u2019s given us some good luck,\u201d Kelenic said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a front-row seat and he doesn\u2019t have to buy a ticket to get in here, so lucky him. He\u2019s been giving us some wins. That\u2019s the main thing.\u201d Austin Riley homered Friday and has 12 hits in his last 22 at-bats, including four homers and four doubles. \u201cIt\u2019s a weird game and we\u2019ll find anything and everything to get us going and get some good mojo,\u201d Riley said. \u201cI\u2019m here for it, whatever keeps it light, whatever keeps it going.\u201d ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2JyYXZlcy1zbml0YmVhci1zbml0a2VyLWIzMTUwMWJlZWVkYTBkYTJhNmY3NTUxYmNhNTA1ZjEz0gEA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Braves' turnaround coincides with arrival of 'Snitbear' in the dugout</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/braves-snitbear-snitker-b31501beeeda0da2a6f7551bca505f13", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/24717f1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5468x3076+0+285/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Ff7%2F0f%2F3df218f0f06cff210e0ce14bf303%2Fb168380bf2984203b7e673108f8e31a0", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:55:23", "author": "Larry Fleisher", "authors": ["Larry Fleisher"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.413}

Police had to intervene as supporters of Kishore Bhikaji Darade, the candidate from Chief Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena for the Nashik Division Teachers constituency, and those of independent contestant Kishore Prabhakar Darade, who is a resident of Kopargaon in Ahmednagar, indulged in a scuffle after the altercation between the two on the last day of filing of nominations. The incident, during which the Shiv Sena candidate, who is also sitting MLC from the constituency, tried to stop his namesake from filing his nomination, took place in the divisional commissioner's office complex here.

Vladimir Putin\u2019s armed forces destroyed the building, as Russia suggested the Epicentre outlet was linked to Ukrainian military intelligence. But footage shows a normal store selling DIY equipment and household goods such as toilets and sinks as one of two Russian guided bombs exploded through the roof in what appears to be a cynical terrorist attack on civilians. \u200cA boy named Mykhailo, 8, is pictured giving a DNA sample so rescuers can identify his father who is feared lost in the rubble. The bodies of seven missing people have not been found amid the mangled carnage. Serhiy Bolvinov, head of the regional police investigative department said: \"On the video, which the investigators are currently working with, is the moment of the impact.\" \u201cIt is clear that people were completely unprepared for such an attack, they were at work and minding their own business. Investigators and criminologists were looking for something that can be recognised as a human body all night long in this charred area, the ruins of the Epicentre. We are afraid that we will have to sift through the ashes in order to find the remains and identify the dead.\u201d One comment on the cruel strike said: \u201cAs usual, [the Russians] are taking revenge on civilians for the failure of the offensive in the Kharkiv region. They take out their anger. Russia is a scum state. Some workers died because they were evacuating people,\" said the director of the construction hypermarket. A Russian source posted that this was not a regular DIY store but \u201ca military base with weapons. All employees serve in the Main Intelligence Directorate, only military personnel are visitors.\u201d The footage immediately before the strike appears to dispel this theory with toilets, sinks, taps and other normal household goods plainly in view. A Russian source had said: \"The tactic of human shields is being used in Kharkiv. They [the Ukrainians] have set up a military camp and a command post in a shopping centre, which was discovered by our intelligence service.\u201d One witness said: \u201cThere were many families in the Epicentre. People came to buy because the summer season has started.\u201d Some 200 people were in the store, according to Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky. The attack was \"another manifestation of Russian madness\u201d, he said. He again pleaded with Ukraine's allies to supply air defence systems to protect its civilians. Kharkiv is only 18 miles from the Russian border and is one of the worst-hit cities in Moscow's illegal bombing campaign since Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Putin sees the city as a prize for invasion, and he again masses fresh troops attempting to push the frontline further into Ukrainian territory, despite losing tens of thousands in recent months in the Kharkiv direction. Kharkiv mayor Ihor Terekhov said: \u201cThe attack targeted the shopping centre, where there were many people - this is clearly terrorism. I was at my workplace. I heard the first hit and... with my colleague, we fell to the ground. There was the second hit and we were covered with debris. Then we started to crawl to the higher ground,\" said Dmytro Syrotenko, 26, who had a large gash on his face.", "summary": "Bombs exploded through the roof of a large department store in Kharkiv leaving 14 people dead - after Russia claimed it was the site of a Ukrainian military base", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/sickening-footage-shows-vladimir-putins-32896871", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32896924.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-Kharkiv-strike-8-east2west-news.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:53:10", "author": "Will Stewart,Will-stewart,Zahra Khaliq", "authors": ["Will Stewart", "Will-stewart", "Zahra Khaliq"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.225}

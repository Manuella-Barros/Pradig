Annie Kuster in a blue-leaning, but competitive, district in a key general election battleground state.\n\nSHOCKER: LONGTIME DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN IN BATTLEGROUND STATE ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT\n\nGoodlander joins a burgeoning field of candidates aiming to succeed the six-term Kuster, who announced in late March that she would retire from Congress rather than seek re-election.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGoodlander could face plenty of scrutiny over Biden administration polices -- both domestic and international -- over her ties to Republicans, and over her residency. Goodlander's congressional campaign will also likely draw national attention to the New Hampshire race and possibly garner high-profile endorsements.\n\nGoodlander married Sullivan nearly nine years ago when he was working as a foreign policy advisor to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign. The couple's wedding, attended by prominent political figures including Clinton, now-Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, was a snapshot of the couple's long history in Democratic politics.\n\nTOP BIDEN ADVISER'S WIFE CONSIDERING RUN FOR HOUSE SEAT IN KEY SWING STATE\n\nSullivan worked as Klobuchar's chief counsel before serving as an adviser on Hillary Clinton's 2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign and later on former President Barack Obama's general election presidential campaign.\n\nHe served as deputy chief of staff to Clinton during her years as Secretary of State in the Obama administration. After Clinton departed the administration, Sullivan became then-Vice President Biden's top security aide.\n\nSullivan then served as a top adviser on Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. Four years later, he was one of Biden's first appointments following the 2020 presidential election.\n\nWhile not as well known nationally as her high-profile husband, Goodlander hails from a prominent New Hampshire family.\n\nTOP BIDEN OFFICIAL'S WIFE COULD FACE SCRUTINY OVER RESIDENCY IF SHE JUMPS INTO HOUSE RACE\n\nHer grandfather, Sam Tamposi, was a major player in state Republican politics. Her mother, Betty Tamposi, ran for the House in 1988 in the Second Congressional District but lost in the GOP primary.\n\nIn some ways, Goodlander's story mirrors that of Kuster, the woman she's trying to succeed in Congress. Kuster's parents were prominent Republicans in New Hampshire, but she ran as a Democrat.\n\nGoodlander, a Yale University and Yale Law School graduate, served as an intelligence officer in the U.S. Navy Reserve and worked as an adviser to late Senators Joe Lieberman and John McCain on the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee.\n\nShe also served as a law clerk to Attorney General Merrick Garland during his tenure as chief judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n\nGoodlander joins a Democratic primary field that includes Colin Van Ostern, who worked as Kuster's campaign manager in 2010 during her first run for Congress, and who later won two terms as a New Hampshire executive councilor before winning the 2016 Democratic gubernatorial nomination.\n\nVan Ostern launched his bid the day after Kuster's retirement announcement and was endorsed by the incumbent a couple of weeks later.\n\nWhile Van Ostern has landed a good deal of Granite State support, Goodlander's entry into the race could potentially shift the landscape.\n\n\"I mean, it's pretty rare to have someone of this caliber who is 37, with pretty unimpeachable roots in the district, a vast national network, and a demonstrable bipartisan record, who isn't already an elected official. It would be a really exciting dynamic in one of the nation's top congressional races,\" a veteran Democratic operative in New Hampshire who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely told Fox News.\n\nState Sen. Becky Whitley, a progressive Democrat, is also running to succeed Kuster.\n\nEight Republicans, including 2022 Senate candidate Vikram Mansharamani and Lily Tang Williams, who's making her second straight bid for the congressional nomination, are running.\n\nGoodlander's campaign announcement highlighted her roots in Nashua, \"the city her family has called home for over 100 years.\"\n\nA video announcing her campaign also spotlights those roots, with Goodlanders' mother explaining that she gave birth to Maggie after voting in Nashua on Election Day.\n\nBut for years, Goodlander and Sullivan have spent much of their time in the nation's capital because of work.\n\nThe couple owns a home in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. While the port city on the New Hampshire Seacoast is located in the state's First Congressional District, the geography won't prevent Goodlander from running in the Second District. The U.S. Constitution only mandates that a candidate must reside in the state in which they are running in, not the specific congressional district.\n\nThe most recent high-profile example of a Democratic congressional candidate in New Hampshire campaigning in a district outside their residence was six years ago, when Levi Sanders -- the son of Sen. Bernie Sanders -- ran in the First District even though he lived in the Second District.\n\nGoodlander's campaign confirmed that the candidate is currently renting a home in Nashua.\n\nWhile Goodland grew up in the Second District, records reviewed by Fox News Digital show that the last time Goodlander voted there was by absentee ballot for the 2008 presidential primary and general elections.\n\nGoodlander registered to vote in New Hampshire's First District in 2016.\n\nFox News' Aubrie Spady contributed to this report\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Klobuchar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amy Klobuchar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Van_Ostern", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colin Van Ostern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Kuster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annie Kuster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_M._Tamposi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth M.

Kuster's parents were prominent Republicans in New Hampshire, but she ran as a Democrat.\n\nGoodlander, a Yale University and Yale Law School graduate, served as an intelligence officer in the U.S. Navy Reserve and worked as an adviser to late Senators Joe Lieberman and John McCain on the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee.\n\nShe also served as a law clerk to Attorney General Merrick Garland during his tenure as chief judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n\nGoodlander joins a Democratic primary field that includes Colin Van Ostern, who worked as Kuster's campaign manager in 2010 during her first run for Congress, and who later won two terms as a New Hampshire executive councilor before winning the 2016 Democratic gubernatorial nomination.\n\nVan Ostern launched his bid the day after Kuster's retirement announcement and was endorsed by the incumbent a couple of weeks later.\n\nWhile Van Ostern has landed a good deal of Granite State support, Goodlander's entry into the race could potentially shift the landscape.\n\n\"I mean, it's pretty rare to have someone of this caliber who is 37, with pretty unimpeachable roots in the district, a vast national network, and a demonstrable bipartisan record, who isn't already an elected official. It would be a really exciting dynamic in one of the nation's top congressional races,\" a veteran Democratic operative in New Hampshire who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely told Fox News.\n\nState Sen. Becky Whitley, a progressive Democrat, is also running to succeed Kuster.\n\nEight Republicans, including 2022 Senate candidate Vikram Mansharamani and Lily Tang Williams, who's making her second straight bid for the congressional nomination, are running.\n\nGoodlander's campaign announcement highlighted her roots in Nashua, \"the city her family has called home for over 100 years.\"\n\nBut for years, Goodlander and Sullivan have spent much of their time in the nation's capital because of work.\n\nThe couple owns a home in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. While the port city on the New Hampshire Seacoast is located in the state's First Congressional District, the geography won't prevent Goodlander from running in the Second District. The U.S. Constitution only mandates that a candidate must reside in the state in which they are running in, not the specific congressional district.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe most recent high-profile example of a Democratic congressional candidate in New Hampshire campaigning in a district outside their residence was six years ago, when Levi Sanders -- the son of Sen. Bernie Sanders -- ran in the First District even though he lived in the Second District.\n\nWhile Goodland grew up in the Second District, records reviewed by Fox News Digital show that the last time Goodlander voted there was by absentee ballot for the 2008 presidential primary and general elections.\n\nGoodlander registered to vote in New Hampshire's First District in 2016.\n\nFox News' Aubrie Spady contributed to this report", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_steinhauser@foxnews.com", "name": "Paul Steinhauser", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Van_Ostern", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colin Van Ostern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Kuster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annie Kuster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Klobuchar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amy Klobuchar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_M._Tamposi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth M.

Annie Kuster, a fellow Democrat who announced in March that she would not seek a seventh term in the state's 2nd Congressional District. At least five Republicans also have announced their candidacies to represent the district, which stretches along the western half of the state and includes Concord and Nashua.\n\nGoodlander, 37, grew up in Nashua and recently moved back there from Washington, where she worked in the Justice Department as a top antitrust official and as counsel to Attorney General Merrick Garland before moving to the White House chief of staff's office earlier this year. Previously, she served as an intelligence officer in the Navy Reserve and taught constitutional law at the University of New Hampshire and Dartmouth College.\n\n\"Right-wing judges, extreme politicians, big corporations all have too much power,\" she said in a campaign announcement video released Thursday. \"I'm ready to take these bullies on. That's why I'm running for Congress.\"\n\nThe video features Goodlander's mother, Betty Tamposi, who lost the GOP primary for the seat in 1988.\n\nGoodlander, who was born on Election Day in 1986 after her parents stopped to vote en route to the hospital, described her own efforts to start a family. She said that she lost a baby last year nearly 20 weeks into her pregnancy and that the experience strengthened her resolve to fight for reproductive rights.\n\nThe White House confirmed Thursday that Goodlander is no longer an employee there.

Annie Kuster in a blue-leaning but competitive district in a key general election battleground state.\n\nGoodlander would join a burgeoning field of candidates aiming to succeed the six-term Kuster, who announced in late March that she would retire from Congress rather than seek re-election.\n\nSHOCKER: LONGTIME DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN IN BATTLEGROUND STATE ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT\n\n\"Maggie is thankful for the encouragement she's received from Granite Staters and will be making a decision in the coming days,\" Scott Merrick, a Democratic operative and veteran of multiple Democratic campaigns in New Hampshire, told Fox News.\n\nGoodlander, if she runs as expected, could face plenty of scrutiny over Biden administration polices - both domestic and international - over her ties to Republicans and over her residency. Goodlander's congressional campaign would also likely draw national attention to the New Hampshire race and possibly garner high-profile endorsements.\n\nGoodland married Sullivan nearly nine years ago when he was working as a foreign policy advisor to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign. The couple's wedding, attended by prominent political figures including Clinton, now-Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, was a snapshot of the couple's long history in Democratic politics.\n\nTOP BIDEN ADVISER'S WIFE MULLING CONGRESSIONAL BID\n\nSullivan worked as Klobuchar's chief counsel before serving as an adviser on Clinton's 2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign and later on former President Obama's general election presidential campaign.\n\nHe served as deputy chief of staff to Clinton during her years as secretary of state in the Obama administration. After Clinton departed the administration, Sullivan became then-Vice President Joe Biden's top security aide.\n\nSullivan then served as a top adviser on Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. Four years later, he was one of Biden's first appointments following the 2020 presidential election.\n\nWhile not as well known nationally as her high-profile husband, Goodlander hails from a prominent New Hampshire family.\n\nGOODLANDER MAY FACE SCRUTINY OVER RESIDENCY\n\nHer grandfather, Sam Tamposi, was a major player in state Republican politics. Additionally, her mother, Betty Tamposi, ran for the House in 1988 in the Second Congressional District but lost in the GOP primary.\n\nIn some ways, Goodlander's story mirrors that of Kuster, the woman she is trying to succeed in Congress. Kuster's parents were prominent Republicans in New Hampshire, but she ran as a Democrat.\n\nGoodlander, a Yale University and Yale Law School graduate, served as an intelligence officer in the U.S. Navy Reserve and worked as an adviser to late Sens. Joe Lieberman and John McCain on the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee.\n\nShe also served as a law clerk to Attorney General Merrick Garland during his tenure as chief judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n\nTOP BIDEN ADVISER'S WIFE MULLING CONGRESSIONAL BID\n\nGoodlander would join a Democratic primary field that includes Colin Van Ostern, who worked as Kuster's campaign manager in 2010 in her first run for Congress, and who later won two terms as a New Hampshire executive councilor before winning the 2016 Democratic gubernatorial nomination.\n\nVan Ostern announced his bid the day after Kuster's retirement announcement and was endorsed by the incumbent a couple of weeks later.\n\nWhile Van Ostern has landed a good deal of Granite State support, Goodlander's entry into the race could potentially shift the landscape.\n\n\"I mean, it's pretty rare to have someone of this caliber who is 37, with pretty unimpeachable roots in the district, a vast national network, and a demonstrable bipartisan record, who isn't already an elected official. It would be a really exciting dynamic in one of the nation's top congressional races,\" a veteran Democratic operative in New Hampshire who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely told Fox News.\n\nState Sen. Becky Whitley, a progressive Democrat, is also running to succeed Kuster.\n\nA handful of Republicans, including 2022 Senate candidate Vikram Mansharamani and Lily Tang Williams, who is making her second straight bid for the congressional nomination, are running.\n\nGoodlander and Sullivan spend much of their time in the nation's capital due to work, but they own a home in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.\n\nWhile the port city on the New Hampshire Seacoast is located in the state's First Congressional District, the geography would not prevent Goodlander from running in the Second District. The U.S. Constitution only mandates that a candidate must reside in the state in which they are running in, not the specific congressional district.\n\nThe most recent high-profile example of a Democratic congressional candidate in New Hampshire campaigning in a district outside their residence was six years ago, when Levi Sanders - the son of Sen. Bernie Sanders - ran in the First District even though he lived in the Second District.\n\nWhile Goodland grew up in the Second District, records reviewed by Fox News Digital show that the last time Goodlander voted there was by absentee ballot for the 2008 presidential primary and general elections.\n\nGoodlander registered in New Hampshire's First District in 2016.\n\nFox News' Aubrie Spady contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_steinhauser@foxnews.com", "name": "Paul Steinhauser", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Kuster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annie Kuster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Klobuchar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amy Klobuchar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Van_Ostern", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colin Van Ostern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_M._Tamposi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth M.

(AP) - Democrat Maggie Goodlander, a former senior White House aide with deep political connections, announced on Thursday that she's running for Congress in her home state of New Hampshire.\n\nGoodlander, who is married to President Joe Biden\u00b4s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, is the third Democrat to enter the race to succeed U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster, a fellow Democrat who announced in March that she would not seek a seventh term in the state\u00b4s 2nd Congressional District. At least five Republicans also have announced their candidacies to represent the district, which stretches along the western half of the state and includes Concord and Nashua.\n\nGoodlander, 37, grew up in Nashua and recently moved back there from Washington, where she worked in the Justice Department as a top antitrust official and as counsel to Attorney General Merrick Garland before moving to the White House chief of staff\u00b4s office earlier this year. Previously, she served as an intelligence officer in the Navy Reserve and taught constitutional law at the University of New Hampshire and Dartmouth College.\n\n\"Right wing judges, extreme politicians, big corporations all have too much power,\" she said in a campaign announcement video released Thursday. \"I\u00b4m ready to take these bullies on. That\u00b4s why I\u00b4m running for Congress.\"\n\nThe video features Goodlander\u00b4s mother, Betty Tamposi, who lost the GOP primary for the seat in 1988.\n\nGoodlander, who was born on Election Day in 1986 after her parents stopped to vote en route to the hospital, described her own efforts to start a family. She said that she lost a baby last year nearly 20 weeks into her pregnancy and that the experience strengthened her resolve to fight for reproductive rights.\n\nFILE - The New Hampshire statehouse is pictured, June 2, 2019, in Concord.

A few years later, they bought a house in Portsmouth, which is part of the state's 1st Congressional District. Goodlander recently signed a lease in her hometown of Nashua, which is in the 2nd Congressional District.\n\nGoodlander and Sullivan have struggled to have children, a point she made in her campaign video. She told the painful story of a miscarriage she suffered at 20 weeks, highlighting an issue that is top of mind for voters -- and Democrats -- since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"When I was almost 20 weeks pregnant, we found out that we had lost our little boy,\" she said in the video. \"I went into labor, and I delivered our baby myself. This is where the effects of the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs became very, very real for me.\"\n\n\"It is wrong that women in this state and across this country are denied the basic health care services that they need and that they deserve, and I want to fight for those freedoms every day for as long as I can,\" Goodlander continued.\n\nThe current law in New Hampshire allows abortion until 24 weeks, with some exceptions.\n\nGoodlander's campaign video:\n\nGoodlander is the third Democratic candidate to enter the race. Former New Hampshire Executive Councilor Colin Van Ostern and state Senator Becky Whitley are also running in the state's congressional Democratic primary on Sept. 10.\n\nEight Republicans are vying for the GOP nomination in a district that leans Democratic but is expected to be competitive.\n\nSullivan didn't respond to requests for comment, but a senior White House official tells CBS News, \"This campaign is Maggie's, not Jake's. He's very proud of his wife for taking this on, but it is absolutely her campaign -- not his.\"\n\n\"Jake will comply with the Hatch Act and with all other applicable law and policy,\" the senior official added. \"Jake has already been engaged with White House ethics officials to make sure that he is fully compliant with all obligations and responsibilities.

'My husband Jake and I, we've been trying to start a family. But when I was almost 20 weeks pregnant, we found out that we had lost our little boy,' she says in her announcement video. 'I went into labor and I delivered my baby myself,' she added. 'He died on Easter.'\n\nGoodlander, 37, has left her job as a top adviser to President Biden and moved to Nashua, N.H., to run her political campaign. She is one of several Democrats vying to replace Democratic Rep. Annie Kuster, who is retiring. The New Hampshire House seat is one of the most competitive races in the nation this year and the winner could help decide which party controls Congress. Goodlander said her experience made the Supreme Court 's decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization case - which overturned Roe v. Wade - 'very, very real for me.' 'I want to fight for those freedoms every day for as long as I can,' she says.\n\nAbortion-rights has proven a strong issue for Democrats on the campaign trail. The party did better than expected in the 2022 midterm election due to high turnout among women who were angry about the Supreme Court's decision. Biden is also using the issue to rally voters as he campaigns for re-election. Given Goodlander and Sullivan's ties to national Democrats and the competitive nature of the seat, the race is likely to garner national attention. But the Democratic primary is competitive. Colin Van Ostern, a former gubernatorial nominee and Kuster's former campaign manager, announced he's running for the seat. State Senator Becky Whitley is also running.\n\nKuster has endorsed Van Ostern. Operatives in the state are expected to raise questions about how long Goodlander has lived and voted in New Hampshire. Goodlander and Sullivan own a $2.2 million home in a tony neighborhood in Portsmouth, N.H. It has been their primary residence since 2018 although they have a home in Washington D.C. due to their jobs. It is also in the state's other congressional district. Goodlander, who was born in Nashua, is renting a home there while she campaigns for Congress.\n\nShe and Sullivan married in 2015 in a ceremony on Yale's campus that was attended by Bill and Hillary Clinton , future Secretary of State Antony Blinken , Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. Clinton did a reading at the wedding. Sullivan served in Clinton's campaign and now is Biden's National Security Adviser, the top White House official on all foreign issues, including Israel's war with Hamas and the war in the Ukraine.\n\nGoodlander is not as well-known as Sullivan, who has become the face of Biden's foreign policy, but she is from a famous New Hampshire family and has an impressive resume of her own. Her grandfather, Samuel Tamposi, was the son of Romanian immigrants and a real-estate developer who brought many Fortune 500 companies to the state, including Fidelity Investments, Anheuser Busch, and Coca-Cola. He was also a part owner of the Boston Red Sox and was friends with legendary player Ted Williams. Goodlander highlighted those roots in her announcement video.\n\nShe introduces herself as 'Maggie Tamposi Goodlander' and starts her pitch to voters with a conversation with her and her mother Betty, who is a well-known political figure in the state. In it, Betty describes going into labor on Election Day but insisting on stopping at the polling place on her way to the hospital so she can vote. 'I have to vote. I'm in New Hampshire girl. This is what we do,' Betty Tamposi says in the video. Sam Tamposi also became a huge player in Republican politics, raising millions and becoming a power broker among the GOP.\n\nGoodlander's mother, Betty Tamposi, actually ran for Congress in the second congressional district in 1988 but lost in the Republican primary. Betty Tamposi is close to the Bush and Sununu families and was appointed as Assistant Secretary of State under President George H.W. Bush. Tamposi was fired from that job during the 1992 election over a controversy involving Bill Clinton's passport records. During the 1992 election, when Clinton was running against her boss President George H.W. Bush, Tamposi had Clinton's passport records sent to her home in Virginia, claiming that she was protecting them from being tampered with. At the time, Clinton's travels as a student and his draft records from the Vietnam War were huge political issues.\n\nWhile not classified, passport information is protected by the Privacy Act and access is restricted to individuals who need them for official government business. Bush ultimately fired her because Tamposi's deputies had also searched the passport files of Independent presidential candidate Ross Perot during the campaign, prompting Perot to accuse the Bush administration of a 'gross abuse of federal power.' Goodlander's father, Theodore Goodlander, is also a real estate developer and businessman. Her parents divorce in 2009 was splashed across the New Hampshire newspapers as the couple had a bitter fight over the family's financial assets. Despite the Tamposi ties to Republicans, Goodlander would run in the Democratic Party.\n\nIn many ways her story parallels Annie Kuster, the woman she would be trying to replace in Congress. Kuster's parents were prominent Republican officials in New Hampshire but she became a Democrat. A Yale Law graduate, Goodlander worked for Senators Joe Lieberman and John McCain, clerked for the Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, and taught constitutional law at the University of New Hampshire Law School and Dartmouth. She is a Navy reservist and spent 11 years as an intelligence officer. She also serves on the board of the New Hampshire Women's Foundation. She and Sullivan met at a security conference in Munich when she worked for Lieberman.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Annie Kuster in the 2nd Congressional District according to sources close to her.\n\nGoodlander, 37, is married to Jake Sullivan, President Joe Biden's national security advisor.\n\nShe served as a deputy assistant attorney general under Attorney General Merrick Garland where she supervised international, appellate and policy work in the antitrust division.\n\nGoodlander served as counselor to Garland and she had been a law clerk for Garland when he was a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the D.C. circuit.\n\nShe also clerked for retired U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer who lives in Plainfield, N.H.\n\nGoodlander was a senior advisor to the late U.S. Sens. John McCain and Joe Lieberman at different times, and also worked as counsel to the U.S. House Judiciary Committee.\n\nGoodlander served for 11 years as an intelligence officer in the U.S. Navy Reserve.\n\nA native of Nashua, Goodlander is a graduate of Yale College and Yale Law School.\n\nHer mother, Betty Tamposi, once ran for the same seat as a Republican and lost a 1988 primary to the eventual winner, former GOP Congressman Chuck Douglas.\n\nPresident George H.W. Bush named Tamposi as an assistant secretary of state.\n\nGoodlander's father, Ted, is a real estate developer.\n\nFormer Executive Councilor Colin Van Ostern of Concord and Senate Assistant Democratic Leader Becky Whitley of Hopkinton announced they are running and have attracted support to their campaigns.\n\nLast month, Kuster announced she would not seek a seventh two-year term. She has already endorsed Van Ostern, a former campaign manager, for the seat.\n\nLincoln entrepreneur Vikram Mansharamani is seeking the Republican nomination along with 2022 candidate Lily Tang Williams of Weare and other lesser-known candidates.\n\nGoodlander and Sullivan own a home in Portsmouth, which is not in Kuster's district.\n\nResidency in the district is not a requirement to run for and to serve in the U.S. House.\n\nHer birthplace, Nashua, is the largest community in the 2nd Congressional District.\n\nklandrigan@unionleader.com", "source": {"uri": "unionleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UnionLeader.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_landrigan@unionleader.com", "name": "Kevin Landrigan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_clerk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Law clerk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Kuster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annie Kuster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_Hampshire", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of New Hampshire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice_Antitrust_Division", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concord,_New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Concord, New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Concord, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_M._Tamposi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth M.

But when I was almost 20 weeks pregnant, we found out that we had lost our little boy,' she says in her announcement video.\n\n'I went into labor and I delivered my baby myself,' she added. 'He died on Easter.'\n\nMaggie Goodlander is married to Jake Sullivan, who serves as President Joe Biden's National Security Adviser\n\nGoodlander, 37, has left her job as a top adviser to President Biden and moved to Nashua, N.H., to run her political campaign.\n\nShe is one of several Democrats vying to replace Democratic Rep. Annie Kuster, who is retiring. The New Hampshire House seat is one of the most competitive races in the nation this year and the winner could help decide which party controls Congress.\n\nGoodlander said her experience made the Supreme Court's decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization case - which overturned Roe v. Wade - 'very, very real for me.'\n\n'I want to fight for those freedoms every day for as long as I can,' she says.\n\nAbortion-rights has proven a strong issue for Democrats on the campaign trail. The party did better than expected in the 2022 midterm election due to high turnout among women who were angry about the Supreme Court's decision.\n\nBiden is also using the issue to rally voters as he campaigns for re-election.\n\nGiven Goodlander and Sullivan's ties to national Democrats and the competitive nature of the seat, the race is likely to garner national attention.\n\nBut the Democratic primary is competitive. Colin Van Ostern, a former gubernatorial nominee and Kuster's former campaign manager, announced he's running for the seat. State Senator Becky Whitley is also running.\n\nKuster has endorsed Van Ostern. Operatives in the state are expected to raise questions about how long Goodlander has lived and voted in New Hampshire.\n\nMaggie Goodlander is one of several Democrats vying to replace Rep. Annie Kuster\n\nMaggie Goodland and Jake Sullivan with President Joe Biden\n\nMaggie Goodlander, a Naval Reservist, worked for Senators Joe Lieberman (right) and John McCain (left)\n\nGoodlander and Sullivan own a $2.2 million home in a tony neighborhood in Portsmouth, N.H. It has been their primary residence since 2018 although they have a home in Washington D.C. due to their jobs.\n\nIt is also in the state's other congressional district.\n\nGoodlander, who was born in Nashua, is renting a home there while she campaigns for Congress.\n\nShe and Sullivan married in 2015 in a ceremony on Yale's campus that was attended by Bill and Hillary Clinton, future Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. Clinton did a reading at the wedding.\n\nSullivan served in Clinton's campaign and now is Biden's National Security Adviser, the top White House official on all foreign issues, including Israel's war with Hamas and the war in the Ukraine.\n\nGoodlander is not as well-known as Sullivan, who has become the face of Biden's foreign policy, but she is from a famous New Hampshire family and has an impressive resume of her own.\n\nHer grandfather, Samuel Tamposi, was the son of Romanian immigrants and a real-estate developer who brought many Fortune 500 companies to the state, including Fidelity Investments, Anheuser Busch, and Coca-Cola.\n\nHe was also a part owner of the Boston Red Sox and was friends with legendary player Ted Williams.\n\nGoodlander highlighted those roots in her announcement video.\n\nShe introduces herself as 'Maggie Tamposi Goodlander' and starts her pitch to voters with a conversation with her and her mother Betty, who is a well-known political figure in the state.\n\nIn it, Betty describes going into labor on Election Day but insisting on stopping at the polling place on her way to the hospital so she can vote.\n\n'I have to vote. I'm in New Hampshire girl. This is what we do,' Betty Tamposi says in the video.\n\nSam Tamposi also became a huge player in Republican politics, raising millions and becoming a power broker among the GOP.\n\nGoodlander's mother, Betty Tamposi, actually ran for Congress in the second congressional district in 1988 but lost in the Republican primary.\n\nBetty Tamposi is close to the Bush and Sununu families and was appointed as Assistant Secretary of State under President George H.W. Bush. Tamposi was fired from that job during the 1992 election over a controversy involving Bill Clinton's passport records.\n\nDuring the 1992 election, when Clinton was running against her boss President George H.W. Bush, Tamposi had Clinton's passport records sent to her home in Virginia, claiming that she was protecting them from being tampered with.\n\nAt the time, Clinton's travels as a student and his draft records from the Vietnam War were huge political issues.\n\nWhile not classified, passport information is protected by the Privacy Act and access is restricted to individuals who need them for official government business.\n\nBush ultimately fired her because Tamposi's deputies had also searched the passport files of Independent presidential candidate Ross Perot during the campaign, prompting Perot to accuse the Bush administration of a 'gross abuse of federal power.'\n\nMaggie Goodlander is from a famous New Hampshire political family and highlighted those roots in her announcement video\n\nGoodlander's grandfather Sam Tamposi (left) was a part owner of the Boston Red Sox and friends with legendary player Ted Williams (right)\n\nGoodlander's mother Betty Tamposi was a top State Department official under President George H.W. Bush\n\nGoodlander's father, Theodore Goodlander, is also a real estate developer and businessman. Her parents divorce in 2009 was splashed across the New Hampshire newspapers as the couple had a bitter fight over the family's financial assets.\n\nDespite the Tamposi ties to Republicans, Goodlander would run in the Democratic Party.\n\nIn many ways her story parallels Annie Kuster, the woman she would be trying to replace in Congress. Kuster's parents were prominent Republican officials in New Hampshire but she became a Democrat.\n\nA Yale Law graduate, Goodlander worked for Senators Joe Lieberman and John McCain, clerked for the Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, and taught constitutional law at the University of New Hampshire Law School and Dartmouth.\n\nShe is a Navy reservist and spent 11 years as an intelligence officer.

Annie Kuster, D-New Hampshire, announced she will not seek reelection. With Goodlander's bid, there are now three Democrats in the race, including former Executive Councilor Colin Van Ostern and current state Sen. Becky Whitley, D-Hopkinton.\n\nGoodlander's entrance is a notable development as her national political ties could shake up the current status of a race where Van Ostern is seemingly Kuster's hand-picked successor.\n\nMost recently a senior adviser in the White House, Goodlander also served as a deputy assistant attorney general in the US Department of Justice, was a law clerk to Justice Stephan Breyer and then Chief Judge Merrick Garland, and worked as an advisor to U.S. senators John McCain and Joseph Lieberman.\n\nShe is the wife of Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser.\n\nShe is a graduate of Yale University and Yale Law School, and was an adjunct professor at the University of New Hampshire Franklin Pierce School of Law.\n\nIn her announcement video, Goodlander said she wants to fight for reproductive health freedoms, telling her story of losing a baby in 2023. She also said she will \"always stand up to bullies.\"\n\n\"The bullies have too much power in America right now. Right wing judges, extreme politicians, big corporations, all have too much power,\" said Goodlander. \"I'm ready to take these bullies on.\"\n\nWind power: Are NH and Maine poised to become the 'Saudi Arabia of wind energy'? Advocates say yes.\n\nGoodlander was born and raised in Nashua and has deep family ties to the state. Her grandfather Samuel Tamposi was a real estate mogul in Nashua and prominent GOP activist, and her mother, Betty Tamposi, served in the New Hampshire House and unsuccessfully ran for Congress as a Republican in 1988.\n\nGoodlander and her husband Sullivan bought a house in 2018 in Portsmouth, which is in New Hampshire's first congressional district, according to the Concord Monitor. The Constitution does not mandate that a candidate live in the specific congressional district they are running in, just the state, but she recently started renting a home in Nashua, located in the second district, according to the Monitor.\n\nSullivan, Goodlander's husband, was also a top aide to Hillary Clinton ahead of the 2016 election. In 2015, former President Bill and Hillary Clinton, current U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and Breyer all attended the couple's wedding.\n\nVan Ostern, former New Hampshire Executive Council member and 2016 Democratic gubernatorial nominee, jumped into the race one day after Kuster announced she would not be seeking reelection.\n\nVan Ostern previously served as Kuster's campaign manager, and she endorsed him soon after his announcement. He has garnered over 300 public supporters, according to his campaign, including former Gov. John Lynch.\n\nState Sen. Becky Whitley announced her candidacy in April following a brief exploratory period. She is a progressive Democrat representing the Concord area who has pushed for reproductive freedom in the state.\n\nEight Republicans have announced their own candidacies for Congress, including Vikram Mansharamani and Lily Tang Williams.\n\nWilliams, from Weare, also ran for the seat in 2022, finishing third in the GOP primary.\n\nMansharamani is a businessman from Lincoln who ran for U.S. Senate in 2022. He finished fourth in the GOP primary then.\n\nCandidates can officially file for candidacy June 5-14. The primaries will be held Sept. 10, and the general election will be held along with the presidential election on Nov. 5.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Van_Ostern", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colin Van Ostern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashua,_New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nashua, New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashua, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becky_Whitley", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Becky Whitley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Kuster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annie Kuster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Council_of_New_Hampshire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive Council of New Hampshire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Breyer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Breyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separation of powers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_M._Tamposi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth M.

It's the city that my family has called home for over 100 years,\" Goodlander told the Boston Globe as she looked out the window of her Nashua living room during her first interview confirming her candidacy.\n\nA graduate of Yale University and Yale Law School, Goodlander worked as an advisor to US senators Joe Lieberman and John McCain, clerked for US Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, and served as a deputy assistant attorney general in the US Department of Justice before her stint at the White House.\n\nHer political campaign might catch the attention of an especially broad audience, since her husband, Jake Sullivan, was a top aide to Hillary Clinton ahead of the 2016 election and now serves as President Biden's National Security Advisor. Clinton delivered a reading at their 2015 wedding, where the guest list was a veritable who's-who of Democratic power players.\n\nNow that she has moved back to Nashua and launched her congressional bid, Goodlander is embarking on the next challenge of her career: convincing locals in the western half of New Hampshire, including Nashua and Concord, that she is well-rooted and well-suited to represent their interests on Capitol Hill.\n\nGoodlander held a rainbow-striped ceramic mug filled with tea as she pointed out her window to St. Joseph Hospital, where she was born; Nashua City Hall, where she cast her first vote for president, in 2008; and other sites where she said her family members settled and made a living over the years.\n\n\"This has always been my home and always will be,\" she said.\n\nGoodlander's family roots run deep in New Hampshire. Her grandfather Samuel Tamposi was a prominent real estate developer in Nashua, part-owner of the Boston Red Sox, and a major player in GOP politics. Her mother, Betty Tamposi, ran for congress as a Republican in 1988, but lost in the primary.\n\nGoodlander herself hasn't resided in New Hampshire's 2nd Congressional District for years. She and Sullivan bought a house in 2018 in Portsmouth, which is in the state's other congressional district.\n\nThey still own the house in Portsmouth, but Goodlander said she recently signed a lease for her home in Nashua.\n\n\"I am a renter, and there should be more renters in Congress,\" she added.\n\nIn the Democratic primary, Goodlander is up against former Executive Councilor and 2016 gubernatorial nominee Colin Van Ostern and current state Senator Becky Whitley. Van Ostern, who previously served as Kuster's campaign manager, already won her endorsement -- but Goodlander said that won't hold her back.\n\n\"I have always admired Annie,\" Goodlander said. \"She is a voter in this district, and I respect her choices. She's one voter, and I'm looking forward to making my case to all the voters in this district.\"\n\nVan Ostern and Whitley have each emphasized protecting reproductive health care and abortion access as key policy priorities for their campaigns, and Goodlander said that makes sense, given the patchwork of state laws that have emerged since the US Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion in 2022.\n\n\"For me, this has been a huge piece of my professional life, and it's deeply personal to me, too,\" Goodlander said. \"My husband, Jake, and I are trying to start a family.\"\n\nGoodlander said she learned on Christmas Day 2022 that she was pregnant, but it became clear about 20 weeks into the pregnancy that her baby would not survive. She did not undergo an abortion, but she said she experienced firsthand how difficult, stressful, and personal decisions about reproductive health care often are, even for those who have legal options, supportive family, and access to quality care.\n\n\"I cannot imagine there being any constraints on a person who is trying to make decisions that are just the most morally complicated, medically complicated,\" she said. \"To have any constraints at all in making a decision about what you have to do to save your own life is just, it's unthinkable. ... The current regime just doesn't make any sense.\"\n\nGoodlander also touted her work on antitrust issues for the DOJ, where she said she fought back against \"the kinds of abuses that big corporations are perpetrating on consumers and workers alike in the industries that matter most to hard-working people around the state.\" As one success story, she cited a federal appellate court's recent decision allowing the DOJ to reopen its investigation into the National Association of Realtors.\n\nSeveral candidates have stepped forward to run in the Republican primary for New Hampshire's 2nd Congressional District as well. They include Vikram Mansharamani, a businessman from Lincoln who finished fourth in the GOP's 2022 primary for US Senate, and Lily Tang Williams of Weare, who finished third in the GOP's 2022 primary for the 2nd Congressional District.\n\nThe filing period runs June 5-14, the primaries will be held Sept. 10, and the general election will be held Nov. 5, along with the presidential election.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Van_Ostern", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colin Van Ostern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashua,_New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nashua, New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashua, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jake Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Lieberman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Lieberman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associate_Justice_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_clerk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law clerk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Breyer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Breyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_Law_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yale Law School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Globe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Boston Globe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yale University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John McCain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concord,_New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Concord, New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Concord, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portsmouth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portsmouth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_M._Tamposi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth M.

Al Drago / Bloomberg via Getty Images file\n\nDemocrat Maggie Goodlander, a former senior official in the Biden White House and Justice Department, is on the verge of launching a primary campaign against the hand-picked, would-be successor to Rep. Annie Kuster, D-N.H., according to three sources familiar with her planning.\n\nThe move, which could come as early as this week, promises to bring national and international politics to the heart of a House race in New Hampshire, at a time when President Joe Biden is trying to keep the state's four electoral votes in his column.\n\nScott Merrick, an adviser to Goodlander, declined to confirm or deny that she will run -- but said a decision is coming soon. Kuster announced earlier this year that she was retiring.\n\n\"Maggie is thankful for the encouragement she's received from Granite Staters and will be making a decision in the coming days,\" Merrick said.\n\nGoodlander worked on domestic issues in the federal government -- on antitrust at the Department of Justice and on Biden's \"unity agenda\" at the White House -- but the connection to foreign policy comes through her marriage to national security adviser Jake Sullivan, who gives Biden counsel on hot-button issues such as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nBut Goodlander's path to Congress won't come without obstacles, starting with her Democratic primary opponent, Colin Van Ostern. The former member of the state executive council has already been endorsed by Kuster and dozens of current and former local officials.\n\nVan Ostern's campaign declined to comment for this story.\n\nWhile Goodlander's resume in the Biden administration is formidable, she also previously worked as a senior advisor to the late Sens. John McCain, a Republican, and Joe Lieberman, a Democrat-turned-independent.\n\nThough her multi-partisan resume might help in a likely competitive general election for the district, it could hurt her in the Democratic primary.\n\nPlus, operatives in the state have raised questions about how long its been since Goodlander actually lived and voted in the district. She's now registered to vote in New Hampshire's 1st District, which is not the one she's planning to run in.\n\nKuster has held her seat for over ten years, but it's still rated by the non-partisan Cook Political Report with Amy Walter as competitive, though \"Likely Democratic.\"\n\nOn the Republican side, several candidates are vying for the GOP nomination in the congressional race, including entrepreneur Vikram Mansharamani, who was the GOP's nominee for Senate in 2022.\n\nAnd though the state at large is usually considered solidly blue, New Hampshire's independent streak puts it on the fringes of the presidential battleground as well. In 2020, Biden won the state by just over seven percentage points.\n\nBiden visited the Granite State in March, after shunning the state's first-in-the-nation primary, while former President Donald Trump visited the state multiple times ahead of the GOP presidential primary there.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Annie Kuster, D-N.H., according to three sources familiar with her planning.\n\nThe move, which could come as early as this week, promises to bring national and international politics to the heart of a House race in New Hampshire, at a time when President Joe Biden is trying to keep the state's four electoral votes in his column.\n\nScott Merrick, an adviser to Goodlander, declined to confirm or deny that she will run -- but said a decision is coming soon. Kuster announced earlier this year that she was retiring.\n\n\"Maggie is thankful for the encouragement she's received from Granite Staters and will be making a decision in the coming days,\" Merrick said.\n\nGoodlander worked on domestic issues in the federal government -- on antitrust at the Department of Justice and on Biden's \"unity agenda\" at the White House -- and she was also a Navy intelligence officer and an aide to two senators known for their focus on foreign policy. But she also has a connection into the current policy debate over the Biden administration's positioning on hot-button issues such as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza through her marriage to national security adviser Jake Sullivan, who gives Biden counsel on those matters.\n\nBut Goodlander's path to Congress won't come without obstacles, starting with her Democratic primary opponent, Colin Van Ostern. The former member of the state executive council has already been endorsed by Kuster and dozens of current and former local officials.\n\nVan Ostern's campaign declined to comment for this story.\n\nWhile Goodlander's resume in the Biden administration is formidable, she also previously worked as a senior advisor to the late Sens. John McCain, a Republican, and Joe Lieberman, a Democrat-turned-independent.\n\nThough her multi-partisan resume might help in a likely competitive general election for the district, it could hurt her in the Democratic primary.\n\nPlus, operatives in the state have raised questions about how long its been since Goodlander actually lived and voted in the district. After leaving her White House job last month, she now lives in Nashua.\n\nKuster has held her seat for over ten years, but it's still rated by the non-partisan Cook Political Report with Amy Walter as competitive, though \"Likely Democratic.\"\n\nOn the Republican side, several candidates are vying for the GOP nomination in the congressional race, including entrepreneur Vikram Mansharamani, who was the GOP's nominee for Senate in 2022.\n\nAnd though the state at large is usually considered solidly blue, New Hampshire's independent streak puts it on the fringes of the presidential battleground as well. In 2020, Biden won the state by just over seven percentage points.\n\nBiden visited the Granite State in March, after shunning the state's first-in-the-nation primary, while former President Donald Trump visited the state multiple times ahead of the GOP presidential primary there.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

At least five Republicans also have announced their candidacies to represent the district, which stretches along the western half of the state and includes Concord and Nashua.", "source": {"uri": "messenger-inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@messenger-inquirer.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "holly_ramer@messenger-inquirer.com", "name": "Holly Ramer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Kuster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Annie Kuster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashua,_New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nashua, New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashua, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concord,_New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Concord, New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Concord, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/messenger-inquirer.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/b4/0b4b0dae-dc90-5c53-a0c3-a26d05bede56/663d148107b9d.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553584", "eventUri": "eng-9553584", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

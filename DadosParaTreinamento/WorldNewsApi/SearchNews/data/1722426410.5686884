Nevertheless, the Canadiens stole the show when they allowed five-time Grammy winner and Quebec native C\u00e9line Dion to announce the selection of Russian winger Ivan Demidov with the fifth overall pick in the first round. After a few extended pauses, the \u201cMy Heart Will Go On\u201d singer mustered out the selection of the 18-year-old forward. ESPN broadcaster John Buccigross was quick to react, calling it \u201cthe most dramatic draft announcement of all time.\u201d Demidov is set to join one of the league\u2019s most storied franchises, which has won 24 Stanley Cups but is still seeking its first since 1993. And he is bringing with him much talent. Demidov decimated the junior-level MHL in Russia, where he tucked away 23 goals and added 37 assists \u2014 totaling 60 points \u2014 in only 30 games this season. Scouting reports touted the stud as one of the most prolific Russian prospects in recent years. Nevertheless, Montreal wasn\u2019t the only one to add some flair on draft night. The Flyers followed suit with the 13th pick in the draft, where they brought out legendary ring announcer Michael Buffer. Buffer had the pleasure of pronouncing center Jett Luchanko of the OHL\u2019s Guelph Storm as the Flyers\u2019 selection. But, of course, he started his announced with his famous phrase, \u201cLet\u2019s get ready to rumble!\u201d \u201cWhat a way to enter the NHL, with Michael Buffer announcing your name,\u201d Buccigross said. Luchanko is coming off a successful junior ice hockey stint during which he scored 20 goals and 74 points in 68 games. He has proven to have exceptional hockey IQ alongside a solid two-way game. If Dion and Buffer are a harbinger of what\u2019s to come for the Canadiens and Flyers, the NHL is now on notice.", "summary": "Many NHL teams upped the ante on Friday night during the draft at The Sphere in Las Vegas.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/29/sports/celine-dion-wows-2024-nhl-draft-by-announcing-canadiens-pick/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/newspress-collage-oxy0zo58h-1719640126285.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1719625750&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:06:14", "author": "Sean Savage", "authors": ["Sean Savage"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.47}

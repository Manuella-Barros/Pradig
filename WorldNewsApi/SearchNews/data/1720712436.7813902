Dubbed a real-life Bogeyman by police, Ahmad Hassan, 28, left the youngster in fear of going to his bedroom alone, while his brother was so traumatized he vomited. Canterbury Crown Court heard the shocking discovery was made after they had returned home from trick or treating with their mom. Despite finding doors and windows open at the property in Folkestone, Kent, and the interior ransacked, the family believed the intruder had left. But then one of the boys was greeted by the \u201cmortifying\u201d sight under his bed. Police were alerted and found Hassan, by now in another bedroom, lying on the floor stretched out in a starfish position and still wearing the boy\u2019s orange pants. Hassan later denied burglary with intent to steal but was found guilty after a jury deliberated for just 40 minutes. He did not give evidence at his trial \u2013 where a police officer described him to jurors as \u201cthe Bogeyman\u201d \u2013 but Canterbury Crown Court heard he had been under the influence of drugs at the time. Now, on being jailed, a judge has told him she could not \u201cbegin to imagine\u201d how his young victim must have felt at what confronted him on October 31 last year. Prosecutor Alex Matthews told the sentencing hearing on Wednesday that the family returned home at about 9pm to find toys all over the floor, wet clothes in the hallway, and some of their own clothing and bedding disturbed. She said: \u201cIt was thought no one was in the house but, to the shock of one of the children, it transpired the defendant was hiding under the child\u2019s bed. \u201cObviously, the family was rather distressed. \u201cThe defendant was ultimately found in another son\u2019s bedroom and was clearly under the influence of drink or drugs.\u201d The court heard it was accepted Hassan had not forced entry as the homeowner believed she may have left a door open, and nothing was actually stolen. In her victim impact statement, made a few hours after the burglary, the mum revealed how she and her sons had been affected. They decided not to stay in the house that night and are believed to have since moved. She told police: \u201cI\u2019m still shaken, feeling extremely anxious, in shock and ultimately scared. I know the house is now safe but I\u2019m scared to go home. \u201cMy children are mortified. One will live constantly thinking someone is in the house. He didn\u2019t want to go back to his bedroom without me. \u201cMy other son threw up as a result of the fear he has been put through.\u201d Hassan, who has no previous convictions, was said to have lived in the UK for 11 years but was homeless at the time of the offence and leading a \u201cchaotic\u201d life. It is believed he changed into the boy\u2019s underwear as his own clothing was wet. Alexa Le Moine, defending, told the court the defendant was \u201cgenuinely remorseful\u201d for his actions. She said: \u201cOne cannot understate the intrusion into one\u2019s home \u2013 a safe place and refuge for this family. \u201cIt is hoped this has not impacted in the long term on her and her children. \u201cThis is, perhaps, a more unusual case in that he was found on the scene, made no attempt to escape, was asleep on the floor and plainly under the influence, which may be an explanation why he entered the premises and remained as he did.\u201d Her argument that Hassan could be spared immediate custody was rejected by Recorder Christine Wilson who jailed Hassan for two-and-a-half-years. Recorder Wilson said the intrusion into the family\u2019s \u201csafe space\u201d and his subsequent behaviour had resulted in significant psychological harm to all three victims. She told Hassan: \u201cIn this case, you didn\u2019t break into the property by damaging any door or window, and you didn\u2019t take anything away. \u201cBut you entered the property and ransacked a number of toys and garments, including the householder\u2019s underwear. \u201cYou took off all your clothes and put on a pair of orange underpants belonging to one of the small children in the family and then you hid under a child\u2019s bed. \u201cI cannot begin to imagine what it must have been like for that child, on returning home on Halloween from trick or treating, finding a person naked, apart from that child\u2019s own underpants, under their bed.\u201d Hassan, who is of no fixed address, was also handed a 10-year restraining order.", "summary": "A 'Bogeyman' burglar discovered hiding under a boy's bed - naked apart from the child's own pants - has been jailed.\u00a0", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/09/world-news/bogeyman-burglar-jailed-after-being-found-under-boys-bed-in-the-childs-pants/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/newspress-collage-gx1mlekl0-1717942628294.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1717928267&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ecv9Exyn-RyIcpnTz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:37:01", "author": "SWNS", "authors": ["SWNS"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.522}

The Anyone But You actor, 35, recently appeared on Jake Shane\u2019s Therapuss Podcast, where he shared the revolting tale. The anecdote \u2013 about a man using \u2018black market lotion that breaks down skin for human consumption\u2019 on his date \u2013 understandably shocked the host. The actor said: \u2018You want to hear a crazy story? My little sister was friends with a girl who went on a date with a guy. They\u2019re hanging out, and he\u2019s super charming. \u2018They have a great night, and she goes back to his apartment that night and he\u2019s like, \u201cHey, can I give you a massage?\u201d As she got back to his apartment, she started getting weird vibes. Something feels off.\u2019 He continued as the host of the podcast listens with wide eyes: \u2018He starts massaging her shoulders [\u2026] Everything just feels odd. She\u2019s like, \u201cI gotta get out of here.\u201d He gets a little weird \u201clike, no, please don\u2019t leave, sorry,\u201d she leaves.

She goes to the doctor [\u2026] It turns out it\u2019s a black market lotion that breaks down skin for human consumption,\u2019 the Hit Man actor said, causing Shane to gasp in horror. \u2018This man was rubbing lotion on her body to eat her. The doctor is like \u201cYou have to give me this person\u2019s address and you should call the police.\u201d They go to this guy\u2019s house, and he had several bodies in the house,\u2019 Powell says in conclusion.

Sorry.\u2019 Lol I knew that Glen Powell cannibal story sounded familiar. When he first started the story I kept saying to myself it sounded like the internet urban legend about the girl who had sex with a guy who was a necrophiliac\u2014 Kar (@karlogan_) June 9, 2024 I regret to inform you all the Glen Powell cannibal date story isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t true, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an urban legend he heard. Sorry. https://t.co/HUAjbnqIsA pic.twitter.com/y7XeTitoP4\u2014 Alex Zalben (@azalben) June 9, 2024 Thankfully, the doubters ended up being correct, with a fact check on Snopes revealing that Powell\u2019s story is a variation of an urban legend that has existed for a long time. It remains unclear whether or not Powell knew the story was fake when he told it (Picture: Hubert Vestil/Getty Images) The original story is even more twisted than Powell\u2019s version, with the biggest change being that the date isn\u2019t a cannibal, but a necrophiliac who causes a rash in his victim by infecting her with a parasite only found in human corpses. Even if the Snopes article didn\u2019t thoroughly debunk Powell\u2019s story, it only takes a little critical thinking to realise that the idea of a lotion that prepares human skin for consumption is, admittedly, pretty nonsensical. While it remains unclear whether Powell was aware that he was telling an urban legend or if he really believed it, we can all rest easy knowing there\u2019s almost certainly no truth to the story.

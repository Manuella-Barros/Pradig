Amidst divorce rumors, her recent Instagram posts and cryptic messages fuel speculation about their relationship status\n\nActress and model Natasa Stankovic has recently come under fire for not publicly congratulating her husband, cricketer Hardik Pandya, following India's T20 World Cup victory. In response to the speculation surrounding her marriage, Natasa addressed the issue in a video shared on her Instagram story, where she mentioned that she was 'going through a certain situation.'\n\nNatasa has faced significant backlash for her silence regarding Hardik's crucial role in the team's win. Recently, she posted a video discussing feelings of being 'lost' and shared a passage from the Bible. In the video, she explained that she got excited to read something she needed to hear that day, which prompted her to bring the Bible with her to read aloud. She quoted the passage, which stated that the Lord goes before you and will be with you, and that he will never leave you nor forsake you. She emphasized that during difficult situations, one often feels discouraged, disappointed, sad, and lost, but God is with you and has a plan.\n\nA few days earlier, Natasa shared her first social media post since India's T20 World Cup win. The post featured photos of herself in a stylish outfit, captioned as a 'fit check.' However, many followers were quick to question her silence on the World Cup victory, with comments asking why she had not posted anything related to the World Cup and why there was no appreciation post for Hardik's achievement.\n\nRumors about Natasa and Hardik's possible divorce have been circulating for some time, although neither has made an official statement. The couple, who married on May 31, 2020, renewed their vows in February 2023 according to Hindu and Christian rituals. Speculation about their relationship intensified after Natasa removed her full name from her Instagram profile.\n\nALSO READ: Anant Ambani, Radhika Wedding: Bride-to-be dances; Mukesh-Nita on cloud nine at Mameru ceremony - WATCH", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandya_dynasty", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pandya dynasty"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ritual"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://static-ai.asianetnews.com/images/01j1khwqesb726h7rj7d8008n3/Natasha-stankovic-instagram-post-1719716961753.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705645", "eventUri": "eng-9705645", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-05-31", "textStart": 1837, "textEnd": 1849}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Fans have been buzzing with questions about their dynamic, especially after Natasa remained silent on social media following Team India's T20 World Cup win. Natasa, who is currently in Mumbai where Team India celebrated their victory with an open bus roadshow, added to the speculation by posting a story on her Instagram right before the team's arrival in New Delhi.\n\nDespite her past support for Hardik during IPL and India games, Natasa's absence from this year's events has led to rumors about their relationship status. Fans have been quick to criticize her for not acknowledging Hardik's T20 World Cup win, with some even speculating about a possible divorce. However, neither Hardik nor Natasa has addressed these rumors, leaving fans to continue speculating about the state of their relationship.\n\nAfter the Indian team returned from Barbados on July 4, Natasa took to Instagram to share a cryptic post, which has been a common theme on her social media feed recently.\n\nThe post included a video of her preparing for an event, along with a message that hinted at something significant.\n\n\"God, fix me when I'm the problem, and protect me when I'm not,\" the message read.\n\nRumors circulated about Pandya video calling Natasa from the field after the final match against South Africa in Barbados, sparking speculation about the status of their relationship. However, the truth behind these rumors remains unknown, leaving fans to ponder the nature of their connection.\n\nHardik Pandya faced criticism and boos from fans during the IPL 2024 season when he was appointed captain of the Mumbai Indians, replacing Rohit Sharma. The team's poor performance, finishing at the bottom of the table, only added to the backlash against Pandya. However, he made a remarkable comeback during the T20 World Cup, showcasing his all-round abilities and playing a crucial role in India's victory.\n\nIn the T20 World Cup final, Pandya defended 16 runs against formidable opponents like David Miller and Keshav Mahraj, securing a thrilling 7-run win for India in Barbados. Despite his lackluster performance in the IPL, where he scored only 216 runs and took 11 wickets in 14 matches, Pandya excelled in the T20 World Cup, scoring 144 runs and taking 11 wickets throughout the tournament.

This silence has fueled rumors about possible issues in their marriage.\n\nOn Wednesday, Natasa took to Instagram Stories to address these speculations indirectly. She shared a heartfelt message about facing difficult times. In the video, she expressed how \"certain situations\" can leave one feeling \"discouraged, disappointed, sad, and often lost.\"\n\nHolding a Bible, she read a passage to her followers: \"I got super excited to read something that I really needed to hear today and that's why I brought the Bible with me in the car because I wanted to read it to you all and it says: 'It is the Lord who goes before you and he will be with you, he will never leave you nor forsake you; do not fear or be dismayed'.\"\n\nShe further said, \"Whenever we're going through certain situations we become discouraged, disappointed, sad, and often lost. God is with you. He is not surprised at what you're going through right now because he already has a plan. He will never leave you or forsake you.\"\n\nDespite being active on Instagram, Natasa's decision not to post about India's T20 World Cup victory has led to renewed rumors of a split between her and Hardik. The couple, who married on May 31, 2020, and have a son named Agastya, faced similar rumors earlier this year.

Pandya played a pivotal role in India's journey to clinch their second T20 World Cup title, showcasing his skills with a crucial performance of 3 wickets in the thrilling final against South Africa.\n\nAfter the ICC awarded the team \u20b920 crore, the BCCI's announcement of additional rewards, six times that amount, sparked a flurry of discussions across social media platforms. However, amidst the celebratory buzz, some fans chose to tease Pandya with memes related to rumors about his personal life, particularly focusing on alleged marital discord with his wife, Natasa Stankovic.\n\nOne meme humorously suggested that Pandya should direct the BCCI to transfer his prize money to his mother's account to safeguard it from potential financial claims in case of a divorce. Speculation had been rife, fueled by reports that Natasa had removed Pandya's surname from her social media profiles. Neither Pandya nor Natasa has addressed these rumors publicly.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by ADULTGRAM \ud83d\ude09 (@_adultgram_)\n\nAdding to the speculation, rumors circulated that Natasa could potentially claim a significant portion of Pandya's wealth if they were to divorce. A viral video further fueled speculation, showing Pandya mentioning that his mother handles his finances. Natasa's absence from congratulating Pandya on his stellar performance in the T20 World Cup final and her decision to stay in Mumbai with their son rather than accompany him to the West Indies also fueled speculations about their relationship.\n\nIn response to media reports claiming she had removed all photos with Pandya from her social media, Natasa made headlines by unarchiving their wedding photos, clarifying the situation. This move highlighted the speculative nature of social media gossip surrounding celebrity relationships.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by @natasastankovic__\n\nWhile the Indian cricket team basks in the glory of their T20 World Cup triumph and the associated financial rewards, the off-field drama surrounding Pandya's personal life continues to captivate public interest. This underscores the intersection of sports and celebrity culture in today's digital age, where players' personal lives often face intense scrutiny amidst their professional achievements.\n\nSEE ALSO: After Hardik Pandya's T20 Win, Wife Natasa Stankovic Shares Cryptic Message; 'God Already Has A Plan'", "source": {"uri": "in.mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandya_dynasty", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pandya dynasty"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Board of Control for Cricket in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://sm.mashable.com/mashable_in/seo/7/75629/75629_gr28.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705645", "eventUri": "eng-9705645", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

God is with you. He is not surprised at what you're going through right now because he already has a plan.\"\n\nThe rumors have escalated since Stankovic did not post any congratulatory message for the Indian team after India's recent T20 World Cup win against South Africa. Despite being an active Instagram user, she did not dedicate any story or post for her husband, despite his crucial role in the final.

The central and southeastern U.S. is where warm, moist air masses originating from the Gulf of Mexico meet dry air that originates over the Rocky Mountains. Clashes between the two create some degree of instability in the environment, producing rapid upward air motion.\n\nWe saw more than 100 tornado reports across the US in the past week. When does tornado season begin?\n\nTypically, the tornado season begins around March in the southeastern United States, and the area most likely to experience severe weather will migrate westward towards the central and southern plains.\n\nOnce we get to summer months, especially June, we will begin to see various severe weather events from tornadoes to strong, damaging winds to large hail at higher latitudes in the plains like Colorado.\n\nIs it usual to have so many tornadoes?\n\nIt is somewhat surprising that we are seeing so many tornadoes. We are currently exiting a strong El Ni\u00f1o winter, a natural climate phenomenon typically associated with a lower likelihood of severe weather and tornado activity in the Central Plains.\n\nDuring El Ni\u00f1o, the atmosphere can produce a strong subtropical air current.\n\nAny waves or fluctuation along the subtropical jet stream that makes the jet wavy can create an environment that facilitates the production of severe weather and tornadoes in the spring. This is what caused the tornadoes across the country over the last couple of weeks.\n\nAre we expecting more tornadoes in the following months?\n\nIt's a little bit too early to say for sure, but if the subtropical jet stream stays relatively active, there could be a prolonged active period of tornadoes.\n\nHere in Colorado, we typically see the largest number of severe weather events in the months of May and June. We have a greater likelihood of tornadoes, extreme hail and strong, damaging wind gusts during that period. So that's something to keep an eye on in the next few weeks.\n\nDoes climate change increase the frequency and intensity of tornadoes in the US?\n\nThere are a lot of uncertainties about how climate change will impact storm-scale severe weather events such as tornadoes. Part of the reason is that most of our climate models don't have fine enough resolution to simulate a tornado.\n\nWhat we can do is look at, on a large scale, how those different atmospheric ingredients that must come together to develop severe weather might change in the future climate.\n\nSome research has shown that we should expect a shift in tornado activity further east from the traditional tornado alley in the central U.S. So we might see a greater likelihood of tornado activity in the Mississippi River Valley region and the southeastern U.S.\n\nWhat are some things we can do to help communities become more resilient to severe weather events like tornadoes?\n\nWe need to raise awareness for individuals, especially those who live in places that aren't traditionally susceptible to tornadoes but may become more susceptible with changes to the atmospheric circulation.\n\nThe first thing in terms of preparation is to have multiple ways to receive severe weather warnings. That means not just relying on hearing a tornado siren as your only option, but making sure you have emergency notifications activated on your phone and you follow local meteorologists or National Weather Service accounts on social media.\n\nThink ahead of time about where you're going if a tornado happens. Sometimes with these severe weather situations, you only have a few minutes of warning time to act before that threat is on top of you.\n\nYou want to go to a room in the most interior part of your house, away from windows or below ground if that's an option. If you're in a more vulnerable structure, know if there are other community shelters available.\n\nThere's a lot of emphasis right now in the weather and atmospheric science community on improving the way we communicate the potential for severe weather. People are getting their information in many different ways nowadays.\n\nTraditionally, most people would tune in to local news if they see a storm coming. Now they are getting information through their phone's alert system and social media.\n\nWe also need to make sure those communication methods are accessible to diverse audiences. That means including warnings and watches in multiple languages, and making sure that there are avenues to disseminate those warnings and watches to all communities.", "source": {"uri": "knowridge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Knowridge Science Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Severe weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_shear", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wind shear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_climatology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tornado climatology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_direction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wind direction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jet stream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado_Boulder", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Colorado Boulder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni\u00f1o", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "El Ni\u00f1o"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Plains", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Plains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oceania"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_mass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air mass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subtropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocky Mountains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bird migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric science"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://knowridge.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Whats-with-the-recent-wild-tornadoes.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549671", "eventUri": "eng-9549671", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

A particularly severe tornado struck Oklahoma in the middle of night, resulting in the deaths of at least four individuals and injuries to over 300 due to severe thunderstorms and high winds.\n\nAs states like Colorado enter their severe weather season, Andrew Winters, an assistant professor in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Colorado, Boulder provided insights into the formation of tornadoes, the potential impacts of climate change on these severe weather events, and strategies for better preparation.\n\nTornadoes are rapidly spinning air columns connected to severe thunderstorms. They often develop in zones of strong \"wind shear,\" where wind direction and speed sharply change with altitude. These shears are drawn into thunderstorms, helping to spin up the air and form tornadoes that reach the ground.\n\nThe U.S. hosts an environment highly conducive to tornadoes, more so than most other places worldwide, though they also occur in South America and parts of Europe.\n\nThe highest risk is in the central and southeastern states where warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico meets dry air from the Rockies, creating instability and promoting strong upward air motions.\n\nTornado season typically kicks off in March in the southeastern U.S. and moves westward to the central and southern plains by late spring. By June, severe weather including tornadoes, strong winds, and hail shifts to higher latitudes such as Colorado.\n\nHowever, the recent surge in tornado activity is somewhat unexpected, especially coming out of a strong El Ni\u00f1o winter, which usually correlates with reduced severe weather in the Central Plains.\n\nWhile it is too early to accurately predict future tornadoes, ongoing activity in the subtropical jet stream could signal more frequent tornadoes in the coming months.\n\nThe impact of climate change on tornadoes is still unclear due to the high resolution required by climate models to accurately simulate these events. However, shifts in atmospheric conditions could move tornado activity eastward from the traditional Tornado Alley to areas like the Mississippi River Valley.\n\nThus, enhancing awareness and improving severe weather communication is necessary to avoid the risks associated with tornadoes.\n\nWinters emphasized the importance of multiple warning systems, including emergency notifications on phones and following local weather services on social media. Preparation also involves planning safe spaces in homes or community shelters for rapid access during a tornado.\n\nAs communication methods evolve, it is crucial to ensure that weather warnings reach diverse audiences through accessible and multilingual formats. The community and meteorological experts are focusing on refining these strategies to better prepare populations for the threats posed by severe weather.\n\nTornadoes are among the most violent and unpredictable natural phenomena on Earth. They are rapidly rotating columns of air that extend from a thunderstorm to the ground and are capable of immense destruction due to their high winds.\n\nThe formation of tornadoes typically involves a severe thunderstorm, known as a supercell, which contains a rotating updraft called a mesocyclone. Under the right conditions, this mesocyclone can tighten and intensify, potentially lowering a funnel cloud that becomes a tornado once it touches the ground.\n\nTornadoes are rated based on their intensity and the damage they cause, using the Enhanced Fujita scale, which ranges from EF0 for the weakest to EF5 for the most powerful. These storms can uproot trees, destroy buildings, and hurl objects and debris at high speeds, making them highly dangerous.\n\nThe central United States, particularly in an area known as Tornado Alley, is famously prone to tornadoes, but they can occur almost anywhere in the world under the right meteorological conditions.\n\n-- -\n\nLike what you read?

An active pattern - with atmospheric waves moving through at 30,000 feet above the ground - was \"bringing everything together.\"\n\nBrooks and Cogil point out the patterns are different every year.\n\n\"Some years it's more active to the south or to the north,\" Cogil said. This year, Iowa has been in \"a very active pattern.\"\n\n\"The jet stream is in close proximity and we've seen a lot more storms,\" Cogil said. \"We've got a good stream of moisture coming up from the Gulf of Mexico and interacting with the jet stream and producing these tornadoes we've seen.\"\n\nThe national average for May is 275 tornadoes, and the storm center has amassed roughly 90 reports so far.\n\nIt remains to be seen how the rest of May plays out, Brooks said, because it's difficult to predict long range activity in the spring.\n\nDinah Voyles Pulver covers climate and the environment for USA TODAY.

Texas has claimed the top spot with 67, followed by Iowa (60), Kansas (55) and Nebraska (54). Oklahoma trails Ohio at No. 6 with 48 twisters. And the tornado totals for Ohio do not reflect any confirmed out of strong storms Tuesday night.\n\nOhio has endured several strong storms that spawned twisters so far this year, including several that popped up before tornado season officially began in April. Here's a look at some of them:\n\nIn Ohio, tornado season peaks between April and June, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nKristen Cassady, meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Wilmington, Ohio, said previously that it is typical for severe weather frequency to ramp up in Ohio at the beginning of March, though March is not a peak tornado season month.\n\n\"We typically do see severe weather events including tornadoes in the month of March, even though there is a slightly higher frequency climatologically in April and May,\" Cassady said. \"March is still one of the primary months for tornadoes in the Ohio Valley.\"\n\nThrough early April, Ohio had 22 tornadoes touch down, according to Brandon Peloquin, a warning coordination meteorologist at the NWS office in Wilmington, the most for this early in the year. The previous record was 12 tornadoes in 1986, WBNS TV-10 reports. The average number of tornadoes in a single year for Ohio is 21, Peloquin said previously.\n\nThe worst year for tornadoes in Ohio was 1992, when 62 twisters touched down, Peloquin said previously.\n\nThe strongest that year was an EF4 tornado that hit Van Wert County in Western Ohio on Feb. 18. With wind speeds of 166 to 200 mph, the tornado was on the ground for 2.8 miles and caused six injuries but no fatalities. It destroyed a house, a mobile home and two cars, and damaged nine homes, according to Tornado Talk.\n\nAdding the five tornadoes confirmed by the NWS in late April to the 22 reported in early April, Ohio's total for the year so far, per NWS data, is 27 tornadoes. That obviously differs from NOAA data.\n\nPeloquin said some databases may show a higher number because tornadoes that cross county lines may be counted multiple times. As an example, he said a single continuous tornado that moves from Auglaize County into Logan County is just one tornado but may be counted in some databases as two since it affected two counties.",

An active pattern - with atmospheric waves moving through at 30,000 feet above the ground - was \"bringing everything together.\"\n\nBrooks and Cogil point out the patterns are different every year.\n\n\"Some years it's more active to the south or to the north,\" Cogil said. This year, Iowa has been in \"a very active pattern.\"\n\n\"The jet stream is in close proximity and we've seen a lot more storms,\" Cogil said. \"We've got a good stream of moisture coming up from the Gulf of Mexico and interacting with the jet stream and producing these tornadoes we've seen.\"\n\nThe national average for May is 275 tornadoes, and the storm center has amassed roughly 90 reports so far.\n\nIt remains to be seen how the rest of May plays out, Brooks said, because it's difficult to predict long range activity in the spring.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType":

Texas has claimed the top spot with 67, followed by Iowa (60), Kansas (55) and Nebraska (54). Oklahoma trails Ohio at No. 6 with 48 twisters. And the tornado totals for Ohio do not reflect any confirmed out of strong storms Tuesday night.\n\nTornado season in Ohio off to a strong start in 2024\n\nOhio has endured several strong storms that spawned twisters so far this year, including several that popped up before tornado season officially began in April. Here's a look at some of them:\n\nIn Ohio, tornado season peaks between April and June, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nKristen Cassady, meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Wilmington, Ohio, said previously that it is typical for severe weather frequency to ramp up in Ohio at the beginning of March, though March is not a peak tornado season month.\n\n\"We typically do see severe weather events including tornadoes in the month of March, even though there is a slightly higher frequency climatologically in April and May,\" Cassady said. \"March is still one of the primary months for tornadoes in the Ohio Valley.\"\n\nOhio sees record number of tornadoes for the first three months of 2024\n\nThrough early April, Ohio had 22 tornadoes touch down, according to Brandon Peloquin, a warning coordination meteorologist at the NWS office in Wilmington, the most for this early in the year. The previous record was 12 tornadoes in 1986, WBNS TV-10 reports. The average number of tornadoes in a single year for Ohio is 21, Peloquin said previously.\n\nWhat is Ohio's record for most tornadoes in a year?\n\nThe worst year for tornadoes in Ohio was 1992, when 62 twisters touched down, Peloquin said previously.\n\nThe strongest that year was an EF4 tornado that hit Van Wert County in Western Ohio on Feb. 18. With wind speeds of 166 to 200 mph, the tornado was on the ground for 2.8 miles and caused six injuries but no fatalities. It destroyed a house, a mobile home and two cars, and damaged nine homes, according to Tornado Talk.\n\nNational Weather Service data shows different total\n\nAdding the five tornadoes confirmed by the NWS in late April to the 22 reported in early April, Ohio's total for the year so far, per NWS data, is 27 tornadoes. That obviously differs from NOAA data.\n\nPeloquin said some databases may show a higher number because tornadoes that cross county lines may be counted multiple times. As an example, he said a single continuous tornado that moves from Auglaize County into Logan County is just one tornado but may be counted in some databases as two since it affected two counties.",

While all tornadoes are dangerous, meteorologists reserve \"violent\" for those with the two highest ratings on the Enhanced-Fujita scale - EF4 or EF5.\n\nThat's because these strongest tornadoes are capable of devastating damage, such as crushing and throwing vehicles, leveling well-built homes, even sweeping foundations clean. These select few tornadoes are estimated to have peak winds of 166 mph or higher.\n\nThis long-track tornado from a supercell thunderstorm, began southeast of Hominy, Oklahoma, then heavily damaged homes and a wax plant on the east side of Barnsdall. Some trees were found to be stripped of bark and denuded of all vegetation, typical of the most intense tornadoes. The tornado then went on to track into the southern and eastern sides of Bartlesville.\n\n- Path length: 27 miles from southwest of Marietta to east of Baum\n\n- 1 killed\n\nThe EF4 rating was due to damage sustained at a Dollar Tree warehouse and a retail store in Marietta after consultation with an engineer, according to NWS-Norman warning coordination meteorologist Rick Smith.\n\nThis was one of at least 130 confirmed tornadoes in the April 25-28 Plains outbreak.\n\n(Further beef up your forecast with our detailed, hour-by-hour breakdown for the next 8 days - only available on our Premium Pro experience.)\n\nSome caveats: MyRadar Weather and Washington Post meteorologist Matthew Cappucci noted the NWS-San Angelo, Texas, office has consulted with a structural engineer regarding the May 2 tornado near Hawley, Texas. NWS offices usually consult with engineers for suspected more intense tornadoes to inform their final damage ratings.\n\nThen there's the nature of rating tornadoes. As weather.com meteorologist Jonathan Belles wrote, the EF scale can only estimate a tornado's peak winds from the damage it inflicts, since we don't have thousands of weather instruments capable of measuring every tornado's wind speed at the ground.\n\nThat means if the tornado doesn't hit anything well constructed, it may not be rated highly even if it was a stronger tornado.\n\nThat came to light with an April 30 tornado in southwest Oklahoma. Despite its spectacular presentation in radar imagery, including an adjacent tornado that spun the opposite direction, a damage survey from the NWS-Norman office could only find EF1 damage in its wake.\n\nFew in numbers, thankfully: These intense tornadoes are pretty rare. This century, the U.S. has averaged only 5 to 6 violent tornadoes per year, about 0.5% of the nation's total.\n\nIn 2018, there were no EF4 or EF5 tornadoes anywhere in the U.S. It was the only year without a single violent tornado dating to 1950.\n\nAlmost 90% of tornadoes from 2000 through 2022 were weak -- rated F/EF0 or F/EF1 -- but they're still capable of light to moderate damage to trees and homes, and significant damage to mobile homes.\n\n(For even more granular weather data tracking in your area, view your 15-minute details forecast in our Premium Pro experience.)\n\nBut they're often deadly: From 2000 through 2023, the most recent year in which finalized tornado death counts are available from NOAA's Storm Prediction Center, this tiny fraction of tornadoes was responsible for roughly half of all U.S. tornado deaths.\n\nThe death toll from these 126 violent tornadoes (850 lives) exceeded the death toll from the other 27,317 tornadoes combined (820 lives). Put another way, each F/EF4 tornado killed an average of four or five people, while F/EF5 tornadoes killed an average of 37.\n\nSpring is peak time: We examined the 646 violent tornadoes in NOAA's database from 1950 through 2023 to see if there was a peak time of year.\n\nWe found a broad peak from April through early June, during which 59% of violent tornadoes occurred.\n\nMultiple violent tornadoes can often cluster in higher-end outbreaks, accounting for some of this spring peak. Among these historic outbreaks include:\n\nThe 25 deadliest tornadoes on record in the U.S. all occurred from mid-March through June.\n\nWhy spring: Spring typically provides a prime overlap of ingredients in the southern and central U.S. needed to generate the intense, rotating supercell thunderstorms that can spawn violent tornadoes.\n\nIncreasingly warm, humid air streaming northward out of the Gulf of Mexico is topped by cold, dry air aloft and a powerful jet stream pivoting out of the West. This provides the instability needed to generate thunderstorms.\n\nIn these cases, wind shear -- the change in wind speed and direction with height -- is intense. This allows supercells to form and provides the spin needed to stretch and tilt into tornadoes.\n\nViolent tornadoes are much less common from mid-summer through fall and winter, but they can happen any time of year if the volatile setup is in place. They have occurred in every month, including winter.\n\nFor example, Christmas Eve F4 tornadoes tore through parts of Arkansas and Missouri in 1982 and Tennessee in 1988.\n\nTop states: It should come as no surprise where violent tornadoes occur most often.\n\nFrom 1950 through 2023, the conventional Plains \"Tornado Alley\" states of Oklahoma, Texas, Iowa and Kansas had the largest number of violent tornadoes.\n\nElevated violent tornado counts also extend eastward into the Ohio Valley and a southern corridor that includes Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee.\n\nDamage from at least one violent tornado has been observed in 33 of 50 states.\n\nViolent tornadoes are less common east of the Appalachians but have occurred as far north as Massachusetts and upstate New York, and as far south as Florida.\n\nJust one violent tornado has been documented from the Rockies to the West Coast.\n\nOn July 21, 1987, an F4 tornado reportedly uprooted 1 million trees as it ripped a path across the Teton and Yellowstone areas of northwestern Wyoming. The tornado affected elevations between 8,500 and 10,000 feet, making it the highest altitude that a violent tornado has been documented.", "source": {"uri": "weather.com", "dataType": "news",

(Mike Simons/Tulsa World via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON (TND) -- Tornadoes, the unpredictable natural phenomena capable of devastating landscapes in mere moments, remain a perpetual concern for communities across the United States, especially during this time of year. While they can strike at any time and in any location, statistics reveal that 70% occur during March through June.\n\nIn April alone, the National Weather Service Prediction Center reported over 300 tornadoes. According to the National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center, the monthly average stands at 182. The only time the U.S. witnessed more tornadoes in April was in 2011, with a staggering count of 757.\n\nZooming out to assess broader patterns, on an average year, approximately 1,200 tornadoes sweep through the nation. Scientists struggle with understanding the complex mechanisms behind tornado formation, making it challenging to understand whether tornadoes are occurring more frequently than in the past. As of now, there is no clear historical or scientific evidence that tornadoes have become more common or damaging.\n\nOfficial tornado records only date back to 1950, and while there may be an increase in recorded tornadoes today compared to previous decades, the majority fall under the weakest category, EF0.\n\nThe damages associated with tornadoes are often extremely expensive. Indeed, President Biden last week declared a major disaster in Nebraska after tornadoes tore through the state, meaning federal funding will be available to those affected.\n\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), since 1980 there have been 378 weather and climate disasters resulting in damages that reached or exceeded $1 billion. The total cost of the disasters was around $3 trillion. From 2018 to 2023, 17 of those billion-dollar disasters were tornadoes.\n\nMost recently, damages from the tornadoes in Oklahoma, Iowa and Nebraska are expected to cost over $2.1 billion. Some of the costs will be covered by insurance, some by city and state governments, and the federal government is providing assistance through FEMA.\n\nThe most expensive tornado in the U.S. was in Joplin, Missouri in 2011, costing close to $3 billion. When adjusting for inflation, however, it cost closer to $4 billion. The second most expensive tornado was in Tuscaloosa, Alabama that same year, costing nearly $2.5 billion, or over $3 billion adjusted for inflation.", "source": {"uri": "bakersfieldnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KBAK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "konner_mcintire@bakersfieldnow.com", "name": "Konner Mcintire", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "courtney_rau@bakersfieldnow.com", "name": "Courtney Rau", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_World", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tulsa World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Prediction_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Storm Prediction Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State governments of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Fujita_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enhanced Fujita scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Emergency Management Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joplin,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joplin, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Joplin, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscaloosa,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tuscaloosa, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tuscaloosa, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Disaster_Relief_and_Recovery", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Disaster Relief and Recovery", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://bakersfieldnow.com/resources/media/bf24a5f0-8d26-41e2-abe5-468b98cbf36e-large16x9_AP24128711630495.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549671", "eventUri": "eng-9549671", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The significant risk to lives and property will continue.\n\nAs of daybreak Wednesday, there have been close to 500 preliminary reports of severe weather since the start of Monday, which encompasses tornadoes, high winds and hail. Of these there have been nearly 50 reports of tornadoes. Perhaps the strongest tornado of the outbreak thus far -- an EF4 -- hit Bansdall, Oklahoma, on Monday evening with winds estimated up to 200 mph. The multiday outbreak has claimed the life of one person and injured several others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe midweek severe weather has the potential to be the biggest day in terms of impact and the number of incidents ranging from tornadoes to damaging winds and hail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccuWeather has highlighted a high-risk area for Wednesday, where widespread severe weather and tornadoes have been anticipated for many days in advance.\n\nRelated Michigan Gov. Whitmer declares state of emergency over tornado damage Central U.S. braces for more severe weather, tornadoes Hot summer expected to bring above-average temperatures to U.S.\n\nThe high-risk zone extends from southeastern Missouri and northeastern Arkansas through southern Illinois, western and central Kentucky and northwestern and middle Tennessee.\n\nOne key aspect affecting impact is that the severe weather and tornado potential will focus on more densely populated areas than the Great Plains. At least 75 million people are at risk of experiencing severe weather on Wednesday from the Central states to parts of the East.\n\n\"There could easily be over a dozen tornadoes produced at midweek alone,\" AccuWeather chief on-air meteorologist Bernie Rayno warned.\n\nSevere weather is expected to reach outward from the bull's-eye, which will be around the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, northward to the Interstate 70 corridor of the Midwest, eastward to the mid-Atlantic coast and southwestward to northeastern Texas.\n\nMajor cities at risk of severe weather on Wednesday include Nashville and Memphis, Tennessee Louisville and Paducah, Kentucky Cincinnati Indianapolis and Evansville, Indiana St. Louis and Cape Girardeau, Missouri Little Rock and Texarkana, Arkansas Springfield, Illinois and Dallas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe key factors behind Wednesday's severe weather threat are a strong jet stream overhead, a warm front and plenty of moisture.\n\n\"This high-risk tornado and large hail zone stretches along where a warm front will lift slowly northward,\" Rayno said, \"Warm fronts are notorious for producing tornadoes and large hail in this setup.\" A warm front represents the back edge of retreating cool air.\n\nShould this zone be free of clouds and downpours for several hours during the afternoon and evening, that could be enough to trigger powerful, discrete thunderstorms. These types of storms often develop rotation, which can trigger tornadoes.\n\nIt is possible for any tornado that forms in the lower Ohio, Tennessee and mid-Mississippi valleys to become strong and on the ground for more than a few minutes. The longer the tornado is on the ground, the greater the chance of it coming in contact with homes, farms and businesses.\n\nThere can be a significant risk to lives and property even where tornadoes do not touch down. Powerful straight-line wind gusts are much more common in severe thunderstorms than tornadoes. These winds reaching hurricane force (74 mph or greater) can uproot trees, break large tree limbs and damage roofs. Some storms can also pack hailstones the size of golf balls and baseballs, which can break windows, damage vehicles severely and destroy newly planted crops.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlash flooding is one of the leading causes of weather-related fatalities, and there is a large area at risk of flooding due to the widespread nature of the thunderstorms through Wednesday night.\n\n\"How intense some of the storms become will depend on the number of competing showers and thunderstorms in the first place,\" AccuWeather long-range meteorologist Paul Pastelok said. \"Because of the large number of storms producing torrential downpours, which can repeat for several hours, this setup has the potential to produce flash flooding on par with the severe weather.\"\n\nSome locations in the Ohio and Tennessee valleys may be hit by downpours for three days in a row by Thursday, which is the final day of the outbreak for part of the region.\n\nPortions of Kentucky, Tennessee and southern Missouri may receive 2-4 inches of rain and locally higher amounts from the repeating rounds. Much of that rain could fall in a few hours.\n\nIn the wake of the severe weather into Thursday in part of the Midwest, a pattern much less conducive for widespread outbreaks will settle in for much of the rest of May.

Scientists are trying to figure out why.", "body": "NEW YORK - Tornadoes tend to travel in packs these days, often with a dozen or more forming in the same region on the same day. On the worst days, hundreds can form at once.\n\nMore than a dozen tornadoes were reported on May 6 and May 7 across the Great Plains and the Midwest, according to the Storm Prediction Center run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Two weeks ago, on the most active day in April, 105 tornadoes were reported.\n\nWhile outbreaks like these have always happened, they have become more common in recent decades.\n\nThe total number of tornadoes in the United States each year has stayed relatively consistent over the last several decades, but they now happen in more concentrated bursts over fewer days during the year.\n\nIn the 1950s through the 1970s, on average about 69 per cent of tornadoes in the US happened on days with fewer than 10 tornadoes, and about 11 per cent happened on days with 20 or more tornadoes. These percentages have shifted significantly in recent decades, according to a 2019 study.\n\nThe researchers found that since 2000, on average only about 49 per cent of tornadoes have happened on less busy days, and about 29 per cent have happened on days with 20 or more tornadoes.\n\n\"Now when tornadoes happen, they often happen in an outbreak environment,\" said Dr Tyler Fricker, an assistant professor of geography at the University of Louisiana Monroe and one of the authors of the study.\n\nWhile the timing of this trend lines up with the planet's rising temperatures, scientists are hesitant to definitively attribute tornadoes' clustering behaviour to human-caused climate change.\n\n\"The link between climate change and tornadoes is still pretty tenuous,\" Dr Fricker said. \"It's a really open and difficult question for us.\" One difficulty is that tornadoes are too small on a planetary scale, and too ephemeral, to show up in the global mathematical models that scientists use to study climate change.\n\nResearchers can, however, look at patterns in the historical record. As more tornadoes cluster together, busy outbreak days are getting busier, according to Dr Zoe Schroder, an assistant professor of meteorology at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. \"When we do get these outbreaks, they're often larger, meaning that they have more tornadoes in them,\" she said.\n\nScientists can also look at how atmospheric conditions that lead to tornadoes are changing.\n\nThere are two main ingredients to tornadoes, said Dr Jana Houser, an associate professor of meteorology at the Ohio State University. The first is atmospheric instability caused by warm, moist air close to the ground meeting colder, dry air above. The second is vertical wind shear, or changes in wind speed and direction at different altitudes.\n\nAs the climate changes, there might be fewer days with both these ingredients. \"But when we have conditions that are favorable, they're almost supercharged,\" Dr Houser said, leading to more tornadoes on fewer days.\n\nTornadoes are also spreading farther east from the region people have historically thought of as \"Tornado Alley\", the Great Plains states running south to north from Texas to the Dakotas. (Central Canada also experiences tornadoes, but fewer than the US)\n\nIn the past several weeks, tornadoes have struck not just the Great Plains but also parts of the Midwest, Appalachia and the South-east.\n\nSpring is typically the busiest time of year for tornadoes. \"It's not completely out of the ordinary for us to have a very active season right now,\" Dr Schroder said.\n\nSo far in 2024, the United States has had a total of 639 tornadoes. That's slightly more than average for this time of year but far fewer than the worst year on record, 2011, when there had already been 1,287 tornadoes by May 7.\n\nDr Houser emphasised, however, that although there are seasonal and geographic patterns, tornadoes \"can and do occur anywhere\" in the US.

While they can strike at any time and in any location, statistics reveal that 70% occur during March through June.\n\nIn April alone, the National Weather Service Prediction Center reported over 300 tornadoes. According to the National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center, the monthly average stands at 182. The only time the U.S. witnessed more tornadoes in April was in 2011, with a staggering count of 757.\n\nZooming out to assess broader patterns, on an average year, approximately 1,200 tornadoes sweep through the nation. Scientists struggle with understanding the complex mechanisms behind tornado formation, making it challenging to understand whether tornadoes are occurring more frequently than in the past. As of now, there is no clear historical or scientific evidence that tornadoes have become more common or damaging.\n\nOfficial tornado records only date back to 1950, and while there may be an increase in recorded tornadoes today compared to previous decades, the majority fall under the weakest category, EF0.\n\nThe damages associated with tornadoes are often extremely expensive. Indeed, President Biden last week declared a major disaster in Nebraska after tornadoes tore through the state, meaning federal funding will be available to those affected.\n\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), since 1980 there have been 378 weather and climate disasters resulting in damages that reached or exceeded $1 billion. The total cost of the disasters was around $3 trillion. From 2018 to 2023, 17 of those billion-dollar disasters were tornadoes.\n\nMost recently, damages from the tornadoes in Oklahoma, Iowa and Nebraska are expected to cost over $2.1 billion. Some of the costs will be covered by insurance, some by city and state governments, and the federal government is providing assistance through FEMA.\n\nThe most expensive tornado in the U.S. was in Joplin, Missouri in 2011, costing close to $3 billion. When adjusting for inflation, however, it cost closer to $4 billion. The second most expensive tornado was in Tuscaloosa, Alabama that same year, costing nearly $2.5 billion, or over $3 billion adjusted for inflation.", "source": {"uri": "ktul.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTUL"}, "authors": [{"uri": "courtney_rau@ktul.com", "name": "Courtney Rau", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "konner_mcintire@ktul.com", "name": "Konner Mcintire", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Prediction_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Storm Prediction Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Fujita_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enhanced Fujita scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State governments of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Emergency Management Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joplin,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joplin, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Joplin, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscaloosa,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tuscaloosa, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tuscaloosa, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://ktul.com/resources/media/261e53c3-cce1-40c2-9e12-e092b77b3ba7-large16x9_AP24129523922326.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549671", "eventUri": "eng-9549671", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

During an unusual night of weather, strong storms led to hazardous tornadoes, and Tillman County experienced several of them, which exhibited strange behavior.\n\nTwo of these tornadoes showed unexpected movements. One powerful column of air rotated back and crossed its previous path again. Meanwhile, the other unusual tornado circled in what is typically considered the wrong direction.\n\nAccording to meteorologist Rick Smith from the National Weather Service in Norman, Oklahoma, this event is not something that happens every day. What makes it more unusual is that both of these odd twisters came from a single powerful thunderstorm.\n\nWhat caused this weird weather event? Scientists discovered that a supercell thunderstorm developed close to the Oklahoma-Texas border and traveled eastward. The thunderstorm created a large and extremely dangerous tornado that formed north of Loveland, Oklahoma.\n\nAs showcased by radar images, this tornado headed to the east before considerably slowing down. Then, it turned north and west and finally looped over a location it had previously hit. Storms generally move from west to east, but powerful ones can sometimes return to the west as they start to lose strength. Another uncommon feature of this event is that the column of air completed an entire loop back over its path.\n\nAccording to Smith, it is not common to witness nearly stationary tornadoes since they almost always go wherever the supercell thunderstorm goes. However, the storms on April 30 were barely moving, creating an environment where a tornado could develop, stroll around, and redevelop.\n\nThis particular tornado not only churned in the wrong direction while moving forward. It also resulted in tell-tale damage signatures on radar imagery, indicating that it lifted debris thousands of feet into the air. Fortunately, the violent twisters unfolded over a sparsely populated area, so there were no reported cases of structural damage, injuries, or deaths.\n\nREAD ALSO: Tornado Disaster Impact Could Triple By The End Of The Century: Current Study Reveals The Fact\n\nThe rotation of the Earth affects weather patterns and ocean currents. Since our planet rotates on its axis, circulating air is deflected in one direction and appears to move at a curve. This phenomenon is called the Coriolis Effect, a force that causes an apparent deflection of the path of an object that moves within a rotating coordinate system.\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, tornadoes typically spin counterclockwise or cyclonically. On the other hand, those found in the Southern Hemisphere rotate clockwise. These patterns are not followed for anticyclonic tornadoes, so they spin clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, only about one percent of tornadoes are believed to be anticyclonic.

Scientists are trying to figure out why. - The Boston Globe", "body": "While outbreaks like these have always happened, they have become more common in recent decades.\n\nThe total number of tornadoes in the United States each year has stayed relatively consistent over the last several decades, but they now happen in more concentrated bursts over fewer days during the year.\n\nIn the 1950s through the 1970s, on average about 69% of tornadoes in the U.S. happened on days with fewer than 10 tornadoes, and about 11% happened on days with 20 or more tornadoes. These percentages have shifted significantly in recent decades, according to a 2019 study. The researchers found that since 2000, on average only about 49% of tornadoes have happened on less busy days, and about 29% have happened on days with 20 or more tornadoes.\n\n\"Now when tornadoes happen, they often happen in an outbreak environment,\" said Tyler Frick, an assistant professor of geography at the University of Louisiana Monroe and one of the authors of the study.\n\nWhile the timing of this trend lines up with the planet's rising temperatures, scientists are hesitant to definitively attribute tornadoes' clustering behavior to human-caused climate change.\n\n\"The link between climate change and tornadoes is still pretty tenuous. It's a really open and difficult question for us,\" Fricker said. One difficulty is that tornadoes are too small on a planetary scale, and too ephemeral, to show up in the global mathematical models that scientists use to study climate change.\n\nResearchers can, however, look at patterns in the historical record. As more tornadoes cluster together, busy outbreak days get busier, according to Zoe Schroder, an assistant professor of meteorology at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. \"When we do get these outbreaks, they're often larger, meaning that they have more tornadoes in them,\" she said.\n\nScientists can also look at how atmospheric conditions that lead to tornadoes are changing.\n\nThere are two main ingredients to tornadoes, said Jana Houser, an associate professor of meteorology at the Ohio State University. The first is atmospheric instability caused by warm, moist air close to the ground meeting colder, dry air above. The second is vertical wind shear, or changes in wind speed and direction at different altitudes.\n\nAs the climate changes, there might be fewer days with both these ingredients. \"But when we have conditions that are favorable, they're almost supercharged,\" Houser said, leading to more tornadoes on fewer days.\n\nTornadoes are also spreading farther east from the region people have historically thought of as \"Tornado Alley,\" the Great Plains states running south to north from Texas to the Dakotas. (Central Canada also experiences tornadoes, but fewer than the U.S.)\n\nIn the past several weeks, tornadoes have struck not just the Great Plains but also parts of the Midwest, Appalachia and the Southeast.\n\nSpring is typically the busiest time of year for tornadoes. \"It's not completely out of the ordinary for us to have a very active season right now,\" Schroder said.\n\nSo far in 2024, the United States has had a total of 639 tornadoes -- slightly more than average for this time of year but far fewer than the worst year on record, 2011, when there had already been 1,287 tornadoes by May 7.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embry\u2013Riddle_Aeronautical_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Embry\u2013Riddle Aeronautical University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mathematical model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Louisiana_at_Monroe", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Louisiana at Monroe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meteorology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dakotas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Dakotas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_instability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric instability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_Alley", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tornado Alley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Appalachia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Plains", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Plains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_shear", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wind shear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/fTqeAHwVCOfVBluWS2BCHUSgov8=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/7U5GXRXA2NOZNZ57OMKRML7QWM.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549671", "eventUri": "eng-9549671", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 3251, "textEnd": 3256}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Meteorologists expect a slew of storms to wallop the central U.S. with torrential rain, hail and possible tornadoes beginning Wednesday afternoon and continuing through the night.\n\nThe tornadoes are part of a multi-state outbreak that began May 6 and has spawned dozens of tornado reports since. More than 22 million people were under a tornado watch Wednesday.\n\nPortions of eight states - Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee - were under a tornado watch Wednesday afternoon, meaning conditions are ripe for tornadoes to form. Several tornado warnings were issued across portions of Tennessee, where at least two tornadoes were spotted, the National Weather Service said. Emergency management officials in Lamar County, Texas, also reported a brief tornado touchdown Wednesday evening.\n\nClaiborne County's emergency management office in Tennessee told USA TODAY a 22-year-old man died after a tree fell on his vehicle while he was driving around 10:30 a.m. Wednesday. Another person died and four others were injured in Maury County, Tennessee, after a tornado touched down. Three people suffered non-life-threatening wounds and one is in serious condition, according to the Maury County Regional Hospital.\n\nOne person in North Carolina died in the storm Wednesday after a tree fell on a car, according to Gaston County officials. Another person was rescued and transported to the hospital. The county declared a state of emergency Wednesday evening after hazardous weather caused severe damage to several communities and left nearly 45% of customers without power.\n\nSeveral supercell thunderstorms were sweeping across south-central Kentucky and Middle Tennessee, the weather service said at 7 p.m. Wednesday, and storms were expected to continue into the evening with large hail, damaging winds and some tornadoes. Supercells are the least common type of thunderstorm and tend to produce hazardous weather.\n\nMichigan tornadoes wreak havoc\n\nWorkers inside a FedEx facility in Michigan managed to escape unharmed after it partially collapsed as tornadoes ripped through Kalamazoo County, less than 60 miles south of Grand Rapids. Nearby, a tornado hit a mobile home community, injuring up to 20 people who were hospitalized with non life-threatening injuries. Around 176 properties were damaged, 17 of which were completely destroyed, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller in a video posted on Facebook.\n\n\"We found homes in the roadway, we found homes in neighbor's homes,\" said Fuller, urging residents to stay home as officials continue to search for people and survey the damage across the county.\n\nIn southern Ohio, officials were surveying damage after two suspected tornadoes destroyed homes, toppled trees and snapped utility poles. Storms flooded some local areas, and emergency response personnel conducted multiple rescues. Tornadoes were also reported in Arkansas, Indiana and West Virginia.\n\nTornadoes, hail, damaging wind forecast for parts of Central US\n\nNearly 20 million people from northeastern Texas to Missouri and Kentucky were at enhanced or moderate risk of severe storms on Wednesday, according to the Storm Predication Center. The powerful thunderstorms were expected to bring tornadoes, giant hail and damaging winds, with the highest risk throughout Missouri, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky and Tennessee, the prediction center said.\n\nThe cities facing potentially the worst impacts include Nashville, Memphis, St. Louis, Louisville and Little Rock, according to the weather service. A vast swath of the central and eastern U.S., from Texas to Georgia and up through New England was at slight risk of experiencing some of the poor weather.\n\nAs of 2 p.m., there were reports of overturned trees causing damage to some homes and other buildings in Tennessee, according to the weather service. In Grainger County, just outside Knoxville, officials reported many downed powerlines, and hail the size of tennis balls pelted Clarksville, Tennessee, as the Storm Prediction Center tracked hail storms across the Central U.S.\n\nDamage from wind gusts were also reported in Kentucky and Missouri, where meteorologists picked up winds speeds of 67 mph. Several school districts in Tennessee either ended classes early or called off all after school activities, according to the Tennessean, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nFlooding from intense rainfall was reported in parts of Middle Tennessee, prompting some water rescues. The Red River near Port Royal Tennessee rose more than 20 feet Wednesday and is expected to crest at moderate flood stage at 38 feet. At least four other local streams in the region rose 6-8 feet in a matter of hours, according to data from the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nThrough the day and into the evening, meteorologists anticipate multiple rounds of severe thunderstorms to slam the Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee valleys. Across Oklahoma, Arkansas and Texas, thunderstorms are forecast to develop by late afternoon. Along with the winds, rain and possible tornadoes, hail larger than 3 inches in diameter are a threat as the system shifts eastward through the evening.\n\nFlood watches were in effect across Kentucky, Tennessee and Missouri through Thursday, according to the weather service. Some local areas may get 2 to 5 inches of total rainfall.\n\n'The early warnings saved lives'\n\nIn St. Joseph County, just south of Kalamazoo, a tornado destroyed seven structures, mostly homes, Branch County Emergency Manager Tim Miner told the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network. There were no reports of serious injuries or deaths from the storms, which some credited to early prompt weather advisories.\n\n\"The early warnings saved lives,\" said Ernie Ostuno, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Grand Rapids. \"The warnings went out and people reacted to them.\"\n\nMore than 101,000 homes and business in North Carolina were without power Wednesday evening, according to a USA TODAY database. About 40,000 utility customers in Tennessee also reported outages.\n\nThe looming storm system spun up at least eight tornadoes in Michigan; others were reported in Arkansas, Ohio and West Virginia, according to the National Weather Service. Powerful storms pummeled the Plains region on Monday, spinning up multiple tornadoes that killed at least one person in Oklahoma, flattened homes in multiple states and caused widespread power outages.\n\nTornado warning safety tips\n\nWhile there's no such thing as guaranteed safety, the weather service says there are things people can do to increase their chances of surviving a deadly tornado:\n\n\u220e Protect yourself from flying or falling debris, the single biggest life-threatening hazard.\n\n\u220e Seek shelter in the closest, safest interior or underground room.\n\n\u220e Always avoid windows.

The cities located in that tornado watch include Jacksonville, Florida; Savannah, Georgia; and Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nIn Texas, a cluster of storms is expected to fire up Thursday afternoon and evening then progress west across the Gulf Coast states through the overnight hours. The main threats are significant wind gusts to 85 mph and very large hail up to 4 inches, though a couple of tornadoes cannot be ruled out.\n\nA tornado watch has also been issued for parts of Texas, including Dallas, Waco and Abilene, through 9 p.m. CT Thursday.\n\nThe latest severe weather threat comes after three people were killed in storms on Wednesday.\n\nOne person died in Claiborne County, the Tennessee Department of Health said.

(WKRN) -- Severe weather in Middle Tennessee is nothing new, but over the last few years, we've noticed a number of the strongest tornadoes to hit the region have come late at night or overnight.\n\n\"In Tennessee, about 46% of our tornadoes happen during the overnight hours,\" said Ryan Husted, warning coordination meteorologist for the National Weather Service (NWS) in Nashville.\n\nHusted said nighttime tornadoes can pose an even bigger threat since many people are sleeping and may not be aware of the danger that's headed their way.\n\nAccording to a study from Northern Illinois University, nocturnal tornadoes are nearly twice as deadly as those that happen during the day.\n\n\"We're third in the nation in tornado deaths because of those overnight tornadoes,\" Husted said.\n\nMonday's tornadoes in DeKalb and Wilson counties happened during the afternoon, however, that's not always the case. Back in March 2020, an EF-3 tornado struck Davidson, Wilson and Smith counties just after midnight leading to five deaths in those places.

Here's what it looks like", "body": "(CNN) -- It started in Utah, of all places. A whirling tendril of air descended from a roiling sky above a southwest suburb of Salt Lake City, punctuating the horizon. It was a tornado - the first of many over the course of weeks.\n\nA tornado frenzy is ongoing in the United States. At least one has been reported every day since the morning of April 25 in Salt Lake City - a more than two-week streak - and there have been hundreds.\n\nApril and May are typically the busiest months for tornadoes in the US, Earth's tornado epicenter, but the pace since April has been exceptional.\n\nThe US was behind the typical tornado pace before the streak started, but after more than 300 tornado reports, it is now above it.\n\nMeteorologists and engineers sifting through the reports and damage to accurately reconstruct one of Mother Nature's most violent phenomena have confirmed 200 tornadoes so far during the streak.\n\nA prolific tornado outbreak accelerated matters on April 26. A third of the streak's reported tornadoes happened on that day in the Plains. Sixty-two have been confirmed, including powerful EF3s that carved a path through entire neighborhoods and businesses in Nebraska and decimated the tiny Iowa town of Minden, killing one person there.\n\nMore than 100 tornadoes hit the Heartland as the streak began at the end of April, a $1 billion disaster on its own, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It capped off an April with 300 tornadoes that tore into the earth in more than a dozen states east of the Rockies, the second-most ever recorded in the typically tornadic month.\n\nThere have been so many tornadoes that a handful of places have been hit or threatened to be hit twice, including Minden. Barnsdall, Oklahoma, is the most devastating example of this dangerous d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\n\nAn EF1 tornado hit the town on April 1. A month later, an EF4 tornado with winds of 165 to 175 mph cut through the core of the small town, upending homes and livelihoods. At least one person died.\n\nTornadoes as strong as the one in Barnsdall are exceptionally rare and deadly. Only 2% of tornadoes reach the so-called \"violent\" status of EF4 or EF5. This streak has had two. The first hit Marietta, Oklahoma, on April 27, killing one person. It was the first EF4 tornado in the US in more than a year.\n\nMay only brought more of the same: A rare Level 5 of 5 high risk for severe weather on May 6 spawned the Barnsdall EF4 and the first of four tornado emergencies this week, including the first-ever one in Michigan.\n\nThe streak continued for a 15th consecutive day Thursday when a tornado was spotted in southern Georgia in the early afternoon.

That number is \"a bit on the high side,\" said Craig Cogil, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Des Moines who tracks the state's tornado numbers. As the storm reports are verified in the weeks ahead, Cogil said that number will drop down to the low 40s.\n\nEven if the final number ends up near 40, Cogil said it would still be a record. The previous high for April was 40, set in 2001. The state's average for the entire year is around 50, he said.\n\nOne death was reported in April, during an outbreak on the 26th, Cogil said.\n\nOther states that saw dozens of tornadoes in April were Nebraska (47), Kansas (38), Oklahoma (38) and Missouri (33). Kentucky and Texas each had 22.\n\nAt just one week into May, the storm center's data shows 32 preliminary tornado reports in Texas, where the monthly average for May is 38, and 10 in Michigan, where the monthly average for May is 3.\n\nThe Michigan tornadoes on Tuesday demolished mobile homes in a neighborhood near Portage, Michigan, and heavily damaged a FedEx distribution facility.\n\nAll the right ingredients have been in place, Brooks said. An active pattern - with atmospheric waves moving through at 30,000 feet above the ground - was \"bringing everything together.\"\n\nBrooks and Cogil point out the patterns are different every year.\n\n\"Some years it's more active to the south or to the north,\" Cogil said. This year, Iowa has been in \"a very active pattern.\"\n\n\"The jet stream is in close proximity and we've seen a lot more storms,\" Cogil said. \"We've got a good stream of moisture coming up from the Gulf of Mexico and interacting with the jet stream and producing these tornadoes we've seen.\"\n\nThe national average for May is 275 tornadoes, and the storm center has amassed roughly 90 reports so far.\n\nIt remains to be seen how the rest of May plays out, Brooks said, because it's difficult to predict long range activity in the spring.\n\nDinah Voyles Pulver covers climate and the environment for USA TODAY.

Here's what it looks like", "body": "CNN --\n\nIt started in Utah, of all places. A whirling tendril of air descended from a roiling sky above a southwest suburb of Salt Lake City, punctuating the horizon. It was a tornado - the first of many over the course of weeks.\n\nA tornado frenzy is ongoing in the United States. At least one has been reported every day since the morning of April 25 in Salt Lake City - a more than two-week streak - and there have been hundreds.\n\nApril and May are typically the busiest months for tornadoes in the US, Earth's tornado epicenter, but the pace since April has been exceptional.\n\nThe US was behind the typical tornado pace before the streak started, but after more than 300 tornado reports, it is now above it.\n\nMeteorologists and engineers sifting through the reports and damage to accurately reconstruct one of Mother Nature's most violent phenomena have confirmed 200 tornadoes so far during the streak.\n\nPowerful tornado crosses I-80 near Lincoln, Nebraska. Adam Lucio/LSM\n\nA prolific tornado outbreak accelerated matters on April 26. A third of the streak's reported tornadoes happened on that day in the Plains. Sixty-two have been confirmed, including powerful EF3s that carved a path through entire neighborhoods and businesses in Nebraska and decimated the tiny Iowa town of Minden, killing one person there.\n\nMore than 100 tornadoes hit the Heartland as the streak began at the end of April, a $1 billion disaster on its own, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It capped off an April with 300 tornadoes that tore into the earth in more than a dozen states east of the Rockies, the second-most ever recorded in the typically tornadic month.\n\nThere have been so many tornadoes that a handful of places have been hit or threatened to be hit twice, including Minden. Barnsdall, Oklahoma, is the most devastating example of this dangerous d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\n\nAn EF1 tornado hit the town on April 1. A month later, an EF4 tornado with winds of 165 to 175 mph cut through the core of the small town, upending homes and livelihoods. At least one person died.\n\nThe Crowder family sift through and recover lost items after their home was struck by a tornado on May 07, 2024 in Barnsdall, Oklahoma. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nTornadoes as strong as the one in Barnsdall are exceptionally rare and deadly. Only 2% of tornadoes reach the so-called \"violent\" status of EF4 or EF5. This streak has had two. The first hit Marietta, Oklahoma, on April 27, killing one person. It was the first EF4 tornado in the US in more than a year.\n\nMay only brought more of the same: A rare Level 5 of 5 high risk for severe weather on May 6 spawned the Barnsdall EF4 and the first of four tornado emergencies this week, including the first-ever one in Michigan.\n\nThe streak continued for a 15th consecutive day Thursday when a tornado was spotted in southern Georgia in the early afternoon.

Here's what you need to know for Thursday:\n\nNearly 22 million people from Central Texas to the Georgia coast were under an enhanced risk for severe weather, the third level of risk out of five, on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center.\n\nBeginning in the afternoon, the nearly 200,000-square-mile region will face a variety of weather threats, including large hail, damaging winds -- some potentially greater than 75 miles per hour -- and the possibility of tornadoes.\n\nMore than 12 million people in parts of Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee and Georgia were under a tornado watch Thursday morning.\n\nAfter storms overnight Wednesday into Thursday morning, more than 200,000 customers across five states, including Georgia, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee were without power, according to PowerOutage.Us.\n\nThe storms in the Midwest and South on Wednesday killed at least three people and brought intense rain, winds and hail to some areas. The previous day, widespread storms tore through the Midwest and tornadoes ripped through Michigan.\n\nOne storm-related death was reported in Gaston County, N.C., just west of Charlotte, while another person was killed in Claiborne County, in northeast Tennessee, after a tree fell on a vehicle. A third person died Wednesday evening in Maury County, Tenn., after a large tornado was spotted near Spring Hill, about 35 miles south of Nashville.\n\nMultiple cities across the region have also faced heavy rain that flooded roads and set off a wave of flood warnings and watches.\n\nEarlier this week, over a dozen tornadoes ripped through the Midwest, including in Michigan, where storms damaged nearly 200 mobile homes and temporarily trapped dozens of FedEx workers inside a building. One tornado that was up to two miles wide ripped through a community in Barnsdall, Okla., a city about 40 miles northwest of Tulsa, killing one person.\n\nThis week, the atmosphere has created the right ingredients for tornadoes. That includes warm, moist air close to the ground and cool, dry air higher up, along with vertical wind sheer, which is the change in wind speed or direction.\n\nTornado outbreaks like those over the last few days have become more common in recent decades, and scientists have been studying why they have been coming in bunches.\n\nResearchers are hesitant, however, to blame tornadoes' clustering

The alarming spate of violent weather was documented with 13 tornado reports and numerous other instances of hail and damaging winds, as noted by a national weather channel. The turmoil also led to significant disruptions in air travel, with McGhee Tyson Airport reporting 31 delays, Charlotte Douglas International Airport seeing 72 delays and 2 cancellations, and Raleigh-Durham International Airport accounting for 18 delays.\n\nThe severity of these storms was underscored by Tornado Emergencies declared in Tennessee and Alabama. A poignant incident occurred in Tennessee's Claiborne County where a life was lost after a tree fell on a vehicle, as local news reported. In North Carolina, Gaston County witnessed a similar tragic event where a tree crushed a car, resulting in a fatality. Additionally, a significant tornado in Columbia, Tennessee, resulted in one death and injured four others.\n\nThe aftermath saw almost 240,000 people without power across the Southeast, data from a utility tracking website shows. The aftermath of the storms also forced numerous schools to close or delay openings due to floodwaters and damage to infrastructure. Social media was abuzz with images of the destruction, including shots of large hailstones.\n\nWarnings for tornadoes and severe thunderstorms were constant throughout Wednesday, with alerts extending into the night. The dark proved no barrier to the tornadoes, debunking the myth of their rarity at night, affecting states from Missouri to Texas. The National Weather Service in Nashville highlighted the critical nature of the situation with a tornado watch issued for several states including Arkansas, Mississippi, and Missouri, lasting into early Thursday.\n\nAdding to the week's severe weather incidents, the National Weather Service confirmed tornado touchdowns in Western Ohio on Tuesday night, following a severe tornado earlier in the week in an Oklahoma town, illustrating the widespread nature of the current weather patterns.\n\nThis week has been marked by intense weather activity, making it one of the most severe in terms of weather disruptions this year, with nearly 400 reports of damaging winds, hail, and tornadoes, especially impacting Tennessee, southern Illinois, and northern Alabama among other states.", "source":

The report said the survey was difficult due to \"several supercell thunderstorms moving across the same area and each producing weak tornadoes.\"\n\nThe report concluded by adding that the tornadoes observed in Shelby, Decatur and Rush counties could have been on the ground for longer periods of time but the open farmland in the rural areas prevented the survey team from moving forward in some sections.\n\nNWS said witnesses described seeing \"small, rope tornadoes and bouncing across the landscape.\"\n\nRush County\n\nStorm damage was largely restricted to southern Rush County where NWS received reports that multiple softwood pine trees were snapped around 10 feet above the ground and that some homes and barns had sustained minimal damage. The report added that one barn in the area had its metal roofing pulled back and thrown off.\n\nNWS classified one of the tornadoes that landed in a soybean farm field near 635 East as an EFU for unknown because no damage occurred, making it difficult for survey crews to accurately rate the storm and provide a wind speed.\n\nA brief tornado was observed in the area and struck a metal barn, causing debris to fly in multiple directions before dissipating in a nearby field to the east.\n\nShelby County\n\nNWS said it received reports describing multiple small to medium-sized trees that were found either uprooted or missing large limbs. A few homes had gutters torn off and a barn sustained some roof damage.\n\nDecatur County\n\nNWS reported that multiple power lines were damaged along 550 East and North 700 East while some larger trees were left with broken branches.\n\nSurveys are set to continue throughout the rest of the week, likely increasing the count for the Hoosier State.", "source": {"uri": "fox59.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox 59"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tyler_haughn@fox59.com", "name": "Tyler Haughn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Fujita_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enhanced Fujita scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_County,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rush County, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rush County, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decatur,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Decatur, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Decatur, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby_County,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shelby County, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shelby County, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Severe weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Paul,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint Paul, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint Paul, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby_County,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shelby County, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shelby County, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greensburg,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greensburg, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greensburg, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supercell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decatur_County,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decatur County, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Decatur County, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soybean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soybean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pine"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Marketing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Marketing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Geomatics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Geomatics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Barns_and_Structures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Barns and Structures", "wgt": 11}], "image": "https://fox59.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/05/Tuesday-Tornadoes.png?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549671", "eventUri": "eng-9549671", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

But, if you prepare for it, that makes it a little bit different -- knowing that you can survive because you made a plan.\"\n\nFor Ouellette and his wife, the plan was to get to the basement, and they barely had time, he said. They were heading toward the room they figured to be the safest when the tornado lifted his childhood home off its foundation over their heads.\n\nWhile his wife suffered some broken bones, he still marvels at how lucky he and she were to walk away.\n\nNow, as people from Dowagiac to Portage to Colon are dealing with the aftermath of what witnesses described as tornadoes, Ouellette said he knows just what those people are going through.\n\n\"You know what they're feeling and you know what's going on and what they're thinking and, oh God, it's horrible,\" he said. \"I wouldn't wish it on anybody.\"\n\nTornadoes in northern Michigan aren't rare, and an average of about two to three occur each year in the National Weather Service's 25-county forecast area around Gaylord: That's roughly every one within a triangle from Manistee to Chippewa to Arenac counties, plus Gladwin County.\n\nBut NWS records show many of those funnel clouds were weak, rating as EF-0 or EF-1 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, with winds of 65 to 85 mph or 86 to 110 mph, respectively. And some years have passed with no tornadoes in that Gaylord forecast area.\n\nAndy Sullivan, a meteorologist at the Gaylord NWS office, said two big factors are behind the rarity of powerful tornadoes like the one that hit Gaylord on May 20, 2022.\n\n\"Being surrounded by three big Great Lakes, that usually brings in cooler air for most of the year,\" he said.\n\nThat can change by summer's end as the lakes are warming up, but in spring and early summer when severe weather is more common, those colder waters hamper its formation, he said.\n\nAnother reason is that humid air from the Plains region to the Ohio River Valley can only get so far north, Sullivan said.\n\nBeing rare doesn't mean it's impossible, though. In fact, it's just the opposite.\n\n\"The chances are, we will see another one, whether it's this year or next year, five years, 10 years -- there'll be another destructive tornado that hits northern Michigan,\" he said.\n\nTransitioning from an El Ni\u00f1o-influenced winter can up the chances for severe weather, especially the supercell thunderstorms that can spawn tornadoes, said Tiffani Wilke, a Northwestern Michigan College professor of meteorology and Earth science.\n\n\"So I'm anticipating tornado season this year to just be intense through the entire summer and progressively moving further north,\" she said.\n\nWilke said wave patterns in the atmosphere are more common coming out of an El Ni\u00f1o winter. They can form deeper troughs in the atmosphere known as short-wave troughs -- picture a long, curvy line of relatively low air pressure.\n\nThose troughs, in turn, can intensify weather systems by letting in warm, moist air to the east and allowing frontal boundaries to form. Cold fronts can produce lift, and if surface winds are blowing in a different direction than winds higher in the atmosphere, that produces directional shear.\n\nShear causes rotation, a key ingredient for a supercell thunderstorm, Wilke said. It's typical to see a line of storms following a cold front as it sweeps west, called a squall line. If the line bows in the middle, a supercell can form at the northern end.\n\nWhile tornadoes that likely hit southern Michigan weren't part of such a squall line, that's what moved across Michigan in May 2022, Wilke said.\n\nTemperatures throughout the Lower Peninsula climbed into the 80s that day, according to the NWS.\n\nMeteorologists at NWS' Gaylord station launched a weather balloon just before thunderstorms moved in back then. The data showed wind shear of 57 knots, whereas 35 knots or more boosts the formation of severe thunderstorms.\n\nIt was one of a rare combination of factors that fueled the weather that caused the calamity nearly two years ago, killing two and injuring 44.\n\n\"For our area, that's a pretty significant tornado to have that far north,\" Wilke said. \"We up here typically don't get those more damaging types of storm systems.\"\n\nHad anyone ever told Ouellette that Gaylord would one day be hit by an EF-3 twister, he would have called them crazy, he said.\n\nNow that he's lived it, he's seen how important preparation can be.\n\nHe had several pointers, from understanding what your property insurance policies cover and don't, to having a cell phone handy, as landlines can be felled by storms, and keeping a stash of emergency supplies like water, food, toiletries and other essentials.\n\nAnd Ouellette routinely checks weather forecasts.\n\nKnowing where to go in a tornado and occasionally practicing through drills is important, too, Sullivan said.\n\nWilke said she's all too familiar with the terror factor of tornadoes, having completed her graduate degree in Norman, Okla. But, for all the fear they evoke, studies show even the massive tornadoes common in other states are very survivable -- if people plan ahead.\n\n\"People get really scared and I strongly believe in respecting the tornado, respecting Mother Nature,\" she said, \"but also knowing that, as long as you take the proper safety protocols, surviving a tornado is really high.\"", "source": {"uri":

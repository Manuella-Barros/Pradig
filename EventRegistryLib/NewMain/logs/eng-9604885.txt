As Rosaleen -- the daughter of Molly Sullivan, played by series regular Johannah Newmarch -- Laverock appeared in the show's first season in early 2014 and returned as a young adult in 2023 for season 10. She also appeared in 2018's \"Wedding of Dreams\" with Debbie Gibson, Robert Gant, and Pascale Hutton.\n\nOn May 14, Nicole and Rob Compton -- Laverock's mom and stepfather from Vancouver, British Columbia -- posted a GoFundMe campaign that provided vague details on the \"medical emergency\" their daughter had suffered. They requested financial help so they could be with Laverock daily during an extended hospitalization.\n\nSadly, they have now shared on the page that a tragic event at the hospital on May 26 has resulted in their daughter suffering \"life threatening injuries.\" Some of Laverock's Hallmark co-stars have posted on social media, sharing their distress over the latest update and encouraging fans to support the family.\n\nWhen the Comptons initially posted their GoFundMe campaign in mid-May, the page explained that on May 11, Nicole \"traveled to Winnipeg to help Mamie, who was having a medical emergency.\"\n\n\"Nicole was able to get there in time to save her life,\" they wrote. \"Then got her to a hospital in Winnipeg. Mamie has since been transferred to Hospital here in Vancouver. Her recovery is unclear at this time but she is alive and is showing signs of improvement.\"\n\nAt the time, the family hoped to raise $2,000 in donations to help them \"go every day to support her,\" adding that \"any contributions would help us be by her side\" and that her hospitalization could last \"upwards of a month or more.\" Family, friends and fans surpassed the goal within days of their posting.\n\nJust before 5 a.m. on May 18, Laverock shared someone's post about the GoFundMe campaign on her Facebook account. About five minutes later, she posted three photos of herself swimming and smiling with her two younger sisters.\n\n\"April 28 Kona, Hawaii,\" she wrote, adding, \"Such a nice time together.\"\n\nBut one week after her Facebook posts, Laverock's family updated their GoFundMe page by writing, \"We are deeply saddened to report that on May 26th, Mamie, who has been in intensive treatment for the past two weeks, was escorted out of a secure unit of the hospital and taken up to a balcony walkway from which she fell five stories.

The page was initially created by Rob and Nicole Compton.\n\nThis took place after she had been hospitalized for a period of two weeks, during which time she was receiving \"intensive treatment\" owing to a \"medical emergency.\"\n\nIn a letter, Mamie Laverock parents indicated that she had been subjected to a number of extensive procedures, that she had suffered injuries that had the potential to be deadly, and that she was presently being supported by life support.\n\nEveryone here is in a state of disbelief and bereavement as a result of the tremendously difficult time that we are going through.\n\nCanada, in order to provide assistance to her son who was experiencing a \"medical emergency.\" This information was provided by the GoFundMe account that was originally described above.\n\nThe patient, Mamie Laverock, was subsequently transported to a hospital in the city of Vancouver after it was stated that \"Nicole was able to arrive in time to save her life.\"\n\nThis statement is made over the course of the account.

Erin Krakow announced that she had recently made a donation to the GoFundMe page by posting a message on her Instagram account explaining the donation.\n\nTo the extent that you are in a position to do so, I sincerely hope that you will also do the same.

It is imperative that they receive as much assistance as they possibly can in order for them to be able to make it through this.

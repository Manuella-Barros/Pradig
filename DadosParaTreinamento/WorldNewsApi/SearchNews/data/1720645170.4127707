The United States is participating in the peace summit through the presence of Vice President Kamala Harris. The Chinese Communist Party chose not to attend at all, complaining that the Russian government would not be present. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called China\u2019s absence \u201cunfortunate\u201d in remarks last week, insinuating that China\u2019s close allies in Moscow pressured the communists to abstain from attending. Zelensky had expressed hope that Biden would attend the summit but has not similarly condemned Washington and appeared friendly with Biden during a meeting on Friday morning. The Global Times condemned Biden in an article criticizing a commemoration ceremony for the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy, France, in 1944. The Chinese outlet claimed that Biden\u2019s presence and speech at the event had tainted the solemnity of the occasion by injecting a \u201cbellicose\u201d tone to the affair. \u201cAt a time meant for reflecting on the hard-won peace, US bellicose genes have been reactivated,\u201d the outlet complained. \u201cAs it is coded in Washington\u2019s DNA \u2013 whenever it feels challenged, the US tends to resort to war and military means to solve problems, even if the current limited peace and stability is being eroded.\u201d The main gripe the Global Times presented was not against Biden, but against an article in Foreign Affairs magazines. The Chinese Communist Party allows no recognizable form of freedom of expression within its borders and imprisons its citizens who attempt to practice journalism outside of closely regulated state propaganda outlets. The Times complained that the article in question posed the possibility that American allies would be at war in three regions: Ukraine, the Middle East, and Asia. In Ukraine, the Global Times claimed, Biden had already lost interest, \u201cRemember as early as October last year, the White House warned that the US only has enough money to meet Ukraine\u2019s \u2018urgent battlefield needs\u2019 in the short term, and the Pentagon warned Congress it is running low on money which could harm US military\u2019s readiness,\u201d the Times noted. \u201cNot to mention Biden\u2019s decision to attend the D-Day ceremony in France while skipping the Ukraine Peace Summit in Switzerland,\u201d it continued, \u201cwhich clearly shows his lack of confidence in Ukraine. He has no faith in Ukraine winning against Russia, nor in achieving any fruitful results from the peace summit.\u201d The Global Times concluded by declaring the United States a \u201cglobal threat.\u201d Zelensky had overtly called for Biden\u2019s presence at the global peace summit prior to his declining the invitation. \u201cI believe that the peace summit needs President Biden,\u201d Zelensky said in May. \u201cHis absence would only be met by an applause by Putin, a personal, standing applause by Putin.\u201d Biden is sending Harris and National Security adviser Jake Sullivan and will be attending a ritzy fundraiser for his presidential campaign hosted by Hollywood A-lister George Clooney instead of the global peace summit. Despite his absence, Biden and Zelensky appeared to get along publicly during a meeting on Friday before Biden\u2019s departure to meet with Clooney. Biden publicly apologized to Zelensky for congressional delays in funding the Ukraine war \u2013 blaming \u201cvery conservative members who were holding it up\u201d \u2013 but did not apologize for missing the peace summit, nor did Zelensky bring it up, according to a White House transcript of the meeting. \u201cI apologize for the \u2014 those weeks of not knowing what was going to pan \u2014 in terms of funding,\u201d Biden said, \u201cbecause we had trouble getting the \u2014 a bill that we had to pass that had the money in it \u2014 from some of our very conservative members who were holding it up. But we got it done, finally.\u201d Biden announced another $225 million in funding to Ukraine during the meeting on Friday. While Zelensky had expressed hope of Biden attending the summit, his response to China skipping the event altogether was much harsher. \u201cIt is unfortunate that such a big, independent, powerful country as China is an instrument in the hands of Putin,\u201d Zelensky said while attending the Shangri-La Dialogue, a global security conference, in Singapore on June 1. Zelensky claimed that Russia intervened to block China\u2019s participation in an attempt to \u201cdisrupt\u201d the event. Zelensky\u2019s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba went further, suggesting China was playing both sides of the war to align itself with the victor in comments on Tuesday. While China is a high-profile Russian ally, it is also Ukraine\u2019s top trade partner and signed Kyiv up for its predatory \u201cBelt and Road Initiative\u201d (BRI). \u201cChina is in no rush\u201d to take a side in the war \u201cfor one simple reason \u2013 it is critical for them to see how the war between Russia and Ukraine ends,\u201d Kuleba said. \u201cBecause if it ends with Ukraine\u2019s victory, China\u2019s further actions will be constrained. But if this war ends not even with Russia\u2019s victory, but with them imposing their strategic initiative,\u201d he explained, \u201cthat is, when they will be encroaching little by little for years, and we will be fighting back little by little despite all the assistance we receive, then, on the contrary, it will free China\u2019s hands.\u201d", "summary": "<p>China's state-run\u00a0Global Times propaganda newspaper accused leftist American President Joe Biden on Thursday of a \"lack of confidence\" in Ukraine's ability to defeat the two-year-old Russian invasion of its homeland, condemning him for skipping a global \"peace summit\" organized by Ukraine in Switzerland.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2024/06/07/china-taunts-biden-he-has-no-faith-ukraine/\">China Taunts Biden: &#8216;He Has No Faith in Ukraine&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.breitbart.com\">Breitbart</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2024/06/07/china-taunts-biden-he-has-no-faith-ukraine/", "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/06/Joe-Biden-Zelensky-Paris-getty-640x335.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:06:53", "author": "Frances Martel", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.067}

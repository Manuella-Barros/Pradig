{"id": 225038570, "title": "Classic graduation dresses ideal for summer ceremonies at Glasgow Universities", "text": "Graduation day is a momentous occasion, marking the end of four years of dedication and hard work. It's a day to reflect on the lectures, flatmates, exams, and all-nighters that have shaped your university experience. Whether these memories are ones you'll cherish or would rather forget, it's time to collect your degree and close this significant chapter in your life. If you're already buzzing with anticipation for the big day, chances are you've started pondering over what to wear under that iconic gown. Trust us, the last thing you want while crossing the stage in front of loved ones is to trip over your hemline or worry about a strapless dress malfunction. That's why we at Glasgow Live have handpicked these outfits to ensure minimal stress on your special day. Some universities enforce strict dress codes, allowing only black or white formal attire, while others offer students complete freedom over their wardrobe choices. Regardless of whether you're aiming for a colourful or neutral look, we've got you covered with a range of dresses designed to sit comfortably beneath your gown and hood. A handy tip we've discovered is to bring safety pins to the ceremony. This allows you to secure the collar to your outfit, preventing the gown from slipping backwards and spoiling the overall look. For an added touch, consider coordinating your shoes with the coloured ribbon on your gown to truly pull the outfit together. These simple yet chic dresses, free of clashing patterns and complicated necklines, will perfectly complement any academic robe you choose to wear.

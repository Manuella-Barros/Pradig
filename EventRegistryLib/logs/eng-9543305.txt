Zapata argued that she was acting as a whistleblower, exposing vulnerabilities in the state's election system.\n\nJohnson and others who work in elections stressed that the change would not affect how elections are run in Milwaukee.\n\n\"Paulina's integrity and capabilities are ideally suited to this position,\" Johnson said in a statement announcing the change. \"She will lead the office at an important juncture when public scrutiny of the work of the department will be extremely high.

(AP) -- Milwaukee's election leader has been ousted by the mayor in a surprise move that comes just six months before Wisconsin's largest city will be in the spotlight in the presidential swing state.\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson announced Monday that he would be replacing Milwaukee Election Commission Executive Director Claire Woodall with her deputy, Paulina Gutierrez.\n\nMilwaukee has been at the center of attention in Wisconsin, a state known for close elections and where four of the past six presidential contests have been decided by less than a percentage point.\n\nIn 2020, former President Donald Trump and others were quick to cry fraud after late-arriving results from Democratic-dominated Milwaukee helped Joe Biden narrowly carry the state by just under 21,000 votes. Recounts demanded by Trump confirmed Biden's victory.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He declined to say what those issues were.\n\nWoodall did not return messages seeking comment. Her replacement, Gutierrez, also did not return messages.\n\nWoodall has been outspoken about the challenges she and other election officials have felt in recent years.\n\nShe has described being harassed and threatened after the 2020 election via email, phone calls and letters to her home -- threats serious enough that she has an assigned FBI agent to forward them to.\n\nThe change came a week after Woodall's former deputy, Kimberly Zapata, was sentenced to probation and fined $3,000 after being convicted of misconduct in office and fraud for obtaining fake absentee ballots. Zapata argued that she was acting as a whistleblower, exposing vulnerabilities in the state's election system.\n\nJohnson and others who work in elections stressed that the change would not affect how elections are run in Milwaukee.\n\n\"Paulina's integrity and capabilities are ideally suited to this position,\" Johnson said in a statement announcing the change. \"She will lead the office at an important juncture when public scrutiny of the work of the department will be extremely high. I have confidence in her, and I will make certain the department has the resources it needs to fulfill its duties.\"\n\nGutierrez has only been a staff member at the city election commission for a little over a year. Neil Albrecht, who led the office for 15 years before retiring in May 2020, has offered his assistance as a volunteer, Fleming said. Woodall took over for Albrecht in 2020 and had been leading the office until now.\n\nFollowing his reelection in April, Johnson had to renominate all of his Cabinet-level positions for city council approval. That is why he decided to make the change at this time, Fleming said.\n\nNone of the city's three election commissioners returned messages seeking comment.

What to know about the Milwaukee election official being replaced", "body": "Claire Woodall, the executive director of the Milwaukee Election Commission, is being replaced by Mayor Cavalier Johnson. Her deputy, Paulina Guti\u00e9rrez, is being nominated to take over her position.\n\nThe major change in leadership comes six months before the November election. Milwaukee's elections are closely watched, especially for the large numbers of absentee ballots that are processed after polls close and can switch up results late in the night.\n\nState lawmakers had considered a bill last session allowing clerks across the state to begin that work on the Monday before Election Day, rather than on Tuesday night, but the proposal failed.\n\nMore: Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson to replace elections chief Claire Woodall, email shows\n\nJohnson has declined to say why he did not reappoint Woodall. Here's what we know and don't know so far:\n\nWhat is the Milwaukee Election Commission?\n\nThe Milwaukee Election Commission oversees elections in Wisconsin's largest city. Unlike a typical clerk's office (which the city also has), the body has commissioners.\n\nIt's distinct from the Wisconsin Elections Commission, which is a state-level agency that provides guidance to clerks across the state.\n\nHow long has Claire Woodall led Milwaukee's elections?\n\nWoodall was confirmed as executive director of the commission in July 2020, a tight window before the city's August primary election. She started working for the commission in 2013 and had two other roles, including overseeing voter services and analyzing registration and absentee data.\n\nIn a 2020 statement supporting her nomination, Johnson called Woodall a \"dedicated public servant, who is passionate about quelling voter suppression and overcoming the barriers faced by our electorate to ensure that everyone in our city has free and fair access to electoral participation.\"\n\nIn between her work on Milwaukee's commission, Woodall was the clerk for the City of Cedarburg.\n\nWhy is Claire Woodall being replaced?\n\nThe mayor's office has not yet given a reason for the change in executive director. A press release that announced the new nominee for the position did not share more information about why Woodall is being replaced.\n\nIn an interview with WISN-TV, Johnson denied Woodall was fired and said she had been offered a different position that she does not plan to take. Johnson said he did not want to discuss personnel decisions when asked if Woodall was accused of any wrongdoing.\n\nWho will replace Claire Woodall?\n\nPaulina Guti\u00e9rrez, who has been Woodall's deputy since 2023, is in line to replace her. But the Common Council will have to sign off on her nomination.\n\n\"Paulina's integrity and capabilities are ideally suited to this position. She will lead the office at an important juncture when public scrutiny of the work of the department will be extremely high,\" Johnson said in the press release. \"I have confidence in her, and I will make certain the department has the resources it needs to fulfill its duties.\"\n\nGuti\u00e9rrez has held management positions previously in state and local government, according to the Mayor's Office. She is a graduate of Alverno College and earned a master's degree from Marquette University.\n\nWhy are Milwaukee's elections closely watched?\n\nMilwaukee's election officials have faced intense scrutiny in recent years, especially from conspiracies that stem from absentee-ballot returns that are often posted late in the night, sometimes changing which candidate is in the lead.\n\nIn 2020, the later tally helped move Democrat Joe Biden over President Donald Trump, fueling the former president's false claims about election fraud in Wisconsin.\n\nMore: Here's how votes are counted in Milwaukee and when to expect election results in Wisconsin\n\nMore: In 2018 governor's race, Milwaukee absentee ballots took center stage. That could happen again in November.\n\nUnder current state law, clerks cannot process absentee ballots until after polls close on Election Day. A proposal to allow clerks to start working earlier and avoid late-night results failed in the Legislature this session.\n\nA fictional storyline about the city's absentee ballots was featured in an episode of HBO's \"Succession,\" about which Woodall consulted with show writers.\n\nAre there recent controversies with the commission?\n\nA reason for Woodall's replacement wasn't given. But the commission has been in the news lately.\n\nThe commission's former deputy director, Kimberly Zapata, was given one year of probation and a $3,000 fine last week for ordering three military absentee ballots under fake names ahead of the 2022 midterm elections and having them sent to a state legislator known for embracing conspiracy theories.\n\nIn a letter ahead of Zapata's sentencing, Woodall described the personal and professional toll she felt from Zapata's actions but maintained that Zapata was trying to highlight a gap in the election system.\n\n\"As the executive director of the Election Commission, I faced severe skepticism and criticism from my colleagues, employees, and the citizens that I serve after Kim's actions came to light,\" Woodall wrote. \"Despite the harm she has caused, her actions were rooted in a very real security vulnerability that state statute has created and that continues to persist.\"\n\nMilwaukee election officials also made errors ahead of the April 2 election. The commission sent the wrong absentee ballots to 237 Milwaukee voters across four voting wards. The commission took disciplinary action against the employees involved. Woodall said she didn't believe there was any malicious intent, but rather \"gross negligence.\"", "source": {"uri": "jsonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Journal Sentinel"}, "authors": [],

Mayor Cavalier Johnson appointed Paulina Guti\u00e9rrez to take over as executive director of the Milwaukee election commission, replacing Claire Woodall who had served as the director since July 2020.\n\nThe change, first reported by the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, means there will be a new head of elections in one of the most critical cities in a key battleground state. Milwaukee is the most populous city in Wisconsin and one of the places Donald Trump targeted as part of his efforts to overturn the election. Woodall did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nGuti\u00e9rrez \"will lead the office at an important juncture when public scrutiny of the work of the department will be extremely high\", Johnson said in a statement. \"I have confidence in her, and I will make certain the department has the resources it needs to fulfill its duties.\"\n\nIt was not immediately clear why Johnson chose to replace Woodall. There were reports on Monday that it was connected to her decision to publicly criticize election employees after the office mistakenly sent the wrong ballots to voters in the spring. Ahead of the 2 April Wisconsin presidential primary, more than 200 voters in Milwaukee were mailed ballots marked for the wrong district - an error that Woodall attributed in strong terms to the staff of her office.\n\nRead more: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/06/milwaukee-top-election-official", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalier_Johnson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cavalier Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Journal_Sentinel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543305", "eventUri": "eng-9543305", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-02", "textStart": 1310, "textEnd": 1317}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-07-", "textStart": 382, "textEnd": 391}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

What to know about the Milwaukee election official being replaced", "body": "Claire Woodall, the executive director of the Milwaukee Election Commission, is being replaced by Mayor Cavalier Johnson. Her deputy, Paulina Guti\u00e9rrez, is being nominated to take over her position.\n\nThe major change in leadership comes six months before the November election. Milwaukee's elections are closely watched, especially for the large numbers of absentee ballots that are processed after polls close and can switch up results late in the night.\n\nState lawmakers had considered a bill last session allowing clerks across the state to begin that work on the Monday before Election Day, rather than on Tuesday night, but the proposal failed.\n\nMore: Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson to replace elections chief Claire Woodall, email shows\n\nJohnson has declined to say why he did not reappoint Woodall. Here's what we know and don't know so far:\n\nThe Milwaukee Election Commission oversees elections in Wisconsin's largest city. Unlike a typical clerk's office (which the city also has), the body has commissioners.\n\nIt's distinct from the Wisconsin Elections Commission, which is a state-level agency that provides guidance to clerks across the state.\n\nWoodall was confirmed as executive director of the commission in July 2020, a tight window before the city's August primary election. She started working for the commission in 2013 and had two other roles, including overseeing voter services and analyzing registration and absentee data.\n\nIn a 2020 statement supporting her nomination, Johnson called Woodall a \"dedicated public servant, who is passionate about quelling voter suppression and overcoming the barriers faced by our electorate to ensure that everyone in our city has free and fair access to electoral participation.\"\n\nIn between her work on Milwaukee's commission, Woodall was the clerk for the City of Cedarburg.\n\nThe mayor's office has not yet given a reason for the change in executive director. A press release that announced the new nominee for the position did not share more information about why Woodall is being replaced.\n\nIn an interview with WISN-TV, Johnson denied Woodall was fired and said she had been offered a different position that she does not plan to take. Johnson said he did not want to discuss personnel decisions when asked if Woodall was accused of any wrongdoing.\n\nPaulina Guti\u00e9rrez, who has been Woodall's deputy since 2023, is in line to replace her. But the Common Council will have to sign off on her nomination.\n\n\"Paulina's integrity and capabilities are ideally suited to this position. She will lead the office at an important juncture when public scrutiny of the work of the department will be extremely high,\" Johnson said in the press release. \"I have confidence in her, and I will make certain the department has the resources it needs to fulfill its duties.\"\n\nGuti\u00e9rrez has held management positions previously in state and local government, according to the Mayor's Office. She is a graduate of Alverno College and earned a master's degree from Marquette University.\n\nMilwaukee's election officials have faced intense scrutiny in recent years, especially from conspiracies that stem from absentee-ballot returns that are often posted late in the night, sometimes changing which candidate is in the lead.\n\nIn 2020, the later tally helped move Democrat Joe Biden over President Donald Trump, fueling the former president's false claims about election fraud in Wisconsin.\n\nMore: Here's how votes are counted in Milwaukee and when to expect election results in Wisconsin\n\nMore: In 2018 governor's race, Milwaukee absentee ballots took center stage. That could happen again in November.\n\nUnder current state law, clerks cannot process absentee ballots until after polls close on Election Day. A proposal to allow clerks to start working earlier and avoid late-night results failed in the Legislature this session.\n\nA fictional storyline about the city's absentee ballots was featured in an episode of HBO's \"Succession,\" about which Woodall consulted with show writers.\n\nA reason for Woodall's replacement wasn't given. But the commission has been in the news lately.\n\nThe commission's former deputy director, Kimberly Zapata, was given one year of probation and a $3,000 fine last week for ordering three military absentee ballots under fake names ahead of the 2022 midterm elections and having them sent to a state legislator known for embracing conspiracy theories.\n\nIn a letter ahead of Zapata's sentencing, Woodall described the personal and professional toll she felt from Zapata's actions but maintained that Zapata was trying to highlight a gap in the election system.\n\n\"As the executive director of the Election Commission, I faced severe skepticism and criticism from my colleagues, employees, and the citizens that I serve after Kim's actions came to light,\" Woodall wrote. \"Despite the harm she has caused, her actions were rooted in a very real security vulnerability that state statute has created and that continues to persist.\"\n\nMilwaukee election officials also made errors ahead of the April 2 election. The commission sent the wrong absentee ballots to 237 Milwaukee voters across four voting wards. The commission took disciplinary action against the employees involved. Woodall said she didn't believe there was any malicious intent, but rather \"gross negligence.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel first reported the news of Woodall's ouster.\n\nIn a statement, Johnson spokesperson Jeff Fleming said the move was not related to how Woodall or her office oversaw elections but was a result of \"other issues internal to the election commission office and to city government that raised concern.\" Fleming did not elaborate on the nature of those issues when asked by NBC News. Gutierrez's appointment is subject to approval by the Milwaukee Common Council.\n\nThe unexpected move comes just under six months away from a 2024 presidential race likely to be decided by a small handful of states, including Wisconsin.\n\nWisconsin's past two presidential elections were both decided by fewer than 23,000 votes each. And Milwaukee -- a Democratic stronghold where Trump allies falsely portrayed slow counting of mail ballots as a sign of fraud in 2020 -- was at the center of the drama in each of those elections.\n\nWisconsin has already lagged behind other swing states in shoring up election policies following 2020 chaos. Election workers and watchdogs in the state have expressed concerns that the same loopholes exploited by Trump allies to try to overturn the election results that year still exist in Wisconsin.\n\nWoodall's departure comes just two months after her former deputy, Kimberly Zapata, was found guilty by a grand jury of official misconduct and election fraud charges related to her having obtained fake absentee ballots.\n\nZapata had claimed she had been trying to expose vulnerabilities in Wisconsin's elections. She was sentenced last week to probation and a $3,000 fine.\n\nWoodall's termination also highlights the widespread issue of election worker turnover, which reached a historic high level this year ahead of the 2024 election, according to data obtained by NBC News last month.\n\nThat data found that turnover in local election offices has been increasing for years, suggesting the issue goes beyond post-2020 threats.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_edelman@aol.com", "name": "Adam Edelman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalier_Johnson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cavalier Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Journal_Sentinel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_County,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee County, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee County, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Council", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absentee_ballot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Absentee ballot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Multimedia", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/l2VsqvT6IHoCkFM1_SWyYw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_nbc_universal_184/4e77a12202a16486115a9c85645bcfdb", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543305", "eventUri": "eng-9543305", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel first reported the news of Woodall's ouster.\n\nIn a statement, Johnson spokesperson Jeff Fleming said the move was not related to how Woodall or her office oversaw elections but was a result of \"other issues internal to the election commission office and to city government that raised concern.\" Fleming did not elaborate on the nature of those issues when asked by NBC News. Gutierrez's appointment is subject to approval by the Milwaukee Common Council.\n\nThe unexpected move comes just under six months away from a 2024 presidential race likely to be decided by a small handful of states, including Wisconsin.\n\nWisconsin's past two presidential elections were both decided by fewer than 23,000 votes each. And Milwaukee -- a Democratic stronghold where Trump allies falsely portrayed slow counting of mail ballots as a sign of fraud in 2020 -- was at the center of the drama in each of those elections.\n\nWisconsin has already lagged behind other swing states in shoring up election policies following 2020 chaos. Election workers and watchdogs in the state have expressed concerns that the same loopholes exploited by Trump allies to try to overturn the election results that year still exist in Wisconsin.\n\nWoodall's departure comes just two months after her former deputy, Kimberly Zapata, was found guilty by a grand jury of official misconduct and election fraud charges related to her having obtained fake absentee ballots.\n\nZapata had claimed she had been trying to expose vulnerabilities in Wisconsin's elections. She was sentenced last week to probation and a $3,000 fine.\n\nWoodall's termination also highlights the widespread issue of election worker turnover, which reached a historic high level this year ahead of the 2024 election, according to data obtained by NBC News last month.\n\nThat data found that turnover in local election offices has been increasing for years, suggesting the issue goes beyond post-2020 threats.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Journal_Sentinel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalier_Johnson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cavalier Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebony_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ebony (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_County,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee County, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee County, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Council", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absentee_ballot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Absentee ballot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Minority_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Minority Groups", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-05/240506-claire-woodall-vl-254p-c6bd40.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543305", "eventUri": "eng-9543305", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

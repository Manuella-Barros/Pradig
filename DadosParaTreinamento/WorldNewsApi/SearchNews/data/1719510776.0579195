His airline only has 20 aircraft (including Fiji Link regional planes), but operates an impressive hub-and-spoke network that optimizes aircraft use via a robust schedule connecting all corners of the Pacific Ocean through Fiji. Viljoen comes to Fiji Airways after a distinguished career leading another island carrier, Air Mauritius. Fiji Airways aircraft shown moments before landing at the Los Angeles International airport. getty Under his tenure at Fiji Airways, the carrier became the inaugural member of the Oneworld Connect program and flies to many of its alliance partner hubs like Los Angeles, Tokyo and Sydney. Connecting passengers from different parts of the world via Fiji helps to grow the destination, too. Tourism Fiji CEO Brent Hill Fiji Airways According to Tourism Fiji CEO Brent Hill, there is great opportunity for the country and airline based on different passenger travel flows. \u201cIndian tourists visiting Australia or New Zealand can be a great source market for Fiji, which is visa free for Indian nationals, and we plan to tap that.\u201d MORE FOR YOU The Best Beers In Canada According To The Canadian Brewing Awards NYT Strands 84 Hints Spangram And Answers For Sunday May 26th Best Buy Memorial Day Sale: 70 Deals On TVs, Tablets And Appliances The airline would stand to benefit from identifying similar patterns. With ambitious plans in the works, the airline has new destinations, aircraft, lounge facilities and even exciting loyalty program plans. RQ: Are there plans to add more Airbus A350s? The carrier currently has four Airbus A350s named for major islands in Fiji. Fiji Airways AJ: We have four new A350 aircraft at the moment, each named for Fijian islands, with three owned A330-200s and one leased A330-300. We plan to begin retiring these in the coming years, and we will need to make a decision on what would be a suitable replacement for them. The A350 is a great aircraft that allows us to fly more efficiently on long-haul sectors like Los Angeles, but also works well for services to Australia and New Zealand where competitors fly 737s. Our larger aircraft proves popular with passengers, especially on those routes. RQ: When will Fiji Airways become a full member of oneworld? Qatar Airways airline Boeing 777 in the Oneworld livery. getty AJ: When becoming a Oneworld Connect partner, the airline had to complete a lot of behind-the-scenes technical and logistical work to meet the alliance\u2019s high standards. Now, we are hoping that each of the alliance members will vote for our full membership request this summer at their annual meeting in Dubai. We are confident that we will be able to become a full member. RQ: Are there plans for growing the network? Beach front property on the island of Taveuni, Fiji. getty AJ: For 2024, Fiji is already up 11% in visitor arrivals compared to this time last year. As the national airline, this growth affects us, too. Already for this year, the carrier is up 9.5% over the same period in 2023. One way we can continue to grow is by flying to more places. Last year, Fiji Airways added Canberra, Noumea and Vancouver, which are all performing well. We believe there are still numerous underserved markets that are the perfect fit for our network. These include cities in Australia like Cairns and Newcastle, but also other markets like Port Moresby and Pago Pago. Ideally, an open skies agreement between the U.S. and Fiji would open up more market possibilities for Fiji Airways, especially to partner hubs like Dallas/Ft. Worth and Seattle. We\u2019re hoping to add a new long-haul destination within the next year. Network growth in North America in 2023 was up 17% in comparison to 2022. We want this to continue. RQ: What are typical traffic patterns for the airline? Nadi, Viti Levu island, Fiji: Fiji Airways aircraft at Nadi International Airport - airside view of ... [+] the terminal - the main international airport of Fiji, a regional hub for the South Pacific islands, western coast of Fiji's main island, Viti Levu. Operated by Fiji Airports, main hub of Fiji Airways and Fiji Link. getty AJ: Fiji Airways is a hub-and-spoke carrier, but the market is quite different from other airlines. Business travel only makes up about 5% of the market with 80% focused on inbound leisure traffic. The remaining 15% is local Fijians visiting family and relatives. With inflationary pressures affecting the discretionary income of people around the world, we cannot rely only in inbound traffic. That\u2019s why the Nadi and Suva hubs are key because they serve as a filler part of our business, connecting traffic to all points near and far through Fiji. Currently, 50% of traffic coming into these hubs is dedicated to connecting passengers with a strong passenger flow between North America and Australia or New Zealand. Sydney Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge illuminated at dusk getty Australia and New Zealand make up 65% of the business in terms of revenue and traffic, but the United States makes up the vast majority of our profitability. It remains very important. There is great potential, especially for markets that are not served directly, to carry connecting passengers through Fiji. This is why secondary markets can play a huge role. It is also why we want to fly to other North American destinations and develop joint ventures with our partners there. North America is our future, and we see the possibility to bring many more Americans to and through Fiji. RQ: How do you determine what Pacific islands fit into the network? Nadi, Viti Levu island, Fiji: Fiji Link ATR 72-600 (72-212A), registration DQ-FJZ, being fueled and ... [+] serviced by ground crew at Nadi International Airport. Fiji Link is a a wholly owned subsidiary of the international carrier Fiji Airways. getty AJ: Fiji Airways is sometimes one of only a few (if not the only) airline serving some of these remote destinations like Tuvalu and Kiribati. There has to be sufficient demand to keep an airport in the network, but don\u2019t forget that cargo can play an important role to remote islands. Just like during the pandemic when Fiji Airways was operating key cargo flights, the fleet carries food and other lucrative supplies to remote destinations on a daily basis. RQ: How important are codeshares and airline partnerships? American Airlines planes waiting for passengers at Miami International Airport. getty AJ: They are all very important to the carrier because they increase exposure to the network, but also allow passengers to book more destinations on a single ticket. Fiji Airways has codeshares with airlines like JetBlue and oneworld partner American Airlines in the U.S. The ultimate goal is to have a joint venture between certain destinations so that the carriers can share revenue. We are waiting on the air service agreement with the U.S. government to allow more routes. For now, we can only fly to three cities there, and even our codeshares are restricted so we are waiting on an Open Skies agreement to allow for more opportunity. RQ: What is the new Chef\u2019s Table service? AJ: Beginning this month, it will be a private dining experience in the lounge with multi-course meals prepared by a dedicated chef. These Fijian dishes will each be able to tell a story from different parts of Fiji giving travelers one last culinary glimpse into local culture before they return home. A private dining room in the lounge will be reserved for guests paying for this service ($67 per person). RQ: How does your own flight training academy help a smaller airline like Fiji? A Fiji Airways Airbus A330 Fiji Airways AJ: Instead of spending millions of dollars to send pilots to other facilities around the world to be trained, we opted to invest in a state-of-the-art facility of our own that could reduce cost, but also generate revenue. Two modern simulators for the A330 and Boeing 737 Max 8 arrived just weeks before the Covid pandemic. Coming at the right time, it allowed the airline to keep its pilots current, even during the pandemic. It also draws business from airlines and governments around the South Pacific who need to find time for their pilots to complete recurrent training. Demand is high for limited facilities in the region, and this has become a strong source of revenue. On the Airbus A350, business class passengers have fully flat beds. Fiji Airways By 2026, the facility will more than double in size with additional space for flight attendant training (they won\u2019t have to travel to Brisbane any longer to complete the rest of their training). The new venue will create space for two more aircraft simulators, one for the A350 and the ATR planes that Fiji Link operates. It will be one of the newest and most modern of its type in the South Pacific. RQ: What is the biggest challenge for an airline like Fiji Airways? A Fijian family playing on the beach getty AJ: As a small flag carrier, we go up against the big airlines from around the world each day. Over the last 15 years, more than 100 carriers have disappeared because their business model no longer makes sense in today\u2019s environment. We must adapt and be nimble, especially since 90% of business is inbound leisure tourism, which is often tied to low prices. Already, margins are tight in bread-and-butter markets like Australia and New Zealand where the competition sets the price for us. In every market we fly to in New Zealand and Australia, we are smaller, and that means we don\u2019t drive the price or set the price. Our market power is smaller, and when we work with travel agencies, we may be less competitive. As a differentiator, we fly our premium aircraft on as many routes as possible. The A350 often flies from Fiji to Auckland or Sydney, for example, which appeals to travelers wanting a better experience than a narrowbody plane can offer. RQ: Why doesn\u2019t Fiji Airways have a loyalty program? Likuliku Lagoon Resort is the only property in Fiji to have overwater villas in the open ocean. Likuliku Lagoon Resort AJ: Here\u2019s the logic, if we start our own frequent flyer program, holiday members have less reason to join because they may only visit Fiji once or twice a year. When they spend money on credit cards in their home markets or fly to other destinations, they want to earn miles with programs that are more relevant to them. American Airlines Airbus A321 & Alaska Airlines Boeing 737, Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). getty This is the reason why we rely on partner programs to help elevate our offering. As a oneworld connect member, travelers can earn in any oneworld loyalty program. With such a small local market, we just don\u2019t see a need to start a loyalty program that may not appeal to travelers looking to rack up points. While we cannot reveal details, there are plans for a big announcement soon in the loyalty program space. There is potential to tie up with another loyalty program that we adopt as our own, and this could boost Fiji\u2019s value proposition since people can earn and redeem miles in a more familiar program they can use elsewhere.

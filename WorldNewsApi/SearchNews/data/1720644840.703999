The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) rescued Noa Argamani, 25, Almog Meir Jan, 21, Andrey Kozlov, 27, and Shlomi Ziv, 40, in two separate locations in the heart of Nuseirat in Gaza. A video of Argamani reaching out her arm and screaming \u2018Please don\u2019t kill me\u2019 as militants drove her away on a motorbike was one of the first and mostly widely shared clips to emerge from October 7. Now, 245 days after the student was kidnapped, new footage shows her smiling as she hugs and kisses her father after she was rescued. Later she was handed a phone so she could speak directly with Israel\u2019s President Isaac Herzog. Noa\u2019s mother, Liora, who has stage four brain cancer, released a video last November pleading to see her daughter before she dies.

International pressure is mounting on Israel to limit civilian bloodshed in its war in Gaza, which reached its eighth month on Friday. Noa\u2019s boyfriend, Avinatan Or, was also seen being walked away with his hands behind his back in the original footage of the kidnapping. He remains in Hamas captivity in Gaza, along with roughly 130 other hostages, more than 40 of whom are believed to be dead. The dead bodies of three other festivalgoers taken that day \u2013 Shani Louk, Amit Buskila and Itzhak Gelerenter \u2013 were recovered by Israeli forces in Gaza last month.

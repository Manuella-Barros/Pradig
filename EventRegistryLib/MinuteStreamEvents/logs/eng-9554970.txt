The settlement resolves allegations that Cobb County violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act by using credit checks and a written exam that unfairly impacted African American applicants.\n\nAs part of the settlement, Cobb County will no longer use these hiring practices and will pay $750,000 in back wages to the affected candidates. Additionally, up to 16 of these candidates will be hired as firefighters and given seniority retroactively.\n\n\"This settlement should send a strong message to employers that reliance on a job applicant's credit history may be discriminatory and unlawful,\" said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. \"Consumer credit checks create a Catch-22 for people seeking access to job opportunities. Cobb County's hiring practices created artificial barriers that prevented qualified Black job candidates from being considered for firefighter positions. Discriminatory barriers, like credit checks, not only cost candidates a fair chance at a job, they also prevent the public from being served by firefighters drawn from the most robust hiring pool possible.\"\n\nU.S. Attorney Ryan K. Buchanan for the Northern District of Georgia added that all job applicants should have an equal opportunity to compete. He stressed that eliminating discriminatory hiring policies is crucial for ensuring fairness in employment.\n\nThe Justice Department's lawsuit argued that Cobb County's hiring process unfairly screened candidates based on their credit histories and performance on a written exam, which wasn't relevant to the actual firefighting job. These practices disproportionately affected African American applicants.\n\nThe Cobb County Board of Commissioners approved the settlement with the Justice Department during their April meeting.\n\nBefore the meeting, Board of Commissioners Chairwoman Lisa Cupid said, \"In 2020, our fire department ceased the practices that led to the DOJ's contentions. I look forward to resolving this with the DOJ to end any practices that could have unintended disparate or discriminatory impacts. Our goal is and should always to be inclusive in finding the best candidates to work in Cobb County.\"\n\nFire Chief Bill Johnson also released a statement saying, \"We are pleased that the DOJ's comprehensive review confirmed no intentional discrimination in our hiring practices and identified no issues with our current process. We are dedicated to continuing our efforts to recruit, hire, and retain well-qualified firefighters to serve Cobb's citizens.\"\n\nUnder Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, employment discrimination based on race, sex, color, national origin, or religion is prohibited. This includes practices that unintentionally have a discriminatory impact on certain groups unless those practices are directly related to the job requirements.", "source": {"uri": "fox5atlanta.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 5 Atlanta"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobb_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cobb County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cobb County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_K._Buchanan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan K.

Cobb County has stopped using the challenged hiring practices and will pay $750,000 in back pay to applicants disqualified by those practices. The county will also hire up to 16 of those applicants with retroactive seniority.\n\n\"This settlement should send a strong message to employers that reliance on a job applicant's credit history may be discriminatory and unlawful,\" said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. \"Consumer credit checks create a Catch-22 for people seeking access to job opportunities.

Buchanan for the Northern District of Georgia. \"Our office will continue to devote resources to eliminate prejudicial policies that illegally deprive qualified candidates of a fair chance to compete for employment opportunities.\"\n\nThe department's lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of Georgia, alleges that Cobb County discriminated in its firefighter hiring process in two ways. First, by screening out candidates based on their credit histories. Many employers use credit checks when screening applicants based on a mistaken assumption that credit history is a measure of character or job fitness. As the department alleges, Cobb County could not establish a connection between credit history and job performance or character and thus did not have a lawful reason for using credit history as part of its hiring process. Second, Cobb County ranked candidates based on their performance on a written examination designed to determine placement level in college classes. The department alleges that these practices disproportionately removed African Americans from consideration for firefighter positions without providing evidence that candidates who advanced based on these practices were more qualified to serve as firefighters.\n\nTitle VII is a federal statute prohibiting employment discrimination based on race, sex, color, national origin, and religion. Title VII prohibits not only intentional discrimination but also prohibits employment practices that result in a disparate impact upon a protected group unless such practices are job-related and consistent with business necessity.\n\nThe full and fair enforcement of Title VII is a top priority of the Civil Rights Division.

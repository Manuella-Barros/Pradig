Fans dragged Geri Halliwell on Instagram for a blundered birthday tribute to her Spice Girls bandmate Mel B that mistakenly included a note to her publicist. Ginger Spice\u2019s account shared a slew of throwback photos with Scary Spice on Wednesday alongside an embarrassing caption that began with a private message intended for Halliwell\u2019s rep, Pippa Beng. \u201cSent images to Pippa and this wording asked her to tweak where needed,\u201d the post read. The real caption followed: \u201cHappy birthday @officialmelb! Hope you have an amazing day!\u201d While the caption was eventually edited to discard the memo for Beng, fans immediately flooded the comments section to roast the pop star, 51, for the flub. \u201cWhat a lovely genuine heartfelt message from yourself,\u201d one person wrote. \u201cIt takes 3 people to post a celebrity\u2019s birthday post to her friend. What world am I living in?!\u201d a confused follower asked. \u201cConfirmation celebs don\u2019t even post legit birthday messages,\u201d another agreed. \u201cSurely you could have written this yourself Geri and made it more personal especially after everything you and Melanie have been through?\u201d one fan wondered. \u201cBabe you need to sort your social media manager out,\u201d another suggested. Others roasted Beng for the mortifying mishap on her client\u2019s page. \u201cOne job Pippa. One job,\u201d one person joked in the comments section. \u201cSending much love to Pippa on this day, she might need a wine glass or two,\u201d a second commented. \u201cPippa has finally \u2018tweaked\u2019 the wording! It reads much more sincerely now,\u201d a third fan wrote. \u201cPippa, I\u2019d tweak it to add a little more sincerity,\u201d a netizen added. \u201cFriendship never ends\u2026 unless Pippa gets involved,\u201d another fan joked, referencing the lyrics to the girl group\u2019s 2007 song \u201cHeadlines (Friendship Never Ends).\u201d \u201cPlot twist: Pippa did this on purpose to boost engagement,\u201d one follower quipped. \u201cCaption is changed\u2026. But we all saw it,\u201d someone else stated. \u201c#prayforpippa,\u201d one more social media user wrote. Page Six has reached out to Beng for comment. The photos posted to Halliwell\u2019s account show her and Mel, whose full name is Melanie Brown, during their touring days in the \u201990s as well as a more recent snap at the British Grand Prix in 2019. Halliwell, Brown, 49, Melanie Chisholm (Sporty Spice), Emma Bunton (Baby Spice) and Victoria Beckham (Posh Spice) formed the Spice Girls in 1994. While the group split up in 2000, the \u201cSpice Up Your Life\u201d singers reunited for a tour in 2007 and 2008 as well as a performance at the 2012 closing ceremony of the London Olympics. They also toured together in 2019, though Beckham, 50, did not join them. Most recently, the fivesome put on an impromptu performance of their 1998 song \u201cStop\u201d at the fashion designer\u2019s private star-studded 50th birthday party in April.", "summary": "Ginger Spice's Instagram account shared throwback photos with Scary Spice alongside an embarrassing caption that began with a note intended for her publicist.", "url": "https://pagesix.com/2024/05/29/entertainment/geri-halliwell-dragged-for-blundered-mel-b-birthday-tribute/", "image": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/82857361.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:53:12", "author": "Leah Bitsky", "authors": ["Leah Bitsky"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.357}

The aristocrat, who is married to Grace Kelly's grandson, opted for a stylish houndstooth dress for the occasion. The mother-of-two's stylish sleeveless dress featured an elegant drop hem and square neckline. The 37-year-old, who was dubbed 'the most stylish European royal' by Tatler last year, opted for simple black accessories with the exception of a dainty gold watch. Beatrice completed her chic ensemble with a small black handbag, leather pumps with gold embellishment and some chunky sunglasses. Pictured: Pierre Casiraghi, son of Caroline, Princess of Hanover with wife Beatrice Borromeo before the Monaco Grand Prix The royal - who married into Monaco's glamorous royal family in 2015 - styled her blonde hair in loose waves and modelled a pair of pearl earrings. Beatrice and Pierre were initially spotted in the Ferrari garage before making their way up to a VIP balcony. Prior to marrying Pierre, Beatrice, whose family owns the Borromean Islands in Lake Maggiore near Milan, along with land in the Lombardy and Piedmont countryside, worked as a newspaper and broadcast journalist in her native Italy. On her wedding day in 2015 \u2013 dubbed the \u2018chicest of the summer\u2019 by Vogue - she wore four couture gowns, two by Valentino for a civil service in Monaco and two by Armani Prive for a religious service at Lake Maggiore. Her family still own the Roca Borromeo castle where the reception took place. She and Pierre have since become parents to two sons, Stefano, five, and Francesco, four. She has now turned her hand to documentary making, recently debuting the three-episode series The King Who Never Was on Netflix. The series focuses on the death of a German teenager in August 1978 which remains a mystery to this day.

For her next project, Beatrice is making a film about the origins of the family she has married into: the Grimaldis of Monaco, Europe\u2019s longest-standing royal family. \u2018My company Astrea Films is producing the film about the seizure of the fortress of Monaco by the Grimaldi family in the Middle Ages,\u2019 she said. Pierre's grandmother Grace Kelly became Princess Grace of Monaco in 1956 when she retired from acting to marry the prince. In 1982, she tragically lost her life in a car accident. Over the course of her 50 years in the public eye, Princess Grace was pictured wearing dozens of couture Christian Dior dresses, including the famous black-and-white one she wore to the 1954 premiere of Hitchcock\u2019s Rear Window, one of her most famous films.

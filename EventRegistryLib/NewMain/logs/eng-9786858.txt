Instead, the 18-year-old said it because it's the only mindset he knows. Chiles wants to be the best, so he'll continue to envision himself as being just that in his pursuit to greatness.\n\nHis job now, he said, is to go out there and prove it to be true.\n\nChiles is arguably the Spartans' most anticipated quarterback in at least a decade. Coach Jonathan Smith already tabbed him as Michigan State's Day 1 starter, noting in the spring it would be an \"upset\" if Chiles isn't under center when the Spartans take the field for their season opener against Florida Atlantic on Aug. 30.\n\nBut all the buzz that's been surrounding Chiles doesn't faze him. He loves the pressure and welcomes it. He knows that the keyboard warriors and fans raving about his potential or being critical of his performances won't have a true impact on what plays out on the field.\n\nChiles, who was rated the No. 1 quarterback in the transfer portal this past winter, has great size, a strong arm and elite explosiveness. His arrival in the spring was an upgrade from Michigan State's messy quarterback situation last season. But what makes Chiles unique is his approach to the mental side of the game. He oozes with confidence but is also self-aware. He knows there are sure to be some growing pains as a first-year starter, but the belief that Smith and offensive coordinator Brian Lindgren have in him will aid in helping him get past any miscues.\n\nWhat excites Chiles most for this season is the opportunity to \"prove what I can do this year.\"\n\nChiles took reps as the backup quarterback at Oregon State last season. He led the Beavers in a drive in nine games and finished the season having completed 68.6% of his passes for 309 yards with four touchdowns. He didn't throw a single interception in his 35 pass attempts and also added 79 yards on the ground, including three rushing scores.\n\n\"Last year, I had one drive a game and I proved a little bit but nobody really saw what I can do,\" Chiles said. \"So this year, the pressure is not there for real -- not in my mind. But I know the team is counting on me to do what I have to do. And I'm also counting on them.\"\n\nBut being the starter is a whole new ballgame. Expectations, especially at a school like Michigan State, are different. The routine leading up to game days can be as mentally straining as the game is physical.\n\n\"He's got the whole week to think about it,\" Lindgren said. \"Coming in as the backup, you kind of got nothing to lose really. You go in there and let it rip for your series. I think that knowing you're going to be the guy and you're going to be out there and having the whole week to really kind of think about that, I think the difference is that.\"\n\nThe big challenge for Chiles over the next few weeks is finding his voice as a leader and maturing into his new role. He already stepped up in the spring when he helped his teammates with the installation of the new offense. Those relationships and the trust between Chiles, the wide receivers, tight ends, running backs and offensive line continued to grow over the summer.\n\n\"He's such a young guy. He was 17 when he came to Oregon State as a freshman, and kind of moving into that role of potentially being the starter for us, he has never started a game which I think people sometimes tend to forget,\" Lindgren said. \"The maturity is something that we've challenged him. I'm seeing him take steps, we're just looking for it more consistently.\"\n\nLearning how to handle situational football, like game management at the end of the first half or late in the fourth quarter, will only get better with real experience. It should help that Chiles has veteran quarterback Tommy Schuster to lean on throughout the season.\n\n\"That's my dog,\" Chiles said of Schuster. \"That's 'Touchdown Tommy.' He don't miss. I like Tommy. Especially him being experienced, it's really good having him.\"\n\nSchuster started 42 games at North Dakota before transferring to Michigan State this spring. He holds the Fighting Hawks' career records for passing yards (9,075), completions (843), touchdown passes (63) and total offense (9,250 yards.)\n\n\"(Schuster) knows...how each rep in camp matters and the detailed difference between executing a good play and creating a big play or something like that and missing it is so small at this level,\" Lindgren said. \"(Chiles has) seen that and heard that a little bit from Tommy.\"\n\nChiles has been eager for the season to start since he set foot on Michigan State's campus in January. It'll take time for him to evolve into the quarterback many believe he can be. But he has the right ideas of what it'll take to get there.\n\n\"Everybody has this mentality but I think I'm the best quarterback in the Big Ten and the nation,\" Chiles said. \"But it comes with the work and also just the team in general. Like the team has to help me out, I got to help them out. So really my improvement is based on the team.\"\n\nSo what does Chiles expect for himself in his first year under center?\n\n\"I'm just here to win games,\" Chiles said. \"That's it.\"\n\nLindgren believes Chiles can help the team do just that.\n\n\"When he's dialed in, and he's going, we're going,\" Lindgren said. \"He's got that confidence, he's got that swagger, that moxie that you really love about a QB and when he's got it going, guys gravitate toward it, it's pretty cool. We're challenging him to be more consistent with it.\"", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_State_Beavers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oregon State Beavers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_Spartans", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State Spartans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Atlantic_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Atlantic University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Smith_(American_football_coach)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Smith (American football coach)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Lindgren", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brian Lindgren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota_Fighting_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Dakota Fighting Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Spicy", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Spicy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/30/PDTN/74608002007-240730-dy-newsms-uftbl-00387.JPG?auto=webp&crop=5045,2835,x4,y29&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786858", "eventUri": "eng-9786858", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-30", "textStart": 896, "textEnd": 903}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

Jordan Chiles floor routine score, explained | Business Upturn", "body": "When Jordan Chiles first saw her score for the floor routine final, it looked like she had just missed the podium, landing in fifth place. The American gymnast was disappointed, believing she had missed out on a medal.\n\nBut then something incredible happened -- a score inquiry changed everything.\n\nThe review led to a late adjustment in Chiles' score, moving her from fifth to third place. This shift bumped her ahead of Romania's Ana Barbosu and secured her a bronze medal.\n\nThis bronze was Chiles' second medal of the Paris Olympics, adding to her gold from the women's team all-around event, making it her first-ever individual Olympic medal. Chiles expressed her excitement and disbelief, saying, \"This is just a dream come true... I honestly didn't expect this whatsoever. I'm just very proud of myself.\"\n\nIn the final standings, Brazil's Rebecca Andrade took gold, while Chiles' teammate Simone Biles won silver.\n\nSo, why did Chiles' score change? Here's a breakdown of the inquiry and how she earned her bronze:\n\nChiles' initial score was 13.666, placing her in fifth. It seemed like she would miss out on a medal. However, following the inquiry, her score was revised to 13.766, which moved her up to third place.\n\nFormer Olympian Laurie Hernandez, speaking on the NBC broadcast, clarified that the judges initially assigned a C value to one of Chiles' leaps, adding 0.30 points to her score. Chiles' team believed this leap was undervalued and decided to challenge it, feeling they had nothing to lose. The judges reviewed the inquiry and agreed with Chiles' team, changing the value of the leap to D, which is worth 0.40 points. This 0.10-point increase made all the difference, moving Chiles from fifth to third and pushing her ahead of Barbosu and Romania's Sabrina Maneca-Voinea.", "source": {"uri": "businessupturn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Upturn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_artistic_team_all-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's artistic team all-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Hernandez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laurie Hernandez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://images.businessupturn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/safeimagekit-Jordan-Chiles-080524_0-1024x576.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786858", "eventUri": "eng-9786858", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

The only other athlete with that much responsibility was the most decorated gymnast of all time, Simone Biles.\n\nThere was a lot of pressure that day, especially while competing in front of thousands of fans, including her family and a host of celebrities: Nicole Kidman, Spike Lee, Jason and Kylie Kelce, Keith Urban, Serena Williams, and Michael Phelps. Just to name a few.\n\n\"The biggest one that I was really shocked came to watch us was Queen Latifah. I was like, 'Oh my gosh she's sitting in the audience watching us, that's so crazy,'\" Chiles said. \"We've been seen! I sometimes don't realize how many people actually know who I am. I don't think of myself as anybody famous.\"\n\nOne might assume that performing in front of thousands of celebrities would be intimidating, but Chiles uses that as motivation to perform even better.\n\nAside from a misstep on her beam mount, Chiles had one of her best competitions when it mattered most. One might say she looked as good as gold.\n\nWhen Chiles struck her final pose on the floor, she couldn't hold back her emotions.\n\nThose tears resembled a culmination of personal struggles, relentless effort, and a deep sense of pride.\n\n\"I was very proud of myself that I was able to make my floor routine because obviously on beam I had a fall,\" Chiles said. \"I just wanted to support the team as much as I could and knew that I could do that in my floor routine. The tears were everything that I've gone through. I've had a few really tough years since 2021; losing people, going to college, figuring out life.\n\n\"I knew at that moment once I made my floor that Simone was going to go out and do her job and we were hopefully going to have that gold in our hands. I think the biggest thing was realizing that I had finally done something and people have recognized it.\"\n\nThe admiration and recognition on social media since becoming an Olympic gold medalist is something Chiles will remember for the rest of her life.\n\nDespite her humility - she insists that she's \"still the same Jordan\" - Chiles has had her idols on notice since before the Games began.\n\nAfter being named to the Olympic team, Megan Thee Stallion sent Chiles flowers. Then just days before she was set to leave for Paris, Chiles received a mysterious, unlabeled package.\n\n\"I needed to have my mom bring me some stuff while we were at our camp in Katy, Texas and I was like, 'Hey can you bring me some stuff before we leave?' She was like, 'Yeah, there's also a package here for you that I'm going to bring,'\" Chiles recalled. \"Beyonc\u00e9 had sent me a personalized vinyl.

Mandatory Credit: Jack Gruber-USA TODAY Sports / Jack Gruber-USA TODAY Sports\n\nJordan Chiles earned a bronze medal in the floor final on Monday, making it her first individual Olympic medal.\n\nThe UCLA alumna featured a split leap with a 1.5-turn in her routine which was originally not counted by the judges. After a review, Chiles earned full credit for the leap. The one-tenth of a point increase was the catapult she needed to earn her first individual Olympic medal.\n\nAna Barbosu of Romania had prematurely celebrated on the floor when Chiles' new score came through. Chiles burst into tears and fell to the ground. Cecile Landi, her coach, embraced the gymnast following the turn of events. Fellow Team USA gymnast, Simone Biles looked elated on the floor as she discovered the score change.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have no words, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m so proud of myself,\u00e2\u20ac Chiles rasped to reporters after the meet. \"So losing my voice means everything, because it takes a while for me to do that.\"\n\n\"I was like, jumping up and down. They're like, 'What happened?' And then I showed them ... I honestly didn't expect this whatsoever,\" Chiles said.\n\nAppealing a score is somewhat of a gamble in gymnastics. It usually ends in the judges lowering a gymnast's score but on Monday, it was in favor of Chiles' routine.\n\nAs the world watched, the bronze medalist featured a Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9-themed routine and had a strong performance overall.\n\n\"I was so nervous, I didn't know what to do,\" Chiles said. \"After my first pass, all I was thinking in my head was, 'Jordan, keep your feet on the ground please, that's all I ask.'\"\n\n\"I'm proud of each and every one of these girls, and especially myself,\" she added.\n\nChiles defeated two Romanian gymnasts, Sabrina Voinea and Ana Barbosu, for the bronze medal. Rebeca Andrade of Brazil earned gold and Biles took silver.\n\nThis was a historic feat as three Black gymnasts comprised the Olympic gymnastics podium. Chiles and her teammate, Biles, displayed their admiration for gold medalist Adrade by celebrating the Brazilian.\n\n\"Why don't we just give her flowers?\" Chiles said of the gesture. \"Not only has she given Simone her flowers, but a lot of us in the United States, our flowers as well. So giving it back is what makes it so beautiful. I felt like it was needed.\"\n\nChiles won a gold medal along with the other Team USA gymnasts in the team final on July 30. Chiles also earned a silver medal in the Tokyo Olympics.

He was 17 when he came to Oregon State as a freshman and kind of moving into that role of potentially being the starter for us. He has never started a game -- I think people sometimes tend to forget.

Minutes later, the public address announcer at Bercy Arena proclaimed Chiles the bronze medalist.\n\nAn official \"inquiry\" by the American coaching staff had resulted in an improvement of .100 in Chiles' score for difficulty -- enough to vault her onto the podium.\n\nElation replaced dejection as USA teammate and training partner Simone Biles, the silver medalist, gave Chiles a big hug.\n\n\"I was so tired, I didn't even realize my coaches put an inquiry in,\" Chiles said, \"and I was like, 'OK, let's see. It can vary.' When it came through, I was very proud of myself. It was my first event final and my first event medal. This is crazy.'\"\n\nThe two-time Olympian added the bronze medal to the gold she won in the team event in Paris and the team silver in Tokyo three years ago, giving her a complete set of Olympic medals.\n\nChiles, 23, was the final competitor in the entire artistic gymnastics competition in Paris. As the ninth and last performer in floor exercise, she took the spotlight after two men's events, parallel bars and horizontal bar, and a disastrous balance beam competition in which four of the eight women fell -- including Biles and USA teammate Sunisa Lee.\n\nFor the first time since 2000, an American did not medal in balance beam.\n\n\"Watching beam was, 'Oh my gosh, what is happening?'\" Chiles said. \"It was overwhelming. While sitting in the back waiting to warm up, and then going out into the competition floor and being the last person to go, I was so nervous I didn't know what to do.\"\n\nShe didn't show it. Chiles smiled, blew on her hands and nodded to her team, before closing her eyes and taking a deep breath.\n\nHer Beyonce'-infused routine garnered the third-highest score during the qualification round on July 28, so Chiles had a good chance to make the podium. Two spots before her, Biles, the favorite, had stepped out twice with both feet. With six-tenths in penalties, she scored 14.133 while Rebeca Andrade of Brazil was the leader at 14.166. Sabrina Maneca-Voinea held third place with a score of 13.700, and her own team's inquiry to boost her score had resulted in no change. Lee was sixth.\n\n\"After my first pass,\" Chiles said, \"all I was thinking in my head was, 'Jordan, you better just keep your feet on the ground, please. That's all I ask.\"\n\nOn her final pass, her double layout was a little short and Chiles took a step forward. When the score flashed, it was 13.666.\n\nUSA coach Cecile Landi had one minute to launch an inquiry. Her husband, Laurent, another USA coach, said, \"What do you have to lose? She was out of the podium already, even if they dropped the score. I felt it was way better than all the other meets that she's done, so what the heck.\"\n\nAfter a video review, Chiles' score for difficulty went up from 5.800 to 5.900, her highest potential.\n\nWhile it was her first individual medal, it was the sixth for Biles, who has 11 total Olympic medals -- including seven gold. The 27-year-old leaves Paris with three gold medals, including her second all-around crown, and one silver.\n\n\"Today has been absolutely wild,\" said Biles. \"I've been competing here at the Olympics for a week or so now. I've been on that floor so many times competing, so obviously exhaustion and all that sets in. We still had to go out and compete one more time today.\"\n\nIn Tokyo, a bronze on balance beam marked her comeback after withdrawing from the all-around competition and other individual events due to \"the twisties.\" But with the fall in Paris, she wound up fifth.\n\n\"I'm not very upset or anything about my performance at the Olympics,\" Biles said. \"I'm actually very happy, proud and even more excited that it's over, the stress of it.\"\n\nShe emphasized that she has no regrets. \"I've accomplished way more than my wildest dreams, not just at this Olympics, but in the sport,\" Biles said. \"A couple of years ago, I didn't think I'd be back here at an Olympics.\"\n\nIn a viral moment, Biles and Chiles bowed down to Andrade during the floor exercise awards ceremony to show respect as the Brazilian stepped onto the podium for her medal.\n\n\"She's an icon, a legend herself, so I feel like being recognized, is what everybody should do,\" Chiles. \"It was an all-black podium, so why don't we give her her flowers?\"\n\nIn the biggest surprise of the women's competition, Alice D'Amato won the balance beam for the first gold by an Italian woman in gymnastics. Her teammate Manila Esposito took the bronze and Zhou Yaqin of China grabbed the silver.\n\nBiles and Lee were unnerved by the silent arena. \"Usually we have music or background noise, and honestly we do better in environments when there's noise going on because it feels most like practice,\" Biles said. \"So, today we could hear some of the Android ring tones going off, photo clickers, and then people start cheering, and then the shushing gets louder, so really they should be shushed.\"\n\nYet the American gymnasts feel they have quieted the doubters from three years ago, when the team won the silver medal. \"This was definitely a redemption tour,\" Biles said. \"Team USA did such an amazing job out here on the gymnastics floor, so there's nothing left. We did our job.\n\n\"It's hard but we did it.\"\n\nChiles said she was proud of herself, her team and her ability to \"go to another Olympic Games and just show and express who you are as a person, always being authentic.\n\n\"Paris, it's been fun, it's been real, but we out of here now.\"", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [],

Chiles starts by jumping with joy with her coach.\n\nAfter she runs down the floor a bit, Chiles falls to the ground and breaks down in tears of joy before being picked up by her coach.

The gymnast who's been questioned, abused, ridiculed, body-shamed, and failed to make a single individual event final in the 2020 Tokyo Games. The Olympian who nailed four individual routines last week, but missed qualifying for the all-around competition because of ill-conceived rules disallowing more than two qualifiers from each country. The young woman who's been so public about so many private struggles.\n\nThat's Jordan Chiles.\n\nAnd Jordan Chiles could've made this moment about herself.\n\nEverything that came before was as dramatic as it was confusing; as emotional as it was spiritual. On Monday afternoon, Chiles walked onto the floor at Bercy Arena knowing she needed to score better than 13.700 in the floor routine to secure a first individual medal in Olympic competition. The routine was good, not great. As Chellsie Memmel, the Team USA technical director, put it afterward, the landings were a little loose and the tumbling passes weren't too crisp. The resulting score maybe had a chance to leapfrog Romanians Ana Barbosa and Sabrina Maneca-Voinea, both tied in third, but it'd be close.\n\nThen came word -- 13.666. Fifth place.\n\nChiles was the last finalist on the day's docket, a position that can be a good thing or a bad thing. It leaves one knowing exactly what's needed to win, but also knowing exactly what isn't good enough.\n\n\"It can be a lot of extra pressure,\" Memmel said, \"but some people also really like it.\"\n\nChiles has talked endlessly in recent years about shedding pressure. Self-pressure. Outside pressure. She says she's grown comfortable in her skin and doesn't care what anyone else expects of her.\n\nIn this instance, though, much of that went out the window. \"I was so nervous,\" Chiles said late Monday afternoon. \"I didn't know what to do after my first (acrobatic) pass. All I was thinking was like, 'Jordan, you better just keep your feet on the ground. Please, that's all I ask.'\"\n\nChiles made it through the set, but reality was reality. A few minor technical miscues dotted the routine. It happens. It was a fate she was mature enough to accept.\n\nChiles began gathering her belongings and heading toward an arena tunnel, but then, a twist. A coup de th\u00e9\u00e2tre. Team USA coach Cecile Landi submitted a score inquiry, requesting the judges review a dance element, believing the score might not have accurately reflected the routine's skills. Landi knew there was a chance of such a scenario. She exchanged text messages with Memmel before the routine about the possibility.\n\nNow the inquiry was in and the results were in question.\n\nWhat was known: A gold medal was assured for dazzling Brazilian Rebeca Andrade. A silver medal was going to Biles, an anticlimactic swansong no one planned for.\n\nWhat was left: That bronze.\n\nThe arena public address announcer finally cut through growing confusion with the final answer.\n\nChiles' eyes grew to the size of saucers. Biles ran down the side of the floor toward her. Their shared moment went from shock over Biles missing out on gold to utter joy over Chiles taking bronze. It was a long time coming. Chiles was invited to move to Houston in 2019 to train alongside Biles, the then-seven-time Olympic medalist, and has been there since. If you think about it, on the one hand, she signed up to work with the best gymnast in the world, but on the other hand, she signed up to reserve a spot as second fiddle. That says all you need to know about Chiles.\n\nChiles started in gymnastics at age 6. Her parents hoped it'd be an outlet for her boundless energy. By 11, she was competing in elite gymnastics. By 13, she was a member of the United States women's national gymnastics team. She was an incredible talent but came of age when no one, nowhere, would rise to the size of 4-foot-8 Biles.\n\nInstead of bemoaning the shadow, Chiles danced in it. She became an equal parts teammate, hype-woman, and outspoken voice. She made her own space.\n\nNow 23 years old, though, Chiles came to Paris very aware that her Olympic career is likely at its end. She'll of course continue competing, and can still return to UCLA for two more years of a brilliant NCAA career, but at this level? She was a borderline long shot to make the 2024 USA team. She'll be 27 for 2028 in Los Angeles. Sure, Biles competed this week at age 27, but she's also the best to ever do it.\n\nSo, winning bronze in an individual event, Chiles looked around Bercy Arena in a daze. She stepped up to the podium for an introduction and dipped her head for the bronze. She kept it together until looking up at the rafters and holding the medal in the air. Having lost a dear grandfather and aunt in 2023, it was obvious where her mind went. That's when Chiles choked up and it all seemed to sink in.\n\nBiles was then introduced for silver.\n\nDone staring down at her bronze, Chiles looked to her right, making eye contact with Biles. She gave a little nod and mimed a little mock bow. Biles smiled and nodded back.\n\nWith the top podium open, Andrade stepped up as gold medalist. At 25, she goes way back with both Biles and Chiles, often the only foil to Biles' brilliance. She's worthy of any stage in front of her.\n\nSo, as Andrade stepped up, the two Americans both extended their arms, lowered their heads, and dipped down. The highest compliment at the ultimate moment. All three were well aware of Monday ending with an all-Black podium -- a scene none of them could've imagined when they were younger.\n\nNow, the gesture will forever be associated with these Games.",

Barbosu began to celebrate, but the U.S. Gymnastics coaches submitted a late inquiry to review Chiles's score after her performance, asking judges to take a look at the difficulty component of her overall score.\n\nAfter a long delay, officials boosted Chiles' score by 0.1, giving her a final score of 13.766, edging out a stunned Barbosu for the bronze. Chiles burst into tears upon hearing the final result.\n\nIt's the first individual medal for Chiles in her Olympics career.

She originally placed fifth but submitted an inquiry to the judges and received a tenth back on her final score.\n\nThen she erupted in celebration.\n\nA skill in her routine called a Gogean, a split leap with a 1.5-turn, was originally not credited by the judges. Their score sheets are not made public, but the rationale is typically related to insufficient rotation.\n\nUpon review, Chiles earned full credit for the leap and it was a medal-making difference. Afterwards, Chiles said she didn't even know her coaches had submitted the appeal on her behalf.\n\nFollow along for live coverage\n\nWhen her new score came appeared on the screen, she fell to the ground and burst into tears. Her coach, Cecile Landi, also dissolved into tears and helped the gymnast to her feet, the pair cheering so loudly that Chiles lost her voice.\n\n\"I have no words, but I'm so proud of myself,\" Chiles rasped after the meet. \"So losing my voice means everything, because it takes a while for me to do that.\"\n\nAppealing a score is a risky business, which often results in an even lower score than before. The gymnast's federation must pay a fee and file the inquiry to the judges promptly.\n\n\"You can go either way, go up, go down,\" Chiles said. \"I was the first one to see because I was looking at the screen.\"\n\nShe quickly grabbed the attention of her coach and Simone Biles. \"I was like, jumping up and down. They're like, 'What happened?' And then I showed them ... I honestly didn't expect this whatsoever,\" Chiles said.\n\n\"I'm proud of each and every one of these girls, and especially myself,\" she added. She won a gold medal with her American teammates in Tuesday's team final, as well as a team silver in Tokyo. A bronze completes her Olympic set.\n\nChiles had some unstable landings throughout her Beyonc\u00e9-themed routine, losing a few tenths in execution, but had a strong showing overall.\n\n\"I was so nervous, I didn't know what to do,\" Chiles said. \"After my first pass, all I was thinking in my head was, 'Jordan, keep your feet on the ground please, that's all I ask.'\"\n\nIn the end, she bested two Romanian gymnasts, Sabrina Voinea and Ana Barbosu, and finished third, earning a 13.766. Rebeca Andrade of Brazil earned gold and Biles, Chiles' teammate and training mate, took silver.\n\nIt was the first Olympic gymnastics podium comprised of three Black gymnasts.\n\nWhen they received their medals, Chiles and Biles bowed to Andrade in a show of their admiration.\n\n\"Why don't we just give her flowers?\" Chiles said of the gesture. \"Not only has she given Simone her flowers, but a lot of us in the United States, our flowers as well. So giving it back is what makes it so beautiful. I felt like it was needed.\"\n\nVoinea and Barbosu both scored 13.700 on their floor routines, but until Chiles' appeal, Barbosu retained the bronze medal position due to her superior execution score. While the sudden twist was a jubilant surprise for Chiles, it was a heart-wrenching loss for Barbosu, who thought she had earned her first Olympic medal.\n\nThe dramatic inquiry echoes Aly Raisman's clutch appeal from the 2012 London Olympics, where she won a bronze on the balance beam after contesting her score.\n\nRaisman, like Chiles, was also the last to go in her Olympic final, making the time-crunch to file an expedient appeal particularly intense and the result more dramatic.\n\nAnother Romanian, Catalina Ponor, lost her bronze to Raisman in London.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebeca_Andrade", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebeca Andrade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C\u0103t\u0103lina_Ponor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "C\u0103t\u0103lina Ponor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aly_Raisman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aly Raisman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-08/240805-olympics-gymnastics-jordan-chiles-mn-1035-ee800a.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786858", "eventUri": "eng-9786858", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Chiles enters his second college season -- and first in green and white -- as the all-but-assumed starter and a beacon of optimism for fans after a tumultuous past few years, looking to bring stability specifically at quarterback and, in the big picture, to a team in transition.\n\nEven if he's only 18 years old. With only 91 snaps to his name. And the weight of a program on his broadening shoulders.\n\nAnd the confidence and raw skills of a burgeoning superstar. With one mission: \"I'm just here to win games. That's it.\"\n\nBEEN AROUND A WHILE: Vets keep expectations high despite new coach, roster turnover\n\n\"I think -- well, I mean, everybody has the mentality -- but I think I'm the best quarterback in the Big Ten and in the nation,\" Chiles said Thursday after MSU's third practice of preseason camp. \"Everybody has (that mentality), though, so my job is to prove it.\"\n\nThe buzz around Chiles is by far the biggest of any transfer MSU has brought in during the portal era. That includes current NFL players who arrived via transfer, among them running back Kenneth Walker III, wide receiver Jayden Reed and linebacker Ben VanSumeren. The 6-foot-3, 217-pound California native was rated the No. 8 overall transfer, and second-best quarterback transfer, going into this fall, according to 247 Sports' rankings.\n\nWhile it is difficult to compare the expectations and excitement that come with bringing in a new QB, as opposed to any other position, there is an anticipation that Chiles can generate the type of momentum shift that Walker did during his one season in 2021 -- when he went from a platoon back at Wake Forest to becoming the Spartans' first Big Ten running back of the year, Doak Walker Award winner and Walter Camp national player of the year.\n\n\"Aidan has such a vital role on the offense. They work around him,\" sixth-year senior defensive tackle Maverick Hansen said Tuesday of Chiles. \"He's the one, he's the one that everyone's looking at to be the guy and everything, just like any other quarterback. Now (Walker) is a running back. But we knew in spring ball before we even hit the season that K9 was a guy, because he would just cut up and he'd be gone before anyone else could touch him. And we're like, 'Holy smokes, this dude is the real deal.' And the coaches would say, 'Oh, K9 ain't gonna be here long. As soon as this season's over, he's in the league. ...'\n\n\"It's different for a quarterback, absolutely. He's got a lot -- he can throw the ball, he can run the ball, he's got a lot of different options, as far as a running back can really just run and block. So I feel like there's a lot of potential there for Aidan. He's young, too, and he's been developing. And he pushes the team to be great.\"\n\nNew MSU coach Jonathan Smith signed Chiles in December 2022. The strong-armed, swift-footed native of Los Angeles suburb Downey, California, enrolled at Oregon State a month later, expecting to play right away after graduating high school early.\n\nHowever, Smith and his staff added Clemson transfer DJ Uiagalelei as the early signing period closed. Uiagalelei started every game in the Beavers' 8-4 season, but Smith played Chiles during nine games, giving him his collegiate baptism by rotating him in for every third series. Chiles responded by going 24-for-35 (68.6%) for 309 yards and four touchdowns, adding 17 carries for 79 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nAs Smith and his staff -- including primary play-caller Lindgren -- headed east to East Lansing, it didn't take long for Chiles to follow. Particularly as MSU lost all three of its scholarship quarterbacks -- Noah Kim (Coastal Carolina), Katin Houser (East Carolina) and Sam Leavitt (Arizona State) -- to transfers.\n\n\"He's such a young guy,\" Lindgren said. \"He was 17 when he came to Oregon State as a freshman, and he's kind of moving into that role to potentially be the starter for us. ... I think just the maturity is something that we've challenged him. I've seen him take steps, I'm just -- (and) we're just looking for it more consistently. I think that's something, as he as he continues to go through camp, that'll be something that we're asking him to work on.\n\n\"It's been cool to see him take those those steps, but I think he can still continue to grow in that area as just a veteran guy (with) consistency, being detailed, bringing some of the younger guys along with him.\"\n\nSenior Montorie Foster, who watched Chiles grow into the starting role upon arriving in January and going through spring practice, said the receivers spent the summer months working almost every other day on their timing and connection. It didn't take much for Foster to succinctly sum up what he's seen from his new quarterback.\n\n\"Dynamic. I can say that in one word,\" Foster said. \"But if you want me to go more in detail: He's just a dude, man. He makes plays, he stretches plays. That West Coast offense, being able to get them out the pocket and stretch plays down the field, it helps my game to make more plays down the field.\"\n\nLindgren said Chiles watched attentively as an understudy to Uiagalelei in Corvallis, learning how to prepare each week and approach the game with a starter's mindset, as opposed to just being a backup. And Chiles added that he keeps in touch with his former teammate, who transferred again to Florida State after Smith and Co. left Corvallis.\n\nThe big improvement that Lindgren wants now -- one Chiles admits he needs to work on -- is taking the reins of leadership that come with his position. Some of that can only be learned on the job and through the inevitable highs and lows of being an every-down player, the only one with the ball in his hands on every snap.\n\nChiles feels he is ready to take that next step, adding that he understands the work necessary to turn his moxie and self-proclamation of greatness into a reality.\n\n\"I love the pressure,\" Chiles said. \"I don't know how to explain it, but it's just different now. I get to prove what I can do this year. Last year, I had one drive a game and I proved a little bit. But nobody really saw what I can do. So this year, the pressure is not there, for real, not in my mind.\n\n\"But I know that the team is counting on me to do what I have to do, and I'm also counting on them.\"\n\nContact Chris Solari: csolari@freepress.com.

Prior to the start of the Olympics, the singer sent Chiles an autographed vinyl with a handwritten message, calling the gymnast her \"twin.\"\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion gave Chiles some major kudos during her balance beam routine en route to Team USA winning gold in the women's team event on Tuesday.\n\n\"You Killing it my girl,\" Megan Thee Stallion took to her Instagram story.\n\nOver the past month, Chiles has been recognized by many stars in different walks of life, including Beyonc\u00e9 and Michael Jordan.\n\nChiles has also hinted she'll be making a big \"announcement\" about her future on Tuesday, Aug. 6 after she finishes competing in Paris and it may involve returning to her alma mater UCLA and the gymnastics team here, according to olympics.com.\n\n\"I know floor is coming up. That's my main focus, but you never know. You never know. I might have the four letters [UCLA] across my chest.

Simone will also face off against her teammate Suni Lee in the beam finals that same day.\n\nBut before the big finale, Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles are making the most of their time in Paris. They've been spotted enjoying the city's stunning sights while rocking their Team USA red shorts.\n\nBiles And Chiles Model Team USA Shorts\n\nBiles and Chiles were seen hanging out on a Parisian rooftop, taking in the city's iconic sights. Both gymnasts rocked matching red Team USA shorts, with Biles pairing hers with a black sports bra and Chiles choosing a white one. \"red, white, biles & chiles,\" Biles captioned the post.\n\nBoth gymnasts wore their hair in buns while they looked at one another, smiling from ear to ear. Fans couldn't get enough of their adorable snap as it gained over 1.7k comments in less than one hour.\n\n\"You both are AMAZING!!!\" one fan wrote. \"Thank you for showing up with integrity, honesty, playfulness, and being willing to demonstrate the importance of self-care in this crazy world of the athletic-industrial complex.\"\n\n\"I love this so much,\" another commented as a third expressed, \"SLAY QUEENS.\"\n\nA fourth said, \"Cute biles&chiles vibes!\"\n\nSimone Biles Helped Jordan Chiles Back Into The Sport\n\nThe duo became close friends after Biles invited Chiles to train in her gym, shortly after Chiles said she \"didn't think the sport wanted [her] anymore.\"\n\n\"I guess this sport is coming to an end for me because things just aren't working out for me at all whatsoever,\" Chiles recalled, per The New York Times. \"I just wanted to finish high school and go off to college. But then I had a talk with Simone.\"\n\nBiles took Chiles under her wing, forming a bond as close as sisterhood. With Bile's guidance and support, Chiles found her way back to the top of the sport.\n\nThe Duo Began Training At The Same Gym\n\nBy the end of 2018, Biles offered Chiles a game-changing suggestion: why not move to Texas and train at her gym, World Champions Centre, with coaches Cecile and Laurent Landi?\n\nThe Landis were known for their tough, meticulous training, but they also stressed the need for a balanced life to handle the pressures of the sport. Biles told Chiles straight up: if she was going to move to Texas and train at World Champions Centre, it had to be something she truly wanted, not just something she felt obligated to do.\n\nAs soon as Chiles heard the offer, she knew she had to say yes. But before she could head south to Texas, she had one big task to wrap up: finishing high school.\n\nSimone Biles Takes On The Role Of Big Sister\n\nJust two days after graduating from high school, Chiles stepped through the doors of Biles's gym in Spring, Texas. According to the New York Times, she took a deep breath and tried to keep an open mind. For the first time in a long while, she wouldn't be the top gymnast in the room. She wondered if she could trust the other elite gymnasts and the coaches.\n\nWhile Biles played the role of big sister, the Landis took charge of helping Chiles get settled. With the move to Texas coming right before the 2020 Olympics, Chiles said she was on a tight schedule to prepare. Her first big test was the U.S. Classic, just about four weeks away.\n\n\"We always knew she was super talented, but I remember seeing her at Classic and being shocked at how good she looked,\" Cecile Landi told the outlet of Chiles. \"Laurent and I were like, 'Wait, hold on, wow, this is just the beginning.'\"\n\nJordan Chiles Learned A Lot From Simone Biles\n\nTo make the sport less stressful, Biles would host dinner parties or take trips to beach resorts, and the gymnasts would often share laughs and jokes during practice or competitions. Chiles added that the Landis are known for really listening to their gymnasts, taking their thoughts seriously without reprimanding them for speaking up.\n\n\"I discovered that gymnastics doesn't always have to be about strictness and being so hard on yourself and having so much doubt,\" Chiles said. \"I actually realized this when I saw Simone compete. She looks like she's having fun out there, laughing and giggling, and doesn't look stressed or tired. I was like, 'You know, I'm going to try that one of these days and see how it turns out.'\"\n\nBiles and Chiles are currently competing in the 2024 Paris Olympics together.", "source": {"uri": "theblast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Blast"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kelly_coffey_behrens@theblast.com", "name": "Kelly Coffey-Behrens", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_artistic_team_all-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's artistic team all-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Champions_Centre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Champions Centre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurent_Landi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laurent Landi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_climbing_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport climbing at the 2020 Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spring, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Spring, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Rhythmic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Rhythmic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Spicy", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Spicy", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Organizations", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/brand-img/123/1300x600/2024/08/04154645/simone-biles-jordan-chiles.jpg?", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786858", "eventUri": "eng-9786858", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 181, "textEnd": 189}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

She contributed to their first-place finish, which earned her country their fourth overall Olympic team gold medal.\n\nChiles' past success includes an Olympic silver medal at the 2020 event in Tokyo, a 2022 World Championship gold medal, a 2023 Pan American Games gold medal, and three Pacific Rim Championships gold medals.\n\nThe super-talented star -- who recently appeared on the cover of Teen Vogue -- has a mixed ethnic background. But what is Jordan Chiles' ethnicity?\n\nJordan Chiles was born to Timothy and Gina Chiles (n\u00e9e Velasquez) in Tualatin, Oregon, on April 15, 2001. As Yahoo! Entertainment explains, Chiles is Black from Timothy's side of the family and biracial and Latina from Gina's side.\n\nIn her Teen Vogue cover issue, she explained to the publication that she had been the target of racism in the past. Referring to one incident when she was a child, Chiles said, \"Some lady in the crowd basically was like, 'She doesn't deserve to be on the floor. She doesn't even look like anybody else.' People were racially attacking me without me even really knowing.\"\n\nNobody deserves to go through that, but Chiles hasn't let it stand in the way of her monumental sporting success -- and if anything proves she \"deserves\" to be on the floor, it's the multiple gold medals that we hope the racist lady is now aware of.\n\nWe wish Jordan Chiles all the luck in the world for future success -- not that someone as outrageously talented as her needs it.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_stewart@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Kevin Stewart", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artistic gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Carey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jade Carey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Vogue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teen Vogue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Rim_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Rim Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_American_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pan American Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tualatin,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tualatin, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tualatin, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2164446894.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786858", "eventUri": "eng-9786858", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2001-04-15", "textStart": 905, "textEnd": 919}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Chiles' coaches on Team USA had questioned whether judges gave her appropriate credit for a leaping skill in her routine. A review backed the coaches.\n\n\"I didn't even realize my coaches put in an inquiry,\" Chiles said afterward, according to the Olympics' news service.

Chiles told reporters on Thursday that the veteran tight end's familiarity with the offense made for an easy transition to the program.\n\n\"It's very valuable for sure because he already knew the offense, came in and he really just ran with it,\" Chiles said. \"It was no hiccups, he was perfect. Everything flowed real smooth. But it's just good having him there for the other guys, too. They've acclimated really well; the tight end group is just amazing right now. They don't have a lot of M.A.s, they don't have a lot of mess-ups, they're just there to play ball, and they catch the ball. That's what they do.

It's good.\"\n\n\"He's [Chiles] become more of that leader, that vocal guy who you can always count on to be saying the right thing and be doing the right thing,\" Velling said at Big Ten Football Media Days last month. \"He's young, but you wouldn't know it.

He works as a pastor and was the one who originally got credit for signing Jordan up for gymnastics.\n\nTimothy first realized Jordan might succeed as a gymnast as he was watching her alone for a week while Gina was on a business trip. Jordan was \"revved up from morning until bedtime\" during that week, per the New York Times.\n\nAfter that, the two parents decided to let Jordan try gymnastics. She quickly found success there and eventually established herself as a force on the national team.\n\nLike Timothy, Gina Chiles is also a pastor. Jordan has described her as being \"literally in love with sports,\" and that's how the youngest Chiles got her name: from Michael Jordan.\n\nChiles' mother was a key force in her sports career, supporting Jordan during some struggles in her team years when she did not see eye to eye with her coaches.\n\n\"She's literally the life of me. I love her to death,\" Jordan said of her mother to NBC Sports in June 2021. \"She's my best friend. I can't thank her enough for everything that she's done for me and the love and support that she's given is 1,000 percent out of this world.\"\n\nThe duo's close relationship is evident during Chiles' competitions, as he mother is often seen raucously rooting her on from the crowd.\n\n2024 PARIS OLYMPICS\n\nFull Olympics schedule | How to watch in USA | Meet NBC's broadcasters\n\nYes, Chiles has four siblings.

Since I was 12 years old, I've talked to my sister about it. We've talked about it over and over again. I want my wedding to be in the summer, and I want it to be a very chic, modern vibe.

A bouncy landing on her first tumbling pass and a step forward on her final landing resulted in a couple deductions that appeared to knock her out of medal contention.\n\nAt first, the judges flashed a 13.666, which slotted her into fifth place, but Chiles' coaches thought something was amiss with her difficulty score. They submitted a score inquiry, requesting the judges review a dance element known as a tour jet\u00e9 full (or a split leap with a 1.5 turn). This process involves a verbal and written inquiry plus a $300 fee. If a gymnast feels her score doesn't accurately reflect the skills she had in her routine, she can submit the inquiry form to ask the judges for a review. There is a bit of risk, as an inquiry can also result in the judges lowering a score, but Chiles had nothing to lose given that she was the last competitor in the final and her initial score placed her fifth.\n\nShe hadn't gotten full credit for the tour jet\u00e9 full when she performed it during qualifications or the team final, but her coaches felt she did fully rotate the turn Monday. After a brief deliberation, the judges agreed. By crediting Chiles for the leap, they also raised her difficulty score, which increased her overall score to a 13.766. It was just high enough to surpass Romania's Ana Barbosu, who had a 13.700.\n\nThe new score placed Chiles behind Brazilian star Rebeca Andrade, who took gold, and Biles, who earned silver.\n\n\"This is just a dream come true,\" said Chiles, sounding high pitched after partially losing her voice from cheering for her teammates over multiple days of Olympic competition. \"This medal means everything. First event final, first event medal. Oh my gosh! I have no words, but I'm very proud of myself.\"\n\nIt was another milestone on the redemption tour that this U.S. women's gymnastics team has been vocal about since Olympic trials. Chiles was a member of the squad that took silver in Tokyo after Biles withdrew from the team final due to a mental block known as the twisties, and the returning 2020 Olympians were all gunning for the team gold they knew they were capable of grabbing when they performed to their usual standards.\n\nThe bronze on floor holds extra significance for Chiles, who didn't qualify for any individual finals at the Tokyo Games and was bumped from the all-around competition in Paris due to a rule that permits only two athletes per country to advance to individual finals. During qualifications, she finished behind Biles and just .067 behind teammate Sunisa Lee, who went on to win bronze in the all-around. She earned her place in the floor exercise final in somewhat surprising fashion, after reigning Olympic floor exercise champion Jade Carey fell on the event during qualifications to open the door for another American to advance behind Biles.\n\nWith one chance at an individual Olympic medal on the line, Chiles hit her sassy Beyonc\u00e9-inspired routine and perhaps the best tour jet\u00e9 full of her life.\n\nIn the end, it was that leap that sent her jumping for joy around Bercy Arena to close the competition with a dramatic flair and a podium featuring three Black women for the first time in Olympic gymnastics history.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tess_demeyer@nytimes.com", "name": "Tess DeMeyer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_artistic_team_all-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's artistic team all-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebeca_Andrade", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebeca Andrade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accor_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accor Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Carey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jade Carey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/08/05104951/GettyImages-2165381856.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786858", "eventUri": "eng-9786858", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

If I go back, they're going to think I need to do this, that, and the other.\"\n\nChiles revealed in June that she almost quit gymnastics altogether due to the lack of diversity in the sport. Ultimately, however, she put her collegiate career at UCLA on hold after last season to lock in for the 2024 Olympics -- and she took a note from Beyonc\u00e9 to remember, \"I'm that girl.\"\n\n\"Just seeing the resilience [Beyonc\u00e9] had within herself to become this amazing person. She didn't have to look back on other people's opinions,\" Chiles told Us while promoting her partnership with Oikos, Activia and Too Good & Co. before the Olympics. \"She didn't have to do any of those things and just kept to herself. So the pressure kind of wore off right now, I don't have to prove to anybody. I am always forever going to be an Olympian.\"\n\nNow, Chiles can also call herself a gold medalist. Team USA won the women's team all-around event on Tuesday, July 30, in Paris after placing second in the same event at the Tokyo Games. Chiles was also on hand to support her teammates Simone Biles and Suni Lee, who took home gold and bronze, respectively, in the individual all-around on Thursday, August 1. She'll return to the mat for the women's floor exercise final before the end of the Paris Games.\n\nTeam USA's result was an ending years in the making for Chiles, who endured the grind of prepping for the Olympics with the help of Oikos, Activia and Too Good & Co. She teamed up with fellow Olympians Sha'Carri Richardson and Kristie Mewis for the campaign as the brands joined forces to create drinkable yogurts and dairy drinks to support athletes on the move.\n\n\"This campaign has been amazing,\" Chiles told Us. \"I'm hustling in the gym every single day, 24/7. It's long weekends, long weeks. I was really happy I was able to join and be a part of it because I feel like being able to get the right nutrients within your body and put it out into the world that it's OK to have those times where you may have to take a snack on the go or whatever.\"\n\nChiles also touted the three grams of sugar and 10 grams of protein in the drinks, which helped keep her moving. As she put it, \"I'm always a hustler, so I'm going to keep hustling no matter what.\"", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "russell_steinberg@usmagazine.com", "name": "Russell Steinberg", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beyonc\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_artistic_team_all-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's artistic team all-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Activia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_rhythmic_individual_all-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's rhythmic individual all-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha'Carri_Richardson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sha'Carri Richardson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristie_Mewis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristie Mewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogurt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yogurt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nutrient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sugar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Excl-Jordan-Chiles-Wasn-t-Sure-She-Wanted-to-Go-to-Paris-2024- -- -But-Then-Realized-I-m-That-Girl-566.jpg?crop=0px%2C96px%2C1334px%2C701px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786858", "eventUri": "eng-9786858", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 1324, "textEnd": 1331}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 1564, "textEnd": 1572}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

That led to a .1 boost, bumping Chiles to 13.766 -- just ahead of Barbosu's 13.700.\n\nWhen the revised results flashed, the 18-year-old Barbosu looked up toward the giant screen and froze.

As excitement took over for the Americans and Chiles, heartbreak was felt by Romania's Ana B\u0103rbosu who fell off the podium as a result.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Owens", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Owens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ana_B\u0103rbosu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ana B\u0103rbosu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/p29chyRi1mB8jAqvNzIzww--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04Mzk7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ftw_outdoors_usa_today_article_609/166b08a0e14becffc15e8eb0523ca946", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786858", "eventUri": "eng-9786858", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

When it comes to gymnastics, Chiles embodies a fiery spirit -- strong, fierce, powerful -- and her passion for her sport shines throughout her performances. In a similar style to teammate Simone Biles, who has spoken of her love of the quote \"And still I rise\" from Maya Angelou in her documentary, both phrases are symbolic of empowerment and resilience.\n\n\"It's not to be cocky,\" she says during a May interview for Chiles's partnership with Invisalign. At the time, she didn't know what laid ahead of her at the Paris Olympics -- but she was feeling optimistic. The expression was an act of affirmation. \"I'm going to wake up like, 'Hey, you know, you're right -- I am that girl.' I'm going to do everything that I can do to make sure I can be solid to who I am. I'm going to be authentic. I'm going to be unapologetic; like, that's just who I am. I'm just going to continue to shine and do everything that I need to do.\"\n\nChiles has made good on that promise to herself. A few weeks after sitting down with PS, she's walking away from the Paris 2024 Games with one gold medal (in the Women's Artistic Team All-Around) and her first individual bronze medal (in Women's Floor, after a scoring inquiry into the difficulty of one of her moves bumped her up from fifth place to third). In addition to her skill, Chiles has gotten attention for her highly infectious energy, affinity for dancing, and her genuine camaraderie with her teammates.\n\nHere, Chiles shares more about how she handles the pressure of a professional career in gymnastics, her favorite memories of Olympics past, and who she turns to when she needs a confidence boost. (Yes, her list includes Beyonc\u00e9.)\n\nIn training and performance, Chiles is known as \"the consistency queen,\" she says. But she acknowledges that even she needs a break from focused practice sometimes. \"When it comes to nerves or trying to focus too hard on something, I'll dance it out. I'll listen to music. I'll go talk to somebody. I'll walk away,\" she says. \"I'll do whatever I need to do to make sure I'm not too focused on that certain thing. I'll pray about it a majority of the time, and just let God do its work.\"\n\nChiles adds that \"the biggest thing with the mental health aspect is to make sure you talk to somebody, because that is definitely something that helped me. Whether it's a sports psychologist, sometimes having a listener, rather than a speaker, can help you. Finding that person, or finding that support system, that can help you and guide you in the right direction.\"\n\nShe also makes sure to enjoy herself. \"I'm always about fun,\" she says. \"Like, people always just ask me, what do you do? Have fun. That's all you gotta do is just have fun.\"\n\nIt's safe to say that winning bronze at Paris -- her first individual Olympic medal -- will go down in her personal history books as a favorite Olympic moment, but she also has fond memories of Tokyo. \"My favorite memory is also my most emotional memory, which is also my biggest stress memory: just being there for my bestie,\" Chiles says.\n\nHer bestie, of course, is none other than, Simone Biles, and Chiles is referencing when Biles withdrew from the event in Tokyo due to experiencing the \"twisties\". \"Biles and Chiles was a huge thing during that time frame, and I was happy that I was there for her, and to be that support system that she needed in that moment. I will cherish that forever. But, you know, I did also say, 'Miss me, don't ever do that to me again,' because that was very stressful. Never thought I was going to have to fill some huge shoes like that. But, I did it with love and kindness, and I supported her as much as she supported us,\" Chiles says. \"We talk about it all the time. That's forever going to be in history books, and being a part of that is memorable.\"\n\nYes, Chiles's \"I'm that girl\" affirmation was inspired by another big performer. \"It's really Beyonc\u00e9's motto,\" she says. She was inspired by the Renaissance tour. \"Knowing what [Beyonc\u00e9 has] gone through as an artist and when she was younger -- people coming at her, body-shaming her. Yes, she is an icon and a legend, but she still went through human things,\" Chiles says.\n\nThat's the reminder she wants to impart to the next generation: never give up, no matter what happens. \"Always believe in the power of your dream, because your dreams are very, very powerful,\" Chiles says. \"Go out there, and shine bright. Use every inch of your mind, your soul, your body, whatever it is, and continue to be you. Be authentic. Be unapologetic, be you, and just encourage everybody around you.\"", "source": {"uri": "popsugar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POPSUGAR UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jade_esmeralda@popsugar.com", "name": "Jade Esmeralda", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empowerment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Empowerment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Angelou", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maya Angelou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beyonc\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soul music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renaissance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/_jZMXrosMYyc3Y4LVCtM--Dx8lw=/8x179:3193x1772/fit-in/3193x2129/top/filters:format_auto():quality(85):upscale()/2024/08/05/778/n/1922729/9030432d66b10e98c6e3d2.86560756_.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786858", "eventUri": "eng-9786858", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

This was Barbosu's first Olympic appearance ever, and the future is bright for the young star.\n\nBrazilian gymnast Rebeca Andrade won gold in the floor final with a score of 14.166, narrowly beating out Biles (14.133) by 0.033 points.\n\nChiles has now won her first-ever Olympic medal in an individual event. She has also won a gold and silver medal in the 2024 and 2020 Olympics.\n\nRelated: Jordan Chiles' Reaction To Winning Olympic Medal Has Fans In Tears\n\nRelated: Simone Biles' Husband Jonathan Owens Posts Update After Leaving Olympics", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_phelps@postandcourier.com", "name": "Chris Phelps", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Rhythmic_Gymnastics_European_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 Rhythmic Gymnastics European Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_climbing_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport climbing at the 2020 Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebeca_Andrade", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebeca Andrade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786858", "eventUri": "eng-9786858", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Not mad about it.\"\n\nBiles' medal total (including seven gold, two silver, two bronze) ties Vera Caslavska for the second-most by a female gymnast in Olympic history.\n\nThe American missed a chance to add a fifth Paris medal earlier on Monday when she fell during the beam final, finishing fifth.\n\nBiles also wore a deduction there when the judges ruled she had failed to properly salute them after her routine.\n\nBiles did make an effort to salute, but it was rather brief and perfunctory -- and the judges seemed to decide it was insufficient and took three tenths off her score.\n\nIt had no impact on the medal standings, but Biles made a show of holding her salute for a comically long time as she left the mat after her next routine in the floor final.\n\n\"Holding her salute until she walks off the podium, match the judges petty with petty,\" one fan wrote.\n\nReplying to that post, Biles' NFL star husband Jonathan Owens wrote: \"Making sure they don't miss it this time!!!!! I love you so much baby, so proud.\"\n\nThough Biles can make it look easy at times, it is not.\n\nShe thudded to the mat during her floor warm-up and had the left calf she tweaked in qualifying last week re-wrapped before she competed.\n\nHer tumbling passes weren't perfect but her difficulty is usually so far above everyone else that it hardly matters.\n\nNot this time. She received a 7.833 execution score that included 0.6 in deductions for stepping out of bounds, allowing Andrade to win her second Olympic gold.\n\nChiles and Biles bowed to Andrade on the podium in a show of their admiration.\n\n\"Why don't we just give her flowers?\" Chiles said of the gesture.\n\n\"Not only has she given Simone her flowers, but a lot of us in the United States, our flowers as well. So giving it back is what makes it so beautiful. I felt like it was needed.\"\n\nChiles was only on the podium because her coaches had submitted an appeal on her behalf, which she did not know about.\n\nShe burst into her tears when she learned she would be on the podium.\n\nA skill in her routine called a Gogean, a split leap with a 1.5-turn, was originally not credited by the judges.\n\nTheir score sheets are not made public, but the rationale is typically related to insufficient rotation.\n\nUpon review, Chiles earned full credit for the leap and it was a medal-making difference.\n\n\"I have no words, but I'm so proud of myself. So losing my voice means everything, because it takes a while for me to do that,\" she said.\n\nAppealing a score is a risky business, which often results in an even lower score than before.\n\nThe gymnast's federation must pay a fee and file the inquiry to the judges promptly.\n\n\"You can go either way, go up, go down. I was the first one to see because I was looking at the screen,\" Chiles said.", "source": {"uri": "7news.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "7NEWS.com.au"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebeca_Andrade", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebeca Andrade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beyonc\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Owens", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Owens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calf_(animal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Calf (animal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-15602987/8133c0e126c6f41aab8858d2e82df8491efdf855-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786858", "eventUri": "eng-9786858", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The photo finishes. The inspiring displays of sportsmanship. The records being broken and humans doing things no human has done before.\n\nSimone Biles has had her fair share -- or more -- of iconic Olympic moments. And she just added another one to her list with the help of her friend and Team USA teammate, Jordan Chiles.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Biles was favored to win gold in the floor exercise final for women's gymnastics at the 2024 Paris Olympics. The floor is one of her strongest events, and the high degree of difficulty in her routine offered some wiggle room for small errors.\n\nBiles on the floor is like Jordan on the court at his peak -- literally gravity-defying and simply mesmerizing to watch. But Brazilian gymnast Rebeca Andrade has been giving Biles a serious run for her money. In any other era, she'd have a pocket full of gold medals, but she's had the fortune-yet-misfortune of competing against the greatest gymnast of all time. However, she finally managed to eek out a win over the GOAT in the floor exercise final in Paris. Andrade took the gold, leaving Biles with the silver and Chiles the bronze.\n\nIf besting Simone Biles on the floor wasn't enough, Andrade got another boost as she approached the podium to receive her gold medal. In a synchronized gesture, giving props where it was due, Biles and Chiles knelt and bowed down before Andrade, creating one of those Olympic snapshots the world will never forget.\n\nWhat was especially great about this moment wasn't just the genuine respect Biles and Chiles showed Andrade. It's the sheer joy with which they did it. Biles being so dominant in her sport could easily lead to pride and arrogance, which doesn't seem to have happened, and losing a gold she was expected to win could easily crush her spirit, but that also doesn't seem to have happened. The GOAT recognizes, acknowledges and honors greatness when she sees it, and Andrade clearly brought her A game.\n\nHere we can see Chiles and Biles plotting to give Andrade the \"We're not worthy\" bow in real time:\n\nBiles and Andrade have both talked about how they've pushed one another to be better, which is exactly what competition is about. And celebrating excellence wherever it comes from is exactly what the Olympic games are all about. Biles and Chiles embodied that Olympic spirit in the floor final and medal ceremony, doing what they came to Paris to do, making it to the medal podium and then lifting up the gymnast who outperformed them both.\n\nBiles and Chiles spoke with reporters about what prompted them to do the bow and how much they admire \"the queen\" Andrade.\n\nWhat a beautiful testament to good sportsmanship and joyful camaraderie between competitors, and what a wonderful example for us all.\n\nHere's what people are saying about the moment:\n\n\"This is the best part of everything Just class and sportsmanship Soooo wholesome.\"\n\n\"This must be real meaning of the Olympics. How beautiful is that they congratulate and respect each other.\"\n\n\"This is exactly what it's all about! Celebrating the human spirit and perseverance. I love their story. Their competitiveness pushes each other to be their greatest selves.\"\n\n\"The nicest podium of all times.

Biles revealed that Chiles suggested the gesture to honor Andrade, which they both agreed upon.\n\nChiles expressed that the gesture was meant to show appreciation for Andrade, who has been influential and supportive of her and her teammates. \"Not only has she given Simone her flowers, but a lot of us in the United States our flowers as well,\" Chiles said, calling Andrade an \"icon\" and a \"legend.\"\n\nEarlier in the Games, Biles made history by becoming the most-decorated U.S. gymnast in Olympic history. However, she downplayed her achievements, stating that her focus is on enjoying the sport she loves. \"I can't be mad at my performances. A couple of years ago, I didn't think I'd be back here at an Olympic game,\" Biles said.\n\nThe Paris Games continue to highlight inspiring moments and milestones in Olympic history.

Simone Biles, who's dominated the floor exercise throughout the competition in Paris, went out bounds on two of her tumblings passes, which opened the door for Brazil's Rebeca Andrade to win gold.\n\nBiles won silver and earned her 11th Olympic medal. However, Romania's Ana Barbosu, who thought she won bronze, ultimately went home empty handed. She initially lifted the Romanian flag around her back in celebration, as her 13.700 score put her in third place after U.S. gymnast Jordan Chiles, the final gymnast to compete, earned a 13.666.\n\nHowever, Chiles' coaches filed an inquiry, contesting the difficulty level of her score. After review, the judges boosted Chiles' final score to 13.766, which knocked Barbosu off the podium.\n\nWhile Chiles broke down in happy tears, Barbosu left the arena gutted, sobbing in defeat. Five-time Olympic gold medalist Nadia Comaneci was devastated for her fellow Romanian gymnast, and made her opinion the last-minute switch extremely clear.\n\n\"I can't believe we play with athletes mental health and emotions like this,\" Comaneci posted on X. let's protect them #anabarbosu.\"\n\nNeither Chiles' coaches, nor the judges, did anything illegal. The AP reported, \"Under the sport's governing body, coaches may inquire about the difficulty score of one of their gymnasts if they believe judges have missed an element or a skill. Such challenges can be solved with the use of video.\"\n\nOne fan responded, \"Nadia you need to be blaming the coaches for allowing her to celebrate before the scores are even in she thought she had it but she did not...should have refreshed everyone on scoring protocols (you don't celebrate until you see the bronze next to your name in the arena).\"\n\nComaneci, the first gymnast to ever score a perfect 10 at the Olympics, also received a lot of support for her comment. While fans were thrilled over Chiles, 23, winning her first individual medal, many viewers were heartbroken for the 18-year-old Romanian.\n\nBarbosu told reporters afterward, \"I did my best. It was the best I could... I mean, I don't think anyone has anything to blame me for.\"\n\nThe Medal Count posted, \"This is who Ana Barbosu is. Her entire career she has been known as the gymnast who reacts more positively to other people winning medals than her own performance Its tough seeing the one gymnast who exemplified herself this way have such a horrible Olympic experience.\"\n\nRelated: Simone Biles Addresses Obvious Excuse for Stumbling During Final Olympic Events\n\nRelated: Gymnast Suni Lee Sends Clear Message on Rumored Rift With Jordan Chiles\n\nRelated: Olympic Gymnast Rebeca Andrade's Huge Announcement Leaves Fans Heartbroken", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emily_bicks@postandcourier.com", "name": "Emily Bicks", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadia_Com\u0103neci", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nadia Com\u0103neci"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accor_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accor Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebeca_Andrade", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebeca Andrade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_governing_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports governing body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786858", "eventUri": "eng-9786858", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Chiles was the final competitor, and the initial score posted on the videoboard was lower than Barbosu's, prompting the Romanian to grab her country's flag and begin celebrating.\n\nMoments later, it was announced that Chiles' coaches had asked judges to review the difficulty component of her score. That led to a .1 boost, bumping Chiles to 13.766 -- just ahead of Barbosu's 13.700.\n\nAlso Read | Bangladesh 'A' Team's Arrival in Pakistan Delayed Due to Worsening Situation Back Home After Sheikh Hasina Resigns As PM Following Unrest.\n\nWhen the revised results flashed, the 18-year-old Barbosu looked up toward the giant screen and froze.

Competing in the Floor Exercise in the 2024 Olympic Games on Monday, the talented trio delivered stunning performances and swept the medals.\n\nAndrade, 25, clinched gold in the floor final. Biles, 27, took home the silver, and 23-year-old Chiles earned the bronze, creating an inspiring and historic all-Black podium.\n\nReflecting on this incredible achievement, Andrade expressed her pride and the significance of the moment. \"We can show the Black Power,\" Andrade said. \"I love myself, my skin color. But I'm also not focused on that. Rebeca goes beyond her color,\" she shared, speaking in the third person.\n\nAndrade emphasized the importance of representation and perseverance, stating, \"The idea is it serves as an incentive. Sometimes it may be more difficult because of our skin color, but we have proven that it's possible, and you can do it.\"\n\nDuring the medal ceremony, Biles and Chiles bowed to Andrade in recognition of her gold medal victory. \"She's so amazing, she's queen,\" Biles said of Andrade. \"And first, it was an all-Black podium, so that was super exciting for us.\"\n\nBiles revealed that it was Chiles who suggested the gesture. \"I was like, absolutely,\" Biles continued. \"So we're like, are we gonna do it now? And then that's why we did it.\" Biles added that Andrade is \"such an excitement to watch,\" and Team USA noticed the fans' enthusiasm for her.\n\nChiles echoed this sentiment, expressing her admiration for Andrade. \"Not only has she given Simone her flowers, but a lot of us in the United States our flowers as well. Giving it back is what makes it so beautiful,\" Chiles said, calling Andrade \"an icon\" and a \"legend.\"\n\nSimone Biles, who became the most-decorated U.S. gymnast in Olympic history on July 30, remains humble about her achievements. \"I just go out here and do what I'm supposed to and I'm doing what I love and enjoying it, so that's really all that matters to me,\" Biles said.\n\nAfter her stellar performance in the floor final, Biles reflected on her journey. \"I've accomplished way more than my wildest dreams in the sport.

Event finals on Parallel Bars and High Bar for men, and Balance Beam and Floor Exercise for the women. But, it was a day that USA gymnast Jordan Chiles will never forget.\n\nJordan Chiles was the last competitor of the entire gymnastics meet, finishing out the Floor Exercise Final inside Bercy Arena, and was aiming for a medal. When her score was flashed she had come in fifth, less than a tenth of a point behind the bronze medal, but the score was overturned after an inquiry, and she ended up with the bronze medal.\n\nSimone Biles was heavily favored in the event, but two out-of-bounds deductions, worth three-tenths each due to both feet being out-of-bounds, put her narrowly in second place behind Brazil star Rebeca Andrade.\n\nWhile the odds of Chiles catching those two, with Andrade at 14.166 and Biles at 14.133, were slim, she had a real shot at a medal in the final routine, with Romania's Ana Barbosu holding the spot at 13.7\n\nHere was Jordan Chiles' Beyonc\u00e9-inspired routine.\n\nWhen the score first came up, she had a 13.666, less than a tenth from a bronze medal. Since she was the last routine, Romania's Ana Barbousa started celebrating. But, Jordan Chiles' coach, Cecile Landi, submitted an inquiry to the judges on Chiles' score.\n\nIn Artistic Gymnastics, the execution score, which starts at 10 and incurs deductions for things like hops on landings, bent legs, and improper body positions, are not able to be appeals. But, the difficulty score, which is the composite of the value of the skills that you complete, no matter how well you complete them, is able to be appealed, as it's considered a matter of fact and can be objectively scored.\n\nAfter the judges reviewed the routine, they decided to give her credit for a skill called a Gogean, saying that she did indeed complete 1 1/2 turns. That upped her difficulty score by .1, which meant she beat out Barbosu with a score of 13.766.\n\nThat is Chiles' third Olympic medal in her career, as she had a team silver in Tokyo, a team gold in Paris, and this bronze medal.

But can Spartans put it together?", "body": "EAST LANSING -- Perhaps it wasn't surprising, considering he would later declare himself the best quarterback in the Big Ten, and yes, even the nation. But minutes before he made that bold proclamation, Aidan Chiles expressed the utmost confidence in the potential of the Michigan State football offense.\n\n\"I think we have all tools, all the keys we need,\" Chiles said Thursday. \"We've just got to put it together now.\"\n\nOver the next four weeks, leading into the Aug. 30 opener against Florida Atlantic, that will be the charge of veteran offensive coordinator Brian Lindgren, new head coach Jonathan Smith's right-hand man the past six seasons. During that period, which elapsed at Oregon State, Smith and Lindgren teamed up to create a well-oiled machine that turned into a powerful apparatus ranked 11 in the country in opponent-adjusted efficiency last season. The Beavers were a balanced attack, passing on 46.8% of their plays and running at a clip of 4.9 yards per carry -- the 26-best average in the country. Three time zones away, in East Lansing, Lindgren believes he and Smith can reproduce a facsimile of the finely tuned operation they ran in Corvallis.\n\n\"The concepts will be pretty similar,\" said Lindgren. \"I think by the time we get to the end of training camp, we'll have a bulk of what we did at Oregon State.\"\n\nAnd from that point on, Chiles said, the Spartans can go \"as far as we take it.\"\n\nThe possibilities are tantalizing, as Chiles implied.\n\nMore: He may be boring. But 'steady' Jonathan Smith is exactly what Michigan State football needs\n\nFifth-year receiver Montorie Foster Jr. describes the offense as more \"dynamic\" than the one Lindgren's predecessor, Jay Johnson, commanded, saying that the play designs allow MSU to \"stretch all halves of the field\" and take more deep shots. Last season, during a dreadful slog to a 4-8 record disrupted by the midseason firing of Mel Tucker, the Spartans often looked impotent.\n\nTheir ineptitude, in part, could be attributed to three unproven quarterbacks -- Noah Kim, Katin Houser and Sam Leavitt -- playing significant snaps. MSU resembled a disjointed mess as a result, ranking second-to-last in the entire Football Bowl Subdivision in points per drive and 13 out of 14 Big Ten teams in scoring average. A shutout against Penn State in the season finale provided a fitting coda to that miserable fall. A day later, Smith arrived and soon thereafter Kim, Houser and Leavitt all left the program. That opened the door for Chiles, a sophomore, to follow Smith from Oregon State to MSU.\n\n\"He's a dude,\" Foster raved. \"He makes plays.\"\n\nReferring to Chiles, MSU safety Dillon Tatum offered similar praise.\n\n\"We've got a really good quarterback that can run and pass and make good decisions,\" he said.\n\nChiles, who played 100 snaps with the Beavers as a freshman, is one of three transfers from Oregon State who man particularly valuable positions in Lindgren's offense and could conceivably accelerate the implementation of his multifaceted scheme. The others are interior lineman Tanner Miller and tight end Jack Velling.\n\nMiller, a cerebral player who has started at both guard spots and center over a college career spanning six seasons, will be an important cog for a rebuilt front trying to develop chemistry as it aims to master the nuanced zone-running concepts Lindgren intends to execute.\n\n\"It's coming along,\" Lindgren said. \"But we're definitely not there yet. ... It's definitely a learning process.\"\n\nVelling, like Miller, has provided a helping hand to the holdovers from Tucker's regime. The 6-foot-5, 244-pound junior is a versatile asset who, Smith said, has \"a chance to become one of the best tight ends in the country.\"\n\nSmith, and by extension Lindgren, may do everything in their power to make that projection become reality. The position Velling occupies, after all, is an important one in Lindgren's offense. That is evidenced by the picks of former Oregon State tight ends Teagan Quitoriano and Luke Musgrave in the 2022 and '23 NFL drafts. It is also reflected in Velling's stat line in 2023, when he led the Beavers with eight touchdown receptions.\n\nMore: Michigan State football opens camp with new coach, fresh perspective and plenty of changes\n\nLast season, Lindgren leveraged Velling to create matchup advantages, flexing him out wide and into the slot, even occasionally moving him into the backfield when he was not attached to the line.\n\n\"That's a big piece of what we like to do, and it's awesome to have a guy in that spot,\" Lindgren said.\n\nAs Chiles said, \"He's very valuable, for sure. He already knew the offense. He came in and there were no hiccups. ... It's good.\"\n\nVelling figures to be one of the primary playmakers within a unit that has several other intriguing pieces. There is Foster, the team's most productive wideout last year. There is also Nate Carter, MSU's leading rusher last year, who has designs on expanding the dimensions of his game as a pass-catcher coming out of the backfield. And now there is Nick Marsh, a freshman receiver from River Rouge who enrolled in January and is expected to be deployed immediately after making a positive impression on coaches and teammates alike throughout the offseason.\n\nLook around MSU's practice fields, and it becomes easier to understand why Chiles believes the Spartans can strike back this season.\n\n\"With all these pieces put together,\" Carter said, \"we have the opportunity to present a struggle for the defense. ... Our offense is organized, where many different people can make plays. It's hard for a defense to be able to combat that.\"\n\nAt the very least, it gives the Spartans hope that better, more productive days are on the horizon. In fact, Chiles seems certain of that.", "source": {"uri": "freep.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Detroit Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_State_Beavers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oregon State Beavers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_Spartans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State Spartans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_Spartans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State Spartans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Lansing,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "East Lansing, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Lansing, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Smith_(American_football_coach)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Smith (American football coach)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Leavitt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Leavitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Lindgren", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Lindgren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Atlantic_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Atlantic University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvallis,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corvallis, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Corvallis, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Football_Bowl_Subdivision", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Tucker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mel Tucker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophomore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sophomore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teagan_Quitoriano", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teagan Quitoriano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Musgrave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Musgrave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/30/PLSJ/74603433007-240730-msu-football-camp-089-a.JPG?auto=webp&crop=2397,1348,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786858", "eventUri": "eng-9786858", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-30", "textStart": 464, "textEnd": 471}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

But I'm also not focused on that. Rebeca goes beyond her color,\" the gymnast said, speaking in third person.\n\n\"And the same goes for Jordan, for Simone. The idea is it serves as an incentive,\" Andrade continued, explaining that while \"sometimes it may be more difficult\" for gymnasts because of their \"skin color,\" the trio has proven that \"it's possible\" and \"you can do it.\"\n\nDuring the medal ceremony, Biles and Chiles of the United States took a moment to bow to Andrade for winning the gold.\n\n\"She's so amazing, she's queen,\" Biles said of the Brazilian gold medalist. \"And first, it was an all-Black podium, so that was super exciting for us.\"\n\nBiles revealed that it was Chiles who suggested bowing to Andrade during the historic moment on the podium. \"And I was like, absolutely,\" Biles continued.\n\n\"So we're like, are we gonna do it now?

Central to this balance will be Aidan Chiles, a player who is transitioning from a backup role to the starting quarterback, a shift that comes with immense pressure and expectations.\n\nChiles, who spent last season as a backup, will now be tasked with the responsibility of orchestrating the Spartans' offense. His ability to adapt quickly to this new role will be crucial. With defenses ramping up their intensity and strategic complexity, Chiles will need to exhibit both poise and precision. The Spartans' success will depend on his ability to read defenses effectively, make quick decisions, and execute plays with accuracy.\n\nOne of the primary challenges facing Chiles will be maintaining efficiency in the passing game. Last season, Michigan State may have been able to rely more on its running game, but facing top-tier defenses this year will demand a more balanced offensive approach. Chiles will need to develop a strong rapport with his receiving corps, ensuring that he can deliver accurate throws under pressure. His ability to make quick reads and adjust his throws based on defensive schemes will be a key factor in the Spartans' offensive strategy.\n\nEqually important is Michigan State's rushing game, which must complement the passing attack. The offensive line will play a critical role in establishing a strong ground game. A consistent and effective run game can help alleviate some of the pressure on Chiles by forcing defenses to respect both the run and the pass, creating more opportunities for big plays. If the running backs can gain consistent yardage and help control the clock, it will provide Chiles with a more manageable workload.\n\nIn summary, the Spartans' ability to handle some of the nation's toughest defenses will hinge on their offensive balance. Chiles' performance will be at the heart of this effort. His development into a reliable starting quarterback, capable of efficiently managing both the passing and running aspects of the game, will be pivotal for Michigan State. As the season progresses, how well he adapts to this responsibility will likely determine the Spartans' success against these elite defenses.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_Spartans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State Spartans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1599,h_899,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/spartan_nation/01j4b1cx8x3xwhmw11kd.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786858", "eventUri": "eng-9786858", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Chiles was the final competitor, and the initial score posted on the videoboard was lower than Barbosu's, prompting the Romanian to grab her country's flag and begin celebrating.\n\nMoments later, it was announced that Chiles' coaches had asked judges to review the difficulty component of her score. That led to a .1 boost, bumping Chiles to 13.766 -- just ahead of Barbosu's 13.700.\n\nWhen the revised results flashed, the 18-year-old Barbosu looked up toward the giant screen and froze.

In 2021, it was Kenneth Walker III, the transfer running back from Wake Forest who, of course, went on to win the 2021 Doak Walker Award. This year, there's quarterback Aidan Chiles, the young transfer from Oregon State.\n\nWith Chiles leading the charge, it seems all aspirations point to him having the same impact on the offense as Walker did in 2021.\n\nMichigan State sixth-year graduate senior defensive tackle Maverick Hansen was one of the few left on the roster who was part of that 2021 group. Having experienced the hype that surrounded Walker back then, Hansen can compare that offseason to Chiles'.\n\n\"Aidan has such a vital role on the offense.,\" Hansen told reporters on Tuesday. \"I mean, they work around him. Like, he's the one that everyone's looking at to be the guy and everything. But just like any other quarterback. Now K9's a running back. But we knew in spring ball, before he even hit the season that K9 was a guy. Because he would just cut up, and he'd be gone before anyone else could touch him. And we were like, 'Holy smokes, this dude is the real deal.' And the coaches would say, 'Oh, K9 ain't going to be here long. Like, as soon as the season's over, he's in the league.' And they gave him the opportunities.\n\n\" ... It's different for a quarterback. Yeah, absolutley. He can throw the ball, he can run the ball, he's got a lot of different options. ... So, I feel like there's a lot of potential there for Aidan. He's young, too, and he's been developing. He pushes the team to be great.\"\n\nChiles could very well be that same spark Walker was for Michigan State's offense, but before anyone gets too ahead of themselves, the Spartans will need to take this season one game at a time to reach the success that 2021 team had.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_Spartans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State Spartans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Walker_III_(running_back)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth Walker III (running back)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_Forest_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wake Forest University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lansing_State_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lansing State Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Lansing,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Lansing, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Lansing, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doak_Walker_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doak Walker Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_State_Beavers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oregon State Beavers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_Spartans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State Spartans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1600,h_900,x_0,y_235/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/spartan_nation/01j4fhqwd9bkk4zwpwhh.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786858", "eventUri": "eng-9786858", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

In the end, Brazil's Rebeca Andrade and Team USA's Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles took the top three spots, making them the gold, silver, and bronze medalists of the floor exercise final. Yes, all Black women on the podium.\n\nAbout an hour before the floor exercise, Andrade and Biles competed in the balance beam final. With both heavily favored in that event, the morning started off rocky for Bilesn who experienced a fall during her beam routine. Despite Andrade having a beautiful event, the judges still didn't quite give her the points needed for a medal.\n\nWhen it came to floor exercise, the pressure was on for all nine ladies to leave it all on the mat. Biles, the 27-year-old gymnastics GOAT, was seen limping after a hiccup on a tumbling pass during her floor warm-up. It left the commentators wondering if she would be able to compete at her highest level for what could be the final routine of her Olympic career. However, if you haven't learned by now, never count out Simone Biles or lose faith in what that woman can do.\n\nAndrade competed first among the three winners and had a near-flawless routine, finishing with a score of 14.166. Next was Biles. After getting her calf taped, she went out and gave her all. Despite two steps out of bounds, mostly due to the power in her tumbling, she came away with a score of 14.133. As the camera panned to her after her routine, she could be seen saying, \"I think Rebeca got this one.\"\n\nAs previously reported, the two women have been the other's toughest competition over the years, especially during the 2024 Paris Games. Pushing each other to give their best, they seem to have nothing but love and admiration for one another.\n\nTo round out the final competition routine of the morning -- and Games -- Jordan Chiles took the mat. As Beyonc\u00e9's \"My House\" blasted through the areana, the UCLA student-athlete went to work. Another powerful routine, she had a slight balance check during her initial tumbling pass, which likely cost her a few tenths deductions. The judges returned with a score that would have knocked her out of medal contention, but her coaches submitted an inquiry, which ultimately shifted her to the bronze standing.\n\nLooking up in anticipation, Chiles leaped with excitement as she saw her new score, a 13.766, making her the 2024 Olympic bronze medalist in floor exercise. Her emotion took over, and the tears fell after it all sank in on what she had just accomplished.\n\n\"It's been a long journey, it's been a long three years,\" Chiles previously told ESSENCE during the 2024 US Olympic gymnastics trials in Minneapolis. \"I'm just so proud of myself after everything I've gone through. The struggles, the losses.

However, USA Gymnastics coaches submitted a late inquiry to review Chiles's score after her performance, and the judges ended up giving her an extra one-tenth to edge out Barbosu and bump her into third place with a score of 13.766.\n\nChiles's reaction once the final results were announced was priceless. She couldn't hold back her tears as she embraced her coach and was also pulled in for a hug by Biles. Her USA teammates, Jade Carey and Sunisa Lee, were seen in the stands visibly stunned at what just happened.\n\nNBC analyst John Roethlisberger explained why Chiles's score was corrected after the fact:\n\n\"The element in question is called a tour jete full, and in the team qualification in the team final, [Chiles] did not get credit for the skill. She has to make a complete twist all the way around, so she should finish back toward the other direction. In the initial evaluation of the skill, the judge did not give her credit for that... Her coaches said, 'We thought she did it much better in the final, so we thought we had nothing to lose, let's put in an inquiry.' And the judges decided to give it to her. That's your one-tenth, and that's the difference in the medal.\"\n\nMonday's floor final results gave Chiles her second medal of the Games.

I'm actually very happy, proud and even more excited that it's over, the stress of it.\"\n\nAs for Jordan Chiles, a Beyonc\u00e9 super stan who often wears looks modeled after Bey, competed throughout the Olympics to \"Black Parade\", \"My House\", \"Cuff It\", \"Energy\" and lastly, \"Lose My Breath.\"\n\nIn a stunning twist, she was elevated to the podium with a 13.766 after a scoring inquiry lifted her from fifth place.\n\nSimone Biles & Jordan Chiles Supported Rebeca Andrade On The Podium\n\nWhile posing for pictures, Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles sweetly bowed down to Rebeca Andrade while she posted with her gold medal.", "source": {"uri": "bossip.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bossip"}, "authors": [{"uri": "danielle_canada@bossip.com", "name": "Danielle Canada", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebeca_Andrade", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebeca Andrade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beyonc\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travis Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuff_It", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cuff It"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lose_My_Breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lose My Breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parade_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parade (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Militaria", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Militaria", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Floors", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Floors", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://bossip.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2024/08/1722869827429.jpg?w=560&h=320&crop=1&strip=all&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786858", "eventUri": "eng-9786858", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

See the leaderboard", "body": "For a full rundown of all the events each day, we have a full breakdown of everything airing, along with where and how to watch. Every Olympic event will be streaming live on Peacock.\n\nWhen it comes to the medal count, the United States is the favorite to win the most medals. China is unlikely to overtake the U.S. in the overall medal haul, but has a chance to win more gold medals than the Americans -- and has been maintaining a lead in golds for much of the first week.\n\nSo which country is leading in medals as of the ninth day of competition? Here is a look at the Olympic medal count.\n\nHere is the full leaderboard, last updated Aug. 5 at 4 p.m. ET\n\nTeam USA is coming off a very successful weekend in which they won 28 medals overall, 18 of which were on Saturday alone.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what events Team USA has won medals in and the athletes involved:\n\nThe last Summer Olympics in which the United States did not top the gold medal table was in 2008 in Beijing. Countries always get a medal bump being the host nation, and France is expected to almost triple the number of gold medals it won in Tokyo.\n\nSILVER BY A SLIVER\n\nTeam USA earned silver in the second ever Olympic triathlon mixed relay in a photo finish.\n\nSeth Rider, Taylor Spivey, Morgan Pearson and Taylor Knibb gave the U.S. a second straight mixed relay silver medal after Team USA placed second in the inaugural event at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nGermany secured gold when Laura Lindemann pulled ahead of Knibb and Great Britain's Beth Potter, the women's triathlon bronze medalist, over the final sprint to the finish line. It is Germany's first medal in the event after it placed sixth in Tokyo.\n\nKnibb and Potter were neck and neck down the stretch, but Knibb crossed first in a photo finish for the silver medal.\n\nBILES AND CHILES END ON A HIGH NOTE\n\nIt may not be how they drew it up, but both Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles will leave Paris on a high note, earning a medal in their final event.\n\nBiles scored a 14.133 on floor exercise, with landing deductions for going out of bounds twice. Her score was the second-highest behind Brazil's Rebeca Andrade, who had a 14.166.\n\nBiles' floor routine was stunning, at a difficulty level far above other competitors, but landing out of bounds twice cost her .6 points in penalties. She lost to Andrade by .033 points.\n\nWith the medal, Biles tied Czechoslovakia's Vera Caslavska for second-most by a female gymnast in Olympic history. The record is held by Larisa Latynina, who had 18 for the Soviet Union between 1956 and 1964.\n\nBiles had been seeking an eighth gold medal, which would have placed her one shy of the record for most by a woman in Olympic history, which is held by Latynina and U.S. swimming star Katie Ledecky.\n\nChiles meanwhile will leave with a bronze, her first individual medal after gold in the 2024 team event and silver in the 2020 team event. The 23-year-old American was initially off the podium but that changed after a review.\n\nWhen Chiles' score in floor exercise final was first announced at 13.600, she appeared to finish in fifth place. But Team USA submitted an inquiry, arguing that one of her leap's difficulty level should be graded a D instead of C -- which means Chiles would get more points for successfully completing it.\n\nThe inquiry was approved and Chiles' score rose to 13.766, just ahead of Barbosu's 13.700.\n\nLET'S DISCUSS DISCUS\n\nTeam USA's Valarie Allman won gold in the women's discus throw final on Monday.\n\nShe finished the event with a total result of 69.50. She was the defending Olympic champion in the event after also having won at the Tokyo Games.\n\nChina's Bin Feng won silver with 67.51 while Croatia's Sandra Elkasevic took home bronze (67.51).",

Every single athlete that makes it to the time-honored trials deserves their moment to shine. But few athletes make it to the top only to come crashing back down.\n\nRomanian gymnast Ana B\u0103rbosu was one of the unlucky few to have her dreams come true only to find out that she missed her moment just an insultingly small amount.\n\nIt really isn't fair to say that B\u0103rbosu's medal was stolen, but to anyone watching as it was happening, it really felt that way. The final scores were tallied for the women's floor exercises, and the 18-year-old Romanian appeared to have cinched her spot by the barest fraction of a point. She took to the floor with her country's flag, eager to celebrate her win.\n\nBut as she leaped for joy, there was trouble brewing behind the scenes. The judges had failed to score one of U.S, contender Jordan Chiles' moves. With 13.66, B\u0103rbosu narrowly sinched bronze, but when Chiles' routine was recalculated to 13.766, it knocked her down to fourth.\n\nChiles' trainers were the ones to push the judges to reevaluate their scores. The gymnast had performed a split leap with a 1.5 turn that had gone untallied. The meager tenth of a point was all that was needed to push Chiles into third. B\u0103rbosu left the arena in tears, prompting fellow Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci to slam the Olympic committee in charge.\n\nThe bronze medal marks the first time 23-year-old Jordan Chiles has placed outside of her team in 2024. Throughout the games, a rule that limits the games to just two athletes per country and her two incredible teammates -Simone Biles, Suni Lee, and Jade Carey - have left Chiles on the sidelines.\n\nThe strain of professional gymnastics usually forces athletes to retire in their early 20s. We don't have enough information to speculate on which gymnasts might be retiring after the Paris games, but there is a real chance B\u0103rbosu may never face off against Chiles again.\n\nShortly after the devastating event, B\u0103rbosu took to Instagram, \"Thank you to everyone who encouraged me before, during, and after the competition,\" she wrote.\n\nFor her sake, however, we hope that she gets the chance to compete against her again, and this time, maybe the judges will be better at their jobs.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ash_martinez@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Ash Martinez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ana_B\u0103rbosu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ana B\u0103rbosu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Carey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jade Carey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadia_Com\u0103neci", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nadia Com\u0103neci"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ana-Barbosu.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786858", "eventUri": "eng-9786858", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Biles, who struggled in warm-ups and was limping due to her calf injury, was still able to secure a silver medal and her fourth medal of the Paris Games, bringing her total count to 11 Olympic medals. And after a skill inquiry and score change, Jordan Chiles took home the bronze.\n\nGoing into the competition, Biles was the favorite to come out on top after her seven-tenth lead in qualifications and a difficulty score of 6.9. Andrade was also expected to make the podium with a silver medal behind Biles, and Chiles was favored for bronze. Team USA's Jade Carey fell in qualifications, so she did not have a chance to compete to defend her gold medal title from Tokyo Games.\n\nFor floor event finals, each gymnast performs a routine, and the difficulty and execution scores are combined for the overall score. The higher the difficulty, the better your chances are to medal. As for the execution score, the better form and landings with no steps or out of bounds, the better your execution score will be. The top eight gymnasts on floor exercise from qualification compete for a chance at medaling.\n\nChiles originally scored a 13.666, which put her in fifth place, and it looked like Romania's Ana Barbosu took the bronze. However, Chiles' coaches, who know her skills and difficulty, put in a skill inquiry to the judges following her routine. In gymnastics, the judges can either accept or deny the inquiry for the skill in question. The inquiry that was put in for Chiles was for her tour jete full leap. Originally, the judges didn't credit her for the skill, which was why the score was a tenth lower. When the judges rewatched the video of the leap, they agreed with her coaches that she did make the leap fully around and added the tenth into her score, which put her ahead of Barbosu to clinch the bronze.\n\nItaly's Manila Esposito of Italy, who grabbed a bronze in beam finals earlier in the day, starts off floor exercise with a double layout but lands short and falls to her knees. Her second pass is a 2.5 twist into front layout, but she has some loose knees in the layout position. She ends with a double pike but had too much power and takes multiple steps back, causing her to go out of bounds for a 12.133 score.\n\nAndrade is up next, and she begins with a front full step out to full-in stuck. Her second pass of a full twisting double layout shows great control in her landing. She performs a double layout for her third pass and ends with a double pike for a stellar routine that earns Andrade a 14.166 to take first place.\n\nChina's Ou Yushan competes third. Her first pass is a triple full, shows a 2.5 punch front tuck with a jump out of bounds and ends with a double back. Yushan gets a 13.0 score, which was six-tenths lower than her qualifying.\n\nJapan's Rina Kishi starts off with a double-double, then a front full to front double twist, a third pass of a double back and finishes with a double pike. The last pass was a bit under rotated, causing her to step forward for a 13.166 score. Kishi sits in second place after four competitors.\n\nRomania's Ana Barbosu opens with a whip back (no-handed back handspring) to full-in, 2.5 twist to punch front full with a step out of bounds and finishes with a double back to immediate punch front. Barbosu scores a 13.7 to jump into second.\n\nWhen Biles warmed up her triple-double, she over-rotated the landing and limped off the floor. The trainer added tape to her left calf that has been hurting her to help in the competition.\n\nBiles opens with her Biles II (triple-double) that shows to be no problem for her. On her second pass of front full step out to double-double, she lands completely out of bounds, which will be a decent-sized deduction. Her third pass is her signature Biles, which shows more control and is almost stuck. She ends her 2024 Paris run with a big double layout that bounces out of bounds again. Biles needs over a 14.166 to jump in front of Andrade but scores a 14.133 to finish second to Andrade by a narrow .033.\n\nRomania's Sabrina Voinea follows Biles with a double-double tuck to open, next pass is a double layout to punch front, which is a very unique pass, and third pass is a full-in that ends with double back to earn a 13.7. Due to a tie breaker, she loses to Barbosu.\n\nJordan Chiles is up last and opens with a full-twisting double layout, second pass is a front full step out to full-in, ends with a double layout and steps forward. Chiles originally scores a 13.666, but her coaches put in an inquiry for her leap pass of tour jete full, and the score is raised one-tenth to a 13.733. Andrade takes gold, Biles takes silver and Chiles takes bronze.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Carey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jade Carey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebeca_Andrade", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebeca Andrade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila_Esposito", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manila Esposito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_Voinea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sabrina Voinea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ou_Yushan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ou Yushan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Women", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66b0fec679431878ad40c3a9/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9786858", "eventUri": "eng-9786858", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

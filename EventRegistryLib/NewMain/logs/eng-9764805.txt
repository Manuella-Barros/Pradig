A win this week would vault him into the top 70, where he needs to be in three weeks to qualify for the FedEx St. Jude Championship, the first of three playoff events.\n\nThe 24-year-old rookie couldn't have had a better time to shoot his career-low, an 8-under 63 at TPC Twin Cities. Bridgeman has yet to record a top-10 finish this season but it's now officially crunch time on the PGA Tour.\n\nWith just two tournaments remaining in the Tour's FedEx Cup regular season, the field of 156 at the 3M Open knows that time is running out to improve their position before the playoffs. The pressure is mounting with just the Wyndham Championship -- to be held in two weeks following the Olympics -- and players battling to secure various levels of status for next year. Stewart Cink summed up what players are facing as the regular season winds to a conclusion.\n\n3M Open: Leaderboard | Photos | Merchandise\n\n\"Any time you put the pressure of whether you're going to have this job next year or a very different one next year, it's tough and if you let that become dependent on your scores and result, it's a recipe for frustration,\" Cink said. \"Psychologically it can take you in the wrong direction because all the players are so good and the field has no bad days. They just tear these places apart.\"\n\nMartin Trainer, who entered the week at No. 137 in the FedEx Cup, said he knew the clock was ticking on his playoff hopes but shooting 65 on Thursday was the start he needed to try to make a late-season charge into the top 70.\n\n\"The season's coming down to the stretch here, so yeah, I'm definitely going to need some good finishes, but hopefully this can be one of them,\" he said.\n\nHere are five more things to know about the first round of the 3M Open.\n\nBridgeman's mental reset\n\nJacob Bridgeman plays his shot from the second tee during the first round of the 2024 3M Open at TPC Twin Cities. (Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images)\n\nJacob Bridgeman stuck an old putter from his high school days into play on Thursday and rolled to nine birdies and a round of 8-under 63 at TPC Twin Cities for a one-stroke lead over Mackenzie Hughes.\n\nWith his caddie having travel woes due to the CrowdStrike tech outage, Bridgeman killed time on Tuesday in the TaylorMade truck and messed around with a gray Spider mallet putter that he used six years ago. He took it out to the course Thursday and made four birdies in his first eight holes, including a 34-foot putt at No. 8, before his lone bogey of his opening round at the ninth. He bounced back with three birdies in a row starting at No. 12, including a 20-footer at 13, and holed a bunker shot at 17.\n\n\"That one kind of surprised me. I was in a bad spot and I didn't think I could stop it and it kind of one-hopped in the hole,\" Bridgeman said. \"That probably went from a 4 to a 2.\"\n\nBridgeman had missed three straight cuts entering this week and said he was down in the dumps after his latest weekend off.\n\n\"Never had struggles with my confidence until these last few weeks and I told a couple people I felt like I've been kicked in the face,\" he said.\n\nPep talks from his parents, his college coach at Clemson University and his girlfriend, who reminded him, \"work is meant to be balanced with rest,\" helped him find a better head space.\n\nIt couldn't have come at a better time for Bridgeman, who has yet to record a top-10 finish this season, but could make up for a sluggish start with a big week -- a win has him projected to leap to No. 63.\n\n\"It's been everything I've dreamed of as a little boy but at the same time it's really hard,\" he said of playing on Tour. \"You can't play the same game I did last year. These guys keep getting better and that's something I've had to learn.\"\n\nHughes's hot putter\n\nMackenzie Hughes looks on from the 18th green during the first round of the 2024 3M Open at TPC Twin Cities. (David Berding/Getty Images)\n\nCanadian Mackenzie Hughes entered the week at No. 50 in the FedEx Cup, one spot ahead of Patrick Rodgers.\n\nThe top 50 after the FedEx St. Jude Championship, the first of three playoff events, earn a spot into the BMW Championship, the second playoff event and become exempt into next year's eight Signature events.\n\n\"There's a big discrepancy between being inside the top 50 and getting in the Signature Events and not having those opportunities,\" said Rodgers, who opened with 65. \"So there's so much to play for.\"\n\nHughes was a stroke better, posting a bogey-free 64, thanks to a red-hot putter. He took just seven putts on his first six holes and sank a 54-foot birdie put at No. 13 among his 188 feet of putts made.\n\n\"You don't know how long it's going to last for, but certainly I knew in the first kind of three or four holes that I had something nice going with the putter,\" said Hughes, who took 27 putts and led the field in Strokes Gained Putting. \"At that point it was just a matter had of making sure I gave myself as many looks as possible and got the ball on the green and let the putter do the work.\"\n\nHis performance should impress Presidents Cup International Team Captain Mike Weir. Hughes also is chasing another bubble of sorts - the Presidents Cup bubble. He's trying to qualify for the International Team on points so he doesn't have to rely on a captain's pick. The Presidents Cup will be held north of the border and Hughes is intent on making the team for the first time after coming up just short two years ago when the biennial competition was held at Quail Hollow Club, where Hughes is a member.\n\nTheegala's revenge week\n\nSahith Theegala plays a shot on the ninth hole during the first round of the 2024 3M Open at TPC Twin Cities. (Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images)\n\nSahith Theegala has missed the cut in his three previous appearances at the 3M Open. He'd only broken 70 once in six rounds. So what made him return this year beyond appreciating that the tournament gave him a start right out of college?\n\n\"It's kind of like a revenge week for me, I just wanted to come back and see what I can do on the golf course that's beat me up pretty bad the last three years,\" he said. \"This is probably the only week where I genuinely feel I'm not even worried about the score, I just want to beat the golf course. I'm not even looking at other guys or the board, don't care what they shoot, I just want to feel like I've tackled this course.\"\n\nHe's off to a great start, carding a 5-under 66 in the first round. Theegala realizes the course might not be the best fit for his game but he's improved his driving, gaining strokes off the tee in 17 of 20 events this season. He hit 9-of-14 fairways and gained more than a shot with his driver.\n\n\"I know some guys would shy away, but I have no problem taking it on,\" Theegala said. \"If I fail, so be it, but I really don't want to let the course get the best of me again.\"\n\nWoodland feeling better, now 'two weeks headache-free'\n\nGary Woodland lines up a putt on the 10th green during the first round of the 2024 3M Open at TPC Twin Cities. (David Berding/Getty Images)\n\nGary Woodland has some work to do to make the playoffs too, but he feels his game is turning the corner. He entered the week No. 130 in the FedEx Cup with just one top-25 finish this season.\n\nWoodland is less than a year removed from having surgery to remove a tumor from his brain.\n\n\"I'm two weeks headache-free,\" he said. \"My caddie says I'm a new person and it's been nice. I'm still dealing with some things but I'm way better.\"\n\nWoodland said he had an MRI three weeks ago and he's stable. His doctor lowered the dose of the medicine he's taking. \"It's night and day,\" he said.\n\nWoodland opened with 5-under 66, his lowest first round of the season.\n\nCink's backup plan for 2025\n\nStewart Cink plays his shot from the second tee during the first round of the 2024 3M Open at TPC Twin Cities. (Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images)\n\nStewart Cink is 178th in the FedEx Cup but he's still confident that he's one week away from working his way back into the playoff mix. On Thursday, he carded five birdies on his second nine to 5-under 66. Cink, the 2009 British Open champ, missed the cut at Royal Troon last week, and opted to skip the senior version at Carnoustie this week.\n\n\"The upside of playing on the PGA Tour is really high and I'm not going to have the privilege of playing out here forever, so, I'm taking advantage of it,\" said Cink, who is making his 13th start this season. \"If I fall flat on my face and end up with little status, I've got a really great backup in that I've got the Champions our to go play as much as I want, which is awesome, so I don't feel much pressure.\"", "source": {"uri":

PGA Tour rookie Jacob Bridgeman tops the list after a birdie-birdie finish to his first round was enough for him to get in the clubhouse with a round of 8-under 63 for a one-stroke lead over Mackenzie Hughes.\n\nCurrently outside the top 125 in the FedEx Cup standings, Bridgeman looks to build off his career-low round on the PGA Tour over the next three days at TPC Twin Cities and capture his first top-10 finish of the season and perhaps the first victory of his young career. In order to do so, however, he will need to fend off a number of PGA Tour staples, including Sahith Theegala who stands at 5 under and Tony Finau just one more adrift.\n\n\"I think again I'm not afraid to say I don't think the golf course really suits my game up until this year,\" Theegala said. \"Really struggled off the tee most of my life and last couple years included, so off the tee's so important out here. I was really excited to come back because it's been the biggest improvement in my game.\n\n\"Really drove it awesome all year and I was just excited to play from the short grass here because I had a lot of lakes and rough the last couple years,\" he continued. \"It's kind of like a revenge week for me. I just wanted to come back and see what I can do on the golf course that's beat me up pretty bad the last three years.\"\n\nUnlike Bridgeman, Theegala enters the week in prime position in the season-long race. Inside the top 10 and all but secured of a spot in the Tour Championship, the free-swinging right-hander seeks revenge against this par-71 layout, which has produced three missed cuts in three tries.\n\nTheegala's opening 66 is a great step towards seeing the weekend for the first time and a great step towards Theegala's first win of the season. Posting career-best numbers in a variety of areas, Theegala -- who was once known for his volatility -- has turned into one of the more consistent fixtures on PGA Tour leaderboards.\n\n\"It's funny, I'm not even like -- this is probably the only week where I genuinely feel I'm not even worried about the score, I just want to beat the golf course,\" Theegala said. \"I'm not even looking at other guys or the board, don't care what they shoot, I just want to feel like I've tackled this course. It's a stressful golf course.\n\n\"It's a good start today, but it's playing soft and gettable and I think a bunch of guys are going to shoot good rounds,\" he continued. \"Hopefully, the wind firms it up. I know there's going to be a lot more stressful shots. I'm just going to try to get through it all. It's fun, it's a different challenge. I know some guys would shy away, but I have no problem taking it on. If I fail, so be it, but I really don't want to let the course get the best of me again.\"\n\nThe leaders\n\n1. Jacob Bridgeman (-8)\n\n2. Mackenzie Hughes (-7)\n\nIt was a vintage Hughes performance on Thursday as he gained six strokes on the field with more than five of those coming courtesy of his putter. The Canadian made seven putts outside 10 feet, including a 59-foot birdie on the par-3 13th.\n\nWhile his fellow countrymen, Nick Taylor and Corey Conners, are not in the field in preparation for next week's Olympics, Hughes is among a large group of Canadians consisting of Adam Hadwin, Taylor Pendrith and Adam Svensson, who are trying to make the most of this closing summer stretch in order to elicit a selection for the International Presidents Cup team. Thursday's bogey-free 64 is a good start.\n\n\"It was a great day,\" Hughes said. \"I felt like I was maybe a tad bit off early with my swing and kind of -- made a nice up-and-down to keep my round going early. Kind of found a bit of a rhythm with my swing kind of seven, eight holes in and started to swing it a little better, and the putter was cooperating nicely today. It was a fun day on the greens.\"\n\nOther contenders\n\nT3. Martin Trainer, Patrick Rodgers, Andrew Novak (-6)\n\nT6. Sahith Theegala, Gary Woodland, Kevin Streelman, Stewart Cink, Taylor Pendrith, Michael Thorbjornsen, Kurt Kitayama, Hayden Springer (-5)\n\nRodgers was rolling early and may have had thoughts of a sub-60 round at one stage. Turning in 5 under, he tacked on birdies on Nos. 1 and 3 (his 10th and 12th holes) to reach 7 under with six holes to play. He got as deep as 8 under with a birdie a few holes later, but dropped shots on two of his final three holes will position him two back heading into Friday. Regardless, it's a great start for a player who entered the week 51st in the FedEx Cup standings.\n\n\"The top 50 number is enormous now with the new structure of the Tour,\" Rodgers said. There's a big discrepancy between being inside the top 50 and getting in the signature events and not having those opportunities. There's so much to play for. I'm just trying to play my best golf. I feel like I'm playing well at the right time, which is exciting.\n\n\"I probably feel more fresh this time of year than I have in years past with the shortened schedule,\" he continued. \"I feel like my season's had a little better flow to it, which has been nice. Yeah, I'm excited, I feel like there's a nice stretch of opportunities here coming and it's exactly what you want, to have all to play for as the season's finishing.\"\n\nThe game within the game\n\nWith it being an Olympics year, the PGA Tour has only two regular-season events following The Open, making it much more of a sprint than usual. Not only is someone like Rodgers on the bubble, but there are also plenty of big names are on important cut-off points, including Hughes, who entered the week at No. 50 in the FedEx Cup standings.\n\nA great result would make his postseason much less stressful and all but secure his place in the field for the 2025 signature events.

A win this week would vault him into the top 70, where he needs to be in three weeks to qualify for the FedEx St. Jude Championship, the first of three playoff events.\n\nThe 24-year-old rookie couldn't have had a better time to shoot his career-low, an 8-under 63 at TPC Twin Cities. Bridgeman has yet to record a top-10 finish this season but it's now officially crunch time on the PGA Tour.\n\nWith just two tournaments remaining in the Tour's FedEx Cup regular season, the field of 156 at the 3M Open knows that time is running out to improve their position before the playoffs. The pressure is mounting with just the Wyndham Championship -- to be held in two weeks following the Olympics -- and players battling to secure various levels of status for next year. Stewart Cink summed up what players are facing as the regular season winds to a conclusion.\n\n3M Open: Leaderboard | Photos | Merchandise\n\n\"Any time you put the pressure of whether you're going to have this job next year or a very different one next year, it's tough and if you let that become dependent on your scores and result, it's a recipe for frustration,\" Cink said. \"Psychologically it can take you in the wrong direction because all the players are so good and the field has no bad days. They just tear these places apart.\"\n\nMartin Trainer, who entered the week at No. 137 in the FedEx Cup, said he knew the clock was ticking on his playoff hopes but shooting 65 on Thursday was the start he needed to try to make a late-season charge into the top 70.\n\n\"The season's coming down to the stretch here, so yeah, I'm definitely going to need some good finishes, but hopefully this can be one of them,\" he said.\n\nHere are five more things to know about the first round of the 3M Open.\n\nJacob Bridgeman stuck an old putter from his high school days into play on Thursday and rolled to nine birdies and a round of 8-under 63 at TPC Twin Cities for a one-stroke lead over Mackenzie Hughes.\n\nWith his caddie having travel woes due to the CrowdStrike tech outage, Bridgeman killed time on Tuesday in the TaylorMade truck and messed around with a gray Spider mallet putter that he used six years ago. He took it out to the course Thursday and made four birdies in his first eight holes, including a 34-foot putt at No. 8, before his lone bogey of his opening round at the ninth. He bounced back with three birdies in a row starting at No. 12, including a 20-footer at 13, and holed a bunker shot at 17.\n\n\"That one kind of surprised me. I was in a bad spot and I didn't think I could stop it and it kind of one-hopped in the hole,\" Bridgeman said. \"That probably went from a 4 to a 2.\"\n\nBridgeman had missed three straight cuts entering this week and said he was down in the dumps after his latest weekend off.\n\n\"Never had struggles with my confidence until these last few weeks and I told a couple people I felt like I've been kicked in the face,\" he said.\n\nPep talks from his parents, his college coach at Clemson University and his girlfriend, who reminded him, \"work is meant to be balanced with rest,\" helped him find a better head space.\n\nIt couldn't have come at a better time for Bridgeman, who has yet to record a top-10 finish this season, but could make up for a sluggish start with a big week -- a win has him projected to leap to No. 63.\n\n\"It's been everything I've dreamed of as a little boy but at the same time it's really hard,\" he said of playing on Tour. \"You can't play the same game I did last year. These guys keep getting better and that's something I've had to learn.\"\n\nCanadian Mackenzie Hughes entered the week at No. 50 in the FedEx Cup, one spot ahead of Patrick Rodgers.\n\nThe top 50 after the FedEx St. Jude Championship, the first of three playoff events, earn a spot into the BMW Championship, the second playoff event and become exempt into next year's eight Signature events.\n\n\"There's a big discrepancy between being inside the top 50 and getting in the Signature Events and not having those opportunities,\" said Rodgers, who opened with 65. \"So there's so much to play for.\"\n\nHughes was a stroke better, posting a bogey-free 64, thanks to a red-hot putter. He took just seven putts on his first six holes and sank a 54-foot birdie put at No. 13 among his 188 feet of putts made.\n\n\"You don't know how long it's going to last for, but certainly I knew in the first kind of three or four holes that I had something nice going with the putter,\" said Hughes, who took 27 putts and led the field in Strokes Gained Putting. \"At that point it was just a matter had of making sure I gave myself as many looks as possible and got the ball on the green and let the putter do the work.\"\n\nHis performance should impress Presidents Cup International Team Captain Mike Weir. Hughes also is chasing another bubble of sorts - the Presidents Cup bubble. He's trying to qualify for the International Team on points so he doesn't have to rely on a captain's pick. The Presidents Cup will be held north of the border and Hughes is intent on making the team for the first time after coming up just short two years ago when the biennial competition was held at Quail Hollow Club, where Hughes is a member.\n\nSahith Theegala has missed the cut in his three previous appearances at the 3M Open. He'd only broken 70 once in six rounds. So what made him return this year beyond appreciating that the tournament gave him a start right out of college?\n\n\"It's kind of like a revenge week for me, I just wanted to come back and see what I can do on the golf course that's beat me up pretty bad the last three years,\" he said. \"This is probably the only week where I genuinely feel I'm not even worried about the score, I just want to beat the golf course. I'm not even looking at other guys or the board, don't care what they shoot, I just want to feel like I've tackled this course.\"\n\nHe's off to a great start, carding a 5-under 66 in the first round. Theegala realizes the course might not be the best fit for his game but he's improved his driving, gaining strokes off the tee in 17 of 20 events this season. He hit 9-of-14 fairways and gained more than a shot with his driver.\n\n\"I know some guys would shy away, but I have no problem taking it on,\" Theegala said. \"If I fail, so be it, but I really don't want to let the course get the best of me again.\"\n\nGary Woodland has some work to do to make the playoffs too, but he feels his game is turning the corner. He entered the week No. 130 in the FedEx Cup with just one top-25 finish this season.\n\nWoodland is less than a year removed from having surgery to remove a tumor from his brain.\n\n\"I'm two weeks headache-free,\" he said. \"My caddie says I'm a new person and it's been nice. I'm still dealing with some things but I'm way better.\"\n\nWoodland said he had an MRI three weeks ago and he's stable. His doctor lowered the dose of the medicine he's taking. \"It's night and day,\" he said.\n\nWoodland opened with 5-under 66, his lowest first round of the season.\n\nStewart Cink is 178th in the FedEx Cup but he's still confident that he's one week away from working his way back into the playoff mix. On Thursday, he carded five birdies on his second nine to 5-under 66. Cink, the 2009 British Open champ, missed the cut at Royal Troon last week, and opted to skip the senior version at Carnoustie this week.\n\n\"The upside of playing on the PGA Tour is really high and I'm not going to have the privilege of playing out here forever, so, I'm taking advantage of it,\" said Cink, who is making his 13th start this season. \"If I fall flat on my face and end up with little status, I've got a really great backup in that I've got the Champions our to go play as much as I want, which is awesome, so I don't feel much pressure.\"", "source": {"uri":

Riding an improved driver, the rising PGA Tour star fired a smooth 5-under 66 in the opening round of the 3M Open.\n\nTheegala has missed the cut in all three career starts in Minneapolis. Prior to Thursday, his second-round 67 in 2023 was his lone round under par.\n\nThe rematch with TPC Twin Cities was personal. The lengthy 70,240-yard par-71 course has presented a stiff test for Theegala, known more for creativity and finesse than driving distance. (Los Angeles Lakers wing Austin Reaves singled out Theegala's putting in our recent conversation; Theegala is breaking out a new putter this week.) For the season, Theegala ranks 57th in driving distance on the PGA Tour.\n\nBack in Minnesota, Theegala was determined to win this round. Well, ideally four rounds.\n\n\"I'm not afraid to say I don't think the golf course really suits my game up until this year,\" the 26-year-old said Thursday. \"Really struggled off the tee most of my life, and last couple years included. So off the tee's so important out here. I was really excited to come back because it's been the biggest improvement in my game.\n\n\"It's kind of like a revenge week for me. I just wanted to come back and see what I can do on the golf course that's beat me up pretty bad the last three years.\"\n\nPlaying alongside fellow future Ryder Cup prospect Nick Dunlap and 2025 U.S. captain Keegan Bradley, Theegala found the ideal mixture of loose and dialed-in.\n\nHe birdied his first hole (par-4 10th), two par-5s (Nos. 18 and 6), and two other par-4s (Nos. 16 and 5). For his bogey-free round, Theegala averaged 315.7 yards and gained 1.60 strokes on the field off the tee. He landed 9 of 14 fairways.\n\n\"I know some guys would shy away, but I have no problem taking it on,\" Theegala said. \"If I fail, so be it, but I really don't want to let the course get the best of me again.\"\n\nTheegala showed off the finesse game, too.\n\nThe laser-focus on the 3M Open has, evidently, enabled Theegala -- now ranked No. 11 in the Official World Golf Ranking and comfortably seventh in the FedExCup standings -- to move past his missed cut at the Open Championship.

He sits tied for fifth after the first round of the tournament.\n\nAfter missing the cut in all three of his previous starts, the PGA Tour winner came out strong on a pure TPC Twin Cities track.\n\nTheegala committed early to play in the 3M Open this season, planning to use this event as a momentum booster for the playoffs.\n\nWhen he turned pro in 2020, this tournament was among the first to offer him a sponsor exemption.\n\n\"It's the perfect storm,\" Theegala said after his round on Thursday. \"They've been so good to me, and it's a well-run event, one of the best run events, and they treat you right. The Golf course is pure. The grounds crew does a great job. All of that keeps me coming back here.\"\n\nHis opening round score is the best to date at this event. Theegala loves this event, but he has not always thought that the track suits his game. The former Pepperdine golfer struggled off the tee most of his career but is now excited about playing it even more.\n\n\"I didn't think the golf course suited my game until this year,\" he said. \"Off the tee's so important out here. I was excited to come back because it's been the biggest improvement in my game. It's like a revenge week for me, and I wanted to come back and see what I can do on the golf course that's beat me up pretty bad the last three years.\"\n\nHe ranks No. 12 in strokes gained off the tee (+1.589) and around the green (+1.156).\n\nIn strokes gained total, Theegala sits T6 at +4.424. He hit 9-of-14 fairways and 15-of-18 greens. It was a solid first round for the 26-year-old.\n\nTheegala is No. 7 in the FedEx Cup standings. He has two runner-up finishes, six Top 10s, and nine Top 25s in 20 starts. This week is not about points for him, as he is in the playoffs.\n\nHowever, he came to conquer something internally with this track.\n\n\"This is the only week where I genuinely feel I'm not even worried about the score; I want to beat the golf course,\" Theegala said. \"I'm not even looking at other guys or the board -- I don't care what they shoot. I want to feel like I've tackled this course. Some guys would shy away, but I have no problem taking it on. If I fail, so be it, but I don't want to let the course get the best of me again.\"\n\nTheegala seems on a mission, and the first round went to him. The next step will likely be to make the cut and play all four days.\n\nHe will get a later tee time for Friday's round as he will play with Nick Dunlap and Keegan Bradley at 1:54 p.m. ET.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "savannah_leigh_richardson@sbnation.com", "name": "Savannah Leigh Richardson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3M_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "3M Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahith_Theegala", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sahith Theegala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_Twin_Cities", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TPC Twin Cities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepperdine_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pepperdine University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FedEx Cup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cPiaOlR6xYVMdDFP5EoVUyvv8z4=/0x0:1276x638/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25546134/2163660049.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764805", "eventUri": "eng-9764805", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Is this kind of goon supposed to work in a CM residence? We are shocked; this is not about minor or major injuries.\"\n\nSenior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Kumar, said that there are contradictions in Maliwal's statement about where she says she was hit and that she went to the police station on the day of the incident but came back without lodging an FIR.\n\nIn the response, the bench asked about the fact that Malliwal called the police using the helpline number (112).\n\nAs Singhvi urged the apex court for the grant of bail, the bench said, \"You are right, we grant bail to murderers and killers. But here, look at the FIR. She is crying about her physical condition. Did you have authority? If this kind of person cannot influence witnesses, then who can? Was anyone there in the drawing room to speak against him, you think? He doesn't seem ashamed, we think.\"\n\nSinghvi then said the FIR lodged by Maliwal should not be treated as gospel truth.\n\n\"We don't want to read in open court... but once she tells him to stop because of this particular physical condition... this man continues. What he thinks, power has gotten to his head?\" asked the bench.\n\nSinghvi said Kumar has been in custody for 75 days and the chargesheet has been filed.\n\nThe bench asked that the chargesheet be placed on record before it was perused.\n\nOn July 12, the High Court dismissed Kumar's bail plea, saying he enjoys \"considerable influence\" and no ground to grant him the relief was made out.\n\nThe High Court had said that it cannot be ruled out that witnesses may be influenced or evidence tampered with in the event that Kumar is released on bail.\n\nOn May 16, an FIR was registered against Kumar under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code, including those related to criminal intimidation, assault or using criminal force on a woman with the intent to disrobe and attempt to commit culpable homicide.\n\nKumar moved the High Court after a Tis Hazari court here dismissed his bail plea on May 26.

But once she tells him (Bibhav Kumar) to stop because of this particular physical condition, this man continues. What he thinks, the power has gotten to his head?\" said a bench headed by Justice Surya Kant.\n\nThe Bench, also comprising Justices Dipankar Datta and Ujjal Bhuyan, remarked that the accused did not feel shame to assault a young woman.\n\nResponding, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who appeared on the accused's behalf, said that the question of assault is a subject matter of trial and the apex court was dealing with the bail plea.\n\nSinghvi submitted that Maliwal suffered simple and non-dangerous injuries as per the MLC report contrary to the allegations contained in the FIR.\n\nHe added that Maliwal did not lodge an FIR on the date of the incident, though she went to the police station, but after three days on May 16.\n\nAt this, Justice Kant-led Bench said, \"But she did dial emergency number 112 on the date of the incident.\"\n\nUltimately, the apex court agreed to examine Bibhav Kumar's special leave petition against the decision of the Delhi High Court refusing to admit his bail plea.\n\nListing the matter for next Wednesday, it asked the petitioner to place on record the copy of the charge sheet and other documents, including the MLC report.\n\nIn its impugned July 12 order, a bench of Justice Anoop Kumar Mendiratta of the Delhi High Court rejected Bibhav Kumar's bail plea saying that at this stage, the possibility of tampering with the evidence or influencing the witnesses cannot be ruled out by the accused, who happened to be the personal secretary of Delhi CM.\n\nEarlier on May 27, a Delhi court refused to release CM Kejriwal's aide on bail. Bibhav Kumar's counsel contended that Maliwal went to the CM's residence with the intent to malign his aide. Questioning the three-day delay in lodging the FIR, he argued that Bibhav Kumar was not present at the CM's residence at the time of the incident and Maliwal had no appointment.\n\nKumar was arrested on May 18 in connection with the assault on Maliwal on May 13 and produced late at night before a local court which sent him to five days of police custody.\n\nDelhi Police registered a case against Kumar after he allegedly assaulted Maliwal at the Chief Minister's residence.\n\nThe FIR at the Civil Lines police station includes charges under Sections 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide), 341 (wrongful restraint), 354(B) (assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe), 506 (criminal intimidation), and 509 (word, gesture, or act intended to insult the modesty of a

He doesn't seem ashamed of what he did, we think. Moreover, the incident did not take place in a private residence, it is the Chief Minister's residence.\"\n\nThe court also observed that the assertion of the Bhbahv Kumar that it is a concocted FIR against him is belied by the fact that Swati Maliwal called on emergency help line 112 from the Chief Minister's residence to report the incident.\n\nThe court also said, \"We normally grant bail. But look at the way the alleged incident took place. We don't want to read in open court.\"\n\nEarlier, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Bibhav Kumar, impressed on the court that the FIR against Kumar was lodged three days after the incident and the court was taking the FIR as the gospel truth. \"The court is taking the FIR as gospel truth. A friendly LG of Delhi and police don't register my complaint but only hers,\" submitted Singhivi.\n\nThe court has now issued notice to Delhi police and listed the matter for hearing on August 7.\n\nBibhav Kumar is accused of of assaulting Swati Maliwal at the Delhi Chief Minister's official residence on May 13 when she had gone there to meet Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.\n\nDelhi Police had arrested Kumar on May 18 in the alleged assault case after an FIR was registered against him under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) related to criminal intimidation, destruction of evidence, assault or criminal force on a woman with the intent to disrobe and attempt to commit culpable homicide.\n\nKumar recently moved the Supreme Court seeking bail in the assault case. He moved the top court against the Delhi High Court refusing to grant him bail in the case.\n\nThe Delhi High Court dismissed Kumar's bail plea earlier on July 12.\n\nHigh court dismissed Kumar's bail, saying he wields considerable power and can influence witnesses if he is released on bail in the case and no grounds are made out for releasing him on bail at this stage keeping in view the nature of accusations against him and apprehension of the witnesses being influenced.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashok_bagriya@news9live.com", "name": "Ashok Bagriya", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swati_Maliwal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swati Maliwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_information_report", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First information report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament,_Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chief_ministers_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of chief ministers of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senior counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Singhvi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Singhvi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culpable_homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Culpable homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Penal_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Penal Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/snap-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776764", "eventUri": "eng-9776764", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 1446, "textEnd": 1454}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-13", "textStart": 1564, "textEnd": 1570}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-18", "textStart": 1671, "textEnd": 1677}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-12", "textStart": 2193, "textEnd": 2200}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

The observation came even as the court issued a notice on Kumar's bail plea and listed it for hearing on August 7.\n\nA bench of justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta, and Ujjal Bhuyan said the question is not whether the injuries Maliwal sustained are major or minor. \"We are shocked at the manner in which it is done to somebody visiting the CM [chief minister] residence,\" it said while agreeing to consider the bail plea. Kumar moved the Supreme Court after the Delhi high court denied him bail on July 12.\n\nSenior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who represented Kumar, said Maliwal came to the chief minister's residence and nobody had gone to her house, prompting the bench to ask if the CM's office was a private residence. \"Does it need these kinds of rules? We have released on bail people who are charged with heinous offences. But see the way and manner the offence is done. What kind of power has gone into his head that she tells him to stop as she is having a particular physical condition, but he continues...It is inhuman. What kind of moral policing does he do.\"\n\nThe court will hear the matter on August 7 and consider the charge sheet filed in this case. It sought a response from the Delhi Police on Kumar's bail plea while permitting the petitioner's lawyers to place the charge sheet on record.\n\nSinghvi said the allegation against Kumar at the highest is that of causing injury and grounds for granting bail are made out as there is no way he can tamper with evidence with the chargesheet already filed.\n\nThe bench replied if this kind of person cannot influence, who else can? \"If he can mislead people by calling the staff from outside, can anybody dare to speak against him?\" The bench wondered if Kumar was a former aide of the CM or a government servant.\n\nSinghvi said Kumar, a former government servant, was a political assistant who fixes appointments of the CM. \"The FIR [first information report] says you [Kumar] are ex-private secretary. What authority did you have at the office of the CM that the victim did not have? You want to put out a case as if some goon has gone into the house. And he is not even ashamed of what he has done.\"\n\nSinghvi said Kumar was only seeking bail as he had been incarcerated for 75 days. He said that the incident occurred on May 13 and that Maliwal chose to file her complaint only after three days.\n\nThe bench said if Maliwal called the police helpline 112 immediately after the incident, what does that show? \"This belies your story that subsequently she concocted allegations.\"\n\nSinghvi said the FIR was possible due to \"friendly\" police under a \"friendly\" Lieutenant Governor, prompting the bench to say that these were internal political affairs.\n\nKumar was on May 16 booked under the Indian Penal Code's sections related to criminal intimidation, assault with intent to disrobe a woman, and attempted culpable homicide. Kumar insisted the allegations were false and that his custody was unnecessary since the investigation was complete. He argued that his arrest was made in a hurry violating his rights as the police did not issue him a notice before arresting him without a warrant.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Singhvi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Singhvi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chargesheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chargesheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ujjal_Bhuyan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ujjal Bhuyan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipankar_Datta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dipankar Datta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chief_ministers_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of chief ministers of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surya_Kant_(judge)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surya Kant (judge)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swati_Maliwal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swati Maliwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Senior counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_information_report", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First information report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culpable_homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Culpable homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Penal_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Penal Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimidation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intimidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/08/01/1600x900/The-court-issued-a-notice-on-Kumar-s-bail-plea-and_1722498010874.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776764", "eventUri": "eng-9776764", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 365, "textEnd": 373, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-12", "textStart": 758, "textEnd": 765}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-13", "textStart": 2548, "textEnd": 2554}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-16", "textStart": 2989, "textEnd": 2995}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

You want to make it appear as if a bad guy broke into the residence. And he isn't even ashamed of his actions.\"\n\nOn Thursday, 1st August, the Supreme Court questioned Bibhav Kumar, Arvind Kejriwal's close aide over the assault of Rajya Sabha member Swati Maliwal, saying it was surprised by how the incident occurred at the Delhi chief minister's residence. The statement came as the court issued a notice of Kumar's bail application, setting it for a hearing on August 7th.\n\nA bench of justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta, and Ujjal Bhuyan stated that the issue is not whether Maliwal's wounds are substantial or slight. \"We are shocked at the manner in which it is done to somebody visiting the CM residence,\" it stated, agreeing to hear the bail petition. Kumar approached the Supreme Court after the Delhi High Court refused him bail on July 12th.\n\nSenior lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who defended Kumar, stated that Maliwal came to the chief minister's residence and no one had gone to her house, prompting the bench to inquire whether the CM's office was a private property.\n\n\"Does it need these kinds of rules? We have released on bail people who are charged with heinous offences. But see the way and manner the offence is done. What kind of power has gone into his head that she tells him to stop as she is having a particular physical condition, but he continues...It is inhuman. What kind of moral policing does he do. Is this kind of goon supposed to work at CM's residence?\" the court said, as per Times of India report.\n\nThe court will hear the case next on August 7th and assess the charge sheet. It sought a response from the Delhi Police to Kumar's bail application while allowing the petitioner's counsel to file the charge sheet.\n\nSinghvi stated that the most serious allegation against Kumar is that he caused injury and that there are reasons for granting bail because he cannot interfere with evidence with the chargesheet already filed.\n\nThe bench responded by asking that if this type of individual cannot influence, who can? \"If he can mislead people by calling the staff from outside, can anybody dare to speak against him?\" The judges pondered if Kumar was a former chief minister's aide or a government employee.\n\nSinghvi claimed Kumar, a former government employee, was a political aide who made appointments for the CM. The Supreme Court asked why a former employee had more power at the CM's residence than Maliwal. \"The FIR [first information report] indicates you [Kumar] are an ex-private secretary. What authority did you have at the Chief Minister's office that the victim did not? You want to make it appear as if a bad guy broke into the residence. And he isn't even ashamed of his actions.\"\n\nSinghvi claimed Kumar was just requesting bail because he had been detained for 75 days. He stated that the event occurred on May 13th and Maliwal chose to register her complaint only three days later.\n\nThe bench asked what it meant if Maliwal called the police helpline 112 right away after the event. \"This belies your story that subsequently she concocted allegations.\" Singhvi claimed that the FIR was feasible due to \"friendly\" police and a \"friendly\" Lieutenant Governor, prompting the bench to rule that these were internal political concerns.\n\nKumar was charged on May 16th under the Indian Penal Code's sections for criminal intimidation, assault with intent to disrobe a woman, and attempted culpable homicide. Kumar claimed that the allegations were baseless and that his detention was unwarranted because the investigation had concluded. He claimed that his arrest was made in haste, violating his rights because the police did not provide him notice before arresting him without a warrant.", "source": {"uri": "opindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OpIndia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Singhvi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Singhvi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ujjal_Bhuyan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ujjal Bhuyan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipankar_Datta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dipankar Datta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chief_ministers_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of chief ministers of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surya_Kant_(judge)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surya Kant (judge)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swati_Maliwal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swati Maliwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chargesheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chargesheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_information_report", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First information report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Times of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culpable_homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Culpable homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Penal_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Penal Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimidation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intimidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/bibhav-kumar-swati-maliwal-supreme-court-bali-plea.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776764", "eventUri": "eng-9776764", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 241, "textEnd": 251}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 578, "textEnd": 588, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-12", "textStart": 956, "textEnd": 965}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-13", "textStart": 2973, "textEnd": 2981}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-16", "textStart": 3420, "textEnd": 3428}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Mr Kumar was arrested in May after allegations of assault, inside Mr Kejriwal's home, by AAP MP Swati Maliwal.\n\nThe next hearing has been set for August 7.\n\nBibhav Kumar was earlier denied bail by the Delhi High Court and a trial court.\n\nMr Kumar, in judicial custody till July 16, faces charges of criminal intimidation, assault or criminal force on a woman with intent to disrobe, and attempt to commit culpable homicide.\n\nHe also faces charges of \"disappearing evidence and giving false information\".\n\nIn the brief hearing this morning the court acknowledged \"we normally grant bail... we grant bail to murderers and killers\". However, in what may be seen as a bad sign going forward, it also remarked \"look at the FIR. She (Ms Maliwal) was crying (during the assault)\" and seemed unconvinced by arguments that Bibhav Kumar, if given bail, would not influence witnesses.\n\n\"If this kind of person can't influence who can? Was anyone in the drawing room (of the Chief Minister's home, where the alleged assault began) to speak against him... he doesn't seem ashamed, we think,\" a bench of Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and Ujjal Bhuyan remarked.\n\nThe court, in a particularly strong observation, also called Mr Kumar a \"goon\".\n\nEarlier today senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, appearing for Mr Kumar, began by questioning the delay by Ms Maliwal in filing her complaint. He referred to Ms Maliwal's visit to Delhi's Civil Lines Police Station on May 13 (the day of the alleged assault) and the \"strange story\" in her FIR.\n\n\"Incident was on May 13. FIR was lodged May 16... the story in FIR is strange. She went on the first day to the police station but came back (Ms Maliwal did not file a police complaint or make a statement on that day). Did not lodge FIR. Three days later, FIR was lodged with injuries...\"\n\nMr Singhvi also argued that there are contradictions in Ms Maliwal's complaints. \"Even trial court should have granted bail... there are contradictions about where she says she was hit.\"\n\nIn her complaint Ms Maliwal said she was hit in the chest, stomach and pelvic areas, and that she felt \"absolutely shocked and was screaming for help over and over again\".\n\n\"In order to protect myself, I pushed him away with my legs. At that time, he pounced on me, brutally dragged and deliberately pulled my shirt up,\" she told the cops.\n\nOn the claimed delay, the court pointed out that Ms Maliwal, the former head of the Delhi Commission for Women, had called the police helpline (112) \"immediately after the incident\".\n\nDelhi Police later confirmed a call had been placed - from Ms Maliwal's phone and from inside Mr Kejriwal's residence. The caller did not, however, reveal their identity, the police said.\n\n\"If she is calling 112 immediately after incident, what does it show?\" the court shot back.\n\nThe court also questioned claims Ms Maliwal should be prosecuted as she had \"trespassed\" on Mr Kejriwal's home. \"Is it a private residence or office of Chief Minister?\" the court asked.\n\nMs Maliwal has maintained she had an appointment with the Chief Minister on that day.\n\nMr Singhvi then objected to the court \"treating the FIR as gospel\" but was told the court is only interested in due processes. \"We are not bothered by your internal and other politics.\"\n\nREAD | Delhi LG Backs Swati Maliwal, AAP Says It Proves Her BJP Link\n\nBibhav Kumar has denied all allegations by Swati Maliwal, and the AAP has claimed that their senior leader is part of a \"conspiracy\" orchestrated by its main rival, the Bharatiya Janata Party.\n\nREAD | Swati Maliwal Cries In Court, Claims Threat If Bibhav Kumar Gets Bail\n\nLast month, ahead of the trial court's verdict on his bail appeal, Ms Maliwal claimed there would be threats to her life, and her family, if Mr Kumar were to be released from jail.\n\nThe case has sparked a predictable political spat between the AAP and the BJP, which has accused Mr Kejriwal of shielding his aide.

She pushed him away to protect herself, but he then pounced on her, brutally dragged her, and deliberately pulled her shirt up. An FIR was registered against Kumar on May 16 under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code and he was arrested on May 18.\n\nOn Thursday, the three-judge bench of Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and Ujjal Bhuyan said it was shocked at the manner in which the incident had unfolded. \"What does he think? Power has gone to his head. You [Kumar] were the ex-secretary. If the victim had no authority to be there, even you did not have authority to be there.\"\n\nThe court added: \"He is not ashamed of doing it. She is a young woman. The FIR says she asked him to stop. She was in a particular condition then. Do you think anyone in that room watching would have dared to say anything against him?\"\n\nNoting that Kumar had behaved \"as if some goon entered the premises\", the court said: \"These are your political affairs. Law and criminal allegations don't have anything to do with it.\"\n\nAs senior advocate AM Singhvi, appearing for Kumar, took the court through the MLC report which described the nature of injuries on Maliwal to be non-dangerous and simple injuries, the Bench asked about the emergency call made from Kejriwal's residence just after the incident.\n\nSinghvi also argued that Kumar had been in custody for 75 days and the chargesheet had been filed (since after the Delhi High Court order). He contended that Maliwal registered the FIR three days after the incident \"with a friendly police, under a friendly LG\", but Kumar's FIR of the same day was not registered.\n\nIt was also remarked by the Bench that bail is even granted to murderers, robbers, etc., but the allegations in Maliwal's case weigh heavily against Kumar. \"We don't want to read in open court...but once she tells him to stop because of this particular physical condition...this man continues!\"", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogging_and_sagging", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hogging and sagging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chief_ministers_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of chief ministers of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swati_Maliwal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swati Maliwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_information_report", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First information report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ujjal_Bhuyan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ujjal Bhuyan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipankar_Datta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dipankar Datta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surya_Kant_(judge)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surya Kant (judge)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Penal_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Penal Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senior counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chargesheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chargesheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/05/swati-maliwal-kejriwal-aide-allegations-2024-05-71c9850c64d2cbe0f2ef70b8c88a7a9b-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776764", "eventUri": "eng-9776764", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-05-16", "textStart": 985, "textEnd": 991}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-18", "textStart": 1065, "textEnd": 1071}], "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

You want to say as if a goon entered the residence and you wanted to protect... you have assaulted a young woman.\", the bench said.\n\nAt one point during the hearing, Justice Kant said, \"He doesn't seem ashamed of himself.\"\n\nJustice Kant said, \"... we grant bail to murderers and killers. But here look at the FIR. She is crying about her physical condition. Did you have authority? If this kind of person cannot influence witnesses then who can?\"\n\nThe matter will now cum up for hearing on August 7 as the Court issued notice to Delhi Police.\n\nSenior Advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Kumar, said, that the trial court should have granted bail in this matter as there are many contradictions in Swati Maliwal's statement about where she was hit.\n\nSinghvi told the bench that on the first day, May 13, she went (to police) but did not file any complaint. Three days later she filed an FIR (First Information Report).\n\nSinghvi pleaded that the FIR had been registered with a \"friendly police under a friendly LG\".\n\nJustice Kant asked Singhvi, what about the fact that she called 112? I think that belies your claim that she concocted.\n\n\"These are all your internal political affairs, we are not concerned with it,\" Justice Kant said.\n\nJustice Kant asked, \"Is CM's official house a private residence? Does it need this kind of rules? We are shocked, this is not about minor or major injuries.\"\n\nSinghvi, while pleading before the bench to grant bail to Kumar, said that the Chargesheet had already been filed on July 30. The MLC report described the nature of injuries as non-dangerous and simple, Singhvi said.\n\n\"Two bruises, one on the right cheek and one over the left leg... the incident occurred on May 13 and the FIR was registered on May 16, the story of the FIR is quite strange... she went to the police station on the first day and did not file the FIR...\" Singhvi added.\n\nThe bench said, we normally grant bail, but look at the way the alleged incident took place. We don't want to read in open court.\n\nThe bench commented, but does he (Kumar) think the power has gone into his head?\n\nJustice Datta asked whether on the date of the incident Kumar was a secretary or ex-secretary?\n\nSinghvi replied that he was the political secretary and handled all the appointments of the chief minister.\n\nJustice Kant then said, \"Not political secretary. You are a government employee.\"\n\nSinghvi told the court that all these questions could be put when the trial is going on but this is a matter where bail is being sought and added this is not a murder case.\n\nWas anyone there in the drawing room to speak against him you think? He doesn't seem ashamed of himself, Justice Kant said.\n\nSinghvi said, \"Lordships are treating the FIR as gospel. A friendly LG and police don't register my complaint but only hers.\"\n\nJustice Kant said, \"We are not on your internal and other politics. Going by criminal process and FIR.\"\n\nThe court then issued a notice returnable on August 7.\n\nThe matter pertains to an FIR registered by Swati Maliwal against Bibhav Kumar that he (Kumar) assaulted her when she went to meet Kejriwal at his residence on May 13.\n\nMaliwal in her written complaint in the police station alleged that Kumar assaulted her and slapped her at least 7-8 times while she screamed.\n\nShe pushed him away to protect herself, but he then pounced on her, brutally dragged her, and deliberately pulled her shirt up.\n\nKumar was arrested on May 18.He is in judicial custody till July 16 and faces charges of criminal intimidation, assault or criminal force on a woman with intent to disrobe.\n\nHe then approached the Delhi High Court seeking bail but his petition was dismissed because he is quite influential and the likelihood of his influencing witnesses cannot be ruled out.\n\nKumar then filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the Apex Court against the Delhi High Court order which had dismissed his bail saying that there was a possibility of his influencing witnesses or tampering with evidence.\n\nJustice Anoop Kumar Mendiratta of the Delhi High Court had on July 12, dismissed the bail petition of Kumar saying that the possibility of his tempering with the evidence cannot be ruled out.\n\nUNI SNG RC", "source": {"uri": "uniindia.com",

He moved the top court against the Delhi High Court refusing to grant him bail in the case.\n\nThe High Court on July 12 dismissed Kumar's bail plea, saying that he wields considerable power and can influence witnesses if he is released on bail in the case and no grounds are made out for releasing him on bail at this stage keeping in view the nature of accusations against him and apprehension of the witnesses being influenced.\n\nEarlier, two sessions courts dismissed Kumar's bail pleas.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nitish_k_singh@news9live.com", "name": "Nitish K Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chief_ministers_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "List of chief ministers of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swati_Maliwal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swati Maliwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Penal_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Penal Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magistrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_information_report", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First information report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culpable_homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Culpable homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/snap-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776764", "eventUri": "eng-9776764", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-16", "textStart": 329, "textEnd": 336}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-24", "textStart": 577, "textEnd": 586}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-13", "textStart": 847, "textEnd": 853}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-18", "textStart": 954, "textEnd": 960}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-16", "textStart": 1032, "textEnd": 1038}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-12", "textStart": 1444, "textEnd": 1451}], "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

It is the chief minister's residence... you have assaulted a young woman.\"\n\nThe remarks were made orally during the hearing on Kumar's bail plea before the bench finally agreed to issue notice on his appeal to the Delhi Police. Kumar had knocked on the top court's doors after the Delhi High Court dismissed his bail plea on 12 July.\n\nBoth the trial court and high court had declined to release Kumar on bail in view of the influential post he held in Kejriwal's office. The two courts said the possibility of tampering with evidence and influencing witnesses could not be ruled out.\n\nIn her complaint based on which the FIR was lodged, Maliwal alleged that Kumar had assaulted her when she went to meet Kejriwal at his residence on 13 May. She further said that Kumar had slapped her seven to eight times while she screamed. When Maliwal pushed him away, Kumar pounced and dragged her and then pulled up her shirt, she alleged.\n\nKumar's lawyer, senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, argued that contradictions in Maliwal's statement about where she was hit raised doubt about the veracity of her allegations and, therefore, his client was entitled to bail. He complained that Maliwal had submitted her formal complaint on 16 May, three days after the alleged incident.\n\nThe bench, also comprising Justices Dipankar Datta and Ujwal Bhuyan, countered Singhvi by reminding him that Maliwal had called 112 (emergency response system). \"This belies your claim that she concocted (the case),\" Justice Kant told Singhvi.\n\nThe judge appeared more vexed when Singhvi argued that Maliwal had gone to Kejriwal's home that day without an appointment. He asked the senior counsel: \"Is the CM's house a private residence? Does it need this kind of a rule? We are shocked, this is not about minor or major injuries. The HC has rightfully reproduced everything.\"\n\nJustice Kant was referring to Maliwal's physical situation at the time of the incident. According to her claim, she was on her period and despite being told about it, Kumar continued to punch her in her stomach.\n\n\"We normally grant bail. But we look at the way the alleged incident took place. We do not want to read (the FIR contents) in the open court,\" Justice Kant said. The judge interjected again when Singhvi argued that his client could not influence anyone.\n\n\"You are right, we grant bail to murderers and killers. But here, look at the FIR. She is crying because of her physical condition. Did you have the authority? If this is a person who cannot influence witnesses, then who can? Was anyone there in the drawing room to speak against him, you think? He doesn't seem ashamed, we think,\" the judge said.\n\nSinghvi, however, told the bench that while they were treating the FIR as the \"gospel truth\", it was filed by \"friendly police on a friendly L-G's intervention\". \"The police did not register my complaint, but hers,\" Singhvi argued.\n\nRefusing to get drawn into the \"politics\", and asserting that it would strictly go by criminal process and the FIR, the top court issued notice and listed the matter for further hearing on 7 August.\n\n(Edited by Tikli Basu)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bhadra_sinha@theprint.in", "name": "Bhadra Sinha", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Senior counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Singhvi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Singhvi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surya_Kant_(judge)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surya Kant (judge)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swati_Maliwal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swati Maliwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_information_report", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First information report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_tradition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oral tradition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immanuel Kant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trial court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipankar_Datta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dipankar Datta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Surety_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Surety Bonds", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bibhav-Kumar.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776764", "eventUri": "eng-9776764", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-12", "textStart": 501, "textEnd": 508}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-13", "textStart": 909, "textEnd": 915}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-16", "textStart": 1395, "textEnd": 1401}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 3260, "textEnd": 3268}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

He said even the trial court should have granted bail in the case as there are alleged contradictions in Maliwal's statement about where she says she was hit, and pointed out that the incident occurred on May 13, and the FIR was lodged after a gap of three days on May 16.\n\nHe said that Maliwal went to the police station on the date of the incident but did not lodge an FIR and came back, and after three days went back and registered the FIR with these injuries \"which are simple and non-dangerous\". Seeking bail, Singhvi said his client has been in custody over 70 days.\n\nJustice Kant told Singhvi that Maliwal calling 112 immediately after the incident, shows what? Singhvi replied that it shows she has a grievance. to this, Justice Kant said: \"That belies your story that she concocted the incident\".\n\nSinghvi said she came to the house and waited in the waiting room. Justice Kant asked Singhvi: \"Is the chief minister's official bungalow a private residence? Is that required to keep these kinds of goons, is the way to deal with it? We are shocked, and this is not a question of minor injury or major injury. The question is of manner....,\" Justice Kant said.\n\nThe counsel replied that the chargesheet has been filed, and the question is that is his client entitled for bail or not? \"What can I tamper with?\" he said. Justice Kant made it clear that in murder and robbery cases, every day court grants bail to the accused but \"the way the occurrence took place...\". \"We do not want to read in open court what she tells him. 'Please stop' because of her physical condition and this man continues. What he thinks, power has gone into head...these words are verbatim from the FIR\", said Justice Kant.\n\nSinghvi said the Delhi police and the lieutenant governor (LG) did not register his client's complaint the same day. At this juncture, Justice Datta queried Singhvi, on the day of the incident May 13, the petitioner was chief minister's secretary or ex-secretary? Who are you? Singhvi said he is a political secretary of the CM and handles the appointments. \"You are not the political secretary, you are a government official probably, this is what?\", the bench queried.\n\nSinghvi said he was a government servant and he has a case going on in Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) and \"I am out of service.

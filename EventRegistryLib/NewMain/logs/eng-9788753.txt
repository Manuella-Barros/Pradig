Jay's body was discovered in an area, described by police as inaccessible in mountains in north-west Tenerife, on July 15, before being airlifted out by helicopter following a 29-day search.\n\nThe apprentice bricklayer, of Oswaldtwistle, Lancs, had disappeared on June 17 after being seen leaving a rental property, named Casa Abuela Tina, in the remote village of Masca, at around 8am. Jay had partied at Papagayo nightclub in Playa de las Americas, before leaving with two British men, who drove him 20 miles to the \u00a340-a-night property.\n\nWhen he tried to walk back to his own accommodation in the south of the island - which would take around 11 hours - the following morning he made video and phone calls to close pals Brad Hargreaves and Lucy Law, who had been with him on the holiday. In what is believed to have been his final call at 8.30am, Jay told Lucy, 18, he had missed a bus, his phone battery was on 1% and he had cut his leg on a cactus.In an earlier video call, Brad, 19, witnessed Jay slip on some rocks while attempting to walk through Parque Rural de Teno nature reserve in order to reach their apartment in Los Cristianos.\n\nJay's disappearance gripped Britain for almost a month, leading to wild speculation and conspiracy theories on social media. Rumours also raged after it was claimed Jay had stolen a \u00a312,000 Rolex watch shortly before his disappearance and that he was scared as he left the rental apartment, which had been rented by convicted drug dealer Ayub Qassim and a pal calling himself \"Rocky\", who police ruled were \"irrelevant\" to their investigation.\n\nAn autopsy has since found Jay suffered multiple injuries consistent with a fall in the mountainous terrain. He is understood to have died immediately. Matt Searle, of LBT Global, the missing persons charity which helped the family repatriate Jay's body, said: \"The family of tragic Brit Jay Slater returned to the UK last week, on the same day that Jay's body was repatriated. \"A UK post mortem was ordered by the coroner, and this concluded that Jay's death was caused by traumatic head injuries, consistent with the fall from height.\"The report also highlighted that his death would have been instantaneous.\"\n\nThe family have asked for family flowers only, adding that if anyone would like to bring a single rose to place with Jay, they are more than welcome. They have requested that people donate in lieu of flowers to LBT Global via a specially built page, https://remembering-jay.raiselysite.com/\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter LANCS LIVE NEWS and

The rest of the money will go towards the cost of his repatriation, as well as costs incurred by his family and friends, who flew out to the holiday island to join the search.\n\nDebbie, 55, made the heartbreaking journey from Tenerife to Manchester Airport last week to retrieve Jay's body, alongside Jay's supportive dad Warren, 58, and Jay's brother Zak, 24. She returned home today, 19 days after Jay was found by a search team.\n\nFurther costs used by the family include accomodation, travel and other fees for them, as well as for professional searchers, including one team that flew from the Netherlands, in order to help find him.\n\nDebbie is now planning the 19-year's funeral, which it was tonight announced will be held next Saturday at Accrington Cemetery Chapel, with mourners asked to wear something blue in his memory. A touching obituary, tonight released on behalf of Jay's family, said: \"After Jay left Rhyddings High School he went on to become an apprentice bricklayer with the PH Build group, a job he greatly enjoyed.\n\n\"At the young age of five Jay started playing football for Huncoat United FC until the age of 17 and also did a few seasons with the Sunday team at St Joesph's too. He also loved spending time chilling out with his friends.\n\n\"Jay's love of music and dance started at a very young age. He loved attending music festivals and events across the country and also loved to socialise and meet new people.\n\n\"A loving son of Debbie and Warren, a cherished brother of Zak and brother in law of Jessica, a treasured grandson of Dawn, June and the late Dougie, a much loved nephew of Glen and Katie, a dear cousin of Maddie and Tillie and a loyal friend to many. Jay will be very sadly missed by all those who knew him.\"\n\nJay's body was discovered in an area, described by police as inaccessible in mountains in north-west Tenerife, on July 15, before being airlifted out by helicopter following a 29-day search. The apprentice bricklayer, of Oswaldtwistle, Lancs, had disappeared on June 17 after being seen leaving a rental property, named Casa Abuela Tina, in the remote village of Masca, at around 8am.\n\nJay had partied at Papagayo nightclub in Playa de las Americas, before leaving with two British men, who drove him 20 miles to the \u00a340-a-night property. When he tried to walk back to his own accommodation in the south of the island - which would take around 11 hours - the following morning he made video and phone calls to close pals Brad Hargreaves and Lucy Law, who had been with him on the holiday.\n\nIn what is believed to have been his final call at 8.30am, Jay told Lucy, 18, he had missed a bus, his phone battery was on 1% and he had cut his leg on a cactus.\n\nIn an earlier video call, Brad, 19, witnessed Jay slip on some rocks while attempting to walk through Parque Rural de Teno nature reserve in order to reach their apartment in Los Cristianos. Jay's disappearance gripped Britain for almost a month, leading to wild speculation and conspiracy theories on social media, including that he had been murdered by gangsters, kidnapped, taken off the island on a boat and even that he was in hiding after running up debts.\n\nRumours also raged after it was claimed Jay had stolen a \u00a312,000 Rolex watch shortly before his disappearance and that he was scared as he left the rental apartment, which had been rented by convicted drug dealer Ayub Qassim and a pal calling himself \"Rocky\", who police ruled were \"irrelevant\" to their investigation. Jay's mum Debbie also fell victim to a number of disgusting slurs, including by some who compared her to Karen Matthews, the Yorkshire mum who had faked the kidnapping of her nine-year-old daughter Shannon in 2008.\n\nAn autopsy has since found Jay suffered multiple injuries consistent with a fall in the mountainous terrain. He is understood to have died immediately.\n\nMatt Searle, of LBT Global, the missing persons charity which helped the family repatriate Jay's body, said: \"The family of tragic Brit Jay Slater returned to the UK last week, on the same day that Jay's body was repatriated. A UK post mortem was ordered by the coroner, and this concluded that Jay's death was caused by traumatic head injuries, consistent with the fall from height.\n\n\"The report also highlighted that his death would have been instantaneous.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "patrick_hill@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Patrick Hill", "type":

He also loved spending time chilling out with his friends.\n\n\"Jay's love of music and dance started at a very young age. He loved attending music festivals and events across the country and also loved to socialise and meet new people.\n\n\"A loving son of Debbie and Warren, a cherished brother of Zak and brother in law of Jessica, a treasured grandson of Dawn, June and the late Dougie, a much loved nephew of Glen and Katie, a dear cousin of Maddie and Tillie and a loyal friend to many. Jay will be very sadly missed by all those who knew him.\"\n\nDebbie has pledged to give her boy the send-off he deserves and is planning to use part of the \u00a374,156 raised by wellwishers to pay for the ceremony. The rest of the money will go towards the cost of his repatriation, as well as costs incurred by his family and friends, who flew out to the holiday island to join the search.\n\nThey include accomodation, travel and other fees for them, as well as for professional searchers, including one team that flew from the Netherlands, in order to help find him. Jay's body was discovered in an area, described by police as inaccessible in mountains in north-west Tenerife, on July 15, before being airlifted out by helicopter following a 29-day search.\n\nThe apprentice bricklayer, of Oswaldtwistle, Lancs, had disappeared on June 17 after being seen leaving a rental property, named Casa Abuela Tina, in the remote village of Masca, at around 8am. Jay had partied at Papagayo nightclub in Playa de las Americas, before leaving with two British men, who drove him 20 miles to the \u00a340-a-night property.\n\nWhen he tried to walk back to his own accommodation in the south of the island - which would take around 11 hours - the following morning he made video and phone calls to close pals Brad Hargreaves and Lucy Law, who had been with him on the holiday. In what is believed to have been his final call at 8.30am, Jay told Lucy, 18, he had missed a bus, his phone battery was on 1% and he had cut his leg on a cactus.\n\nIn an earlier video call, Brad, 19, witnessed Jay slip on some rocks while attempting to walk through Parque Rural de Teno nature reserve in order to reach their apartment in Los Cristianos. Jay's disappearance gripped Britain for almost a month, leading to wild speculation and conspiracy theories on social media, including that he had been murdered by gangsters, kidnapped, taken off the island on a boat and even that he was in hiding after running up debts.\n\nRumours also raged after it was claimed Jay had stolen a \u00a312,000 Rolex watch shortly before his disappearance and that he was scared as he left the rental apartment, which had been rented by convicted drug dealer Ayub Qassim and a pal calling himself \"Rocky\", who police ruled were \"irrelevant\" to their investigation.\n\nJay's mum Debbie also fell victim to a number of disgusting slurs, including by some who compared her to Karen Matthews, the Yorkshire mum who had faked the kidnapping of her nine-year-old daughter Shannon in 2008.\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond.

On an earlier video call, Brad, 19, had seen Jay slip on some rocks while trying to walk through Parque Rural de Teno nature reserve to reach their apartment in Los Cristianos.\n\nBack in Britain, there was speculation about Jay's disappearance, including theories he had been murdered by gangsters, kidnapped, taken off the island on a boat or even hiding from debt.\n\nThere was also a rumour that Jay had stolen a \u00a312,000 Rolex watch just before he disappeared and that he had been frightened after leaving the rental place, which had been rented by convicted drug dealer Ayub Qassim and a friend calling himself \"Rocky\". However, police ruled the pair were \"irrelevant\" to their investigation.\n\nMs Duncan was also a victim of these conspiracies, with some comparing her to Karen Mattews, the Yorkshire mum who faked the kidnapping of her nine-year-old daughter Shannon in 2008.\n\nThe family have asked for family flowers only, adding that if anyone would like to bring a single rose to place with Jay, they are more than welcome. They have requested that people donate in lieu of flowers to LBT Global via a dedicated page.\n\nGot a story? Email katherine.gray@reachplc.com.\n\nWant more from MyLondon?

A touching obituary, tonight released on behalf of Jay's family, said: \"After Jay left Rhyddings High School he went on to become an apprentice bricklayer with the PH Build group, a job he greatly enjoyed.\"\n\nAt the young age of 5 Jay started playing football for Huncoat United FC until the age of 17 and also did a few seasons with the Sunday team at St Joesph's too.\n\n\"He also loved spending time chilling out with his friends. Jay's love of music and dance started at a very young age. He loved attending music festivals and events across the country and also loved to socialise and meet new people.\n\n\"A loving son of Debbie and Warren, a cherished brother of Zak and brother in law of Jessica, a treasured grandson of Dawn, June and the late Dougie, a much loved nephew of Glen and Katie, a dear cousin of Maddie and Tillie and a loyal friend to many. Jay will be very sadly missed by all those who knew him.\"\n\nDebbie has pledged to give her boy the send-off he deserves and is planning to use part of the \u00a374,156 raised by wellwishers to pay for the ceremony.\n\nThe rest of the money will go towards the cost of his repatriation, as well as costs incurred by his family and friends, who flew out to the holiday island to join the search.\n\nThey include accomodation, travel and other fees for them, as well as for professional searchers, including one team that flew from the Netherlands, in order to help find him. Jay's body was discovered in an area, described by police as inaccessible in mountains in north-west Tenerife, on July 15, before being airlifted out by helicopter following a 29-day search.\n\nThe apprentice bricklayer, of Oswaldtwistle, Lancs, had disappeared on June 17 after being seen leaving a rental property, named Casa Abuela Tina, in the remote village of Masca, at around 8am. Jay had partied at Papagayo nightclub in Playa de las Americas, before leaving with two British men, who drove him 20 miles to the \u00a340-a-night property.\n\nWhen he tried to walk back to his own accommodation in the south of the island - which would take around 11 hours - the following morning he made video and phone calls to close pals Brad Hargreaves and Lucy Law, who had been with him on the holiday. In what is believed to have been his final call at 8.30am, Jay told Lucy, 18, he had missed a bus, his phone battery was on 1% and he had cut his leg on a cactus.In an earlier video call, Brad, 19, witnessed Jay slip on some rocks while attempting to walk through Parque Rural de Teno nature reserve in order to reach their apartment in Los Cristianos.\n\nJay's disappearance gripped Britain for almost a month, leading to wild speculation and conspiracy theories on social media, including that he had been murdered by gangsters, kidnapped, taken off the island on a boat and even that he was in hiding after running up debts. Rumours also raged after it was claimed Jay had stolen a \u00a312,000 Rolex watch shortly before his disappearance and that he was scared as he left the rental apartment, which had been rented by convicted drug dealer Ayub Qassim and a pal calling himself \"Rocky\", who police ruled were \"irrelevant\" to their investigation.\n\nJay's mum Debbie also fell victim to a number of disgusting slurs, including by some who compared her to Karen Matthews, the Yorkshire mum who had faked the kidnapping of her nine-year-old daughter Shannon in 2008. An autopsy has since found Jay suffered multiple injuries consistent with a fall in the mountainous terrain.\n\nHe is understood to have died immediately. Matt Searle, of LBT Global, the missing persons charity which helped the family repatriate Jay's body, said: \"The family of tragic Brit Jay Slater returned to the UK last week, on the same day that Jay's body was repatriated. \"A UK post mortem was ordered by the coroner, and this concluded that Jay's death was caused by traumatic head injuries, consistent with the fall from height.\"The report also highlighted that his death would have been instantaneous.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "patrick_hill@mirror.co.uk", "name":

A poignant obituary, released on behalf of Jay's family, read: \"After Jay left Rhyddings High School he went on to become an apprentice bricklayer with the PH Build group, a job he greatly enjoyed.\"\n\nThey said from the age of five Jay began playing football for Huncoat United FC until he was 17 and also spent a few seasons with the Sunday team at St Joseph's, reports the Mirror. \"He also loved spending time chilling out with his friends. Jay's love of music and dance started at a very young age. He loved attending music festivals and events across the country and also loved to socialise and meet new people.\n\nREAD MORE:Grieving mum ordered to remove baby son's headstone or see it 'discarded'\n\nREAD MORE: Residents take down fences after being threatened with court action\n\n\"A loving son of Debbie and Warren, a cherished brother of Zak and brother-in-law of Jessica, a treasured grandson of Dawn, June, and the late Dougie, a much-loved nephew of Glen and Katie, a dear cousin of Maddie and Tillie, and a loyal friend to many. Jay will be very sadly missed by all those who knew him.\"\n\nDebbie has vowed to give her son the farewell he deserves planning to use a portion of the \u00a374,156 raised by kind-hearted supporters to cover the ceremony costs. The remaining funds will be allocated towards his repatriation expenses as well as costs incurred by family and friends who travelled to the holiday island to participate in the search.\n\nThese costs encompass accommodation, travel and other fees for them as well as for professional search teams, including one that flew in from the Netherlands to assist in locating him. Jay's body was found in an area described by police as inaccessible in the mountains of north-west Tenerife on July 15 before being airlifted out by helicopter following a 29-day search.\n\nThe apprentice bricklayer from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, vanished on June 17 after being spotted leaving a rental property, known as Casa Abuela Tina, in the secluded village of Masca, at around 8am. Jay had enjoyed a night at Papagayo nightclub in Playa de las Americas before departing with two British men who drove him 20 miles to the \u00a340-a-night property.\n\nAttempting to return to his accommodation in the south of the island he made video and phone calls to close friends Brad Hargreaves and Lucy Law, who had accompanied him on the holiday. In what is thought to have been his last call at 8.30am Jay informed Lucy, 18, that he had missed a bus, his phone battery was down to 1%, and he had injured his leg on a cactus. In an earlier video call Brad, 19, saw Jay slip on some rocks while trying to navigate through Parque Rural de Teno nature reserve to get back to their apartment in Los Cristianos.\n\nJay's disappearance captivated the UK for nearly a month and sparked wild speculation and conspiracy theories on social media including suggestions that he had been murdered by gangsters, kidnapped, smuggled off the island on a boat or even that he was hiding after accumulating debts. Rumours also circulated after it was alleged that Jay had stolen a \u00a312,000 Rolex watch just before he vanished and that he was frightened as he left the rental apartment, which had been leased by convicted drug dealer Ayub Qassim and a friend known as Rocky who police declared were \"irrelevant\" to their investigation.\n\nJay's mum Debbie was subjected to a barrage of vile comments with some even comparing her to Karen Matthews, the infamous mother who staged her own daughter Shannon's kidnapping in 2008. A post-mortem examination revealed that Jay had sustained multiple injuries consistent with a fall on rugged terrain.\n\nIt is believed he died instantly. Matt Searle, from LBT Global, the charity that assisted the family in bringing Jay's body back to the UK, said: \"The family of tragic Brit Jay Slater returned to the UK last week on the same day that Jay's body was repatriated. A UK post-mortem was ordered by the coroner and this concluded that Jay's death was caused by traumatic head injuries consistent with the fall from height. The report also highlighted that his death would have been instantaneous.\"\n\nThe family has requested only family flowers at the funeral but if anyone wishes to bring a single rose to place with Jay they are welcome to do so. Instead of flowers they have asked for donations to be made to LBT Global through a dedicated page here.", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"},

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nThe autopsy results of Jay Slater, a teenager who tragically died in Tenerife, have been released, with his mother making a poignant request for those attending his funeral.\n\nJay's body was recovered on the Spanish island after an exhaustive search that lasted a month. The post-mortem examination revealed that he had sustained multiple injuries consistent with a fall in the mountainous region.\n\nRead more: Jay Slater's tragic last steps in 10 pictures\n\nHis heartbroken mother has disclosed that she has returned to the UK with his body, 19 days after it was discovered following the extensive search. Debbie Duncan, aged 55, made the sorrowful journey from Tenerife to Manchester Airport last week, accompanied by Jay's supportive father Warren, 58, and his brother Zak, 24.\n\nFurther examination confirmed that Jay had suffered numerous injuries indicative of a fall in the rugged terrain. It is believed that he died instantly, reports the Mirror.\n\nMatt Searle, from LBT Global, the charity that assisted the family in repatriating Jay's body, stated: \"The family of tragic Brit Jay Slater returned to the UK last week, on the same day that Jay's body was repatriated.\"\n\n\"A UK post mortem was ordered by the coroner, and this concluded that Jay's death was caused by traumatic head injuries, consistent with the fall from height. The report also highlighted that his death would have been instantaneous.\"\n\nRead more: 'Our hearts are broken': Heartbreak as Jay Slater's mum pays tribute to 'beautiful boy'\n\nDebbie is now organising the funeral for the 19 year old, which is scheduled to take place next Saturday at Accrington Cemetery Chapel. Attendees have been asked to wear something blue in memory of Jay.\n\nA heartfelt obituary, released on Saturday on behalf of Jay's family, read: \"After Jay left Rhyddings High School he went on to become an apprentice bricklayer with the PH Build group, a job he greatly enjoyed.\"From the tender age of 5, Jay began playing football for Huncoat United FC until he was 17 and also spent a few seasons with the Sunday team at St Joesph's. He relished chilling out with his mates.\n\n\"Jay's passion for music and dance was evident from a young age. He was a regular attendee at music festivals and events across the country and loved socialising and making new acquaintances.\n\n\"A beloved son of Debbie and Warren, a treasured brother of Zak and brother-in-law of Jessica, a cherished grandson of Dawn, June and the late Dougie, a much-loved nephew of Glen and Katie, a dear cousin of Maddie and Tillie and a loyal friend to many. Jay will be sorely missed by all who knew him.\"\n\nRead more: Jay Slater's heartbreaking vigil as tearful friends pay tribute to teen\n\nDebbie is determined to give her son the farewell he deserves and plans to use part of the \u00a374,156 raised by kind-hearted supporters to cover the ceremony costs. The remaining funds will be used towards repatriation expenses, as well as costs incurred by his family and friends, who flew to the holiday island to join the search.\n\nThese include accommodation, travel and other fees for them, as well as for professional searchers, including one team that flew in from the Netherlands, to assist in locating him. Jay's body was found in a remote area of north-west Tenerife, described by police as inaccessible, on July 15.\n\nThe discovery followed a 29-day search and his body was airlifted out by helicopter.\n\nThe apprentice bricklayer from Oswaldtwistle, Lancs, vanished on June 17 after he was seen leaving a rental property, Casa Abuela Tina, in the secluded village of Masca, around 8am. Jay had spent the night at Papagayo nightclub in Playa de las Americas before leaving with two British men who drove him 20 miles to the \u00a340-a-night accommodation.\n\nRead more: Jay Slater's family warned after internet sleuths meddle in 'unprecedented' investigation\n\nAttempting to walk back to his own lodgings in the south of the island a journey that would take approximately 11 hours the following morning, he made video and phone calls to close friends Brad Hargreaves and Lucy Law, who were also on holiday with him. In what is thought to have been his last call at 8.30am, Jay informed Lucy, 18, that he had missed a bus, his phone battery was down to 1 per cent and he had injured his leg on a cactus.\n\nDuring an earlier video call, Brad, 19, saw Jay slip on some rocks while trying to navigate through Parque Rural de Teno nature reserve to reach their apartment in Los Cristianos.\n\nJay's disappearance captivated Britain for nearly a month, sparking wild speculation and conspiracy theories on social media, including suggestions that he had been murdered by gangsters, kidnapped, transported off the island on a boat or even that he was hiding after accumulating debts. Rumours swirled following allegations that Jay had pinched a \u00a312,000 Rolex watch just before vanishing, leading to speculation he was frightened when he left the rented flat, which was under the name of convicted drug dealer Ayub Qassim and an associate known as \"Rocky\", individuals the police later dismissed as \"irrelevant\" to their inquiries.\n\nJay's mother Debbie was subjected to vile rumours, with some drawing comparisons to Karen Matthews, the notorious Yorkshire mother who staged the abduction of her nine year old daughter Shannon in 2008.\n\nGet all the latest and breaking news

Jay's love of music and dance started at a very young age. He loved attending music festivals and events across the country and also loved to socialise and meet new people.\n\n\"A loving son of Debbie and Warren, a cherished brother of Zak and brother in law of Jessica, a treasured grandson of Dawn, June and the late Dougie, a much loved nephew of Glen and Katie, a dear cousin of Maddie and Tillie and a loyal friend to many. Jay will be very sadly missed by all those who knew him.\"\n\nDebbie has vowed to give her son the farewell he deserves, planning to use a portion of the \u00a374,156 generously donated by supporters to cover the ceremony costs.\n\nThe remaining funds will be allocated towards the expenses of his repatriation, as well as costs incurred by his family and friends who travelled to the holiday island to participate in the search.\n\nThese costs include accommodation, travel and other fees for them, as well as for professional search teams, including one that flew in from the Netherlands to assist in locating him. Jay's body was found in an area described by police as inaccessible in the mountains of north-west Tenerife on July 15, before being airlifted out by helicopter following a 29-day search.\n\nJay, an apprentice bricklayer from Oswaldtwistle, Lancs, vanished on June 17 after being spotted leaving a rental property, known as Casa Abuela Tina, in the secluded village of Masca, around 8am. Prior to his disappearance, Jay had been partying at Papagayo nightclub in Playa de las Americas, before departing with two British men who drove him 20 miles to the \u00a340-a-night property.\n\nJay's mysterious disappearance had the nation on tenterhooks for nearly a month, sparking wild speculation and conspiracy theories on social media.\n\nIn what is thought to have been his last call at 8.30am, Jay told Lucy, 18, that he'd missed a bus, his phone battery was down to 1% and he'd injured his leg on a cactus. During an earlier video call, Brad, 19, saw Jay stumble on some rocks while trying to navigate through Parque Rural de Teno nature reserve to get back to their flat in Los Cristianos.\n\nAn autopsy has since found Jay suffered multiple injuries consistent with a fall in the mountainous terrain. Jay is believed to have passed away instantly.\n\nMatt Searle of LBT Global, the charity for missing persons which supported the family in bringing Jay's body back home, stated: \"The family of tragic Brit Jay Slater returned to the UK last week, on the same day that Jay's body was repatriated. A UK post mortem was ordered by the coroner, and this concluded that Jay's death was caused by traumatic head injuries, consistent with the fall from height.\n\n\"The report also highlighted that his death would have been instantaneous.\"\n\nThe family have asked for family flowers only, adding that if anyone would like to bring a single rose to place with Jay, they are more than welcome. They have requested that people donate in lieu of flowers to LBT Global via a specially built page, https://remembering-jay.raiselysite.com/.", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

obituary ahead of funeral", "body": "THE family of fallen Brit Jay Slater have revealed their heartbreaking obituary days ahead of the \"cherished\" teen's funeral.\n\nJay, 19, died on holiday in Tenerife when he fell into a treacherous ravine while attempting a massive 11-hour walk back to accommodation on his own.\n\nJay's family returned to the UK last week, on the same day his body was repatriated.\n\nNow they have released an emotional obituary, saying \"Jay will be very sadly missed by all those who knew him\".\n\nThe tribute also reads: \"After Jay left Rhyddings High School he went on to become an apprentice bricklayer with the PH Build group, a job he greatly enjoyed.\n\n\"At the young age of five Jay started playing football for Huncoat United FC until the age of 17 and also did a few seasons with the Sunday team at St Joesph's too.\n\n\"He also loved spending time chilling out with his friends.\n\n\"Jay's love of music and dance started at a very young age.\n\n\"He loved attending music festivals and events across the country and also loved to socialise and meet new people.\n\n\"A loving son of Debbie and Warren, a cherished brother of Zak and brother in law of Jessica, a treasured grandson of Dawn, June and the late Dougie, a much loved nephew of Glen and Katie, a dear cousin of Maddie and Tillie and a loyal friend to many.\"\n\nThe family has encouraged anyone attending the funeral on Saturday to wear blue and bring family flowers or single roses.\n\nIt's set to be held at the Accrington Cemetery Chapel in Lancashire at 10:30am.\n\nJay's family has launched another fundraiser via charity LBT Global, which promises to use proceeds to support families of missing people.\n\nAn LBT press release said funds will be used to help \"tackle online trolling and misinformation spreading aimed at victims and families of missing people, seen at worryingly high levels throughout Jay's case\".\n\nAn original GoFundMe fundraiser set up by Jay's pal Lucy Mae has chalked up nearly \u00a375,000 in donations.\n\nWeb bullies criticised Jay's mum Debbie and other members of the family for encouraging people to donate.\n\nFamily and friends lost contact with Jay, from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, on the morning of June 17.\n\nHe'd attended a music festival Papagayo Beach Club in south Tenerife, before heading to the mountain village of Masca with two other party-goers.\n\nThe following morning he phoned pal Lucy, telling her he was \"lost\", without water and his phone was about to die.\n\nHe was never heard from again.\n\nJay's dad Warren and brother Zak spent weeks searching the unforgiving terrain for any sign of their beloved teen.\n\nSpanish cops suspended their search, but Jay's family retraced his steps in the blistering heat for days on their own.\n\nLocal police then found Jay's body nearly a month from his disappearance on July 15.\n\nA post-mortem in the UK confirmed he died of traumatic head injuries consistent with a fall from height.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "owen_leonard@thescottishsun.co.uk", "name": "Owen Leonard",

His body was returned to the UK late last month after his body was found in a mountainous area, with his funeral set to take place this Saturday.\n\nJay's mum Debbie Duncan, 55, dad Warren, 58, and brother Zak, 24, returned home from Tenerife last week. A post mortem in the UK has since confirmed that Jay died because of traumatic head injuries, consistent with a \"fall from height\". The coroner's report said his death would have been instant.\n\nNow, it has been revealed that attendees at his funeral on August 10 will be asked to wear blue rather than the traditional black in a \"celebration of his life\". Loved ones have also asked that people donate to LBT Global, an overseas crisis support charity, instead of sending flowers.\n\nA new obituary released on behalf of Jay's family at the weekend spoke of his love of football, music, and dance. It read: \"After Jay left Rhyddings High School he went on to become an apprentice bricklayer with the PH Build group, a job he greatly enjoyed.

The rest of the money will go towards the cost of flying him back home, as well as costs incurred by his family and friends, who flew out to the holiday island to join the search.

In a heartfelt remembrance, loved ones are encouraging those attending the ceremony on August 10 to wear something blue to honour the 19-year-old's memory.\n\nRather than floral tributes, the family suggests donations to LBT Global, a charity that provided invaluable support during their harrowing time. Just last week, Jay's body was repatriated following his untimely death on June 17.\n\nPost-mortem results indicate he suffered traumatic head injuries consistent with a fall, leading to instant death. Jay, from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, disappeared June 17 while walking back to his accommodation during his first-ever holiday away without his family.\n\nA \"celebration of life service\" will hold space for mourning and memory at Accrington Cemetery Chapel before the burial. Attendees are also welcome to bring a single rose to lay with Jay, as per the family's wishes via a statement by LBT Global.\n\nRemembered lovingly as an apprentice bricklayer, Jay's obituary reads: \"A loving son of Debbie and Warren, a cherished brother of Zak and brother-in-law of Jessica, a treasured grandson of Dawn, June and the late Dougie, a much-loved nephew of Glen and Katie, a dear cousin of Maddie and Tillie and a loyal friend to many. Jay will be very sadly missed by all those who knew him.\"\n\nThe family shared: \"After Jay left Rhyddings High School he went on to become an apprentice bricklayer with the PH Build group, a job he greatly enjoyed. From the tender age of five, Jay began playing football for Huncoat United FC until he was 17 and also spent a few seasons with the Sunday team at St Joesph's too.\"\n\n\"He also relished in spending time relaxing with his mates. Jay's passion for music and dance started at a very young age. He was a regular attendee at music festivals and events across the country and loved to socialise and meet new people.\"\n\nBefore his disappearance, Jay attended the NRG music festival with two pals, and his last known location was the Rural de Teno Park in the north of the Canary Island, which was about an 11-hour walk from where he was staying.\n\nHe had journeyed to an Airbnb in Masca after a night out, but the two men alleged to have rented the property were later deemed \"not relevant\" to the case. It was suggested by the Spanish Civil Guard that Jay may have slipped and fallen in the steep and hard-to-reach area where he was discovered.", "source": {"uri": "nottinghampost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nottingham Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charlotte_smith@nottinghampost.com", "name": "Charlotte Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autopsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenerife", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tenerife"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tenerife"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dawn (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bricklayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bricklayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprenticeship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apprenticeship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Funeral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accrington", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accrington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Accrington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lancashire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lancashire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswaldtwistle", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oswaldtwistle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oswaldtwistle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhyddings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhyddings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airbnb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Guard_(Spain)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil Guard (Spain)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teno", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teno"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Teno"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huncoat", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Huncoat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Huncoat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canary Islands"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://i2-prod.nottinghampost.com/incoming/article9458896.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_01J0RDFZ5ZA3F9HPNYYD6HKN54.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788753", "eventUri": "eng-9788753", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-10", "textStart": 256, "textEnd": 265}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-17", "textStart": 547, "textEnd": 554, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

He relished attending music festivals and events across the nation, and he was always keen to socialise and make new acquaintances. Jay, the beloved son of Debbie and Warren, adored brother of Zak and brother-in-law of Jessica, treasured grandson of Dawn, June and the late Dougie, much-loved nephew of Glen and Katie, dear cousin of Maddie and Tillie, and a faithful friend to many, will be sorely missed by all who knew him.\"\n\nJay's body was found in an inaccessible mountainous area in north-west Tenerife on July 15, after a 29-day search. A post-mortem later determined Jay suffered numerous injuries indicative of a tumble in rough mountain terrain, leading experts to believe his death was instant.\n\nMatt Searle of LBT Global, the charity which supported the family in bringing Jay's remains home, said: \"The family of tragic Brit Jay Slater returned to the UK last week, on the same day that Jay's body was repatriated. A UK post-mortem was ordered by the coroner, and this concluded that Jay's death was caused by traumatic head injuries, consistent with the fall from height.\"\n\n\"The report also highlighted that his death would have been instantaneous.\"", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "patrick_hill@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "Patrick Hill", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jamie_brassington@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "Jamie Brassington", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Zoo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London Zoo"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhyddings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rhyddings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_nature_reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Local nature reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bricklayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bricklayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprenticeship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apprenticeship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accrington", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accrington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Accrington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenerife", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tenerife"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tenerife"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dawn (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coroner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autopsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huncoat", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Huncoat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Huncoat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/news/uk-news/article29571393.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_thp_5297jpg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788753", "eventUri": "eng-9788753", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-15", "textStart": 2558, "textEnd": 2565}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nThe family of British teen Jay Slater, who tragically lost his life while holidaying in Tenerife, have called for the funeral service to be a \"celebration\" of his life. In a heartfelt remembrance, loved ones are encouraging those attending the ceremony on August 10 to wear something blue to honour the 19-year-old's memory.\n\nRather than floral tributes, the family suggests donations to LBT Global, a charity that provided invaluable support during their harrowing time. Just last week, Jay's body was repatriated following his untimely death on June 17.\n\nPost-mortem results indicate he suffered traumatic head injuries consistent with a fall, leading to instant death. Jay, from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, disappeared June 17 while walking back to his accommodation during his first-ever holiday away without his family.\n\nA \"celebration of life service\" will hold space for mourning and memory at Accrington Cemetery Chapel before the burial. Attendees are also welcome to bring a single rose to lay with Jay, as per the family's wishes via a statement by LBT Global.\n\nRemembered lovingly as an apprentice bricklayer, Jay's obituary reads: \"A loving son of Debbie and Warren, a cherished brother of Zak and brother-in-law of Jessica, a treasured grandson of Dawn, June and the late Dougie, a much-loved nephew of Glen and Katie, a dear cousin of Maddie and Tillie and a loyal friend to many. Jay will be very sadly missed by all those who knew him.\"\n\nThe family shared: \"After Jay left Rhyddings High School he went on to become an apprentice bricklayer with the PH Build group, a job he greatly enjoyed. From the tender age of five, Jay began playing football for Huncoat United FC until he was 17 and also spent a few seasons with the Sunday team at St Joesph's too.\"\n\n\"He also relished in spending time relaxing with his mates. Jay's passion for music and dance started at a very young age. He was a regular attendee at music festivals and events across the country and loved to socialise and meet new people.\"\n\nBefore his disappearance, Jay attended the NRG music festival with two pals, and his last known location was the Rural de Teno Park in the north of the Canary Island, which was about an 11-hour walk from where he was staying.\n\nHe had journeyed to an Airbnb in Masca after a night out, but the two men alleged to have rented the property were later deemed \"not relevant\" to the case. It was suggested by the Spanish Civil Guard that Jay may have slipped and fallen in the steep and hard-to-reach area where he was discovered.", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charlotte_smith@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "Charlotte Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenerife", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tenerife"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tenerife"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dawn (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bricklayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bricklayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Autopsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprenticeship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apprenticeship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Funeral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accrington", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accrington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Accrington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lancashire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lancashire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswaldtwistle", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oswaldtwistle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oswaldtwistle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhyddings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhyddings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airbnb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Guard_(Spain)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil Guard (Spain)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teno", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teno"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Teno"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huncoat", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Huncoat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Huncoat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canary Islands"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article29673558.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_01J2V51BRX0PW474DPMT3P2DRS.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788753", "eventUri": "eng-9788753", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-10", "textStart": 400, "textEnd": 409}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-17", "textStart": 691, "textEnd": 698, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nThe family of British teenager Jay Slater, who tragically passed away while on holiday in Tenerife, have announced that his funeral service will be a \"celebration\" of his life. Those attending the service on August 10 are requested to wear something blue in his memory.\n\nInstead of flowers, the family has asked for donations to LBT Global, an overseas crisis support charity which provided invaluable assistance during their time of grief. The body of the 19 year old from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, who died on June 17, was returned to the UK last week.\n\nA post-mortem examination revealed he died of traumatic head injuries, consistent with a fall from height, and his death would have been instantaneous. The \"celebration of life service\" is set to take place at Accrington Cemetery Chapel before interment.\n\nRead more: Police respond after football fans 'singing loudly' in the North East are mistaken for 'far-right organisation' Keep up to date with all the latest breaking news and top stories from the North East with our free newsletter\n\nThe family will provide floral tributes but have invited anyone who wishes to bring a single rose to place with Jay. In a statement issued through LBT Global, they remembered Mr Slater, an apprentice bricklayer, and highlighted the significant events and passions of his life.\n\nThey said: \"A loving son of Debbie and Warren, a cherished brother of Zak and brother-in-law of Jessica, a treasured grandson of Dawn, June and the late Dougie, a much-loved nephew of Glen and Katie, a dear cousin of Maddie and Tillie and a loyal friend to many. Jay will be very sadly missed by all those who knew him.\"\n\nThe family shared: \"After Jay left Rhyddings High School he went on to become an apprentice bricklayer with the PH Build group, a job he greatly enjoyed.\"\n\n\"At the young age of five Jay started playing football for Huncoat United FC until the age of 17 and also did a few seasons with the Sunday team at St Joesph's too.\"\n\n\"He also loved spending time chilling out with his friends.\"\n\n\"Jay's love of music and dance started at a very young age. He loved attending music festivals and events across the country and also loved to socialise and meet new people.\"\n\nMr Slater had attended the NRG music festival with a couple of friends prior to his disappearance, with his last known whereabouts being the Rural de Teno Park in the north of the Canary Island, approximately an 11-hour walk from where he was staying.\n\nHe had journeyed to an Airbnb in Masca following a night out, but the two men alleged to have rented the property were later deemed \"not relevant\" to the investigation.\n\nThe Spanish Civil Guard suggested that Mr Slater may have fallen in the steep and inaccessible area where he was found.", "source": {"uri": "chroniclelive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chronicle Live"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Slater, aged 19, went missing in the Canary Islands in mid-June before being four four weeks later, after frantic searches.\n\nThe 19-year-old apprentice bricklayer was in Tenerife with pals for his first holiday abroad, and the trio - including Lucy Law and Brad Hargreaves - visited a rave before Jay went missing in a mountainous region of the European Union holiday island.\n\nJay's body was flown back to the UK last week and his funeral is set to take place on August 10.

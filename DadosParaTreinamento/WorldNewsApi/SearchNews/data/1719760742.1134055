The youngster won the nation's hearts when she appeared on the Toy Show during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and spoke about her illness, inspiring the launch of the Toy Show Appeal, which has led to millions of euros being raised for charity. She had been diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer, which led to her right leg being amputated. Taking to Instagram this week, Saoirse\u2019s mother Roseanna shared a clip of her daughter with then Late Late Show host Ryan Tubridy on that year\u2019s Toy Show. \u201cHow you made her laugh @instatubridy,\u201d she wrote, adding the hashtags \u201c12 Weeks\u201d and \u201cRemembering Sao\u00edrse\u201d. Ryan re-shared the post on his own Instagram account and said: \u201cOne of life\u2019s beautiful souls. Missed every day.\u201d On Tuesday, Roseanna marked 12 weeks since her daughter\u2019s passing by sharing a video of the pair with Sao\u00edrse\u2019s younger sister, Farrah Rose, walking hand in hand in a forest. Captioning the black and white clip, Roseanna wrote: \u201cWe\u2019ll always hold Space for you Sao\u00edrse.

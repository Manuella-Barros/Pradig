Barron \u2014 the bishop who, five years ago, first conceived of a national Eucharistic revival. After noon-hour Eucharistic adoration in downtown Rochester at the diocese\u2019s Co-Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist \u2014 which sits in the shadow of the city\u2019s famed Mayo Clinic \u2014 Bishop Barron led hundreds in a half-mile procession to the Mayo Civic Center for Mass on the day the church particularly honors the reality of transubstantiation: the bread and wine truly becoming Jesus\u2019 body and blood during Mass. \u201cWe\u2019re celebrating the Lord\u2019s presence among us in the Eucharist,\u201d Bishop Barron noted in a video posted to social media following the Mass. \u201cIt\u2019s part of this revival that we bishops started a couple years ago just to remind everybody of the centrality of the Eucharist, the importance of the Eucharist. My prayer is that the whole country is lit with a Eucharistic fire.\u201d Known especially for his evangelization ministry Word on Fire, Bishop Barron was chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops\u2019 Committee on Evangelization and Catechesis in 2019, when the Pew Research Center released a study that reported only one-third of Catholics believe the church\u2019s teaching on the Eucharist. The study prompted Bishop Barron to float the idea of the National Eucharistic Revival, and the idea took shape under his successor, Bishop Andrew H. Cozzens of Crookston, Minnesota, with the addition of the National Eucharistic Pilgrimage and its destination, the National Eucharistic Congress in Indianapolis July 17-21. In 2022, Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate revisited the topic of Catholic belief in the Eucharist with a more nuanced survey, and found almost two-thirds of Catholics believe in the Real Presence, but only 17% of Catholic adults attend Mass at least weekly. On their third week of the pilgrimage, however, the perpetual pilgrims \u2014 young adults traveling the full lengths of the four National Eucharistic Pilgrimage routes with the Eucharist \u2014 reported meeting enthusiasm at every stop since setting out from points in California, Connecticut, Minnesota and Texas May 18-19. \u201cI\u2019ve been edified by \u2026 seeing people come out in droves to see our Lord, and even seeing people on the streets who, for the first time, you can just see the wonder on their face, like \u2018what is this?\u2019 And here we are, and Jesus is able to contact these people, maybe for the first time\u201d in the Eucharist, said Blase Gebes, a perpetual pilgrim and seminarian from the Diocese of Rapid City, South Dakota, on a June 5 media call. \u201cSeeing that is a sign of hope for me, and I think the church moving forward will see a true Eucharistic revival.\u201d On the pilgrimage\u2019s eastern Seton Route, perpetual pilgrims and their chaplains spent May 30-June 3 in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, where Archbishop Nelson J. P\u00e9rez led a Corpus Christi procession through downtown Philadelphia from the Cathedral Basilica of Sts. Peter and Paul to St. Patrick\u2019s Catholic Church June 2. In his homily at the cathedral prior to the pilgrimage, Seton Route chaplain Father Roger Landry of the Diocese of Fall River, Massachusetts, pointed to St. Thomas Aquinas\u2019 liturgical sequence \u201cLauda Sion Salvatorem,\u201d which had been chanted minutes earlier before the Gospel, saying it contains the essence of that day\u2019s solemnity. \u201cWe\u2019re here today to fundamentally praise and thank Jesus Christ, our Good Shepherd, who accompanies us always in the holy Eucharist,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mystery we celebrate is so much greater than all we could ever do and say. We\u2019re called to pull out all the stops, to push ourselves way beyond our comfort zones because all our thanks, individually and combined, including all the saints that ever lived, all we can muster will be far short of what the incredible self-gift of Jesus in the holy Eucharist deserves.\u201d Two days later, the Seton pilgrims were in the Diocese of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, walking in yet another public procession. \u201cThis pilgrimage is so radical and so crazy, and I\u2019m glad that it is, because it\u2019s a witness in and of itself,\u201d Dominic Carstens, a perpetual pilgrim and student at Wyoming Catholic College, told The Catholic Witness, the diocesan newspaper. \u201cIt makes people look at us and ask, \u2018Why would they do this? Why would they give so much time and energy and sacrifice?'\u201d he said. \u201cI want them to ask those things, because then they can think for a moment and realize we\u2019re out here because the Eucharist is truly Christ. I hope they see our love for the Lord, and that love makes them want to findChrist, too.\u201d On June 5, the Seton Route pilgrims entered the Archdiocese of Baltimore, with a June 6 visit to the shrine of their route\u2019s patron, St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, in Emmitsburg, Maryland, for Mass and a solemn procession. Pilgrims on the southern Juan Diego Route marked the feast of Corpus Christi in the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston, where Cardinal Daniel N. Dinardo celebrated Mass at St. Mary\u2019s Cathedral Basilica in Galveston with a standing-room-only congregation June 2, and then led a mile-long Eucharistic procession. Though the heat and humidity were nearly unbearable, save for a Gulf breeze that occasionally blessed those walking behind the monstrance, church officials estimated nearly 1,500 participants. Block by block, the procession moved among historical homes, with residents watching from their balconies and porches. Earlier in the week, the southern route passed through Houston, home to perpetual pilgrim Camille Anigbogu. Throughout the weekend, she saw several friends and even former teachers, often unexpectedly, eliciting surprised hugs and greetings. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to be back in Houston,\u201d Anigbogu told the Texas Catholic Herald. \u201cIt reminds me of where I\u2019m coming from and all of the people who have sacrificed and loved me over the years. I\u2019m really glad that I\u2019m getting to take that with me across the U.S. with my fellow Juan Diego route teammates and all the people who I\u2019m going to encounter, all the Houston love.\u201d Following a meeting with Cardinal DiNardo, the pilgrims made for their maiden voyage on the Bolivar Ferry \u2014 a Galveston right of passage \u2014 heading for their final Texas stop June 2-3 in the Diocese of Beaumont, including adoration at its Christ Central Camp\u2019s Blessed Carlos Acutis Chapel with Bishop David L. Toups. On June 3, they crossed the border into Louisiana, journeying through the Diocese of Lake Charles before entering the Diocese of Lafayette in Louisiana June 5. On the western Serra Route, pilgrims participated in a procession through the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation June 4 in Roosevelt, Utah, part of the Diocese of Salt Lake City, and also were introduced to the area\u2019s vibrant Hispanic culture, said Maria Benes, the National Eucharistic Pilgrimage project lead for Modern Catholic Pilgrim, the Minnesota organization that partnered with the National Eucharistic Congress Inc., to create the pilgrimage. Chas Firestone East, a Serra Route perpetual pilgrim from Virginia, called the pilgrims\u2019 time with the Ute tribe a highlight of his week. He said its members used the analogy of a quilt to share \u201cthis idea \u2026 of the patchwork of this nation, and making sure there are no tears that cause the blanket to grow apart \u2014 really a good lesson on what it means to be a Christian neighbor.\u201d The Serra Route pilgrims left Utah June 4, driving through the Rocky Mountains with a June 5 stop in Steamboat Springs. They arrived in Boulder June 6 for Eucharistic adoration at the University of Colorado Boulder before heading to Arvada and Littleton June 7. After three weeks in Minnesota, the Marian route pilgrims prepared to process into Wisconsin June 7, with Bishop Barron expected to hand off the Eucharist in a monstrance to Bishop Gerard W. Battersby, who was installed as head of the Diocese of La Crosse May 20, before processing to a local arena for Mass and large revival gathering called \u201cThe Answer.\u201d On his Corpus Christi social media video, Bishop Barron asked for prayers for the upcoming National Eucharistic Congress. \u201cPray,\u201d he said, \u201cthat it gives the whole church a Eucharistic inspiration.\u201d Maria Wiering is senior writer for OSV News.

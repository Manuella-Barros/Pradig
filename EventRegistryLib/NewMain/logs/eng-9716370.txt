Flooding, rains and tornadoes were possible across portions of eastern Texas, Western Louisiana and Arkansas.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nHOUSTON (AP) -- Tropical Storm Beryl slammed into Texas on Monday, knocking out power to nearly 3 million homes and businesses and unleashing heavy rains that prompted dozens of high-water rescues. The fast-moving tempest threatened to carve a harsh path over several more states in coming days.\n\nTexas state and local officials warned it could take several days to restore power after Beryl came ashore as a Category 1 hurricane and toppled 10 transmission lines and knocked down trees that took down power lines.\n\nWithin hours, Beryl had weakened into a tropical storm, far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean last weekend. But the winds and rains of the fast-moving storm were still powerful enough to knock down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth, and strand dozens of cars on flooded roadways.\n\nAs it moved inland, the storm still threatened to spawn tornados.\n\n\"We're not past any difficult conditions,\" said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country, warning it would be a \"multiple day process to get power restored.\"\n\nHouston took a hard hit as CenterPoint Energy reported more than 2 million homes and businesses without power in and around the nation's fourth-largest city. Patrick said the company was bringing in thousands of additional workers to restore power, with top priority for places such as nursing homes and assisted living centers.\n\nAt least two people were killed when trees fell on homes, and the National Hurricane Center said damaging winds and flash flooding would continue as Beryl pushes inland. A third person, a civilian employee of the Houston Police Department, was killed when he was trapped in flood waters under a highway overpass, Houston Mayor John Whitmire said. There were no immediate reports of widespread structural damage, however.\n\nThe loss of power was an all-too familiar experience for Houston: Powerful storms had just ripped through the area in May, killing eight people, leaving nearly 1 million without power and flooding numerous streets.\n\nResidents without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in her neighborhood in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio, 67, said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nHouston and Harris County officials said power crews would be sent into the area to restore service as quickly as possible, an urgent priority for homes also left without air conditioning in the middle of summer. Temperatures, which had cooled slightly with the storm, were expected to reach back into the 90s as early as Tuesday. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory that said the area heat index could reach 105 degrees Fahrenheit (41 degrees Celsius).\n\nThe state will be ready to open cooling centers as well as food and water distribution centers, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations.\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast on Monday, reclosing streets in neighborhoods that had already been washed out by previous storms. Television stations on Monday broadcast the dramatic rescue of a man who had climbed to the roof of his pickup truck after it got trapped in fast-flowing waters. Emergency crews used an extension ladder from a fire truck to drop him a life preserver and a tether before moving him to dry land.\n\nHouston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\n\"First responders are putting their lives at risk. That's what they're trained for. It's working,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said.\n\nJavier Mejia was one of about 20 people who gathered near the pickup truck rescue site to take pictures of other submerged vehicles sitting on the flooded highway.\n\n\"If you don't have a way through, you're going to get stuck like that,\" Mejia said.\n\nHaving experienced previous storms in Houston, Mejia stocked up on food and water before Beryl hit, but forgot gas for his portable generator. He planned to spend the day looking for some.\n\n\"I don't want it to go bad,\" he said of the food, adding that if he can't find gas, \"We can just fire up the grill.\"\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents set to work chopping up knocked-down trees and big branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks.\n\nPatrick warned that flooding could last for days as rain continued to fall on already saturated ground.\n\n\"This is not a one-day event,\" he said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was getting regular updates on the storm after it made landfall, the White House said. The U.S. Coast Guard and FEMA had prepared search and rescue teams, and FEMA collected bottled water, meals, tarps and electric generators in case they are needed.\n\nSeveral companies with refineries or industrial plants in the area reported that the power disruptions necessitated the flaring of gases at the facilities.\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corp. said it conducted a \"safe combustion of excess gases\" at its Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, but did not provide information on the amount of gas flared or how long it would continue. Formosa Plastics Corporation and Freeport LNG also reported flaring related to Beryl, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\n\nCompanies have 24 hours to share emissions data after the flaring stops, a representative from the TCEQ said in an email.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nIn Louisiana, heavy bands of rain were expected all day Monday and \"the risk is going to be for that heavy rainfall and potential for flash flooding,\" National Weather Service meteorologist Donald Jones said in a Monday morning Facebook Live briefing.\n\nThe weather service in Shreveport issued tornado warnings across northwest Louisiana. The agency confirmed on social media that multiple tornados had been spotted in that corner of the state. Information on whether those weather events have caused any significant damage was not immediately available.\n\nBeryl was forecast to bring more strong rain and winds into additional states over the coming days. One of those, Missouri was already dealing with a wet summer. Heavy rains unrelated to the storm prompted several water rescues around the city of Columbia, where rivers and creeks were already high ahead of Beryl's expected arrival on Tuesday.\n\nAssociated Press reporters Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas; Corey Williams in Detroit; Julie Walker in New York; Melina Walling in Chicago; and Jeff Martin in Atlanta contributed to this report.\n\nMore from this section\n\nProNotary Announces Exciting New Partner Program\n\nKickstarter Fundraising for Jig App: Unique Experiences and Tailored At-Home Services App Project\n\nReconnect with Your Food in Andrea Kristin's Best Selling Book", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kulr8.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "juan_a_lozano@kulr8.com", "name": "Juan A.

Flooding, rains and tornadoes were possible across portions of eastern Texas, Western Louisiana and Arkansas.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nHOUSTON (AP) -- Tropical Storm Beryl slammed into Texas on Monday, knocking out power to nearly 3 million homes and businesses and unleashing heavy rains that prompted dozens of high-water rescues. The fast-moving tempest threatened to carve a harsh path over several more states in coming days.\n\nTexas state and local officials warned it could take several days to restore power after Beryl came ashore as a Category 1 hurricane and toppled 10 transmission lines and knocked down trees that took down power lines.\n\nWithin hours, Beryl had weakened into a tropical storm, far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean last weekend. But the winds and rains of the fast-moving storm were still powerful enough to knock down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth, and strand dozens of cars on flooded roadways.\n\nAs it moved inland, the storm still threatened to spawn tornados.\n\n\"We're not past any difficult conditions,\" said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country, warning it would be a \"multiple day process to get power restored.\"\n\nHouston took a hard hit as CenterPoint Energy reported more than 2 million homes and businesses without power in and around the nation's fourth-largest city. Patrick said the company was bringing in thousands of additional workers to restore power, with top priority for places such as nursing homes and assisted living centers.\n\nAt least two people were killed when trees fell on homes, and the National Hurricane Center said damaging winds and flash flooding would continue as Beryl pushes inland. A third person, a civilian employee of the Houston Police Department, was killed when he was trapped in flood waters under a highway overpass, Houston Mayor John Whitmire said. There were no immediate reports of widespread structural damage, however.\n\nThe loss of power was an all-too familiar experience for Houston: Powerful storms had just ripped through the area in May, killing eight people, leaving nearly 1 million without power and flooding numerous streets.\n\nResidents without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in her neighborhood in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio, 67, said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nHouston and Harris County officials said power crews would be sent into the area to restore service as quickly as possible, an urgent priority for homes also left without air conditioning in the middle of summer. Temperatures, which had cooled slightly with the storm, were expected to reach back into the 90s as early as Tuesday. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory that said the area heat index could reach 105 degrees Fahrenheit (41 degrees Celsius).\n\nThe state will be ready to open cooling centers as well as food and water distribution centers, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations.\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast on Monday, reclosing streets in neighborhoods that had already been washed out by previous storms. Television stations on Monday broadcast the dramatic rescue of a man who had climbed to the roof of his pickup truck after it got trapped in fast-flowing waters. Emergency crews used an extension ladder from a fire truck to drop him a life preserver and a tether before moving him to dry land.\n\nHouston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\n\"First responders are putting their lives at risk. That's what they're trained for. It's working,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said.\n\nJavier Mejia was one of about 20 people who gathered near the pickup truck rescue site to take pictures of other submerged vehicles sitting on the flooded highway.\n\n\"If you don't have a way through, you're going to get stuck like that,\" Mejia said.\n\nHaving experienced previous storms in Houston, Mejia stocked up on food and water before Beryl hit, but forgot gas for his portable generator. He planned to spend the day looking for some.\n\n\"I don't want it to go bad,\" he said of the food, adding that if he can't find gas, \"We can just fire up the grill.\"\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents set to work chopping up knocked-down trees and big branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks.\n\nPatrick warned that flooding could last for days as rain continued to fall on already saturated ground.\n\n\"This is not a one-day event,\" he said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was getting regular updates on the storm after it made landfall, the White House said. The U.S. Coast Guard and FEMA had prepared search and rescue teams, and FEMA collected bottled water, meals, tarps and electric generators in case they are needed.\n\nSeveral companies with refineries or industrial plants in the area reported that the power disruptions necessitated the flaring of gases at the facilities.\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corp. said it conducted a \"safe combustion of excess gases\" at its Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, but did not provide information on the amount of gas flared or how long it would continue. Formosa Plastics Corporation and Freeport LNG also reported flaring related to Beryl, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\n\nCompanies have 24 hours to share emissions data after the flaring stops, a representative from the TCEQ said in an email.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nIn Louisiana, heavy bands of rain were expected all day Monday and \"the risk is going to be for that heavy rainfall and potential for flash flooding,\" National Weather Service meteorologist Donald Jones said in a Monday morning Facebook Live briefing.\n\nThe weather service in Shreveport issued tornado warnings across northwest Louisiana. The agency confirmed on social media that multiple tornados had been spotted in that corner of the state. Information on whether those weather events have caused any significant damage was not immediately available.\n\nBeryl was forecast to bring more strong rain and winds into additional states over the coming days. One of those, Missouri was already dealing with a wet summer. Heavy rains unrelated to the storm prompted several water rescues around the city of Columbia, where rivers and creeks were already high ahead of Beryl's expected arrival on Tuesday.\n\nAssociated Press reporters Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas; Corey Williams in Detroit; Julie Walker in New York; Melina Walling in Chicago; and Jeff Martin in Atlanta contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@register-herald.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "juan_a_lozano@register-herald.com", "name": "Juan A.

But the winds and rains of the fast-moving storm were still powerful enough to knock down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth, and strand dozens of cars on flooded roadways.\n\nAs it moved inland, the storm still threatened to spawn tornados.\n\n\"We're not past any difficult conditions,\" said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country, warning it would be a \"multiple day process to get power restored.\"\n\nHouston took a hard hit as CentrePoint Energy reported more than two million homes and businesses without power in and around the nation's fourth-largest city. Patrick said the company was bringing in thousands of additional workers to restore power, with top priority for places such as nursing homes and assisted living centres.\n\nA tree uprooted by the effects of Hurricane Beryl lies in a lawn, Monday, July 8, 2024, in Bay City, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)\n\nAt least two people were killed when trees fell on homes, and the National Hurricane Centre said damaging winds and flash flooding would continue as Beryl pushes inland. A third person, a civilian employee of the Houston Police Department, was killed when he was trapped in flood waters under a highway overpass, Houston Mayor John Whitmire said. There were no immediate reports of widespread structural damage, however.\n\nThe loss of power was an all-too familiar experience for Houston: Powerful storms had just ripped through the area in May, killing eight people, leaving nearly 1 million without power and flooding numerous streets.\n\nResidents without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in her neighborhood in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio, 67, said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nHouston and Harris County officials said power crews would be sent into the area to restore service as quickly as possible, an urgent priority for homes also left without air conditioning in the middle of summer. Temperatures, which had cooled slightly with the storm, were expected to reach back into the 90s as early as Tuesday. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory that said the area heat index could reach 105 degrees Fahrenheit (41 degrees Celsius).\n\nThe state will be ready to open cooling centres as well as food and water distribution centres, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations.\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast on Monday, reclosing streets in neighborhoods that had already been washed out by previous storms. Television stations on Monday broadcast the dramatic rescue of a man who had climbed to the roof of his pickup truck after it got trapped in fast-flowing waters. Emergency crews used an extension ladder from a fire truck to drop him a life preserver and a tether before moving him to dry land.\n\nHouston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\n\"First responders are putting their lives at risk. That's what they're trained for. It's working,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said.\n\nJavier Mejia was one of about 20 people who gathered near the pickup truck rescue site to take pictures of other submerged vehicles sitting on the flooded highway.\n\n\"If you don't have a way through, you're going to get stuck like that,\" Mejia said.\n\nHaving experienced previous storms in Houston, Mejia stocked up on food and water before Beryl hit, but forgot gas for his portable generator. He planned to spend the day looking for some.\n\n\"I don't want it to go bad,\" he said of the food, adding that if he can't find gas, \"We can just fire up the grill.\"\n\nClyde George, left, and his son Chris George board up their home ahead of the arrival of Tropical Storm Beryl on Sunday, July 7, 2024, in Port O'Connor, Texas. (Jon Shapley/Houston Chronicle via AP)\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents set to work chopping up knocked-down trees and big branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks.\n\nPatrick warned that flooding could last for days as rain continued to fall on already saturated ground.\n\n\"This is not a one-day event,\" he said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was getting regular updates on the storm after it made landfall, the White House said. The U.S. Coast Guard and FEMA had prepared search and rescue teams, and FEMA collected bottled water, meals, tarps and electric generators in case they are needed.\n\nSeveral companies with refineries or industrial plants in the area reported that the power disruptions necessitated the flaring of gases at the facilities.\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corp. said it conducted a \"safe combustion of excess gases\" at its Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, but did not provide information on the amount of gas flared or how long it would continue. Formosa Plastics Corporation and Freeport LNG also reported flaring related to Beryl, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\n\nCompanies have 24 hours to share emissions data after the flaring stops, a representative from the TCEQ said in an email.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over US$6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nIn Louisiana, heavy bands of rain were expected all day Monday and \"the risk is going to be for that heavy rainfall and potential for flash flooding,\" National Weather Service meteorologist Donald Jones said in a Monday morning Facebook Live briefing.\n\nThe weather service in Shreveport issued tornado warnings across northwest Louisiana. The agency confirmed on social media that multiple tornados had been spotted in that corner of the state. Information on whether those weather events have caused any significant damage was not immediately available.\n\nBeryl was forecast to bring more strong rain and winds into additional states over the coming days. One of those, Missouri was already dealing with a wet summer. Heavy rains unrelated to the storm prompted several water rescues around the city of Columbia, where rivers and creeks were already high ahead of Beryl's expected arrival on Tuesday.", "source":

But the winds and rains of the fast-moving storm were still powerful enough to knock down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth, and strand dozens of cars on flooded roadways.\n\nAs it moved inland, the storm still threatened to spawn tornados.\n\n\"We're not past any difficult conditions,\" said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country, warning it would be a \"multiple day process to get power restored.\"\n\nHouston took a hard hit as CenterPoint Energy reported more than 2 million homes and businesses without power in and around the nation's fourth-largest city. Patrick said the company was bringing in thousands of additional workers to restore power, with top priority for places such as nursing homes and assisted living centers.\n\nAt least two people were killed when trees fell on homes, and the National Hurricane Center said damaging winds and flash flooding would continue as Beryl pushes inland. A third person, a civilian employee of the Houston Police Department, was killed when he was trapped in flood waters under a highway overpass, Houston Mayor John Whitmire said. There were no immediate reports of widespread structural damage, however.\n\nThe loss of power was an all-too familiar experience for Houston: Powerful storms had just ripped through the area in May, killing eight people, leaving nearly 1 million without power and flooding numerous streets.\n\nResidents without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in her neighborhood in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio, 67, said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nHouston and Harris County officials said power crews would be sent into the area to restore service as quickly as possible, an urgent priority for homes also left without air conditioning in the middle of summer. Temperatures, which had cooled slightly with the storm, were expected to reach back into the 90s as early as Tuesday. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory that said the area heat index could reach 105 degrees Fahrenheit (41 degrees Celsius).\n\nThe state will be ready to open cooling centers as well as food and water distribution centers, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations.\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast on Monday, reclosing streets in neighborhoods that had already been washed out by previous storms. Television stations on Monday broadcast the dramatic rescue of a man who had climbed to the roof of his pickup truck after it got trapped in fast-flowing waters. Emergency crews used an extension ladder from a fire truck to drop him a life preserver and a tether before moving him to dry land.\n\nHouston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\n\"First responders are putting their lives at risk. That's what they're trained for. It's working,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said.\n\nJavier Mejia was one of about 20 people who gathered near the pickup truck rescue site to take pictures of other submerged vehicles sitting on the flooded highway.\n\n\"If you don't have a way through, you're going to get stuck like that,\" Mejia said.\n\nHaving experienced previous storms in Houston, Mejia stocked up on food and water before Beryl hit, but forgot gas for his portable generator. He planned to spend the day looking for some.\n\n\"I don't want it to go bad,\" he said of the food, adding that if he can't find gas, \"We can just fire up the grill.\"\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents set to work chopping up knocked-down trees and big branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks.\n\nPatrick warned that flooding could last for days as rain continued to fall on already saturated ground.\n\n\"This is not a one-day event,\" he said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was getting regular updates on the storm after it made landfall, the White House said. The U.S. Coast Guard and FEMA had prepared search and rescue teams, and FEMA collected bottled water, meals, tarps and electric generators in case they are needed.\n\nSeveral companies with refineries or industrial plants in the area reported that the power disruptions necessitated the flaring of gases at the facilities.\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corp. said it conducted a \"safe combustion of excess gases\" at its Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, but did not provide information on the amount of gas flared or how long it would continue.

Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country, said CenterPoint Energy was bringing in thousands of additional workers to help get the lights turned back on quicker. He said the storm toppled 10 transmission lines and that many of the outages were caused by fallen trees.\n\nBeryl sped across the Texas coast on Monday, unleashing heavy rains that prompted dozens of high-water rescues. The fast-moving tempest threatened to carve a harsh path over several more states in coming days. At least three people were killed as Beryl moved through Texas.\n\nWithin hours after Beryl swept ashore as a Category 1 hurricane, it had weakened into a tropical storm, far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean last weekend.\n\nBut the winds and rains of the fast-moving storm were still powerful enough to knock down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth and to strand dozens of cars on flooded roadways.\n\nAt least two people were killed when trees fell on homes, and the National Hurricane Center said damaging winds and flash flooding would continue as Beryl pushes inland. A third person, a civilian employee of the Houston Police Department, was killed when he was trapped in flood waters under a highway overpass, Houston Mayor John Whitmire said. There were no immediate reports of widespread structural damage, however.\n\nMore than 2.2 million homes and businesses were without power around Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city, after Beryl blew through, according to the CenterPoint Energy utility. For many, it was an all-too-familiar experience: Powerful storms had just ripped through the area in May, killing eight people, leaving nearly 1 million without power and flooding numerous streets.\n\nResidents without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in her neighborhood in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio, 67, said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nHouston and Harris County officials said power crews would be sent into the area to restore service as quickly as possible, an urgent priority for homes also left without air conditioning in the middle of summer. Temperatures, which had cooled slightly with the storm, were expected to reach back into the 90s as early as Tuesday.\n\n\"While these efforts are full steam ahead, we want residents to know and prepare for a possible multi-day power outage,\" Galveston city officials said on Facebook. \"The estimated timeline is anywhere from 72 hours to two weeks in parts of the island.\"\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast on Monday, reclosing streets in neighborhoods that had already been washed out by previous storms. Television stations on Monday broadcast the dramatic rescue of a man who had climbed to the roof of his pickup truck after it got trapped in fast-flowing waters. Emergency crews used an extension ladder from a fire truck to drop him a life preserver and a tether before moving him to dry land.\n\nHouston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\n\"First responders are putting their lives at risk. That's what they're trained for. It's working,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said.\n\nJavier Mejia was one of about 20 people who gathered near the pickup truck rescue site to take pictures of other submerged vehicles sitting on the flooded highway.\n\n\"If you don't have a way through, you're going to get stuck like that,\" Mejia said.\n\nHaving experienced previous storms in Houston, Mejia stocked up on food and water before Beryl hit, but forgot gas for his portable generator. He planned to spend the day looking for some.\n\n\"I don't want it to go bad,\" he said of the food, adding that if he can't find gas, \"We can just fire up the grill.\"\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents set to work chopping up knocked-down trees and big branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks.\n\nTwo people were killed after trees fell on their houses: a man in the Houston suburb of Humble and a woman in Harris County, authorities said. Hundreds of trees fell in the county, crushing vehicles and damaging homes, said Precinct 4 County Constable Mark Herman.\n\nPatrick warned that flooding could last for days as rain continued to fall on already saturated ground.\n\n\"This is not a one-day event,\" he said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was getting regular updates on the storm after it made landfall, the White House said. The U.S. Coast Guard and FEMA had prepared search and rescue teams, and FEMA collected bottled water, meals, tarps and electric generators in case they are needed.\n\nSeveral companies with refineries or industrial plants in the area reported that the power disruptions necessitated the flaring of gases at the facilities.\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corp. said it conducted a \"safe combustion of excess gases\" at its Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, but did not provide information on the amount of gas flared or how long it would continue. Formosa Plastics Corporation and Freeport LNG also reported flaring related to Beryl, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\n\nCompanies have 24 hours to share emissions data after the flaring stops, a representative from the TCEQ said in an email.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. The storm ripped off doors, windows and roofs with devastating winds and storm surge fueled by the Atlantic's record warmth.\n\nThree times during the week, Beryl gained 35 mph (56 kph) in wind speed in 24 hours or less, the official weather service definition of rapid intensification.\n\nBeryl's explosive growth into an unprecedented early whopper of a storm indicates the hot water of the Atlantic and Caribbean and what the Atlantic hurricane belt can expect for the rest of the storm season, experts said. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nIn Louisiana, heavy bands of rain were expected all day Monday and \"the risk is going to be for that heavy rainfall and potential for flash flooding,\" National Weather Service meteorologist Donald Jones said in a Monday morning Facebook Live briefing.\n\nMeteorologists in Louisiana are watching for lingering rainbands, which could drop copious amounts of rain wherever they materialize, as well as \"quick, spin-up tornadoes,\" said Donald Jones, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Lake Charles, Louisiana.\n\n\"It's just a matter of exactly where that's going to be,\" Jones said. \"That's very difficult to predict more than maybe an hour or so in advance.\"\n\nBeryl was forecast to bring more strong rain and winds into additional states over the coming days. One of those, Missouri was already dealing with a wet summer. Heavy rains unrelated to the storm prompted several water rescues around the city of Columbia, where rivers and creeks were already high ahead of Beryl's expected arrival on Tuesday.\n\nAssociated Press reporters Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas; Corey Williams in Detroit; Julie Walker in New York; Melina Walling in Chicago; and Jeff Martin in Atlanta contributed to this report.\n\nMore from this section\n\nKickstarter Fundraising for Jig App: Unique Experiences and Tailored At-Home Services App Project\n\nProNotary Announces Exciting New Partner Program\n\nMocPOGO Pokemon GO Hacks Updated: Fixes Failed to Detect Location Error 12", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kulr8.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "juan_a_lozano@kulr8.com", "name": "Juan A.

Costancio, 67, said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nHouston and Harris County officials said power crews would be sent into the area to restore service as quickly as possible, an urgent priority for homes also left without air conditioning in the middle of summer. Temperatures, which had cooled slightly with the storm, were expected to reach back into the 90s as early as Tuesday. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory that said the area heat index could reach 41 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe state will be ready to open cooling centres as well as food and water distribution centres, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations.\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast on Monday, reclosing streets in neighbourhoods that had already been washed out by previous storms. Television stations on Monday broadcast the dramatic rescue of a man who had climbed to the roof of his pickup truck after it got trapped in fast-flowing waters. Emergency crews used an extension ladder from a fire truck to drop him a life preserver and a tether before moving him to dry land.\n\nHouston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in flood waters.\n\n\"First responders are putting their lives at risk. That's what they're trained for. It's working,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said.\n\nJavier Mejia was one of about 20 people who gathered near the pickup truck rescue site to take pictures of other submerged vehicles sitting on the flooded highway.\n\n\"If you don't have a way through, you're going to get stuck like that,\" Mr. Mejia said.\n\nHaving experienced previous storms in Houston, Mr. Mejia stocked up on food and water before Beryl hit, but forgot gas for his portable generator. He planned to spend the day looking for some.\n\n\"I don't want it to go bad,\" he said of the food, adding that if he can't find gas, \"We can just fire up the grill.\"\n\nMany streets and neighbourhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents set to work chopping up knocked-down trees and big branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks.\n\nMr. Patrick warned that flooding could last for days as rain continued to fall on already saturated ground.\n\n\"This is not a one-day event,\" he said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was getting regular updates on the storm after it made landfall, the White House said. The U.S. Coast Guard and FEMA had prepared search and rescue teams, and FEMA collected bottled water, meals, tarps and electric generators in case they are needed.\n\nSeveral companies with refineries or industrial plants in the area reported that the power disruptions necessitated the flaring of gases at the facilities.\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corp. said it conducted a \"safe combustion of excess gases\" at its Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, but did not provide information on the amount of gas flared or how long it would continue. Formosa Plastics Corporation and Freeport LNG also reported flaring related to Beryl, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\n\nCompanies have 24 hours to share emissions data after the flaring stops, a representative from the TCEQ said in an e-mail.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4-million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nIn Louisiana, heavy bands of rain were expected all day Monday and \"the risk is going to be for that heavy rainfall and potential for flash flooding,\" National Weather Service meteorologist Donald Jones said in a Monday morning Facebook Live briefing.\n\nThe weather service in Shreveport issued tornado warnings across northwest Louisiana. The agency confirmed on social media that multiple tornadoes had been spotted in that corner of the state. Information on whether those weather events have caused any significant damage was not immediately available.\n\nBeryl was forecast to bring more strong rain and winds into additional states over the coming days. One of those, Missouri was already dealing with a wet summer. Heavy rains unrelated to the storm prompted several water rescues around the city of Columbia, where rivers and creeks were already high ahead of Beryl's expected arrival on Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "juan_a_lozano@theglobeandmail.com", "name": "Juan A.

Drone footage shows the widespread destruction in the Sargent Beach area. (CREDIT: CNN)\n\nHOUSTON (AP) -- After Hurricane Beryl slammed into Texas early Monday, knocking out power to nearly 3 million homes and businesses, unleashing heavy rain, and killing at least four people, it moved east and later weakened to a tropical depression, according to officials. The fast-moving tempest threatened to carve a harsh path over several more states in coming days.\n\nTexas state and local officials warned it could take several days to restore power after Beryl came ashore as a Category 1 hurricane and toppled 10 transmission lines and knocked down trees that took down power lines.\n\nBeryl later weakened into a tropical storm and then a tropical depression, far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean last weekend. But the winds and rains of the fast-moving storm were still powerful enough to knock down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth, and strand dozens of cars on flooded roadways.\n\nAs it moved inland, the storm threatened to spawn tornadoes and the National Weather Service confirmed on social media that tornadoes had been spotted in northeastern Louisiana. Bossier Sheriff Julian Whittington said in a Facebook post that a woman was killed in the Benton area when a tree fell on her home. The Louisiana Department of Health later confirmed the death in Bossier Parish.\n\n\"We're not past any difficult conditions,\" said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country, warning it would be a \"multiple day process to get power restored.\"\n\nHouston took a hard hit as CenterPoint Energy reported more than 2 million homes and businesses without power in and around the nation's fourth-largest city. Patrick said the company was bringing in thousands of additional workers to restore power, with top priority for places such as nursing homes and assisted living centers.\n\nAt least two people were killed when trees fell on homes, and the National Hurricane Center said damaging winds and flash flooding would continue as Beryl pushes inland. A third person, a civilian employee of the Houston Police Department, was killed when he was trapped in flood waters under a highway overpass, Houston Mayor John Whitmire said. There were no immediate reports of widespread structural damage, however.\n\nThe loss of power was an all-too familiar experience for Houston: Powerful storms had just ripped through the area in May, killing eight people, leaving nearly 1 million without power and flooding numerous streets.\n\nResidents without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in her neighborhood in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio, 67, said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nHouston and Harris County officials said power crews would be sent into the area to restore service as quickly as possible, an urgent priority for homes also left without air conditioning in the middle of summer. Temperatures, which had cooled slightly with the storm, were expected to reach back into the 90s as early as Tuesday. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory that said the area heat index could reach 105 degrees Fahrenheit (41 degrees Celsius).\n\nThe state will be ready to open cooling centers as well as food and water distribution centers, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations.\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast on Monday, reclosing streets in neighborhoods that had already been washed out by previous storms. Television stations on Monday broadcast the dramatic rescue of a man who had climbed to the roof of his pickup truck after it got trapped in fast-flowing waters.

Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country, warning it would be a \"multiple day process to get power restored.\"\n\nHouston took a hard hit as CenterPoint Energy reported more than 2 million homes and businesses without power in and around the nation's fourth-largest city.

Costancio, 67, said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nHouston and Harris County officials said power crews would be sent into the area to restore service as quickly as possible, an urgent priority for homes also left without air conditioning in the middle of summer. Temperatures, which had cooled slightly with the storm, were expected to reach back into the 90s as early as Tuesday. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory that said the area heat index could reach 105 degrees Fahrenheit (41 degrees Celsius).\n\nThe state will be ready to open cooling centers as well as food and water distribution centers, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations.\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast on Monday, reclosing streets in neighborhoods that had already been washed out by previous storms. Television stations on Monday broadcast the dramatic rescue of a man who had climbed to the roof of his pickup truck after it got trapped in fast-flowing waters. Emergency crews used an extension ladder from a fire truck to drop him a life preserver and a tether before moving him to dry land.\n\nHouston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\n\"First responders are putting their lives at risk. That's what they're trained for. It's working,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said.\n\nJavier Mejia was one of about 20 people who gathered near the pickup truck rescue site to take pictures of other submerged vehicles sitting on the flooded highway.\n\n\"If you don't have a way through, you're going to get stuck like that,\" Mejia said.\n\nHaving experienced previous storms in Houston, Mejia stocked up on food and water before Beryl hit, but forgot gas for his portable generator. He planned to spend the day looking for some.\n\n\"I don't want it to go bad,\" he said of the food, adding that if he can't find gas, \"We can just fire up the grill.\"\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents set to work chopping up knocked-down trees and big branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks.\n\nPatrick warned that flooding could last for days as rain continued to fall on already saturated ground.\n\n\"This is not a one-day event,\" he said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was getting regular updates on the storm after it made landfall, the White House said. The U.S. Coast Guard and FEMA had prepared search and rescue teams, and FEMA collected bottled water, meals, tarps and electric generators in case they are needed.\n\nSeveral companies with refineries or industrial plants in the area reported that the power disruptions necessitated the flaring of gases at the facilities.\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corp. said it conducted a \"safe combustion of excess gases\" at its Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, but did not provide information on the amount of gas flared or how long it would continue. Formosa Plastics Corporation and Freeport LNG also reported flaring related to Beryl, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\n\nCompanies have 24 hours to share emissions data after the flaring stops, a representative from the TCEQ said in an email.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nIn Louisiana, heavy bands of rain were expected all day Monday and \"the risk is going to be for that heavy rainfall and potential for flash flooding,\" National Weather Service meteorologist Donald Jones said in a Monday morning Facebook Live briefing.\n\nThe weather service in Shreveport issued tornado warnings across northwest Louisiana. The agency confirmed on social media that multiple tornadoes had been spotted in that corner of the state. Information on whether those weather events have caused any significant damage was not immediately available.\n\nBeryl was forecast to bring more strong rain and winds into additional states over the coming days. One of those, Missouri was already dealing with a wet summer. Heavy rains unrelated to the storm prompted several water rescues around the city of Columbia, where rivers and creeks were already high ahead of Beryl's expected arrival on Tuesday.", "source":

At least three people were killed as Beryl moved through Texas.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nHOUSTON (AP) -- Tropical Storm Beryl sped across the Texas coast on Monday, leaving more than 2 million people and businesses without power in the Houston area and unleashing heavy rains that prompted dozens of high-water rescues. The fast-moving tempest threatened to carve a harsh path over several more states in coming days.\n\nWithin hours after Beryl swept ashore as a Category 1 hurricane, it had weakened into a tropical storm, far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean last weekend.\n\nBut the winds and rains of the fast-moving storm were still powerful enough to knock down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth and to strand dozens of cars on flooded roadways.\n\nAt least two people were killed when trees fell on homes, and the National Hurricane Center said damaging winds and flash flooding would continue as Beryl pushes inland.

There were no immediate reports of widespread structural damage, however.\n\nMore than 2.2 million homes and businesses were without power around Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city, after Beryl blew through, according to the CenterPoint Energy utility. For many, it was an all-too-familiar experience: Powerful storms had just ripped through the area in May, killing eight people, leaving nearly 1 million without power and flooding numerous streets.\n\nResidents without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in her neighborhood in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio, 67, said already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nHouston and Harris County officials said power crews would be sent into the area to restore service as quickly as possible, an urgent priority for homes also left without air conditioning in the middle of summer. Temperatures, which had cooled slightly with the storm, were expected to reach back into the 90s as early as Tuesday.\n\n\"While these efforts are full steam ahead, we want residents to know and prepare for a possible multi-day power outage,\" Galveston city officials said on Facebook. \"The estimated timeline is anywhere from 72 hours to two weeks in parts of the island.\"\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast on Monday, reclosing streets in neighborhoods that had already been washed out by previous storms.

Hundreds of trees fell in the county, crushing vehicles and damaging homes, said Precinct 4 County Constable Mark Herman.\n\nTexas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov.

Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country, said CenterPoint Energy was bringing in thousands of additional workers to help get the lights turned back on quicker. He said the storm toppled 10 transmission lines and that many of the outages were caused by fallen trees.\n\nBeryl sped across the Texas coast on Monday, unleashing heavy rains that prompted dozens of high-water rescues. The fast-moving tempest threatened to carve a harsh path over several more states in coming days. At least three people were killed as Beryl moved through Texas.\n\nWithin hours after Beryl swept ashore as a Category 1 hurricane, it had weakened into a tropical storm, far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean last weekend.\n\nBut the winds and rains of the fast-moving storm were still powerful enough to knock down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth and to strand dozens of cars on flooded roadways.\n\nAt least two people were killed when trees fell on homes, and the National Hurricane Center said damaging winds and flash flooding would continue as Beryl pushes inland. A third person, a civilian employee of the Houston Police Department, was killed when he was trapped in flood waters under a highway overpass, Houston Mayor John Whitmire said. There were no immediate reports of widespread structural damage, however.\n\nMore than 2.2 million homes and businesses were without power around Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city, after Beryl blew through, according to the CenterPoint Energy utility. For many, it was an all-too-familiar experience: Powerful storms had just ripped through the area in May, killing eight people, leaving nearly 1 million without power and flooding numerous streets.\n\nResidents without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in her neighborhood in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio, 67, said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nHouston and Harris County officials said power crews would be sent into the area to restore service as quickly as possible, an urgent priority for homes also left without air conditioning in the middle of summer. Temperatures, which had cooled slightly with the storm, were expected to reach back into the 90s as early as Tuesday.\n\n\"While these efforts are full steam ahead, we want residents to know and prepare for a possible multi-day power outage,\" Galveston city officials said on Facebook. \"The estimated timeline is anywhere from 72 hours to two weeks in parts of the island.\"\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast on Monday, reclosing streets in neighborhoods that had already been washed out by previous storms. Television stations on Monday broadcast the dramatic rescue of a man who had climbed to the roof of his pickup truck after it got trapped in fast-flowing waters. Emergency crews used an extension ladder from a fire truck to drop him a life preserver and a tether before moving him to dry land.\n\nHouston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\n\"First responders are putting their lives at risk. That's what they're trained for. It's working,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said.\n\nJavier Mejia was one of about 20 people who gathered near the pickup truck rescue site to take pictures of other submerged vehicles sitting on the flooded highway.\n\n\"If you don't have a way through, you're going to get stuck like that,\" Mejia said.\n\nSign Up for Newsletters Email* Select Newsletters to Sign Up For News Updates Breaking News Sports Digest Obituaries and Death Notices Submit\n\nHaving experienced previous storms in Houston, Mejia stocked up on food and water before Beryl hit, but forgot gas for his portable generator. He planned to spend the day looking for some.\n\n\"I don't want it to go bad,\" he said of the food, adding that if he can't find gas, \"We can just fire up the grill.\"\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents set to work chopping up knocked-down trees and big branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks.\n\nTwo people were killed after trees fell on their houses: a man in the Houston suburb of Humble and a woman in Harris County, authorities said. Hundreds of trees fell in the county, crushing vehicles and damaging homes, said Precinct 4 County Constable Mark Herman.\n\nPatrick warned that flooding could last for days as rain continued to fall on already saturated ground.\n\n\"This is not a one-day event,\" he said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was getting regular updates on the storm after it made landfall, the White House said. The U.S. Coast Guard and FEMA had prepared search and rescue teams, and FEMA collected bottled water, meals, tarps and electric generators in case they are needed.\n\nSeveral companies with refineries or industrial plants in the area reported that the power disruptions necessitated the flaring of gases at the facilities.\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corp. said it conducted a \"safe combustion of excess gases\" at its Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, but did not provide information on the amount of gas flared or how long it would continue. Formosa Plastics Corporation and Freeport LNG also reported flaring related to Beryl, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\n\nCompanies have 24 hours to share emissions data after the flaring stops, a representative from the TCEQ said in an email.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. The storm ripped off doors, windows and roofs with devastating winds and storm surge fueled by the Atlantic's record warmth.\n\nThree times during the week, Beryl gained 35 mph in wind speed in 24 hours or less, the official weather service definition of rapid intensification.\n\nBeryl's explosive growth into an unprecedented early whopper of a storm indicates the hot water of the Atlantic and Caribbean and what the Atlantic hurricane belt can expect for the rest of the storm season, experts said. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nIn Louisiana, heavy bands of rain were expected all day Monday and \"the risk is going to be for that heavy rainfall and potential for flash flooding,\" National Weather Service meteorologist Donald Jones said in a Monday morning Facebook Live briefing.\n\nMeteorologists in Louisiana are watching for lingering rainbands, which could drop copious amounts of rain wherever they materialize, as well as \"quick, spin-up tornadoes,\" said Donald Jones, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Lake Charles, Louisiana.\n\n\"It's just a matter of exactly where that's going to be,\" Jones said. \"That's very difficult to predict more than maybe an hour or so in advance.\"\n\nBeryl was forecast to bring more strong rain and winds into additional states over the coming days. One of those, Missouri was already dealing with a wet summer. Heavy rains unrelated to the storm prompted several water rescues around the city of Columbia, where rivers and creeks were already high ahead of Beryl's expected arrival on Tuesday.", "source":

There were no immediate reports of widespread structural damage, however.\n\nThe loss of power was an all-too familiar experience for Houston: Powerful storms had just ripped through the area in May, killing eight people, leaving nearly 1 million without power and flooding numerous streets.\n\nResidents without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in her neighborhood in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio, 67, said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nHouston and Harris County officials said power crews would be sent into the area to restore service as quickly as possible, an urgent priority for homes also left without air conditioning in the middle of summer. Temperatures, which had cooled slightly with the storm, were expected to reach back into the 90s as early as Tuesday. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory that said the area heat index could reach 105 degrees Fahrenheit (41 degrees Celsius).\n\nThe state will be ready to open cooling centers as well as food and water distribution centers, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations.\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast on Monday, reclosing streets in neighborhoods that had already been washed out by previous storms. Television stations on Monday broadcast the dramatic rescue of a man who had climbed to the roof of his pickup truck after it got trapped in fast-flowing waters. Emergency crews used an extension ladder from a fire truck to drop him a life preserver and a tether before moving him to dry land.\n\nHouston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\n\"First responders are putting their lives at risk. That's what they're trained for. It's working,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said.\n\nJavier Mejia was one of about 20 people who gathered near the pickup truck rescue site to take pictures of other submerged vehicles sitting on the flooded highway.\n\n\"If you don't have a way through, you're going to get stuck like that,\" Mejia said.\n\nHaving experienced previous storms in Houston, Mejia stocked up on food and water before Beryl hit, but forgot gas for his portable generator. He planned to spend the day looking for some.\n\n\"I don't want it to go bad,\" he said of the food, adding that if he can't find gas, \"We can just fire up the grill.\"\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents set to work chopping up knocked-down trees and big branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks.\n\nPatrick warned that flooding could last for days as rain continued to fall on already saturated ground.\n\n\"This is not a one-day event,\" he said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was getting regular updates on the storm after it made landfall, the White House said. The U.S. Coast Guard and FEMA had prepared search and rescue teams, and FEMA collected bottled water, meals, tarps and electric generators in case they are needed.\n\nSeveral companies with refineries or industrial plants in the area reported that the power disruptions necessitated the flaring of gases at the facilities.\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corp. said it conducted a \"safe combustion of excess gases\" at its Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, but did not provide information on the amount of gas flared or how long it would continue. Formosa Plastics Corporation and Freeport LNG also reported flaring related to Beryl, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\n\nCompanies have 24 hours to share emissions data after the flaring stops, a representative from the TCEQ said in an email.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. The storm ripped off doors, windows and roofs with devastating winds and storm surge fueled by the Atlantic's record warmth.\n\nThree times during the week, Beryl gained 35 mph (56 kph) in wind speed in 24 hours or less, the official weather service definition of rapid intensification.\n\nBeryl's explosive growth into an unprecedented early whopper of a storm indicates the hot water of the Atlantic and Caribbean and what the Atlantic hurricane belt can expect for the rest of the storm season, experts said. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nIn Louisiana, heavy bands of rain were expected all day Monday and \"the risk is going to be for that heavy rainfall and potential for flash flooding,\" National Weather Service meteorologist Donald Jones said in a Monday morning Facebook Live briefing.\n\nThe weather service in Shreveport issued tornado warnings across northwest Louisiana. The agency confirmed on social media that multiple tornados had been spotted in that corner of the state. Information on whether those weather events have caused any significant damage was not immediately available.\n\nBeryl was forecast to bring more strong rain and winds into additional states over the coming days. One of those, Missouri was already dealing with a wet summer. Heavy rains unrelated to the storm prompted several water rescues around the city of Columbia, where rivers and creeks were already high ahead of Beryl's expected arrival on Tuesday.\n\nAssociated Press reporters Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas; Corey Williams in Detroit; Julie Walker in New York; Melina Walling in Chicago; and Jeff Martin in Atlanta contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@eagletribune.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "juan_a_lozano@eagletribune.com", "name": "Juan A.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)HOUSTON (AP) - After Tropical Storm Beryl slammed into Texas early Monday, knocking out power to nearly 3 million homes and businesses and killing several people it moved east and weakened to a tropical depression, the National Hurricane Center said Monday evening. Flooding, rains and tornadoes were possible across portions of eastern Texas, Western Louisiana and Arkansas. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below. HOUSTON (AP) - Tropical Storm Beryl slammed into Texas on Monday, knocking out power to nearly 3 million homes and businesses and unleashing heavy rains that prompted dozens of high-water rescues. The fast-moving tempest threatened to carve a harsh path over several more states in coming days. Texas state and local officials warned it could take several days to restore power after Beryl came ashore as a Category 1 hurricane and toppled 10 transmission lines and knocked down trees that took down power lines. Within hours, Beryl had weakened into a tropical storm, far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean last weekend. But the winds and rains of the fast-moving storm were still powerful enough to knock down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth, and strand dozens of cars on flooded roadways. As it moved inland, the storm still threatened to spawn tornados. \"We're not past any difficult conditions,\"\u009d said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country, warning it would be a \"\u009dmultiple day process to get power restored.\"\u009d Houston took a hard hit as CenterPoint Energy reported more than 2 million homes and businesses without power in and around the nation's fourth-largest city. Patrick said the company was bringing in thousands of additional workers to restore power, with top priority for places such as nursing homes and assisted living centers. At least two people were killed when trees fell on homes, and the National Hurricane Center said damaging winds and flash flooding would continue as Beryl pushes inland. A third person, a civilian employee of the Houston Police Department, was killed when he was trapped in flood waters under a highway overpass, Houston Mayor John Whitmire said.

The fast-moving tempest threatened to carve a harsh path over several more states in coming days.\n\nTexas state and local officials warned that it could take several days to restore power after Beryl came ashore as a Category 1 hurricane and toppled 10 transmission lines and knocked down trees that took down power lines.\n\nBeryl later weakened into a tropical storm and then a tropical depression, far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean last weekend. But the winds and rains of the fast-moving storm were still powerful enough to knock down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth, and strand dozens of cars on flooded roadways.\n\nAs it moved inland, the storm threatened to spawn tornadoes and the National Weather Service confirmed on social media that tornadoes had been spotted in northeastern Louisiana. Bossier Sheriff Julian Whittington said in a Facebook post that a woman was killed in the Benton area when a tree fell on her home.\n\n\"We're not past any difficult conditions,\" said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country, warning that it would be a \"multiple-day process to get power restored.\"\n\nHouston took a hard hit as CenterPoint Energy reported more than 2 million homes and businesses without power in and around the nation's fourth-largest city. Patrick said the company was bringing in thousands of additional workers to restore power, with top priority for places such as nursing homes and assisted living centers.\n\nAt least two people were killed when trees fell on homes, and the National Hurricane Center said damaging winds and flash flooding would continue as Beryl pushes inland. A third person, a civilian employee of the Houston Police Department, was killed when he was trapped in flood waters under a highway overpass, Houston Mayor John Whitmire said. There were no immediate reports of widespread structural damage, however.\n\nPhoto GalleryBeryl causes damage in Texas\n\nThe loss of power was an all-too-familiar experience for Houston: Powerful storms had just ripped through the area in May, killing eight people, leaving nearly 1 million without power and flooding numerous streets.\n\nResidents without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in her neighborhood in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio, 67, said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nHouston and Harris County officials said power crews would be sent into the area to restore service as quickly as possible, an urgent priority for homes also left without air conditioning in the middle of summer. Temperatures, which had lowered slightly with the storm, were expected to climb back into the 90s as early as Tuesday. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory that said the area heat index could reach 105 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe state will be ready to open cooling centers as well as food and water distribution centers, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations.\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast Monday, reclosing streets in neighborhoods that had already been washed out by previous storms. Television stations on Monday broadcast the dramatic rescue of a man who had climbed to the roof of his pickup after it got trapped in fast-flowing waters. Emergency crews used an extension ladder from a fire truck to drop him a life preserver and a tether before moving him to dry land.\n\nHouston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents set to work chopping up knocked-down trees and big branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks.\n\nPatrick warned that flooding could last for days as rain continued to fall on already saturated ground.\n\n\"This is not a one-day event,\" he said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was getting regular updates on the storm after it made landfall, the White House said. The U.S. Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency had prepared search-and-rescue teams and collected bottled water, meals, tarps and electric generators in case they are needed.\n\nSeveral companies with refineries or industrial plants in the area reported that the power disruptions necessitated the flaring of gases at the facilities.\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corp. said it conducted a \"safe combustion of excess gases\" at its Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, but did not provide information on the amount of gas flared or how long it would continue. Formosa Plastics Corporation and Freeport LNG also reported flaring related to Beryl, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\n\nCompanies have 24 hours to share emissions data after the flaring stops, a representative from the TCEQ said in an email.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas.\n\nBeryl was forecast to bring more strong rain and winds into additional states over the coming days.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Jim Vertuno, Corey Williams, Julie Walker, Melina Walling and Jeff Martin of The Associated Press.\n\nHook Jefferson assesses damages after a tree fell on his neighbor's home after Hurricane Beryl hit the Texas coast, Monday, July 8, 2024, in Bay City, Texas.

Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country, said CenterPoint Energy was bringing in thousands of additional workers to help get the lights turned back on quicker. He said the storm toppled 10 transmission lines and that many of the outages were caused by fallen trees.\n\nBeryl sped across the Texas coast on Monday, unleashing heavy rains that prompted dozens of high-water rescues. The fast-moving tempest threatened to carve a harsh path over several more states in coming days. At least three people were killed as Beryl moved through Texas.\n\nWithin hours after Beryl swept ashore as a Category 1 hurricane, it had weakened into a tropical storm, far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean last weekend.\n\nBut the winds and rains of the fast-moving storm were still powerful enough to knock down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth and to strand dozens of cars on flooded roadways.\n\nAt least two people were killed when trees fell on homes, and the National Hurricane Center said damaging winds and flash flooding would continue as Beryl pushes inland. A third person, a civilian employee of the Houston Police Department, was killed when he was trapped in flood waters under a highway overpass, Houston Mayor John Whitmire said. There were no immediate reports of widespread structural damage, however.\n\nMore than 2.2 million homes and businesses were without power around Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city, after Beryl blew through, according to the CenterPoint Energy utility. For many, it was an all-too-familiar experience: Powerful storms had just ripped through the area in May, killing eight people, leaving nearly 1 million without power and flooding numerous streets.\n\nResidents without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in her neighborhood in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio, 67, said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nTornadoes and flash flooding were also possible in eastern Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas, the hurricane center said.\n\nIn the Texas coastal city of Freeport, Patti Richardson said she was riding out the the storm in her 123-year-old house.\n\n\"We are sitting in the middle of it. It sounds like we are in a train station, it's that loud and has been about four hours. We're just hoping everything holds together,\" Richardson said. \"You can feel the house shaking. ... It's freaky.\"\n\nMore than 1,000 flights have been canceled at Houston's two airports, according to tracking data from FlightAware.\n\nHouston and Harris County officials said power crews would be sent into the area to restore service as quickly as possible, an urgent priority for homes also left without air conditioning in the middle of summer. Temperatures, which had cooled slightly with the storm, were expected to reach back into the 90s as early as Tuesday.\n\n\"While these efforts are full steam ahead, we want residents to know and prepare for a possible multi-day power outage,\" Galveston city officials said on Facebook. \"The estimated timeline is anywhere from 72 hours to two weeks in parts of the island.\"\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast on Monday, reclosing streets in neighborhoods that had already been washed out by previous storms. Television stations on Monday broadcast the dramatic rescue of a man who had climbed to the roof of his pickup truck after it got trapped in fast-flowing waters. Emergency crews used an extension ladder from a fire truck to drop him a life preserver and a tether before moving him to dry land.\n\nHouston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\n\"First responders are putting their lives at risk. That's what they're trained for. It's working,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said.\n\nJavier Mejia was one of about 20 people who gathered near the pickup truck rescue site to take pictures of other submerged vehicles sitting on the flooded highway.\n\n\"If you don't have a way through, you're going to get stuck like that,\" Mejia said.\n\nHaving experienced previous storms in Houston, Mejia stocked up on food and water before Beryl hit, but forgot gas for his portable generator. He planned to spend the day looking for some.\n\n\"I don't want it to go bad,\" he said of the food, adding that if he can't find gas, \"We can just fire up the grill.\"\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents set to work chopping up knocked-down trees and big branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks.\n\nTwo people were killed after trees fell on their houses: a man in the Houston suburb of Humble and a woman in Harris County, authorities said. Hundreds of trees fell in the county, crushing vehicles and damaging homes, said Precinct 4 County Constable Mark Herman.\n\nPatrick warned that flooding could last for days as rain continued to fall on already saturated ground.\n\n\"This is not a one-day event,\" he said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was getting regular updates on the storm after it made landfall, the White House said. The U.S. Coast Guard and FEMA had prepared search and rescue teams, and FEMA collected bottled water, meals, tarps and electric generators in case they are needed.\n\nSeveral companies with refineries or industrial plants in the area reported that the power disruptions necessitated the flaring of gases at the facilities.\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corp. said it conducted a \"safe combustion of excess gases\" at its Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, but did not provide information on the amount of gas flared or how long it would continue. Formosa Plastics Corporation and Freeport LNG also reported flaring related to Beryl, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\n\nCompanies have 24 hours to share emissions data after the flaring stops, a representative from the TCEQ said in an email.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. The storm ripped off doors, windows and roofs with devastating winds and storm surge fueled by the Atlantic's record warmth.\n\nThree times during the week, Beryl gained 35 mph (56 kph) in wind speed in 24 hours or less, the official weather service definition of rapid intensification.\n\nBeryl's explosive growth into an unprecedented early whopper of a storm indicates the hot water of the Atlantic and Caribbean and what the Atlantic hurricane belt can expect for the rest of the storm season, experts said. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nIn Louisiana, heavy bands of rain were expected all day Monday and \"the risk is going to be for that heavy rainfall and potential for flash flooding,\" National Weather Service meteorologist Donald Jones said in a Monday morning Facebook Live briefing.\n\nMeteorologists in Louisiana are watching for lingering rainbands, which could drop copious amounts of rain wherever they materialize, as well as \"quick, spin-up tornadoes,\" said Donald Jones, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Lake Charles, Louisiana.\n\n\"It's just a matter of exactly where that's going to be,\" Jones said. \"That's very difficult to predict more than maybe an hour or so in advance.\"\n\nBeryl was forecast to bring more strong rain and winds into additional states over the coming days. One of those, Missouri was already dealing with a wet summer. Heavy rains unrelated to the storm prompted several water rescues around the city of Columbia, where rivers and creeks were already high ahead of Beryl's expected arrival on Tuesday.\n\n__", "source":

The lack of cooling to people's homes, downed power lines and non-functioning traffic lights led officials to ask residents to stay home if possible.\n\n\"Houstonians need to know we're working around the clock so you will be safe,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said Monday at a media briefing, urging residents to also know the dangers of high water, to stay hydrated and to check on their neighbors.\n\nBeryl later Monday weakened into a tropical depression with maximum wind speeds of about 35 mph (56 kph). The storm still packed a punch, and the National Weather Service confirmed on social media Monday evening that tornadoes had been spotted in northeastern Louisiana. Bossier Sheriff Julian Whittington said in a Facebook post that a woman was killed in the Benton area when a tree fell on her home.\n\nDozens of tornado warnings were issued in Louisiana and Arkansas on Monday evening and they continued into the night.\n\nWhile weakened, Beryl threatened to unleash harsh weather over several more states in coming days.\n\nTexas state and local officials warned it could take several days to fully restore power after Beryl came ashore as a Category 1 hurricane and toppled 10 transmission lines and knocked down trees that took down power lines.\n\nBeryl on Tuesday was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean last weekend. But its winds and rains were still powerful enough to knock down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth, and strand dozens of cars on flooded roadways.\n\n\"We're not past any difficult conditions,\" said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country.\n\nPatrick said CenterPoint Energy was bringing thousands of additional workers to restore power, with top priorities including nursing homes and assisted living centers.\n\nAt least two people were killed when trees fell on homes in Texas, and a third person, a civilian employee of the Houston Police Department, was killed when he was trapped in flood waters under a highway overpass, Whitmire said.\n\nThe loss of power was an all-too familiar experience for Houston: Powerful storms had just ripped through the area in May, killing eight people, leaving nearly 1 million without power and flooding numerous streets.\n\nResidents without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in her neighborhood in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg.

Temperatures in the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius) were expected Tuesday. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory that said the area heat index could reach 105 F (40.5 C).\n\nThe state was opening cooling centers as well as food and water distribution centers, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations.\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast on Monday, reclosing streets in neighborhoods that had already been washed out by previous storms.

He told the mayor his administration will make sure Texans have the resources they need to get through the storm and recovery.\n\nSeveral companies with refineries or industrial plants in the area reported that the power disruptions necessitated the flaring of gases at the facilities.\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corp. said it conducted a \"safe combustion of excess gases\" at its Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, but did not provide information on the amount of gas flared or how long it would continue. Formosa Plastics Corporation and Freeport LNG also reported flaring related to Beryl, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\n\nCompanies have 24 hours to share emissions data after the flaring stops, a representative from the TCEQ said in an email.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nBeryl was forecast to bring more strong rain and winds into additional states over the coming days. One of those, Missouri was already dealing with a wet summer. Heavy rains unrelated to the storm prompted several water rescues around the city of Columbia, where rivers and creeks were already high ahead of Beryl's expected arrival on Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas; Corey Williams in Detroit; Julie Walker in New York; Melina Walling in Chicago; Jeff Martin in Atlanta; and Sara Cline in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Flooding, rains and tornadoes were possible across portions of eastern Texas, Western Louisiana and Arkansas.\n\nBeryl slammed into Texas on Monday, knocking out power to nearly three million (30 lakh) homes and businesses and unleashing heavy rains that prompted dozens of high-water rescues. The fast-moving tempest threatened to carve a harsh path over several more states in coming days.\n\nAlso Read | US Presidential Elections 2024: Joe Biden Tells Democrats in Congress He Will Not Drop out in Race Against Donald Trump After Debate Debacle.\n\nTexas state and local officials warned it could take several days to restore power after Beryl came ashore as a Category-1 hurricane and toppled 10 transmission lines and knocked down trees that took down power lines.\n\nWithin hours, Beryl had weakened into a tropical storm, far less powerful than the Category-5 behemoth that tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean last weekend. But the winds and rains of the fast-moving storm were still powerful enough to knock down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth, and strand dozens of cars on flooded roadways.\n\nAlso Read | Layoffs 2024: US-Based Westgate Resorts Announced To Lay Off 357 Workers To Streamline Operations.\n\nAs it moved inland, the storm still threatened to spawn tornados.\n\n\"We are not past any difficult conditions,\" said Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, who is the acting governor while Governor Greg Abbott is out of the country, warning it would be a \"multiple-day process to get power restored\".\n\nHouston took a hard hit as CenterPoint Energy reported more than two million (20 lakh) homes and businesses without power in and around the nation's fourth-largest city. Patrick said the company was bringing in thousands of additional workers to restore power, with top priority for places such as nursing homes and assisted living centres.\n\nAt least two people were killed when trees fell on homes, and the National Hurricane Centre said damaging winds and flash flooding would continue as Beryl pushes inland. A third person, a civilian employee of the Houston Police Department, was killed when he was trapped in flood waters under a highway overpass, Houston Mayor John Whitmire said. There were no immediate reports of widespread structural damage, however.\n\nThe loss of power was an all-too familiar experience for Houston -- powerful storms had just ripped through the area in May, killing eight people, leaving nearly one million (10 lakh) without power and flooding numerous streets.\n\nResidents without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We have not really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in her neighbourhood in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio, 67, said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nHouston and Harris County officials said power crews would be sent into the area to restore service as quickly as possible, an urgent priority for homes also left without air conditioning in the middle of summer. Temperatures, which had cooled slightly with the storm, were expected to reach back into the 90s as early as on Tuesday. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory that said the area heat index could reach 105 degrees Fahrenheit (41 degrees Celsius).\n\nThe state will be ready to open cooling centres as well as food and water distribution centres, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations.\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast on Monday, reclosing streets in neighbourhoods that had already been washed out by previous storms. Television stations on Monday broadcast the dramatic rescue of a man who had climbed to the roof of his pickup truck after it got trapped in fast-flowing waters. Emergency crews used an extension ladder from a fire truck to drop him a life preserver and a tether before moving him to dry land.\n\nHouston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\n\"First responders are putting their lives at risk. That is what they are trained for. It is working,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said.\n\nJavier Mejia was one of about 20 people who gathered near the pickup truck rescue site to take pictures of other submerged vehicles sitting on the flooded highway.\n\n\"If you do not have a way through, you are going to get stuck like that,\" Mejia said.\n\nHaving experienced previous storms in Houston, Mejia stocked up on food and water before Beryl hit, but forgot gas for his portable generator. He planned to spend the day looking for some.\n\n\"I do not want it to go bad,\" he said of the food, adding that if he cannot find gas, \"We can just fire up the grill.\"\n\nMany streets and neighbourhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air on Monday afternoon as residents set to work chopping up knocked-down trees and big branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks.\n\nPatrick warned that flooding could last for days as rain continued to fall on already saturated ground.\n\n\"This is not a one-day event,\" he said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was getting regular updates on the storm after it made landfall, the White House said.

The lack of cooling to people's homes, downed power lines and non-functioning traffic lights led officials to ask residents to stay home if possible.\"Houstonians need to know we're working around the clock so you will be safe,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said Monday at a media briefing, urging residents to also know the dangers of high water, to stay hydrated and to check on their neighbors.Beryl later Monday weakened into a tropical depression with maximum wind speeds of about 35 mph. The storm still packed a punch, and the National Weather Service confirmed on social media Monday evening that tornadoes had been spotted in northeastern Louisiana. Bossier Sheriff Julian Whittington said in a Facebook post that a woman was killed in the Benton area when a tree fell on her home.Dozens of tornado warnings were issued in Louisiana and Arkansas on Monday evening and they continued into the night.While weakened, Beryl threatened to unleash harsh weather over several more states in coming days.Texas state and local officials warned it could take several days to fully restore power after Beryl came ashore as a Category 1 hurricane and toppled 10 transmission lines and knocked down trees that took down power lines.Beryl on Tuesday was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean last weekend.

The lack of cooling to people's homes, downed power lines and non-functioning traffic lights led officials to ask residents to stay home if possible.\n\n\"Houstonians need to know we're working around the clock so you will be safe,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said Monday at a media briefing, urging residents to also know the dangers of high water, to stay hydrated and to check on their neighbors.\n\nBeryl later Monday weakened into a tropical depression with maximum wind speeds of about 35 mph. The storm still packed a punch, and the National Weather Service confirmed on social media Monday evening that tornadoes had been spotted in northeastern Louisiana. Bossier Sheriff Julian Whittington said in a Facebook post that a woman was killed in the Benton area when a tree fell on her home.\n\nDozens of tornado warnings were issued in Louisiana and Arkansas on Monday evening and they continued into the night.\n\nWhile weakened, Beryl threatened to unleash harsh weather over several more states in coming days.\n\nTexas state and local officials warned it could take several days to fully restore power after Beryl came ashore as a Category 1 hurricane and toppled 10 transmission lines and knocked down trees that took down power lines.\n\nBeryl on Tuesday was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean last weekend.

Beryl was downgraded to a tropical storm after sweeping into Texas.\n\nHOUSTON -- Tropical Storm Beryl slammed into Texas on Monday, knocking out power to nearly 3 million homes and businesses and unleashing heavy rains that prompted dozens of high-water rescues. The fast-moving tempest threatened to carve a harsh path over several more states in coming days.\n\nTexas state and local officials warned it could take several days to restore power after Beryl came ashore as a Category 1 hurricane and toppled 10 transmission lines and knocked down trees that took down power lines.\n\nWithin hours, Beryl had weakened into a tropical storm, far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean last weekend. But the winds and rains of the fast-moving storm were still powerful enough to knock down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth, and strand dozens of cars on flooded roadways.\n\nAs it moved inland, the storm still threatened to spawn tornados.\n\n\"We're not past any difficult conditions,\" said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country, warning it would be a \"multiple-day process to get power restored.\"\n\nHouston took a hard hit: CenterPoint Energy reported more than 2 million homes and businesses without power in and around the nation's fourth-largest city. Patrick said the company was bringing in thousands of additional workers to restore power, with top priority for places such as nursing homes and assisted living centers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt least two people were killed when trees fell on homes, and the National Hurricane Center said damaging winds and flash flooding would continue as Beryl pushes inland. A third person, a civilian employee of the Houston Police Department, was killed when he was trapped in floodwaters under a highway overpass, Houston Mayor John Whitmire said. There were no immediate reports of widespread structural damage, however.\n\nA tree uprooted by the effects of Hurricane Beryl lies on a lawn Monday in Bay City, Texas. Eric Gay/Associated Press\n\nThe loss of power was an all-too familiar experience for Houston: Powerful storms just ripped through the area in May, killing eight people, leaving nearly 1 million without power and flooding numerous streets.\n\nResidents without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in her neighborhood in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio, 67, said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food, and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nHouston and Harris County officials said power crews would be sent into the area to restore service as quickly as possible, an urgent priority for homes also left without air conditioning in the middle of summer. Temperatures, which cooled slightly with the storm, were expected to reach back into the 90s as early as Tuesday. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory, saying the area heat index could reach 105 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe state will be ready to open cooling centers as well as food and water distribution centers, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations.\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast Monday, again closing streets in neighborhoods that had already been washed out by previous storms.\n\nTelevision stations broadcast the dramatic rescue of a man who had climbed to the roof of his pickup truck after it got trapped in fast-flowing waters. Emergency crews used an extension ladder from a fire truck to drop him a life preserver and a tether before moving him to dry land.\n\nHouston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\n\"First responders are putting their lives at risk. That's what they're trained for. It's working,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said.\n\nJavier Mejia was one of about 20 people who gathered near the pickup truck rescue site to take pictures of other submerged vehicles sitting on the flooded highway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If you don't have a way through, you're going to get stuck like that,\" Mejia said.\n\nHaving experienced previous storms in Houston, Mejia stocked up on food and water before Beryl hit, but he forgot gas for his portable generator. He planned to spend the day looking for some.\n\n\"I don't want it to go bad,\" he said of the food, adding that if he can't find gas, \"We can just fire up the grill.\"\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents set to work chopping up knocked-down trees and big branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks.\n\nPatrick warned that flooding could last for days as rain continued to fall on already saturated ground.\n\n\"This is not a one-day event,\" the lieutenant governor said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Biden was getting regular updates on the storm after it made landfall, the White House said. The U.S. Coast Guard and FEMA had prepared search and rescue teams, and FEMA collected bottled water, meals, tarps and electric generators in case they are needed.\n\nSeveral companies with refineries or industrial plants in the area reported that the power disruptions necessitated the flaring of gases at the facilities.\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corp. said it conducted a \"safe combustion of excess gases\" at its Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, but it did not provide information on the amount of gas flared or how long it would continue. Formosa Plastics Corporation and Freeport LNG also reported flaring related to Beryl, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\n\nCompanies have 24 hours to share emissions data after the flaring stops, a representative from the TCEQ said in an email.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. The storm ripped off doors, windows and roofs with devastating winds and storm surge fueled by the Atlantic's record warmth.\n\nThree times during the week, Beryl gained 35 mph in wind speed in 24 hours or less - the official weather service definition of rapid intensification.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeryl's explosive growth into an unprecedented early whopper of a storm indicates the hot water of the Atlantic and Caribbean and what the Atlantic hurricane belt can expect for the rest of the storm season, experts said. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nIn Louisiana, heavy bands of rain were expected all day Monday, and \"the risk is going to be for that heavy rainfall and potential for flash flooding,\" National Weather Service meteorologist Donald Jones said in a Monday morning Facebook Live briefing.\n\nThe weather service in Shreveport issued tornado warnings across northwest Louisiana. The agency confirmed on social media that multiple tornadoes had been spotted in that corner of the state. Information on whether those weather events have caused any significant damage was not immediately available.\n\nBeryl was forecast to bring more strong rain and winds into additional states over the coming days. One of those, Missouri, was already dealing with a wet summer. Heavy rains unrelated to the storm prompted several water rescues around the city of Columbia, where rivers and creeks were already high ahead of Beryl's expected arrival Tuesday.\n\nAssociated Press

LOZANO\n\nJuly 9, 2024 at 6:04 AM\n\nHOUSTON (AP) -- Power started to come back for some of the millions of homes and businesses left in the dark when Hurricane Beryl slammed into the Houston area, while the weakened storm moved east, spawning suspected tornadoes and causing more damage.\n\nBeryl was blamed for killing several people in Texas on Monday and at least one person in Louisiana, officials said.\n\nAfter a peak Monday of more than 2.7 million customers around Houston without power, the numbers improved to more than 2.4 million homes and businesses lacking electricity by Monday night, according to PowerOutage.us. The lack of cooling to people's homes, downed power lines and non-functioning traffic lights led officials to ask residents to stay home if possible.\n\n\"Houstonians need to know we're working around the clock so you will be safe,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said Monday at a media briefing, urging residents to also know the dangers of high water, to stay hydrated and to check on their neighbors.\n\nBeryl later Monday weakened into a tropical depression with maximum wind speeds of about 35 mph (56 kph). The storm still packed a punch, and the National Weather Service confirmed on social media Monday evening that tornadoes had been spotted in northeastern Louisiana. Bossier Sheriff Julian Whittington said in a Facebook post that a woman was killed in the Benton area when a tree fell on her home.\n\nDozens of tornado warnings were issued in Louisiana and Arkansas on Monday evening and they continued into the night.\n\nWhile weakened, Beryl threatened to unleash harsh weather over several more states in coming days.\n\nTexas state and local officials warned it could take several days to fully restore power after Beryl came ashore as a Category 1 hurricane and toppled 10 transmission lines and knocked down trees that took down power lines.\n\nBeryl on Tuesday was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean last weekend. But its winds and rains were still powerful enough to knock down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth, and strand dozens of cars on flooded roadways.\n\n\"We're not past any difficult conditions,\" said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country.\n\nPatrick said CenterPoint Energy was bringing thousands of additional workers to restore power, with top priorities including nursing homes and assisted living centers.\n\nAt least two people were killed when trees fell on homes in Texas, and a third person, a civilian employee of the Houston Police Department, was killed when he was trapped in flood waters under a highway overpass, Whitmire said.\n\nThe loss of power was an all-too familiar experience for Houston: Powerful storms had just ripped through the area in May, killing eight people, leaving nearly 1 million without power and flooding numerous streets.\n\nResidents without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in her neighborhood in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nPower crews were working to restore service as quickly as possible, an urgent priority for homes also left without air conditioning in the middle of summer. Temperatures in the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius) were expected Tuesday. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory that said the area heat index could reach 105 F (40.5 C).\n\nThe state was opening cooling centers as well as food and water distribution centers, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations.\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast on Monday, reclosing streets in neighborhoods that had already been washed out by previous storms. Television stations on Monday broadcast the dramatic rescue of a man who had climbed to the roof of his pickup truck after it got trapped in fast-flowing waters. Emergency crews used an extension ladder from a fire truck to drop him a life preserver and a tether before moving him to dry land.\n\nHouston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents chopped up knocked-down trees and branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks.\n\nPatrick warned that flooding could last for days as rain continued to fall on already saturated ground.\n\n\"This is not a one-day event,\" he said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was getting regular updates on the storm after it made landfall and called the Houston mayor on Monday, the White House said. He told the mayor his administration will make sure Texans have the resources they need to get through the storm and recovery.\n\nSeveral companies with refineries or industrial plants in the area reported that the power disruptions necessitated the flaring of gases at the facilities.\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corp. said it conducted a \"safe combustion of excess gases\" at its Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, but did not provide information on the amount of gas flared or how long it would continue. Formosa Plastics Corporation and Freeport LNG also reported flaring related to Beryl, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\n\nCompanies have 24 hours to share emissions data after the flaring stops, a representative from the TCEQ said in an email.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nBeryl was forecast to bring more strong rain and winds into additional states over the coming days. One of those, Missouri was already dealing with a wet summer. Heavy rains unrelated to the storm prompted several water rescues around the city of Columbia, where rivers and creeks were already high ahead of Beryl's expected arrival on Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas; Corey Williams in Detroit; Julie Walker in New York; Melina Walling in Chicago; Jeff Martin in Atlanta; and Sara Cline in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "juan_a_lozano@aol.com", "name": "Juan A.

A few tornadoes were possible from midday to the early evening in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, according to the weather service.\n\nThe weather service confirmed on social media Monday evening that tornadoes had been spotted in northeastern Louisiana. Bossier Sheriff Julian Whittington said in a Facebook post that a woman was killed in the Benton area when a tree fell on her home.\n\nTexas state and local officials warned it could take several days to fully restore power after Beryl came ashore as a Category 1 hurricane, toppled 10 transmission lines and knocked down trees that took down power lines.\n\nBeryl on Tuesday was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that earlier tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth, and strand dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\n\"We're not past any difficult conditions,\" said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country.\n\nPatrick said CenterPoint Energy was bringing thousands of additional workers to restore power, with top priorities including nursing homes and assisted living centers. CenterPoint said in an update Monday evening that it expected to restore power to 1 million customers by the end of Wednesday.\n\nAt least two people were killed when trees fell on homes in Texas, and a third person, a civilian employee of the Houston Police Department, was killed when he was trapped in floodwaters under a highway overpass, Whitmire said.\n\nThe loss of power was an all-too familiar experience for Houston. Powerful storms ripped through the area in May, killing eight people, leaving nearly 1 million without power and flooding streets.\n\nResidents without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in her neighborhood in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food, and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nThe state was opening cooling centers, as well as food and water distribution centers, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations.\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast Monday, closing streets that had already been washed out by previous storms. Houston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents chopped up knocked-down trees and branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was getting regular updates on the storm and called the Houston mayor Monday, the White House said. He told the mayor his administration will make sure Texans have resources.\n\nSeveral companies with refineries or industrial plants reported the power disruptions required the flaring of gases.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.", "source": {"uri":

LOZANO\n\nHOUSTON -- Tropical Storm Beryl slammed into Texas on Monday, knocking out power to nearly 3 million homes and businesses and unleashing heavy rains that prompted dozens of high-water rescues. The fast-moving tempest threatened to carve a harsh path over several more states in coming days.\n\nTexas state and local officials warned it could take several days to restore power after Beryl came ashore as a Category 1 hurricane and toppled 10 transmission lines and knocked down trees that took down power lines.\n\nWithin hours, Beryl had weakened into a tropical storm, far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean last weekend. But the winds and rains of the fast-moving storm were still powerful enough to knock down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth, and strand dozens of cars on flooded roadways.\n\nAs it moved inland, the storm still threatened to spawn tornados.\n\n\"We're not past any difficult conditions,\" said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country, warning it would be a \"multiple day process to get power restored.\"\n\nHouston took a hard hit as CenterPoint Energy reported more than 2 million homes and businesses without power in and around the nation's fourth-largest city. Patrick said the company was bringing in thousands of additional workers to restore power, with top priority for places such as nursing homes and assisted living centers.\n\nAt least two people were killed when trees fell on homes, and the National Hurricane Center said damaging winds and flash flooding would continue as Beryl pushes inland. A third person, a civilian employee of the Houston Police Department, was killed when he was trapped in flood waters under a highway overpass, Houston Mayor John Whitmire said. There were no immediate reports of widespread structural damage, however.\n\nThe loss of power was an all-too familiar experience for Houston: Powerful storms had just ripped through the area in May, killing eight people, leaving nearly 1 million without power and flooding numerous streets.\n\nResidents without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in her neighborhood in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio, 67, said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nHouston and Harris County officials said power crews would be sent into the area to restore service as quickly as possible, an urgent priority for homes also left without air conditioning in the middle of summer. Temperatures, which had cooled slightly with the storm, were expected to reach back into the 90s as early as Tuesday. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory that said the area heat index could reach 105 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe state will be ready to open cooling centers as well as food and water distribution centers, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations.\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast on Monday, reclosing streets in neighborhoods that had already been washed out by previous storms. Television stations on Monday broadcast the dramatic rescue of a man who had climbed to the roof of his pickup truck after it got trapped in fast-flowing waters. Emergency crews used an extension ladder from a fire truck to drop him a life preserver and a tether before moving him to dry land.\n\nHouston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\n\"First responders are putting their lives at risk. That's what they're trained for. It's working,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said.\n\nToday's Top Headlines\n\nStory continues below\n\nA good neighbor's bad decision.

He planned to spend the day looking for some.\n\n\"I don't want it to go bad,\" he said of the food, adding that if he can't find gas, \"We can just fire up the grill.\"\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents set to work chopping up knocked-down trees and big branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks.\n\nPatrick warned that flooding could last for days as rain continued to fall on already saturated ground.\n\n\"This is not a one-day event,\" he said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was getting regular updates on the storm after it made landfall, the White House said. The U.S. Coast Guard and FEMA had prepared search and rescue teams, and FEMA collected bottled water, meals, tarps and electric generators in case they are needed.\n\nSeveral companies with refineries or industrial plants in the area reported that the power disruptions necessitated the flaring of gases at the facilities.\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corp. said it conducted a \"safe combustion of excess gases\" at its Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, but did not provide information on the amount of gas flared or how long it would continue. Formosa Plastics Corporation and Freeport LNG also reported flaring related to Beryl, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\n\nCompanies have 24 hours to share emissions data after the flaring stops, a representative from the TCEQ said in an email.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. The storm ripped off doors, windows and roofs with devastating winds and storm surge fueled by the Atlantic's record warmth.\n\nThree times during the week, Beryl gained 35 mph (56 kph) in wind speed in 24 hours or less, the official weather service definition of rapid intensification.\n\nBeryl's explosive growth into an unprecedented early whopper of a storm indicates the hot water of the Atlantic and Caribbean and what the Atlantic hurricane belt can expect for the rest of the storm season, experts said. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nIn Louisiana, heavy bands of rain were expected all day Monday and \"the risk is going to be for that heavy rainfall and potential for flash flooding,\" National Weather Service meteorologist Donald Jones said in a Monday morning Facebook Live briefing.\n\nThe weather service in Shreveport issued tornado warnings across northwest Louisiana. The agency confirmed on social media that multiple tornados had been spotted in that corner of the state. Information on whether those weather events have caused any significant damage was not immediately available.\n\nBeryl was forecast to bring more strong rain and winds into additional states over the coming days. One of those, Missouri was already dealing with a wet summer. Heavy rains unrelated to the storm prompted several water rescues around the city of Columbia, where rivers and creeks were already high ahead of Beryl's expected arrival on Tuesday.", "source":

The storm still packed a punch, and the National Weather Service confirmed on social media Monday evening that tornadoes had been spotted in northeastern Louisiana. Bossier Sheriff Julian Whittington said in a Facebook post that a woman was killed in the Benton area when a tree fell on her home.\n\nDozens of tornado warnings were issued in Louisiana and Arkansas on Monday evening and they continued into the night.\n\nWhile weakened, Beryl threatened to unleash harsh weather over several more states in coming days.\n\nTexas state and local officials warned it could take several days to fully restore power after Beryl came ashore as a Category 1 hurricane and toppled 10 transmission lines and knocked down trees that took down power lines.\n\nBeryl on Tuesday was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean last weekend. But its winds and rains were still powerful enough to knock down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth, and strand dozens of cars on flooded roadways.\n\n\"We're not past any difficult conditions,\" said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country.\n\nPatrick said CenterPoint Energy was bringing thousands of additional workers to restore power, with top priorities including nursing homes and assisted living centers.\n\nAt least two people were killed when trees fell on homes in Texas, and a third person, a civilian employee of the Houston Police Department, was killed when he was trapped in flood waters under a highway overpass, Whitmire said.\n\nThe loss of power was an all-too familiar experience for Houston: Powerful storms had just ripped through the area in May, killing eight people, leaving nearly 1 million without power and flooding numerous streets.\n\nResidents without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in her neighborhood in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nPower crews were working to restore service as quickly as possible, an urgent priority for homes also left without air conditioning in the middle of summer. Temperatures in the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius) were expected Tuesday. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory that said the area heat index could reach 105 F (40.5 C).\n\nThe state was opening cooling centers as well as food and water distribution centers, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations.\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast on Monday, reclosing streets in neighborhoods that had already been washed out by previous storms. Television stations on Monday broadcast the dramatic rescue of a man who had climbed to the roof of his pickup truck after it got trapped in fast-flowing waters. Emergency crews used an extension ladder from a fire truck to drop him a life preserver and a tether before moving him to dry land.\n\nHouston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents chopped up knocked-down trees and branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks.\n\nPatrick warned that flooding could last for days as rain continued to fall on already saturated ground.\n\n\"This is not a one-day event,\" he said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was getting regular updates on the storm after it made landfall and called the Houston mayor on Monday, the White House said. He told the mayor his administration will make sure Texans have the resources they need to get through the storm and recovery.\n\nSeveral companies with refineries or industrial plants in the area reported that the power disruptions necessitated the flaring of gases at the facilities.\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corp. said it conducted a \"safe combustion of excess gases\" at its Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, but did not provide information on the amount of gas flared or how long it would continue. Formosa Plastics Corporation and Freeport LNG also reported flaring related to Beryl, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\n\nCompanies have 24 hours to share emissions data after the flaring stops, a representative from the TCEQ said in an email.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nBeryl was forecast to bring more strong rain and winds into additional states over the coming days. One of those, Missouri was already dealing with a wet summer. Heavy rains unrelated to the storm prompted several water rescues around the city of Columbia, where rivers and creeks were already high ahead of Beryl's expected arrival on Tuesday.", "source":

The lack of cooling to people\u00b4s homes, downed power lines and non-functioning traffic lights led officials to ask residents to stay home if possible.\n\n\"Houstonians need to know we\u00b4re working around the clock so you will be safe,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said Monday at a media briefing, urging residents to also know the dangers of high water, to stay hydrated and to check on their neighbors.\n\nBeryl later Monday weakened into a tropical depression with maximum wind speeds of about 35 mph (56 kph). The storm still packed a punch, and the National Weather Service confirmed on social media Monday evening that tornadoes had been spotted in northeastern Louisiana. Bossier Sheriff Julian Whittington said in a Facebook post that a woman was killed in the Benton area when a tree fell on her home.\n\nDozens of tornado warnings were issued in Louisiana and Arkansas on Monday evening and they continued into the night.\n\nAn upended tree rests on Bethel Church after Hurricane Beryl moved through the area, Monday, July 8, 2024, in Van Vleck, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)\n\nWhile weakened, Beryl threatened to unleash harsh weather over several more states in coming days.\n\nTexas state and local officials warned it could take several days to fully restore power after Beryl came ashore as a Category 1 hurricane and toppled 10 transmission lines and knocked down trees that took down power lines.\n\nBeryl on Tuesday was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean last weekend. But its winds and rains were still powerful enough to knock down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth, and strand dozens of cars on flooded roadways.\n\n\"We\u00b4re not past any difficult conditions,\" said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country.\n\nPatrick said CenterPoint Energy was bringing thousands of additional workers to restore power, with top priorities including nursing homes and assisted living centers.\n\nAt least two people were killed when trees fell on homes in Texas, and a third person, a civilian employee of the Houston Police Department, was killed when he was trapped in flood waters under a highway overpass, Whitmire said.\n\nThe loss of power was an all-too familiar experience for Houston: Powerful storms had just ripped through the area in May, killing eight people, leaving nearly 1 million without power and flooding numerous streets.\n\nResidents without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven\u00b4t really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in her neighborhood in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nPower crews were working to restore service as quickly as possible, an urgent priority for homes also left without air conditioning in the middle of summer. Temperatures in the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius) were expected Tuesday. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory that said the area heat index could reach 105 F (40.5 C).\n\nThe state was opening cooling centers as well as food and water distribution centers, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations.\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast on Monday, reclosing streets in neighborhoods that had already been washed out by previous storms. Television stations on Monday broadcast the dramatic rescue of a man who had climbed to the roof of his pickup truck after it got trapped in fast-flowing waters. Emergency crews used an extension ladder from a fire truck to drop him a life preserver and a tether before moving him to dry land.\n\nHouston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents chopped up knocked-down trees and branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks.\n\nPatrick warned that flooding could last for days as rain continued to fall on already saturated ground.\n\n\"This is not a one-day event,\" he said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was getting regular updates on the storm after it made landfall and called the Houston mayor on Monday, the White House said. He told the mayor his administration will make sure Texans have the resources they need to get through the storm and recovery.\n\nSeveral companies with refineries or industrial plants in the area reported that the power disruptions necessitated the flaring of gases at the facilities.\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corp. said it conducted a \"safe combustion of excess gases\" at its Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, but did not provide information on the amount of gas flared or how long it would continue. Formosa Plastics Corporation and Freeport LNG also reported flaring related to Beryl, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\n\nCompanies have 24 hours to share emissions data after the flaring stops, a representative from the TCEQ said in an email.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nBeryl was forecast to bring more strong rain and winds into additional states over the coming days. One of those, Missouri was already dealing with a wet summer. Heavy rains unrelated to the storm prompted several water rescues around the city of Columbia, where rivers and creeks were already high ahead of Beryl's expected arrival on Tuesday.\n\nAssociated Press reporters Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas; Corey Williams in Detroit; Julie Walker in New York; Melina Walling in Chicago; Jeff Martin in Atlanta; and Sara Cline in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, contributed to this report.\n\nJackie Jecmenek, right, talks with city worker Bobby Head as she stands in front of her neighbor's home after Beryl passed, Monday, July 8, 2024, in Bay City, Texas.

It's working,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said.\n\nJavier Mejia was one of about 20 people who gathered near the pickup truck rescue site to take pictures of other submerged vehicles sitting on the flooded highway.\n\n\"If you don't have a way through, you're going to get stuck like that,\" Mejia said.\n\nHaving experienced previous storms in Houston, Mejia stocked up on food and water before Beryl hit, but forgot gas for his portable generator. He planned to spend the day looking for some.\n\n\"I don't want it to go bad,\" he said of the food, adding that if he can't find gas, \"We can just fire up the grill.\"\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents set to work chopping up knocked-down trees and big branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks.\n\nPatrick warned that flooding could last for days as rain continued to fall on already saturated ground.\n\n\"This is not a one-day event,\" he said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was getting regular updates on the storm after it made landfall, the White House said. The U.S. Coast Guard and FEMA had prepared search and rescue teams, and FEMA collected bottled water, meals, tarps and electric generators in case they are needed.\n\nSeveral companies with refineries or industrial plants in the area reported that the power disruptions necessitated the flaring of gases at the facilities.\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corp. said it conducted a \"safe combustion of excess gases\" at its Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, but did not provide information on the amount of gas flared or how long it would continue. Formosa Plastics Corporation and Freeport LNG also reported flaring related to Beryl, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\n\nCompanies have 24 hours to share emissions data after the flaring stops, a representative from the TCEQ said in an email.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. The storm ripped off doors, windows and roofs with devastating winds and storm surge fueled by the Atlantic's record warmth.\n\nThree times during the week, Beryl gained 35 mph (56 kph) in wind speed in 24 hours or less, the official weather service definition of rapid intensification.\n\nBeryl's explosive growth into an unprecedented early whopper of a storm indicates the hot water of the Atlantic and Caribbean and what the Atlantic hurricane belt can expect for the rest of the storm season, experts said. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nIn Louisiana, heavy bands of rain were expected all day Monday and \"the risk is going to be for that heavy rainfall and potential for flash flooding,\" National Weather Service meteorologist Donald Jones said in a Monday morning Facebook Live briefing.\n\nThe weather service in Shreveport issued tornado warnings across northwest Louisiana. The agency confirmed on social media that multiple tornados had been spotted in that corner of the state. Information on whether those weather events have caused any significant damage was not immediately available.\n\nBeryl was forecast to bring more strong rain and winds into additional states over the coming days. One of those, Missouri was already dealing with a wet summer. Heavy rains unrelated to the storm prompted several water rescues around the city of Columbia, where rivers and creeks were already high ahead of Beryl's expected arrival on Tuesday.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Flooding, rains and tornadoes were possible across portions of eastern Texas, Western Louisiana and Arkansas.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nHOUSTON (AP) -- Tropical Storm Beryl slammed into Texas on Monday, knocking out power to nearly 3 million homes and businesses and unleashing heavy rains that prompted dozens of high-water rescues. The fast-moving tempest threatened to carve a harsh path over several more states in coming days.\n\nTexas state and local officials warned it could take several days to restore power after Beryl came ashore as a Category 1 hurricane and toppled 10 transmission lines and knocked down trees that took down power lines.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWithin hours, Beryl had weakened into a tropical storm, far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean last weekend. But the winds and rains of the fast-moving storm were still powerful enough to knock down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth, and strand dozens of cars on flooded roadways.\n\nAs it moved inland, the storm still threatened to spawn tornados.\n\n\"We're not past any difficult conditions,\" said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country, warning it would be a \"multiple day process to get power restored.\"\n\nHouston took a hard hit as CenterPoint Energy reported more than 2 million homes and businesses without power in and around the nation's fourth-largest city. Patrick said the company was bringing in thousands of additional workers to restore power, with top priority for places such as nursing homes and assisted living centers.\n\nAt least two people were killed when trees fell on homes, and the National Hurricane Center said damaging winds and flash flooding would continue as Beryl pushes inland. A third person, a civilian employee of the Houston Police Department, was killed when he was trapped in flood waters under a highway overpass, Houston Mayor John Whitmire said. There were no immediate reports of widespread structural damage, however.\n\nThe loss of power was an all-too familiar experience for Houston: Powerful storms had just ripped through the area in May, killing eight people, leaving nearly 1 million without power and flooding numerous streets.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nResidents without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in her neighborhood in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio, 67, said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nHouston and Harris County officials said power crews would be sent into the area to restore service as quickly as possible, an urgent priority for homes also left without air conditioning in the middle of summer. Temperatures, which had cooled slightly with the storm, were expected to reach back into the 90s as early as Tuesday. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory that said the area heat index could reach 105 degrees Fahrenheit (41 degrees Celsius).\n\nThe state will be ready to open cooling centers as well as food and water distribution centers, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations.\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast on Monday, reclosing streets in neighborhoods that had already been washed out by previous storms. Television stations on Monday broadcast the dramatic rescue of a man who had climbed to the roof of his pickup truck after it got trapped in fast-flowing waters. Emergency crews used an extension ladder from a fire truck to drop him a life preserver and a tether before moving him to dry land.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHouston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\n\"First responders are putting their lives at risk.

The widespread loss of power -- and therefore air conditioning -- could make for dangerous conditions, the National Weather Service said.\n\nMore than 2.3 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday morning, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\n\"Houstonians need to know we're working around the clock so you will be safe,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said Monday, urging residents to also know the dangers of high water, to stay hydrated and to check on their neighbors.\n\nBeryl was blamed for killing several people in Texas and at least one in Louisiana, officials said.\n\nThe storm weakened into a tropical depression after making landfall, and by Tuesday morning its center was over southwestern Arkansas, moving northeast with maximum sustained wind speeds near 30 mph (48 kph), the weather service said. Its strength wasn't expected to change much in the next day or two.\n\nBeryl still threatened to unleash more harsh weather over several other states in coming days. It is expected to bring heavy rainfall and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes on Tuesday into Wednesday, the weather service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan, and tornadoes were possible through the early morning across parts of the mid-South. A few tornadoes were possible from midday to the early evening in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, according to the weather service.\n\nThe weather service confirmed on social media Monday evening that tornadoes had been spotted in northeastern Louisiana. Bossier Sheriff Julian Whittington said in a Facebook post that a woman was killed in the Benton area when a tree fell on her home.\n\nTexas state and local officials warned it could take several days to fully restore power after Beryl came ashore as a Category 1 hurricane, toppled 10 transmission lines and knocked down trees that took down power lines.\n\nBeryl on Tuesday was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that earlier tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth, and strand dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\n\"We're not past any difficult conditions,\" said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country.\n\nPatrick said CenterPoint Energy was bringing thousands of additional workers to restore power, with top priorities including nursing homes and assisted living centers. CenterPoint said in an update Monday evening that it expected to restore power to 1 million customers by the end of Wednesday.\n\nAt least two people were killed when trees fell on homes in Texas, and a third person, a civilian employee of the Houston Police Department, was killed when he was trapped in floodwaters under a highway overpass, Whitmire said.\n\nThe loss of power was an all-too familiar experience for Houston. Powerful storms ripped through the area in May, killing eight people, leaving nearly 1 million without power and flooding streets.\n\nResidents without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in her neighborhood in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food, and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nThe state was opening cooling centers, as well as food and water distribution centers, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations.\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast Monday, closing streets that had already been washed out by previous storms. Houston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents chopped up knocked-down trees and branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was getting regular updates on the storm and called the Houston mayor Monday, the White House said. He told the mayor his administration will make sure Texans have resources.\n\nSeveral companies with refineries or industrial plants reported the power disruptions required the flaring of gases.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\n___", "source":

The widespread loss of power -- and therefore air conditioning -- could make for dangerous conditions, the National Weather Service said.\n\nMore than 2.3 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday morning, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\n\"Houstonians need to know we're working around the clock so you will be safe,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said Monday, urging residents to also know the dangers of high water, to stay hydrated, and to check on their neighbors.\n\nBeryl was blamed for killing several people in Texas and at least one in Louisiana, officials said.\n\nThe storm weakened into a tropical depression after making landfall, and by Tuesday morning its center was over southwestern Arkansas, moving northeast with maximum sustained wind speeds near 30 mph (48 kph), the weather service said. Its strength wasn't expected to change much in the next day or two.\n\nBeryl still threatened to unleash more harsh weather over several other states in the coming days. It is expected to bring heavy rainfall and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes on Tuesday into Wednesday, the weather service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan, and tornadoes were possible through the early morning across parts of the mid-South. A few tornadoes were possible from midday to the early evening in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, according to the weather service.\n\nThe weather service confirmed on social media Monday evening that tornadoes had been spotted in northeastern Louisiana. Bossier Sheriff Julian Whittington said in a Facebook post that a woman was killed in the Benton area when a tree fell on her home.\n\nTexas state and local officials warned it could take several days to fully restore power after Beryl came ashore as a Category 1 hurricane, toppled 10 transmission lines, and knocked down trees that took down power lines.\n\nBeryl on Tuesday was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that earlier tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth, and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\n\"We're not past any difficult conditions,\" said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country.\n\nPatrick said CenterPoint Energy was bringing thousands of additional workers to restore power, with top priorities including nursing homes and assisted living centers. CenterPoint said in an update Monday evening that it expected to restore power to 1 million customers by the end of Wednesday.\n\nAt least two people were killed when trees fell on homes in Texas, and a third person, a civilian employee of the Houston Police Department, was killed when he was trapped in floodwaters under a highway overpass, Whitmire said.\n\nThe loss of power was an all-too-familiar experience for Houston. Powerful storms ripped through the area in May, killing eight people, leaving nearly 1 million without power, and flooding streets.\n\nResidents without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in her neighborhood in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that the food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food, and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nThe state was opening cooling centers, as well as food and water distribution centers, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations.\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast Monday, closing streets that had already been washed out by previous storms. Houston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents chopped up knocked-down trees and branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was getting regular updates on the storm and called the Houston mayor Monday, the White House said. He told the mayor his administration would make sure Texans have resources.\n\nSeveral companies with refineries or industrial plants reported that power disruptions required the flaring of gases.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\n___\n\nContributing

The widespread loss of power, and therefore air conditioning, could make for dangerous conditions, the National Weather Service said.\n\nMore than 2.3 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday morning, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\n\"Houstonians need to know we're working around the clock so you will be safe,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said Monday, urging residents to also know the dangers of high water, to stay hydrated and to check on their neighbors.\n\nBeryl has been blamed for at least seven deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas, officials said.\n\nThe storm weakened after making landfall, and late Tuesday morning it was a post-tropical cyclone centered over northeastern Arkansas, moving northeast with maximum sustained winds near 30 mph (48 kph), the weather service said. Its strength wasn't expected to change much in the next two days.\n\nThe storm is forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the weather service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nBeryl came ashore in Texas as a Category 1 hurricane, far less powerful than the behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in saturated earth and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\nIt could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country.\n\nPowerful storms in the area in May killed eight people, left nearly 1 million without power and flooded streets. Residents now without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food, and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nThe state was opening cooling centers, as well as food and water distribution centers, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations.\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast Monday, closing streets that had already been washed out by previous storms. Houston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents chopped up knocked-down trees and branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks. Several companies with refineries or industrial plants reported the power disruptions required the flaring of gases.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\n___", "source":

Bossier Sheriff Julian Whittington said in a Facebook post that a woman was killed in the Benton area when a tree fell on her home.\n\nTexas state and local officials warned it could take several days to fully restore power after Beryl came ashore as a Category 1 hurricane, toppled 10 transmission lines and knocked down trees that took down power lines.\n\nBeryl on Tuesday was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that earlier tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean.

The widespread loss of power, and therefore air conditioning, could make for dangerous conditions, the National Weather Service said.\n\nMore than 2.3 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday morning, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\n\"Houstonians need to know we're working around the clock so you will be safe,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said Monday, urging residents to also know the dangers of high water, to stay hydrated and to check on their neighbors.\n\nBeryl has been blamed for at least seven deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas, officials said.\n\nThe storm weakened after making landfall, and by Tuesday morning it was a tropical depression centered over southwestern Arkansas, moving northeast with maximum sustained winds near 30 mph (48 kph), the weather service said. Its strength wasn't expected to change much in the next day or two.\n\nThe storm is forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the weather service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nBeryl came ashore in Texas as a Category 1 hurricane, far less powerful than the behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in saturated earth and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\nIt could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country.\n\nPowerful storms in the area in May killed eight people, left nearly 1 million without power and flooded streets. Residents now without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food, and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nThe state was opening cooling centers, as well as food and water distribution centers, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations.\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast Monday, closing streets that had already been washed out by previous storms. Houston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents chopped up knocked-down trees and branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks. Several companies with refineries or industrial plants reported the power disruptions required the flaring of gases.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\n___\n\nContributing

The fast-moving tempest threatened to carve a harsh path over several more states in coming days.\n\nWithin hours after Beryl swept ashore as a Category 1 hurricane, it had weakened into a tropical storm, far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean last weekend.\n\nBut the winds and rains of the fast-moving storm were still powerful enough to knock down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth and to strand dozens of cars on flooded roadways.\n\nAt least two people were killed when trees fell on homes, and the National Hurricane Center said damaging winds and flash flooding would continue as Beryl pushes inland. There were no immediate reports of widespread structural damage, however.\n\nMore than 2.2 million homes and businesses were without power around Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city, after Beryl blew through, according to the CenterPoint Energy utility. For many, it was an all-too-familiar experience: Powerful storms had just ripped through the area in May, killing eight people, leaving nearly 1 million without power and flooding numerous streets.\n\nResidents without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in her neighborhood in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio, 67, said already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nHouston and Harris County officials said power crews would be sent into the area to restore service as quickly as possible, an urgent priority for homes also left without air conditioning in the middle of summer. Temperatures, which had cooled slightly with the storm, were expected to reach back into the 90s as early as Tuesday.\n\n\"While these efforts are full steam ahead, we want residents to know and prepare for a possible multi-day power outage,\" Galveston city officials said on Facebook. \"The estimated timeline is anywhere from 72 hours to two weeks in parts of the island.\"\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast on Monday, reclosing streets in neighborhoods that had already been washed out by previous storms. Television stations on Monday broadcast the dramatic rescue of a man who had climbed to the roof of his pickup truck after it got trapped in fast-flowing waters. Emergency crews used an extension ladder from a fire truck to drop him a life preserver and a tether before moving him to dry land.\n\nHouston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\n\"First responders are putting their lives at risk. That's what they're trained for. It's working,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said.\n\nJavier Mejia was one of about 20 people who gathered near the pickup truck rescue site to take pictures of other submerged vehicles sitting on the flooded highway.\n\n\"If you don't have a way through, you're going to get stuck like that,\" Mejia said.\n\nHaving experienced previous storms in Houston, Mejia stocked up on food and water before Beryl hit, but forgot gas for his portable generator. He planned to spend the day looking for some.\n\n\"I don't want it to go bad,\" he said of the food, adding that if he can't find gas, \"We can just fire up the grill.\"\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents set to work chopping up knocked-down trees and big branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks.\n\nTwo people were killed after trees fell on their houses: a man in the Houston suburb of Humble and a woman in Harris County, authorities said. Hundreds of trees fell in the county, crushing vehicles and damaging homes, said Precinct 4 County Constable Mark Herman.\n\nTexas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country, warned that flooding could last for days as rain continued to fall on already saturated ground.\n\n\"This is not a one-day event,\" he said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was getting regular updates on the storm after it made landfall, the White House said. The U.S. Coast Guard and FEMA had prepared search and rescue teams, and FEMA collected bottled water, meals, tarps and electric generators in case they are needed.\n\nSeveral companies with refineries or industrial plants in the area reported that the power disruptions necessitated the flaring of gases at the facilities.\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corp. said it conducted a \"safe combustion of excess gases\" at its Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, but did not provide information on the amount of gas flared or how long it would continue. Formosa Plastics Corporation and Freeport LNG also reported flaring related to Beryl, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\n\nCompanies have 24 hours to share emissions data after the flaring stops, a representative from the TCEQ said in an email.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. The storm ripped off doors, windows and roofs with devastating winds and storm surge fueled by the Atlantic's record warmth.\n\nThree times during the week, Beryl gained 35 mph (56 kph) in wind speed in 24 hours or less, the official weather service definition of rapid intensification.\n\nBeryl's explosive growth into an unprecedented early whopper of a storm indicates the hot water of the Atlantic and Caribbean and what the Atlantic hurricane belt can expect for the rest of the storm season, experts said. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nIn Louisiana, heavy bands of rain were expected all day Monday and \"the risk is going to be for that heavy rainfall and potential for flash flooding,\" National Weather Service meteorologist Donald Jones said in a Monday morning Facebook Live briefing.\n\nMeteorologists in Louisiana are watching for lingering rainbands, which could drop copious amounts of rain wherever they materialize, as well as \"quick, spin-up tornadoes,\" said Donald Jones, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Lake Charles, Louisiana.\n\n\"It's just a matter of exactly where that's going to be,\" Jones said. \"That's very difficult to predict more than maybe an hour or so in advance.\"\n\nBeryl was forecast to bring more strong rain and winds into additional states over the coming days. One of those, Missouri was already dealing with a wet summer. Heavy rains unrelated to the storm prompted several water rescues around the city of Columbia, where rivers and creeks were already high ahead of Beryl's expected arrival on Tuesday.\n\nAssociated Press reporters Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas; Corey Williams in Detroit; Julie Walker in New York; Melina Walling in Chicago; and Jeff Martin in Atlanta contributed to this report.\n\nMore from this section\n\nReconnect with Your Food in Andrea Kristin's Best Selling Book\n\nMocPOGO Pokemon GO Hacks Updated: Fixes Failed to Detect Location Error 12\n\nProNotary Announces Exciting New Partner Program", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kulr8.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "juan_a_lozano@kulr8.com", "name": "Juan A.

The lack of cooling to people's homes, downed power lines and non-functioning traffic lights led officials to ask residents to stay home if possible.\n\nBreaking News\n\nGet the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\n\"Houstonians need to know we're working around the clock so you will be safe,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said Monday at a media briefing, urging residents to also know the dangers of high water, to stay hydrated and to check on their neighbors.\n\nBeryl later Monday weakened into a tropical depression and by Tuesday morning the weather service said it was about 95 miles (155 kilometers) north of Shreveport, Louisiana, moving northeast with maximum sustained wind speeds near 30 mph (48 kph). Its strength wasn't expected to change much in the next day or two.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile weakened, Beryl threatened to unleash more harsh weather over several other states in coming days. The storm was expected to bring heavy rainfall and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes on Tuesday into Wednesday, the weather service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan and tornadoes were possible through the early morning across parts of the Mid-South. A few tornadoes were possible from midday to the early evening in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, according to the weather service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe storm still packed a punch, and the weather service confirmed on social media Monday evening that tornadoes had been spotted in northeastern Louisiana. Bossier Sheriff Julian Whittington said in a Facebook post that a woman was killed in the Benton area when a tree fell on her home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDozens of tornado warnings were issued in Louisiana and Arkansas on Monday evening.\n\nTexas state and local officials warned it could take several days to fully restore power after Beryl came ashore as a Category 1 hurricane, toppled 10 transmission lines and knocked down trees that took down power lines.\n\nBeryl on Tuesday was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that earlier tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth, and strand dozens of cars on flooded roadways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We're not past any difficult conditions,\" said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country.\n\nPatrick said CenterPoint Energy was bringing thousands of additional workers to restore power, with top priorities including nursing homes and assisted living centers.\n\nAt least two people were killed when trees fell on homes in Texas, and a third person, a civilian employee of the Houston Police Department, was killed when he was trapped in floodwaters under a highway overpass, Whitmire said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe loss of power was an all-too familiar experience for Houston: Powerful storms had just ripped through the area in May, killing eight people, leaving nearly 1 million without power and flooding numerous streets.\n\nResidents without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in her neighborhood in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPower crews were working to restore service as quickly as possible, an urgent priority for homes also left without air conditioning in the middle of summer. Temperatures in the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius) were expected Tuesday. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory that said the area heat index could reach 105 degrees (40.5 C).\n\nThe state was opening cooling centers as well as food and water distribution centers, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations.\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast on Monday, reclosing streets in neighborhoods that had already been washed out by previous storms. Houston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents chopped up knocked-down trees and branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPatrick warned that flooding could last for days as rain continued to fall on already saturated ground.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was getting regular updates on the storm and called the Houston mayor on Monday, the White House said. He told the mayor his administration will make sure Texans have the resources they need to get through the storm and recovery.\n\nSeveral companies with refineries or industrial plants in the area reported that the power disruptions necessitated the flaring of gases at the facilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nBy MARK VANCLEAVE and JUAN A.

The widespread loss of power, and therefore air conditioning, could make for dangerous conditions, the National Weather Service said.\n\nMore than 2.3 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday morning, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\n\"Houstonians need to know we're working around the clock so you will be safe,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said Monday, urging residents to also know the dangers of high water, to stay hydrated and to check on their neighbors.\n\nBeryl has been blamed for at least seven deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas, officials said.\n\nThe storm weakened after making landfall, and by Tuesday morning it was a tropical depression centered over southwestern Arkansas, moving northeast with maximum sustained winds near 30 mph (48 kph), the weather service said. Its strength wasn't expected to change much in the next day or two.\n\nThe storm is forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the weather service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nBeryl came ashore in Texas as a Category 1 hurricane, far less powerful than the behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in saturated earth and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\nIt could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country.\n\nPowerful storms in the area in May killed eight people, left nearly 1 million without power and flooded streets. Residents now without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food, and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nThe state was opening cooling centers, as well as food and water distribution centers, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations.\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast Monday, closing streets that had already been washed out by previous storms. Houston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents chopped up knocked-down trees and branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks. Several companies with refineries or industrial plants reported the power disruptions required the flaring of gases.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.", "source": {"uri":

At midday Tuesday, it was a post-tropical cyclone centered over Arkansas and was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flooding to a swath extending to the Great Lakes and Canada.\n\nMore than 2 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday, down from a peak of more than 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nFood spoiled in listless refrigerators in neighborhoods that pined for air conditioning. Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck or gas station that had power and was open. And frustration mounted that Houston appeared to buckle under a storm not as powerful as previous ones.\n\nPatrons lined up on one block to eat at KFC, Jack in the Box or Denny's -- or just to get a few minutes in some cooler air. Dwight Yell, 54, had power at his house but took a disabled neighbor, who did not, to Denny's for some food.\n\nHe complained that city and state officials did not alert residents well enough to a storm initially projected to land much farther down the coast: \"They didn't give us enough warning, where maybe we could go get gas or prepare to go out of town if the lights go out.\"\n\nRobin Taylor, who got takeout from Denny's, was getting tired of the same old struggle. She has been living a hotel since her home was damaged by the storms in May. When Beryl hit, her hotel room flooded.\n\nShe was angry that Houston didn't appear prepared to handle the Category 1 storm after it had weathered much stronger ones in the past.\n\n\"No WiFi, no power, and it's hot outside. That's dangerous for people. That's really the big issue,\" Taylor said. \"People will die in this heat in their homes.\"\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, said at a news conference with other officials that restoring power is the No. 1 priority. And in Washington, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration. Emergency crews hope to have power restored to an additional 1 million people by the end of the day, she said.\n\nIt could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nPatrick urged utilities to restore power \"as quickly as they can.\"\n\nBeryl's strength at midday Tuesday -- with sustained winds near 30 mph -- wasn't expected to change much in the next two days. It was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into today, the National Weather Service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean.

The widespread loss of power, and therefore air conditioning, could make for dangerous conditions, the National Weather Service said.\n\nMore than 2.3 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday morning, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\n\"Houstonians need to know we're working around the clock so you will be safe,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said Monday, urging residents to also know the dangers of high water, to stay hydrated and to check on their neighbors.\n\nBeryl has been blamed for at least seven deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas, officials said.\n\nThe storm weakened after making landfall, and late Tuesday morning it was a post-tropical cyclone centered over northeastern Arkansas, moving northeast with maximum sustained winds near 30 mph (48 kph), the weather service said. Its strength wasn't expected to change much in the next two days.\n\nThe storm is forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the weather service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nBeryl came ashore in Texas as a Category 1 hurricane, far less powerful than the behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in saturated earth and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\nIt could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country.\n\nPowerful storms in the area in May killed eight people, left nearly 1 million without power and flooded streets. Residents now without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food, and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nThe state was opening cooling centers, as well as food and water distribution centers, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations.\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast Monday, closing streets that had already been washed out by previous storms. Houston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents chopped up knocked-down trees and branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks. Several companies with refineries or industrial plants reported the power disruptions required the flaring of gases.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\n___\n\nContributing

State officials were questioned whether utilities were prepared in advance, and at least one said they would withhold judgement until after the lights were turned back on.\n\nA heat advisory took effect through Wednesday in the Houston area and beyond, with temperatures expected to soar into the 90s and humidity that could make it feel as hot as 105 degrees. The National Weather Service described the conditions as potentially dangerous given the lack of power and air conditioning.\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths and at least 11 in the Caribbean. At midday Tuesday, it was a post-tropical cyclone centered over Arkansas and was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flooding to a swath extending to the Great Lakes and Canada.\n\nMore than 2 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday, down from a peak of more than 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nFood spoiled in powerless refrigerators in neighborhoods that pined for air conditioning. Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck or gas station that had power and was open.\n\nPatrons lined up on one block to eat at KFC, Jack in the Box or Denny's -- or just to get a few minutes in some cooler air.\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, said at a news conference with other officials that restoring power is the No. 1 priority. In Washington, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration.\n\nEmergency crews hoped to have power restored to an additional 1 million people by the end of the day, she said.\n\nIt could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country. Sixteen hospitals were on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nPatrick said he would evaluate later whether utilities had taken proper steps before the storm to mount a swift response.\n\nCenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, said it would bring in about 12,000 workers from around the region to help restore power. A company spokesperson said those workers weren't staged in the Houston area before the storm hit, noting that forecasts initially predicted it would go much further south.\n\nKyuta Allen brought her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet for work and the night classes she takes online.\n\n\"You can't really get a lot of stuff done when you are hot,\" she said, adding it is also hard to sleep in the heat.\n\n\"During the day you can have the doors open but at night you've got to board up and lock up -- lock yourself like into a sauna,\" she said.\n\nLesley Briones, a Harris County commissioner, who visited a community center, said she's been told of people waiting hours to get gas.\n\n\"It's catastrophic when you lose everything in your fridge and you are living check to check,\" Briones said.\n\nBeryl's strength at midday Tuesday -- with sustained winds near 30 mph -- wasn't expected to change much in the next two days. It was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry issued a state of emergency Tuesday afternoon for part of that state after trees were knocked down, homes were damaged and thousands lost power.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that already teetered in saturated earth and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\nBeryl was the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 in the Atlantic. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed more than $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nFrom the Caribbean to Texas, Hurricane Beryl leaves a trail of destruction\n\nLocal Weather\n\nGet the daily forecast and severe weather alerts in your inbox!\n\nSign up!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "dothaneagle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dothan Eagle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "juan_a_lozano@dothaneagle.com", "name": "Juan A.

At midday Tuesday, it was a post-tropical cyclone centered over Arkansas and was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flooding to a swath extending to the Great Lakes and Canada.\n\nMore than 2 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday, down from a peak of more than 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nFood spoiled in powerless refrigerators in neighborhoods that pined for air conditioning. Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck or gas station that had power and was open.\n\nPatrons lined up on one block to eat at KFC, Jack in the Box or Denny's -- or just to get a few minutes in some cooler air.\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, said at a news conference with other officials that restoring power is the No. 1 priority. In Washington, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration.\n\nEmergency crews hoped to have power restored to an additional 1 million people by the end of the day, she said.\n\nIt could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country. Sixteen hospitals were on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nPatrick said he would evaluate later whether utilities had taken proper steps before the storm to mount a swift response.\n\nCenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, said it would bring in about 12,000 workers from around the region to help restore power. A company spokesperson said those workers weren't staged in the Houston area before the storm hit, noting that forecasts initially predicted it would go much further south.\n\nKyuta Allen brought her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet for work and the night classes she takes online.\n\n\"You can't really get a lot of stuff done when you are hot,\" she said, adding it is also hard to sleep in the heat.\n\n\"During the day you can have the doors open but at night you've got to board up and lock up -- lock yourself like into a sauna,\" she said.\n\nLesley Briones, a Harris County commissioner, who visited a community center, said she's been told of people waiting hours to get gas.\n\n\"It's catastrophic when you lose everything in your fridge and you are living check to check,\" Briones said.\n\nBeryl's strength at midday Tuesday -- with sustained winds near 30 mph -- wasn't expected to change much in the next two days. It was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry issued a state of emergency Tuesday afternoon for part of that state after trees were knocked down, homes were damaged and thousands lost power.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that already teetered in saturated earth and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\nBeryl was the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 in the Atlantic. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed more than $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nFrom the Caribbean to Texas, Hurricane Beryl leaves a trail of destruction", "source": {"uri": "dailyprogress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Progress"}, "authors": [{"uri": "juan_a_lozano@dailyprogress.com", "name": "Juan A.

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nAfter a peak Monday of more than 2.7 million customers around Houston without power, the numbers improved to more than 2.4 million homes and businesses lacking electricity by Monday night, according to PowerOutage.us. The lack of cooling to people's homes, downed power lines and non-functioning traffic lights led officials to ask residents to stay home if possible.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Houstonians need to know we're working around the clock so you will be safe,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said Monday at a media briefing, urging residents to also know the dangers of high water, to stay hydrated and to check on their neighbors.\n\nBeryl later Monday weakened into a tropical depression with maximum wind speeds of about 35 mph (56 kph). The storm still packed a punch, and the National Weather Service confirmed on social media Monday evening that tornadoes had been spotted in northeastern Louisiana. Bossier Sheriff Julian Whittington said in a Facebook post that a woman was killed in the Benton area when a tree fell on her home.\n\nDozens of tornado warnings were issued in Louisiana and Arkansas on Monday evening and they continued into the night.\n\nWhile weakened, Beryl threatened to unleash harsh weather over several more states in coming days.\n\nTexas state and local officials warned it could take several days to fully restore power after Beryl came ashore as a Category 1 hurricane and toppled 10 transmission lines and knocked down trees that took down power lines.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBeryl on Tuesday was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean last weekend. But its winds and rains were still powerful enough to knock down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth, and strand dozens of cars on flooded roadways.\n\n\"We're not past any difficult conditions,\" said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country.\n\nPatrick said CenterPoint Energy was bringing thousands of additional workers to restore power, with top priorities including nursing homes and assisted living centers.\n\nAt least two people were killed when trees fell on homes in Texas, and a third person, a civilian employee of the Houston Police Department, was killed when he was trapped in flood waters under a highway overpass, Whitmire said.\n\nThe loss of power was an all-too familiar experience for Houston: Powerful storms had just ripped through the area in May, killing eight people, leaving nearly 1 million without power and flooding numerous streets.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nResidents without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in her neighborhood in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nPower crews were working to restore service as quickly as possible, an urgent priority for homes also left without air conditioning in the middle of summer. Temperatures in the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius) were expected Tuesday. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory that said the area heat index could reach 105 F (40.5 C).\n\nThe state was opening cooling centers as well as food and water distribution centers, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations.\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast on Monday, reclosing streets in neighborhoods that had already been washed out by previous storms. Television stations on Monday broadcast the dramatic rescue of a man who had climbed to the roof of his pickup truck after it got trapped in fast-flowing waters. Emergency crews used an extension ladder from a fire truck to drop him a life preserver and a tether before moving him to dry land.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHouston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents chopped up knocked-down trees and branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks.\n\nPatrick warned that flooding could last for days as rain continued to fall on already saturated ground.\n\n\"This is not a one-day event,\" he said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was getting regular updates on the storm after it made landfall and called the Houston mayor on Monday, the White House said. He told the mayor his administration will make sure Texans have the resources they need to get through the storm and recovery.\n\nSeveral companies with refineries or industrial plants in the area reported that the power disruptions necessitated the flaring of gases at the facilities.\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corp. said it conducted a \"safe combustion of excess gases\" at its Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, but did not provide information on the amount of gas flared or how long it would continue. Formosa Plastics Corporation and Freeport LNG also reported flaring related to Beryl, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\n\nCompanies have 24 hours to share emissions data after the flaring stops, a representative from the TCEQ said in an email.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nBeryl was forecast to bring more strong rain and winds into additional states over the coming days. One of those, Missouri was already dealing with a wet summer. Heavy rains unrelated to the storm prompted several water rescues around the city of Columbia, where rivers and creeks were already high ahead of Beryl's expected arrival on Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas; Corey Williams in Detroit; Julie Walker in New York; Melina Walling in Chicago; Jeff Martin in Atlanta; and Sara Cline in

The fast-moving tempest threatened to carve a harsh path over several more states in coming days.\n\nWithin hours after Beryl swept ashore as a Category 1 hurricane, it had weakened into a tropical storm, far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean last weekend.\n\nBut the winds and rains of the fast-moving storm were still powerful enough to knock down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth and to strand dozens of cars on flooded roadways.\n\nAt least two people were killed when trees fell on homes, and the National Hurricane Center said damaging winds and flash flooding would continue as Beryl pushes inland. There were no immediate reports of widespread structural damage, however.\n\nMore than 2.2 million homes and businesses were without power around Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city, after Beryl blew through, according to the CenterPoint Energy utility. For many, it was an all-too-familiar experience: Powerful storms had just ripped through the area in May, killing eight people, leaving nearly 1 million without power and flooding numerous streets.\n\nResidents without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in her neighborhood in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio, 67, said already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nHouston and Harris County officials said power crews would be sent into the area to restore service as quickly as possible, an urgent priority for homes also left without air conditioning in the middle of summer. Temperatures, which had cooled slightly with the storm, were expected to reach back into the 90s as early as Tuesday.\n\n\"While these efforts are full steam ahead, we want residents to know and prepare for a possible multi-day power outage,\" Galveston city officials said on Facebook. \"The estimated timeline is anywhere from 72 hours to two weeks in parts of the island.\"\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast on Monday, reclosing streets in neighborhoods that had already been washed out by previous storms. Television stations on Monday broadcast the dramatic rescue of a man who had climbed to the roof of his pickup truck after it got trapped in fast-flowing waters. Emergency crews used an extension ladder from a fire truck to drop him a life preserver and a tether before moving him to dry land.\n\nHouston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\n\"First responders are putting their lives at risk. That's what they're trained for. It's working,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said.\n\nJavier Mejia was one of about 20 people who gathered near the pickup truck rescue site to take pictures of other submerged vehicles sitting on the flooded highway.\n\n\"If you don't have a way through, you're going to get stuck like that,\" Mejia said.\n\nHaving experienced previous storms in Houston, Mejia stocked up on food and water before Beryl hit, but forgot gas for his portable generator. He planned to spend the day looking for some.\n\n\"I don't want it to go bad,\" he said of the food, adding that if he can't find gas, \"We can just fire up the grill.\"\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents set to work chopping up knocked-down trees and big branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks.\n\nTwo people were killed after trees fell on their houses: a man in the Houston suburb of Humble and a woman in Harris County, authorities said. Hundreds of trees fell in the county, crushing vehicles and damaging homes, said Precinct 4 County Constable Mark Herman.\n\nTexas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country, warned that flooding could last for days as rain continued to fall on already saturated ground.\n\n\"This is not a one-day event,\" he said.\n\nMore: York County happenings: Food drive; starwatch; Snack Town Street Fair; Ma & Pa Discovery Days\n\nMore: York City sets trash pickup an hour early through the end of July to combat heat\n\nMore: Temperature rising: Another heat advisory for York County\n\nPresident Joe Biden was getting regular updates on the storm after it made landfall, the White House said. The U.S. Coast Guard and FEMA had prepared search and rescue teams, and FEMA collected bottled water, meals, tarps and electric generators in case they are needed.\n\nSeveral companies with refineries or industrial plants in the area reported that the power disruptions necessitated the flaring of gases at the facilities.\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corp. said it conducted a \"safe combustion of excess gases\" at its Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, but did not provide information on the amount of gas flared or how long it would continue. Formosa Plastics Corporation and Freeport LNG also reported flaring related to Beryl, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\n\nCompanies have 24 hours to share emissions data after the flaring stops, a representative from the TCEQ said in an email.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. The storm ripped off doors, windows and roofs with devastating winds and storm surge fueled by the Atlantic's record warmth.\n\nThree times during the week, Beryl gained 35 mph in wind speed in 24 hours or less, the official weather service definition of rapid intensification.\n\nBeryl's explosive growth into an unprecedented early whopper of a storm indicates the hot water of the Atlantic and Caribbean and what the Atlantic hurricane belt can expect for the rest of the storm season, experts said. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nIn Louisiana, heavy bands of rain were expected all day Monday and \"the risk is going to be for that heavy rainfall and potential for flash flooding,\" National Weather Service meteorologist Donald Jones said in a Monday morning Facebook Live briefing.\n\nMeteorologists in Louisiana are watching for lingering rainbands, which could drop copious amounts of rain wherever they materialize, as well as \"quick, spin-up tornadoes,\" said Donald Jones, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Lake Charles, Louisiana.\n\n\"It's just a matter of exactly where that's going to be,\" Jones said. \"That's very difficult to predict more than maybe an hour or so in advance.\"\n\nBeryl was forecast to bring more strong rain and winds into additional states over the coming days. One of those, Missouri was already dealing with a wet summer. Heavy rains unrelated to the storm prompted several water rescues around the city of Columbia, where rivers and creeks were already high ahead of Beryl's expected arrival on Tuesday.", "source":

The widespread loss of power, and therefore air conditioning, could make for dangerous conditions, the National Weather Service said.\n\nMore than 2.3 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday morning, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\n\"Houstonians need to know we're working around the clock so you will be safe,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said Monday, urging residents to also know the dangers of high water, to stay hydrated and to check on their neighbors.\n\nBeryl has been blamed for at least seven deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas, officials said.\n\nThe storm weakened after making landfall, and by Tuesday morning it was a tropical depression centered over southwestern Arkansas, moving northeast with maximum sustained winds near 30 mph (48 kph), the weather service said. Its strength wasn't expected to change much in the next day or two.\n\nThe storm is forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the weather service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nBeryl came ashore in Texas as a Category 1 hurricane, far less powerful than the behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in saturated earth and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\nIt could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country.\n\nPowerful storms in the area in May killed eight people, left nearly 1 million without power and flooded streets. Residents now without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio said she had already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food, and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nThe state was opening cooling centers, as well as food and water distribution centers, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations.\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast Monday, closing streets that had already been washed out by previous storms. Houston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents chopped up knocked-down trees and branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks.

Meanwhile remnants of the storm are moving north and leaving flooding rains in their path. At least eight people have been killed by the storm.\n\nThe return of soaring heat in Houston on Tuesday deepened the misery for millions of people still without power after Hurricane Beryl crashed into Texas and left residents in search of places to cool off and fuel up as the extended outages strained one of the nation's largest cities.\n\nFrustration mounted that Houston appeared to buckle under a storm less powerful than previous ones. State officials faced questions over whether Houston's power utility had sufficiently prepared, including one who said he would withhold judgement until after the lights are back on.\n\nHospitals also started to feel the pinch: Nearly 36 hours after Beryl made landfall, Texas' lieutenant governor said a sports and event complex would be used to temporarily hold up to 250 patients who are awaiting discharge but cannot be released to homes with no power.\n\nPeople coped as best they could.\n\n\"We can handle it, but not the kids,\" said Walter Perez, 49, as he arrived early Tuesday at celebrity pastor Joel Osteen's megachurch in Houston, which served as a cooling center and distributed 40-bottle packs of water.\n\nPerez said his family -- including his wife, a 3-year-old son, a 3-week-old daughter and his father-in-law -- retreated from their apartment after a night he described as \"bad, bad, bad, bad.\"\n\nHighs in the Houston on Tuesday climbed back into the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius) and humidity that could make it feel even hotter. The National Weather Service described the conditions as potentially dangerous given the lack of power and air conditioning.\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean.\n\nNearly 2 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us . For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nFood spoiled in listless refrigerators in neighborhoods that pined for air conditioning. Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck or gas station that had power and was open.\n\nPatrons lined up on one block to eat at KFC, Jack in the Box or Denny's -- or just to get a few minutes in some cooler air. Dwight Yell, 54, had power at his house but took a disabled neighbor, who did not, to Denny's for some food.\n\nHe complained that city and state officials did not alert residents well enough to a storm initially projected to land much farther down the coast: \"They didn't give us enough warning, where maybe we could go get gas or prepare to go out of town if the lights go out.\"\n\nRobin Taylor, who got takeout from Denny's, was getting tired of the same old struggle. She has been living a hotel since her home was damaged by the storms in May. When Beryl hit, her hotel room flooded.\n\nShe was angry that Houston didn't appear prepared to handle the Category 1 storm after it had weathered much stronger ones in the past.\n\n\"No WiFi, no power, and it's hot outside. That's dangerous for people. That's really the big issue,\" Taylor said. \"People will die in this heat in their homes.\"\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, emphasized that restoring power was the top priority. CenterPoint Energy in Houston has said it aims to restore power to 1 million customers by the end of Wednesday.\n\nBut for others, getting the lights back could take several more days or longer. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is serving as acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is oveseas, said nursing homes and assisted living centers were the highest priority. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nPatrick urged utilities to restore power quickly and said he would evaluate later whether they did enough before the storm.\n\nAn executive for CenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, defended the utility's preparation and response.\n\n\"From my perspective to have a storm pass at 3 p.m. in the afternoon, have those crews come in in the late evening, and have everything ready by 5 a.m. to go out and get out and start the workforce is rather impressive because we're talking about thousands of crews,\" Brad Tutunjian, vice president of regulatory policy with CenterPoint Energy, said at a media briefing on Tuesday .\n\nKyuta Allen brought her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet for work and the night classes she takes online.\n\n\"During the day you can have the doors open but at night you've got to board up and lock up - lock yourself like into a sauna,\" she said.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry issued a state of emergency Tuesday afternoon for part of that state after trees were knocked down, homes were damaged and thousands lost power.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean .\n\nBeryl was the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 in the Atlantic. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.", "source": {"uri":

State officials faced questions over whether Houston's power utility had sufficiently prepared, including one who said he would withhold judgement until after the lights are back on.\n\nHospitals also started to feel the pinch: Nearly 36 hours after Beryl made landfall, Texas' lieutenant governor said a sports and event complex would be used to temporarily hold up to 250 patients who are awaiting discharge but cannot be released to homes with no power.\n\nPeople coped as best they could.\n\n\"We can handle it, but not the kids,\" said Walter Perez, 49, as he arrived early Tuesday at celebrity pastor Joel Osteen's megachurch in Houston, which served as a cooling center and distributed 40-bottle packs of water.\n\nPerez said his family -- including his wife, a 3-year-old son, a 3-week-old daughter and his father-in-law -- retreated from their apartment after a night he described as \"bad, bad, bad, bad.\"\n\nHighs in the Houston on Tuesday climbed back into the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius) and humidity that could make it feel even hotter. The National Weather Service described the conditions as potentially dangerous given the lack of power and air conditioning.\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean.\n\nNearly 2 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nFood spoiled in listless refrigerators in neighborhoods that pined for air conditioning. Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck or gas station that had power and was open.\n\nPatrons lined up on one block to eat at KFC, Jack in the Box or Denny's -- or just to get a few minutes in some cooler air. Dwight Yell, 54, had power at his house but took a disabled neighbor, who did not, to Denny's for some food.\n\nHe complained that city and state officials did not alert residents well enough to a storm initially projected to land much farther down the coast: \"They didn't give us enough warning, where maybe we could go get gas or prepare to go out of town if the lights go out.\"\n\nRobin Taylor, who got takeout from Denny's, was getting tired of the same old struggle. She has been living a hotel since her home was damaged by the storms in May. When Beryl hit, her hotel room flooded.\n\nShe was angry that Houston didn't appear prepared to handle the Category 1 storm after it had weathered much stronger ones in the past.\n\n\"No WiFi, no power, and it's hot outside. That's dangerous for people. That's really the big issue,\" Taylor said. \"People will die in this heat in their homes.\"\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, emphasized that restoring power was the top priority. CenterPoint Energy in Houston has said it aims to restore power to 1 million customers by the end of Wednesday.\n\nBut for others, getting the lights back could take several more days or longer. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is serving as acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is oveseas, said nursing homes and assisted living centers were the highest priority. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nPatrick urged utilities to restore power quickly and said he would evaluate later whether they did enough before the storm.\n\nAn executive for CenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, defended the utility's preparation and response.\n\n\"From my perspective to have a storm pass at 3 p.m. in the afternoon, have those crews come in in the late evening, and have everything ready by 5 a.m. to go out and get out and start the workforce is rather impressive because we're talking about thousands of crews,\" Brad Tutunjian, vice president of regulatory policy with CenterPoint Energy, said at a media briefing on Tuesday .\n\nKyuta Allen brought her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet for work and the night classes she takes online.\n\n\"During the day you can have the doors open but at night you've got to board up and lock up - lock yourself like into a sauna,\" she said.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry issued a state of emergency Tuesday afternoon for part of that state after trees were knocked down, homes were damaged and thousands lost power.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean.\n\nBeryl was the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 in the Atlantic. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Tropical Storm Beryl was unleashing heavy rains and powerful winds along the Texas coast, knocking out power to more than 2 million homes and businesses and flooding streets with fast-rising waters.\n\nHOUSTON (AP) -- Tropical Storm Beryl sped across the Texas coast on Monday, leaving more than 2 million people and businesses without power in the Houston area and unleashing heavy rains that prompted dozens of high-water rescues. The fast-moving tempest threatened to carve a harsh path over several more states in coming days.\n\nWithin hours after Beryl swept ashore as a Category 1 hurricane, it had weakened into a tropical storm, far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean last weekend.\n\nBut the winds and rains of the fast-moving storm were still powerful enough to knock down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth and to strand dozens of cars on flooded roadways.\n\nAt least two people were killed when trees fell on homes, and the National Hurricane Center said damaging winds and flash flooding would continue as Beryl pushes inland. There were no immediate reports of widespread structural damage, however.\n\nMore than 2.2 million homes and businesses were without power around Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city, after Beryl blew through, according to the CenterPoint Energy utility. For many, it was an all-too-familiar experience: Powerful storms had just ripped through the area in May, killing eight people, leaving nearly 1 million without power and flooding numerous streets.\n\nResidents without power after Beryl were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" said Eva Costancio as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in her neighborhood in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg. Costancio, 67, said already been without power for several hours and worried that food in her refrigerator would be spoiled.\n\n\"We are struggling to have food and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nHouston and Harris County officials said power crews would be sent into the area to restore service as quickly as possible, an urgent priority for homes also left without air conditioning in the middle of summer. Temperatures, which had cooled slightly with the storm, were expected to reach back into the 90s as early as Tuesday.\n\n\"While these efforts are full steam ahead, we want residents to know and prepare for a possible multi-day power outage,\" Galveston city officials said on Facebook. \"The estimated timeline is anywhere from 72 hours to two weeks in parts of the island.\"\n\nBeryl's rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast on Monday, reclosing streets in neighborhoods that had already been washed out by previous storms. Television stations on Monday broadcast the dramatic rescue of a man who had climbed to the roof of his pickup truck after it got trapped in fast-flowing waters. Emergency crews used an extension ladder from a fire truck to drop him a life preserver and a tether before moving him to dry land.\n\nHouston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in floodwaters.\n\n\"First responders are putting their lives at risk. That's what they're trained for. It's working,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said.\n\nJavier Mejia was one of about 20 people who gathered near the pickup truck rescue site to take pictures of other submerged vehicles sitting on the flooded highway.\n\n\"If you don't have a way through, you're going to get stuck like that,\" Mejia said.\n\nHaving experienced previous storms in Houston, Mejia stocked up on food and water before Beryl hit, but forgot gas for his portable generator. He planned to spend the day looking for some.\n\n\"I don't want it to go bad,\" he said of the food, adding that if he can't find gas, \"We can just fire up the grill.\"\n\nMany streets and neighborhoods throughout Houston were littered with fallen branches and other debris. The buzz of chainsaws filled the air Monday afternoon as residents set to work chopping up knocked-down trees and big branches that had blocked streets and sidewalks.\n\nTwo people were killed after trees fell on their houses: a man in the Houston suburb of Humble and a woman in Harris County, authorities said. Hundreds of trees fell in the county, crushing vehicles and damaging homes, said Precinct 4 County Constable Mark Herman.\n\nTexas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country, warned that flooding could last for days as rain continued to fall on already saturated ground.\n\n\"This is not a one-day event,\" he said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was getting regular updates on the storm after it made landfall, the White House said. The U.S. Coast Guard and FEMA had prepared search and rescue teams, and FEMA collected bottled water, meals, tarps and electric generators in case they are needed.\n\nSeveral companies with refineries or industrial plants in the area reported that the power disruptions necessitated the flaring of gases at the facilities.\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corp. said it conducted a \"safe combustion of excess gases\" at its Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, but did not provide information on the amount of gas flared or how long it would continue. Formosa Plastics Corporation and Freeport LNG also reported flaring related to Beryl, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\n\nCompanies have 24 hours to share emissions data after the flaring stops, a representative from the TCEQ said in an email.\n\nThe earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. The storm ripped off doors, windows and roofs with devastating winds and storm surge fueled by the Atlantic's record warmth.\n\nThree times during the week, Beryl gained 35 mph (56 kph) in wind speed in 24 hours or less, the official weather service definition of rapid intensification.\n\nBeryl's explosive growth into an unprecedented early whopper of a storm indicates the hot water of the Atlantic and Caribbean and what the Atlantic hurricane belt can expect for the rest of the storm season, experts said. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nIn Louisiana, heavy bands of rain were expected all day Monday and \"the risk is going to be for that heavy rainfall and potential for flash flooding,\" National Weather Service meteorologist Donald Jones said in a Monday morning Facebook Live briefing.\n\nMeteorologists in Louisiana are watching for lingering rainbands, which could drop copious amounts of rain wherever they materialize, as well as \"quick, spin-up tornadoes,\" said Donald Jones, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Lake Charles, Louisiana.\n\n\"It's just a matter of exactly where that's going to be,\" Jones said. \"That's very difficult to predict more than maybe an hour or so in advance.\"\n\nBeryl was forecast to bring more strong rain and winds into additional states over the coming days. One of those, Missouri was already dealing with a wet summer. Heavy rains unrelated to the storm prompted several water rescues around the city of Columbia, where rivers and creeks were already high ahead of Beryl's expected arrival on Tuesday.\n\nAssociated Press reporters Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas; Corey Williams in Detroit; Julie Walker in New York; Melina Walling in Chicago; and Jeff Martin in Atlanta contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@register-herald.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "juan_a_lozano@register-herald.com", "name": "Juan A.

At midday Tuesday, it was a post-tropical cyclone centered over Arkansas and was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flooding to a swath extending to the Great Lakes and Canada.\n\nMore than 2 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nFood spoiled in listless refrigerators in neighborhoods that pined for air conditioning. Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck or gas station that had power and was open. And frustration mounted that Houston appeared to buckle under a storm not as powerful as previous ones.\n\nPatrons lined up on one block to eat at KFC, Jack in the Box or Denny's -- or just to get a few minutes in some cooler air. Dwight Yell, 54, had power at his house but took a disabled neighbor, who did not, to Denny's for some food.\n\nHe complained that city and state officials did not alert residents well enough to a storm initially projected to land much farther down the coast: \"They didn't give us enough warning, where maybe we could go get gas or prepare to go out of town if the lights go out.\"\n\nRobin Taylor, who got takeout from Denny's, was getting tired of the same old struggle. She has been living a hotel since her home was damaged by the storms in May. When Beryl hit, her hotel room flooded.\n\nShe was angry that Houston didn't appear prepared to handle the Category 1 storm after it had weathered much stronger ones in the past.\n\n\"No WiFi, no power, and it's hot outside. That's dangerous for people. That's really the big issue,\" Taylor said. \"People will die in this heat in their homes.\"\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, said at a news conference with other officials that restoring power is the No. 1 priority. And in Washington, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration. Emergency crews hope to have power restored to an additional 1 million people by the end of the day, she said.\n\nIt could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nPatrick urged utilities to restore power \"as quickly as they can.\"\n\nBeryl's strength at midday Tuesday -- with sustained winds near 30 mph (48 kph) -- wasn't expected to change much in the next two days. It was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in saturated earth and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\nBeryl was the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 in the Atlantic. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nContributing to this report were Associated Press journalists Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas; Sara Cline in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Jeff Martin in Atlanta; and Sarah Brumfield in Silver Spring, Maryland.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@register-herald.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "juan_a_lozano@register-herald.com", "name": "Juan A.

State officials were questioned whether utilities were prepared in advance, and at least one said they would withhold judgement until after the lights were turned back on.\n\nA heat advisory took effect through Wednesday in the Houston area and beyond, with temperatures expected to soar into the 90s and humidity that could make it feel as hot as 105 degrees. The National Weather Service described the conditions as potentially dangerous given the lack of power and air conditioning.\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths and at least 11 in the Caribbean. At midday Tuesday, it was a post-tropical cyclone centered over Arkansas and was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flooding to a swath extending to the Great Lakes and Canada.\n\nMore than 2 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday, down from a peak of more than 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nFood spoiled in powerless refrigerators in neighborhoods that pined for air conditioning. Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck or gas station that had power and was open.\n\nPatrons lined up on one block to eat at KFC, Jack in the Box or Denny's -- or just to get a few minutes in some cooler air.\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, said at a news conference with other officials that restoring power is the No. 1 priority. In Washington, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration.\n\nEmergency crews hoped to have power restored to an additional 1 million people by the end of the day, she said.\n\nIt could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country. Sixteen hospitals were on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nPatrick said he would evaluate later whether utilities had taken proper steps before the storm to mount a swift response.\n\nCenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, said it would bring in about 12,000 workers from around the region to help restore power. A company spokesperson said those workers weren't staged in the Houston area before the storm hit, noting that forecasts initially predicted it would go much further south.\n\nKyuta Allen brought her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet for work and the night classes she takes online.\n\n\"You can't really get a lot of stuff done when you are hot,\" she said, adding it is also hard to sleep in the heat.\n\n\"During the day you can have the doors open but at night you've got to board up and lock up -- lock yourself like into a sauna,\" she said.\n\nLesley Briones, a Harris County commissioner, who visited a community center, said she's been told of people waiting hours to get gas.\n\n\"It's catastrophic when you lose everything in your fridge and you are living check to check,\" Briones said.\n\nBeryl's strength at midday Tuesday -- with sustained winds near 30 mph -- wasn't expected to change much in the next two days. It was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry issued a state of emergency Tuesday afternoon for part of that state after trees were knocked down, homes were damaged and thousands lost power.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that already teetered in saturated earth and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\nBeryl was the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 in the Atlantic. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed more than $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nLocal Weather\n\nGet the daily forecast and severe weather alerts in your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "newsadvance.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsAdvance.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "juan_a_lozano@newsadvance.com", "name": "Juan A.

The US National Hurricane Centre said damaging winds and flash flooding will continue as Beryl continues pushing inland.\n\nMore than two million homes and businesses in the Houston area were without electricity, CenterPoint Energy officials said. Texas lieutenant governor Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Greg Abbott is out of the country, said crews could not get out to restore it until the wind dies down.\n\nResidents without power were doing their best.\n\n\"We haven't really slept,\" Eva \u00adCostancio said as she gazed at a large tree that had fallen across electric lines in her neighbourhood in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg.\n\nMs Costancio (67) said she had been without power for about four hours yesterday and worried that food in her \u00adrefrigerator would be spoiled. \"We are struggling to have food and losing that food would be difficult,\" she said.\n\nHigh waters quickly closed streets. In flood-weary Houston, where previous storms had already washed out neighbourhoods, television stations broadcast the dramatic rescue of a man who had climbed to the roof of his pickup truck after it got trapped in fast-flowing waters. Emergency crews used an extension ladder from a fire truck to drop him a life preserver and a tether before moving him to dry land.\n\nHouston officials said they had performed at least 15 high-water rescues and more were ongoing. \"First responders are putting their lives at risk. That's what they're trained for. It's working,\" Houston mayor John Whitmire said.\n\nHouston was under a flash-flood warning for most of the morning as heavy rain continued to soak the city. Flood warnings also were in effect across a wide stretch of the Texas coast, where a powerful storm surge pushed water ashore, and further inland as heavy rain continued to fall.\n\nRosenberg police also noted that one of their high-water vehicles was hit by a falling tree while returning from a rescue.\n\nTwo people were killed after trees fell on their houses: a man in the Houston suburb of Humble and a woman in \u00adHarris County, authorities said. Hundreds of trees fell in the county, crushing vehicles and damaging homes, said a police spokesman.\n\nMr Patrick warned flooding could last for days as the storm continues to dump rain on to already saturated ground. \"This is not a one-day event,\" he said.\n\nBeryl and the widespread power outages were just the latest weather problems for Houston, where nearly one million people lost power when deadly storms ripped through the area in May, killed eight people and brought much of the city to a standstill.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Beryl_(1994)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical Storm Beryl (1994)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CenterPoint_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CenterPoint Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greater Houston"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant Governor of Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flash flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Patrick_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dan Patrick (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fire engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abbott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abbott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickup_truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pickup truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Whitmire", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Whitmire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dew point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_outage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Power outage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_surge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Storm surge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humble,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humble, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Humble, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harris County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harris County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.independent.ie/extra/assets/img/dummy-social.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716370", "eventUri": "eng-9716370", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

State officials were questioned whether utilities were prepared in advance, and at least one said they would withhold judgement until after the lights were turned back on.\n\n\"We can handle it, but not the kids,\" said Walter Perez, 49, as he arrived early Tuesday at celebrity pastor Joel Osteen's megachurch in Houston, which served as a cooling center and distributed 40-bottle packs of water to cars that drove up.\n\nPerez said he, his wife, their 3-year-old son and 3-week-old daughter, and his father-in-law retreated from their apartment after a night he described as \"bad, bad, bad, bad.\"\n\nA heat advisory took effect through Wednesday in the Houston area and beyond, with temperatures expected to soar into the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius) and humidity that could make it feel as hot as 105 degrees (40.5 Celsius). The National Weather Service described the conditions as potentially dangerous given the lack of power and air conditioning.\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean. At midday Tuesday, it was a post-tropical cyclone centered over Arkansas and was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flooding to a swath extending to the Great Lakes and Canada.\n\nNearly 2 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nHospitals were having a crowding problem because they haven't been able to release patients who can't return to homes with no power, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country. A large sports and events complex will be used to temporarily hold up to 250 patients who are released from hospitals.\n\nFood spoiled in listless refrigerators in neighborhoods that pined for air conditioning. Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck or gas station that had power and was open.\n\nPatrons lined up on one block to eat at KFC, Jack in the Box or Denny's -- or just to get a few minutes in some cooler air. Dwight Yell, 54, had power at his house but took a disabled neighbor, who did not, to Denny's for some food.\n\nHe complained that city and state officials did not alert residents well enough to a storm initially projected to land much farther down the coast: \"They didn't give us enough warning, where maybe we could go get gas or prepare to go out of town if the lights go out.\"\n\nRobin Taylor, who got takeout from Denny's, was getting tired of the same old struggle. She has been living a hotel since her home was damaged by the storms in May. When Beryl hit, her hotel room flooded.\n\nShe was angry that Houston didn't appear prepared to handle the Category 1 storm after it had weathered much stronger ones in the past.\n\n\"No WiFi, no power, and it's hot outside. That's dangerous for people. That's really the big issue,\" Taylor said. \"People will die in this heat in their homes.\"\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, said at a news conference with other officials that restoring power is the No. 1 priority. And in Washington, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration. Emergency crews hope to have power restored to an additional 1 million people by the end of the day, she said.\n\nIt could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Patrick. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nPatrick urged utilities to restore power \"as quickly as they can.\" Patrick said he would evaluate later whether utilities had taken proper steps before the storm to mount a swift response.\n\nCenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, said it was bringing in about 12,000 workers from around the region to help restore power. A company spokesperson said those workers weren't staged in the Houston area before the storm hit, noting that forecasts initially predicted it would go much further south.\n\nKyuta Allen brought her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet for work and the night classes she takes online.\n\n\"You can't really get a lot of stuff done when you are hot,\" she said, adding it is also hard to sleep in the heat.\n\n\"During the day you can have the doors open but at night you've got to board up and lock up - lock yourself like into a sauna,\" she said.\n\nLesley Briones, a Harris County commissioner, who visited a community center, said she's been told of people waiting hours to get gas.\n\n\"It's catastrophic when you lose everything in your fridge and you are living check to check,\" Briones said.\n\nBeryl's strength at midday Tuesday -- with sustained winds near 30 mph (48 kph) -- wasn't expected to change much in the next two days. It was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry issued a state of emergency Tuesday afternoon for part of that state after trees were knocked down, homes were damaged and thousands lost power.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in saturated earth and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\nBeryl was the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 in the Atlantic. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\n___\n\nContributing

Dwight Yell, 54, had power at his house but took a disabled neighbor, who did not, to Denny's for some food.\n\nHe complained that city and state officials did not alert residents well enough to a storm initially projected to land much farther down the coast: \"They didn't give us enough warning, where maybe we could go get gas or prepare to go out of town if the lights go out.\"\n\nRobin Taylor, who got takeout from Denny's, was getting tired of the same old struggle. She has been living a hotel since her home was damaged by the storms in May. When Beryl hit, her hotel room flooded.\n\nShe was angry that Houston didn't appear prepared to handle the Category 1 storm after it had weathered much stronger ones in the past.\n\n\"No WiFi, no power, and it's hot outside. That's dangerous for people. That's really the big issue,\" Taylor said. \"People will die in this heat in their homes.\"\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, said at a news conference with other officials that restoring power is the No. 1 priority. And in Washington, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration. Emergency crews hope to have power restored to an additional 1 million people by the end of the day, she said.\n\nIt could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nPatrick urged utilities to restore power \"as quickly as they can.\" Patrick said he would evaluate later whether utilities had taken proper steps before the storm to mount a swift response.\n\nCenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, said it was bringing in about 12,000 workers from around the region to help restore power. A company spokesperson said those workers weren't staged in the Houston area before the storm hit, noting that forecasts initially predicted it would go much further south.\n\nKyuta Allen brought her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet for work and the night classes she takes online.\n\n\"You can't really get a lot of stuff done when you are hot,\" she said, adding it is also hard to sleep in the heat.\n\n\"During the day you can have the doors open but at night you've got to board up and lock up - lock yourself like into a sauna,\" she said.\n\nLesley Briones, a Harris County commissioner, who visited a community center, said she's been told of people waiting hours to get gas.\n\n\"It's catastrophic when you lose everything in your fridge and you are living check to check,\" Briones said.\n\nBeryl's strength at midday Tuesday -- with sustained winds near 30 mph (48 kph) -- wasn't expected to change much in the next two days. It was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry issued a state of emergency Tuesday afternoon for part of that state after trees were knocked down, homes were damaged and thousands lost power.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in saturated earth and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\nBeryl was the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 in the Atlantic. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.", "source": {"uri":

At midday Tuesday, it was a post-tropical cyclone centered over Arkansas and was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flooding to a swath extending to the Great Lakes and Canada.\n\nMore than 2 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nFood spoiled in listless refrigerators in neighborhoods that pined for air conditioning. Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck or gas station that had power and was open. And frustration mounted that Houston appeared to buckle under a storm not as powerful as previous ones.\n\nPatrons lined up on one block to eat at KFC, Jack in the Box or Denny's -- or just to get a few minutes in some cooler air. Dwight Yell, 54, had power at his house but took a disabled neighbor, who did not, to Denny's for some food.\n\nHe complained that city and state officials did not alert residents well enough to a storm initially projected to land much farther down the coast: \"They didn't give us enough warning, where maybe we could go get gas or prepare to go out of town if the lights go out.\"\n\nRobin Taylor, who got takeout from Denny's, was getting tired of the same old struggle.

As frustration mounted, state officials faced questions over whether the power utility that covers much of the area had sufficiently prepared.\n\nNearly 36 hours after Beryl made landfall, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said that a sports and event complex would be used to temporarily hold up to 250 hospital patients who are awaiting discharge but cannot be released to homes with no power.\n\nPeople were coping as best they could.\n\n\"We can handle it, but not the kids,\" Walter Perez said as he arrived at celebrity pastor Joel Osteen's megachurch in Houston, which served as a cooling center and distributed 40-bottle packs of water.\n\nMr. Perez said his wife, 3-year-old son, 3-week-old daughter, and his father-in-law retreated from their apartment after a night he described as \"bad, bad, bad, bad.\"\n\nAn executive for CenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, defended the utility's preparation and response.\n\n\"From my perspective to have a storm pass at 3 p.m. in the afternoon, have those crews come in in the late evening, and have everything ready by 5 a.m. to go out and get out and start the workforce is rather impressive because we're talking about thousands of crews,\" Brad Tutunjian, vice president of regulatory policy with CenterPoint Energy, said at a media briefing.\n\nHighs in the Houston area on Tuesday climbed back into the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius) with humidity that made it feel even hotter. Similar heat and humidity was expected Wednesday. The National Weather Service described the conditions as potentially dangerous given the lack of power and air conditioning.\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean.\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, emphasized that restoring power was the top priority.\n\nMr. Patrick, who is serving as acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is overseas, said nursing homes and assisted living centers were the highest priority. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nFor many in the Houston area it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nPatrons on Tuesday lined up on one block to eat at KFC, Jack in the Box, or Denny's. Dwight Yell took a disabled neighbor who did not have power to Denny's for some food.\n\nHe complained that city and state officials did not alert residents well enough to a storm initially projected to land much farther down the coast: \"They didn't give us enough warning, where maybe we could go get gas or prepare to go out of town if the lights go out.\"\n\nRobin Taylor, who got takeout from Denny's, has been living a hotel since her home was damaged by the storms in May. When Beryl hit, her hotel room flooded.\n\n\"No WiFi, no power, and it's hot outside,\" Mr. Taylor said. \"People will die in this heat in their homes.\"\n\nKyuta Allen brought her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet.\n\n\"During the day you can have the doors open but at night you've got to board up and lock up -- lock yourself like into a sauna,\" she said.",

That's dangerous for people.\"\n\nBy Juan A. Lozano and Mark Vancleave | Associated Press\n\nHOUSTON (AP) -- Many of the millions left without power after Hurricane Beryl crashed into Texas sweltered and grumbled Tuesday as the storm gutted access to air conditioning, food and water, and smothering heat and humidity draped over the nation's fourth-largest city.\n\nFrustration mounted that Houston appeared to buckle under a storm not as powerful as previous ones. State officials were questioned whether utilities were prepared in advance, and at least one said they would withhold judgement until after the lights were turned back on.\n\n\"We can handle it, but not the kids,\" said Walter Perez, 49, as he arrived early Tuesday at celebrity pastor Joel Osteen's megachurch in Houston, which served as a cooling center and distributed 40-bottle packs of water to cars that drove up.\n\nPerez said he, his wife, their 3-year-old son and 3-week-old daughter, and his father-in-law retreated from their apartment after a night he described as \"bad, bad, bad, bad.\"\n\nA heat advisory took effect through Wednesday in the Houston area and beyond, with temperatures expected to soar into the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius) and humidity that could make it feel as hot as 105 degrees (40.5 Celsius). The National Weather Service described the conditions as potentially dangerous given the lack of power and air conditioning.\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean. At midday Tuesday, it was a post-tropical cyclone centered over Arkansas and was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flooding to a swath extending to the Great Lakes and Canada.\n\nMore than 2 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nFood spoiled in listless refrigerators in neighborhoods that pined for air conditioning. Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck or gas station that had power and was open.\n\nPatrons lined up on one block to eat at KFC, Jack in the Box or Denny's -- or just to get a few minutes in some cooler air. Dwight Yell, 54, had power at his house but took a disabled neighbor, who did not, to Denny's for some food.\n\nHe complained that city and state officials did not alert residents well enough to a storm initially projected to land much farther down the coast: \"They didn't give us enough warning, where maybe we could go get gas or prepare to go out of town if the lights go out.\"\n\nRobin Taylor, who got takeout from Denny's, was getting tired of the same old struggle. She has been living a hotel since her home was damaged by the storms in May. When Beryl hit, her hotel room flooded.\n\nShe was angry that Houston didn't appear prepared to handle the Category 1 storm after it had weathered much stronger ones in the past.\n\n\"No WiFi, no power, and it's hot outside. That's dangerous for people. That's really the big issue,\" Taylor said. \"People will die in this heat in their homes.\"\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, said at a news conference with other officials that restoring power is the No. 1 priority. And in Washington, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration. Emergency crews hope to have power restored to an additional 1 million people by the end of the day, she said.\n\nIt could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nPatrick urged utilities to restore power \"as quickly as they can.\" Patrick said he would evaluate later whether utilities had taken proper steps before the storm to mount a swift response.\n\nCenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, said it was bringing in about 12,000 workers from around the region to help restore power. A company spokesperson said those workers weren't staged in the Houston area before the storm hit, noting that forecasts initially predicted it would go much further south.\n\nKyuta Allen brought her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet for work and the night classes she takes online.\n\n\"You can't really get a lot of stuff done when you are hot,\" she said, adding it is also hard to sleep in the heat.\n\n\"During the day you can have the doors open but at night you've got to board up and lock up - lock yourself like into a sauna,\" she said.\n\nLesley Briones, a Harris County commissioner, who visited a community center, said she's been told of people waiting hours to get gas.\n\n\"It's catastrophic when you lose everything in your fridge and you are living check to check,\" Briones said.\n\nBeryl's strength at midday Tuesday -- with sustained winds near 30 mph (48 kph) -- wasn't expected to change much in the next two days. It was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry issued a state of emergency Tuesday afternoon for part of that state after trees were knocked down, homes were damaged and thousands lost power.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean.

As frustration mounted, state officials faced questions over whether the power utility that covers much of the area had sufficiently prepared.\n\nNearly 36 hours after Beryl made landfall, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said that a sports and event complex would be used to temporarily hold up to 250 hospital patients who are awaiting discharge but cannot be released to homes with no power.\n\nPeople were coping as best they could.\n\n\"We can handle it, but not the kids,\" Walter Perez said as he arrived at celebrity pastor Joel Osteen's megachurch in Houston, which served as a cooling center and distributed 40-bottle packs of water.\n\nPerez said his wife, 3-year-old son, 3-week-old daughter and his father-in-law retreated from their apartment after a night he described as \"bad, bad, bad, bad.\"\n\nAn executive for CenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, defended the utility's preparation and response.\n\n\"From my perspective to have a storm pass at 3 p.m. in the afternoon, have those crews come in in the late evening, and have everything ready by 5 a.m. to go out and get out and start the workforce is rather impressive because we're talking about thousands of crews,\" Brad Tutunjian, vice president of regulatory policy with CenterPoint Energy, said at a media briefing.\n\nHighs in the Houston area on Tuesday climbed back into the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius) with humidity that made it feel even hotter. Similar heat and humidity was expected Wednesday. The National Weather Service described the conditions as potentially dangerous given the lack of power and air conditioning.\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean.\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, emphasized that restoring power was the top priority.\n\nPatrick, who is serving as acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is overseas, said nursing homes and assisted living centers were the highest priority. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nFor many in the Houston area it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nPatrons on Tuesday lined up on one block to eat at KFC, Jack in the Box or Denny's. Dwight Yell took a disabled neighbor who did not have power to Denny's for some food.\n\nHe complained that city and state officials did not alert residents well enough to a storm initially projected to land much farther down the coast: \"They didn't give us enough warning, where maybe we could go get gas or prepare to go out of town if the lights go out.\"\n\nRobin Taylor, who got takeout from Denny's, has been living a hotel since her home was damaged by the storms in May. When Beryl hit, her hotel room flooded.\n\n\"No WiFi, no power, and it's hot outside,\" Taylor said. \"People will die in this heat in their homes.\"\n\nKyuta Allen brought her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet.\n\n\"During the day you can have the doors open but at night you've got to board up and lock up -- lock yourself like into a sauna,\" she said.\n\n___\n\nBy JUAN A.

State officials were questioned whether utilities were prepared in advance, and at least one said they would withhold judgement until after the lights were turned back on.\n\nA heat advisory took effect through Wednesday in the Houston area and beyond, with temperatures expected to soar into the 90s and humidity that could make it feel as hot as 105 degrees. The National Weather Service described the conditions as potentially dangerous given the lack of power and air conditioning.\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths and at least 11 in the Caribbean. At midday Tuesday, it was a post-tropical cyclone centered over Arkansas and was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flooding to a swath extending to the Great Lakes and Canada.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Now what?\n\nMore than 2 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday, down from a peak of more than 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nFood spoiled in powerless refrigerators in neighborhoods that pined for air conditioning. Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck or gas station that had power and was open.\n\nPatrons lined up on one block to eat at KFC, Jack in the Box or Denny's -- or just to get a few minutes in some cooler air.\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, said at a news conference with other officials that restoring power is the No. 1 priority. In Washington, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration.\n\nEmergency crews hoped to have power restored to an additional 1 million people by the end of the day, she said.\n\nIt could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country. Sixteen hospitals were on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nPatrick said he would evaluate later whether utilities had taken proper steps before the storm to mount a swift response.\n\nCenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, said it would bring in about 12,000 workers from around the region to help restore power. A company spokesperson said those workers weren't staged in the Houston area before the storm hit, noting that forecasts initially predicted it would go much further south.\n\nKyuta Allen brought her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet for work and the night classes she takes online.\n\n\"You can't really get a lot of stuff done when you are hot,\" she said, adding it is also hard to sleep in the heat.\n\n\"During the day you can have the doors open but at night you've got to board up and lock up -- lock yourself like into a sauna,\" she said.\n\nLesley Briones, a Harris County commissioner, who visited a community center, said she's been told of people waiting hours to get gas.\n\n\"It's catastrophic when you lose everything in your fridge and you are living check to check,\" Briones said.\n\nBeryl's strength at midday Tuesday -- with sustained winds near 30 mph -- wasn't expected to change much in the next two days. It was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nLouisiana Gov.

As frustration mounted, state officials faced questions over whether the power utility that covers much of the area had sufficiently prepared.\n\nNearly 36 hours after Beryl made landfall, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said that a sports and event complex would be used to temporarily hold up to 250 hospital patients who are awaiting discharge but cannot be released to homes with no power.\n\nPeople were coping as best they could.\n\n\"We can handle it, but not the kids,\" Walter Perez said as he arrived at celebrity pastor Joel Osteen's megachurch in Houston, which served as a cooling centre and distributed 40-bottle packs of water.\n\nPerez said his wife, 3-year-old son, 3-week-old daughter and his father-in-law retreated from their apartment after a night he described as \"bad, bad, bad, bad.\"\n\nAn executive for CenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, defended the utility's preparation and response.\n\n\"From my perspective to have a storm pass at 3 p.m. in the afternoon, have those crews come in in the late evening, and have everything ready by 5 a.m. to go out and get out and start the workforce is rather impressive because we're talking about thousands of crews,\" Brad Tutunjian, vice president of regulatory policy with CenterPoint Energy, said at a media briefing.\n\nHighs in the Houston area on Tuesday climbed back into the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius) with humidity that made it feel even hotter. Similar heat and humidity was expected Wednesday. The National Weather Service described the conditions as potentially dangerous given the lack of power and air conditioning.\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths - one in Louisiana and six in Texas - and at least 11 in the Caribbean.\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, emphasized that restoring power was the top priority.\n\nPatrick, who is serving as acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is overseas, said nursing homes and assisted living centres were the highest priority. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nFor many in the Houston area it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nPatrons on Tuesday lined up on one block to eat at KFC, Jack in the Box or Denny's. Dwight Yell took a disabled neighbour who did not have power to Denny's for some food.\n\nHe complained that city and state officials did not alert residents well enough to a storm initially projected to land much farther down the coast: \"They didn't give us enough warning, where maybe we could go get gas or prepare to go out of town if the lights go out.\"\n\nRobin Taylor, who got takeout from Denny's, has been living a hotel since her home was damaged by the storms in May. When Beryl hit, her hotel room flooded.\n\n\"No WiFi, no power, and it's hot outside,\" Taylor said. \"People will die in this heat in their homes.\"\n\nKyuta Allen brought her family to a Houston community centre to cool down and use the internet.\n\n\"During the day you can have the doors open but at night you've got to board up and lock up - lock yourself like into a sauna,\" she said.",

The National Weather Service described the conditions as potentially dangerous given the lack of power and air conditioning.\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven US deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean. At midday Tuesday, it was a post-tropical cyclone centered over Arkansas and was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flooding to a swath extending to the Great Lakes and Canada.\n\nMore than 2 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nFood spoiled in listless refrigerators. Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck, or gas station that had power and was open.\n\nPatrons lined up on one block to eat at KFC, Jack in the Box, or Denny's -- or just to get a few minutes in some cooler air. Dwight Yell, 54, had power at his house but took a disabled neighbor, who did not, to Denny's for some food.\n\nHe complained that city and state officials did not alert residents well enough to a storm initially projected to land much farther down the coast: \"They didn't give us enough warning, where maybe we could go get gas or prepare to go out of town if the lights go out.\"\n\nRobin Taylor, who got takeout from Denny's, was getting tired of the same old struggle. She has been living in a hotel since her home was damaged by the storms in May. When Beryl hit, her hotel room flooded.\n\nShe was angry that Houston didn't appear prepared to handle the Category 1 storm after it had weathered much stronger ones in the past.\n\n\"No Wi-Fi, no power, and it's hot outside. That's dangerous for people. That's really the big issue,\" Taylor said. \"People will die in this heat in their homes.\"\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, said at a news conference with other officials that restoring power is the number one priority. And in Washington, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Biden approved a major disaster declaration. Emergency crews hope to have power restored to an additional 1 million people by the end of the day, she said.\n\nIt could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Governor Greg Abbott is out of the country. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nPatrick urged utilities to restore power \"as quickly as they can.\" Patrick said he would evaluate later whether utilities had taken proper steps before the storm to mount a swift response.\n\nCenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, said it was bringing in about 12,000 workers from around the region to help restore power. A company spokesperson said those workers weren't staged in the Houston area before the storm hit, noting that forecasts initially predicted it would go much farther south.\n\nLesley Briones, a Harris County commissioner, who visited a community center, said she's been told of people waiting hours to get gas.\n\n\"It's catastrophic when you lose everything in your fridge and you are living check to check,\" Briones said.\n\nBeryl's strength at midday Tuesday -- with sustained winds near 30 miles per hour -- wasn't expected to change much in the next two days. It was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nLouisiana Governor Jeff Landry issued a state of emergency Tuesday afternoon for part of that state after trees were knocked down, homes were damaged, and thousands lost power.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean.

Similar heat and humidity was expected on Wednesday. The National Weather Service described the conditions as potentially dangerous given the lack of power and air conditioning.\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean.\n\nMore than 1.7 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday night, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nPatrons on Tuesday lined up on one block to eat at KFC, Jack in the Box or Denny's. Dwight Yell took a disabled neighbor who did not have power to Denny's for some food.\n\nHe complained that city and state officials did not alert residents well enough to a storm initially projected to land much farther down the coast: \"They didn't give us enough warning, where maybe we could go get gas or prepare to go out of town if the lights go out.\"\n\nRobin Taylor, who got takeout from Denny's, has been living a hotel since her home was damaged by storms that hit the city in May. When Beryl hit, her hotel room flooded.\n\n\"No WiFi, no power, and it's hot outside,\" Taylor said. \"People will die in this heat in their homes.\"\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, emphasized that restoring power was the top priority. CenterPoint Energy in Houston has said it aims to restore power to 1 million customers by the end of Wednesday.\n\nTexas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is serving as acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is overseas, said nursing homes and assisted living centers were the highest priority. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nAn executive for CenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, defended the utility's preparation and response.\n\n\"From my perspective to have a storm pass at 3 p.m. in the afternoon, have those crews come in in the late evening, and have everything ready by 5 a.m. to go out and get out and start the workforce is rather impressive because we're talking about thousands of crews,\" Brad Tutunjian, vice president of regulatory policy with CenterPoint Energy, said at a media briefing on Tuesday.\n\nKyuta Allen brought her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet.\n\n\"During the day you can have the doors open but at night you've got to board up and lock up - lock yourself like into a sauna,\" she said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas; Sara Cline in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Jeff Martin in Atlanta; and Sarah Brumfield in Silver Spring, Maryland, congtributed.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

It still threatens flooding on its path northward - WSVN 7News | Miami News, Weather, Sports | Fort Lauderdale", "body": "HOUSTON (AP) -- Many of the millions left without power after Hurricane Beryl crashed into Texas, killing several people and unleashing flooding, sweltered and fretted Tuesday as the storm deprived them of air conditioning, food and water in dangerous heat.\n\nA heat advisory took effect through Wednesday in the Houston area and beyond, with temperatures expected to soar into the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius) and humidity that could make it feel as hot as 105 degrees (40.5 Celsius).\n\n\"We can handle it, but not the kids,\" said Walter Perez, 49, as he arrived early Tuesday at celebrity pastor Joel Osteen's megachurch in Houston, which served as a cooling center and distributed 40-bottle packs of water to cars that drove up.\n\nPerez said he, his wife, their 3-year-old son and 3-week-old daughter, and his father-in-law retreated from their apartment after a night he described as \"bad, bad, bad, bad.\"\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean. At midday Tuesday, it was a post-tropical cyclone centered over Arkansas and was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flooding to a swath extending to the Great Lakes and Canada.\n\nMore than 2.1 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, said at a news conference with other officials that restoring power is the No. 1 priority. And in Washington, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration. Emergency crews hope to have power restored to another 1 million people by the end of the day, she said.\n\nFood spoiled in listless refrigerators in neighborhoods that pined for air conditioning. Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck or gas station that had power and was open.\n\nDamonte Oliver, 32, visited Osteen's Lakewood Church with his girlfriend and her mother. Their apartment had lost power for days after the May storm.\n\n\"I know they are trying to do their best to get everything back on. It's just a waiting game on how long it's going to take,\" he said before walking to a convenience store to buy cigarettes.\n\n\"I've got to calm down a little bit myself,\" Oliver said.\n\nIt could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nBeryl's strength at midday Tuesday -- with sustained winds near 30 mph (48 kph) -- wasn't expected to change much in the next two days. It was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in saturated earth and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\nBeryl was the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 in the Atlantic. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Three of those people were killed by fallen trees, one died in a fire, two drowned, and a civilian police department employee died after being trapped in high water while driving to work.\n\nOne person died in north-west Louisiana during the storm when a tree fell on a home, according to authorities.\n\nAfter a peak Monday of more than 2.7 million customers around Houston without power, the numbers improved with more than 2.3m homes and businesses lacking electricity by Tuesday morning, according to PowerOutage.us. The lack of cooling to people's homes, downed power lines and non-functioning traffic lights led officials to ask residents to stay home if possible.\n\n\"Houstonians need to know we're working around the clock so you will be safe,\" the mayor, John Whitmire, said on Monday at a media briefing, urging residents to also know the dangers of high water, to stay hydrated and to check on their neighbors.\n\nBeryl later on Monday weakened into a tropical depression and by Tuesday morning the National Weather Service (NWS) said it was about 95 miles (155km) north of Shreveport, Louisiana, moving north-east with maximum sustained wind speeds near 30mph (48km/h). Its strength was not expected to change much in the next day or two.\n\nWhile weakened, Beryl threatened to unleash more harsh weather over several other states in coming days. The storm was expected to bring heavy rainfall and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes on Tuesday into Wednesday, the NWS said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan, and tornadoes were possible through the early morning across parts of the mid-south. A few tornadoes were possible from midday to the early evening in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, according to the NWS.\n\nThe storm still packed a punch, and the NWS confirmed on social media on Monday evening that tornadoes had been spotted in north-eastern Louisiana. The Bossier sheriff, Julian Whittington, said in a Facebook post that a woman was killed in the Benton area when a tree fell on her home.\n\nDozens of tornado warnings were issued in Louisiana and Arkansas on Monday evening.\n\nTexas state and local officials warned it could take several days to fully restore power after Beryl came ashore as a category 1 hurricane, toppled 10 transmission lines and knocked down trees that took down power lines.\n\nBeryl on Tuesday was far less powerful than the category 5 behemoth - the earliest on record in the Atlantic basin - that previously tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean.\n\nBut its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth, and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roadways.\n\nThe loss of power was an all-too familiar experience for Houston: powerful storms had just ripped through the area in May, killing eight people, leaving nearly 1 million without power and flooding numerous streets.\n\nPower crews were working to restore service as quickly as possible, an urgent priority for homes also left without air conditioning in the middle of summer. Temperatures in the 90s Fahrenheit (above 32.2C) were expected on Tuesday. The NWS issued a heat advisory that said the area heat index could reach 105F (40.5C).\n\nThe state was opening cooling centers as well as food and water distribution centers, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations.\n\nBeryl was supercharged by extremely hot ocean temperatures resulting from the burning of fossil, according to experts. Its rains pounded Houston and other areas of the coast on Monday, reclosing streets in neighborhoods that had already been washed out by previous storms. Houston officials reported at least 25 water rescues by Monday afternoon, mostly for people with vehicles stuck in flood waters.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

As frustration mounted, state officials faced questions over whether the power utility that covers much of the area had sufficiently prepared.\n\nNearly 36 hours after Beryl made landfall, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said that a sports and event complex would be used to temporarily hold up to 250 hospital patients who are awaiting discharge but cannot be released to homes with no power.\n\nPeople were coping as best they could.\n\n\"We can handle it, but not the kids,\" Walter Perez said as he arrived at celebrity pastor Joel Osteen's megachurch in Houston, which served as a cooling center and distributed 40-bottle packs of water.\n\nPerez said his wife, 3-year-old son, 3-week-old daughter and his father-in-law retreated from their apartment after a night he described as \"bad, bad, bad, bad.\"\n\nAn executive for CenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, defended the utility's preparation and response.\n\n\"From my perspective to have a storm pass at 3 p.m. in the afternoon, have those crews come in in the late evening, and have everything ready by 5 a.m. to go out and get out and start the workforce is rather impressive because we're talking about thousands of crews,\" Brad Tutunjian, vice president of regulatory policy with CenterPoint Energy, said at a media briefing.\n\nHighs in the Houston area on Tuesday climbed back into the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius) with humidity that made it feel even hotter. Similar heat and humidity was expected Wednesday. The National Weather Service described the conditions as potentially dangerous given the lack of power and air conditioning.\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean.\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, emphasized that restoring power was the top priority.\n\nPatrick, who is serving as acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is overseas, said nursing homes and assisted living centers were the highest priority. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nFor many in the Houston area it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nPatrons on Tuesday lined up on one block to eat at KFC, Jack in the Box or Denny's. Dwight Yell took a disabled neighbor who did not have power to Denny's for some food.\n\nHe complained that city and state officials did not alert residents well enough to a storm initially projected to land much farther down the coast: \"They didn't give us enough warning, where maybe we could go get gas or prepare to go out of town if the lights go out.\"\n\nRobin Taylor, who got takeout from Denny's, has been living a hotel since her home was damaged by the storms in May. When Beryl hit, her hotel room flooded.\n\n\"No WiFi, no power, and it's hot outside,\" Taylor said. \"People will die in this heat in their homes.\"\n\nKyuta Allen brought her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet.\n\n\"During the day you can have the doors open but at night you've got to board up and lock up -- lock yourself like into a sauna,\" she said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Similar heat and humidity was expected on Wednesday. The National Weather Service described the conditions as potentially dangerous given the lack of power and air conditioning.\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean.\n\nMore than 1.7 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday night, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us.

Dwight Yell took a disabled neighbor who did not have power to Denny's for some food.\n\nHe complained that city and state officials did not alert residents well enough to a storm initially projected to land much farther down the coast: \"They didn't give us enough warning, where maybe we could go get gas or prepare to go out of town if the lights go out.\"\n\nRobin Taylor, who got takeout from Denny's, has been living a hotel since her home was damaged by storms that hit the city in May. When Beryl hit, her hotel room flooded.\n\n\"No WiFi, no power, and it's hot outside,\" Taylor said. \"People will die in this heat in their homes.\"\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, emphasized that restoring power was the top priority. CenterPoint Energy in Houston has said it aims to restore power to 1 million customers by the end of Wednesday.\n\nTexas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is serving as acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is overseas, said nursing homes and assisted living centers were the highest priority. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nAn executive for CenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, defended the utility's preparation and response.\n\n\"From my perspective to have a storm pass at 3 p.m. in the afternoon, have those crews come in in the late evening, and have everything ready by 5

Here's why, and the rush to fix it", "body": "DALLAS (AP) -- It could take days or longer to fully restore power to the Houston area after Hurricane Beryl slammed into Texas, leaving millions of residents in the dark and without air conditioning in searing summer heat.\n\nThe slow pace of restoring power in America's fourth-largest city has put CenterPoint Energy, Houston's utility provider, under mounting scrutiny over whether it was sufficiently prepared before the storm and was working fast enough to get the lights back on.\n\nSome Houston residents -- who are all too familiar with enduring natural disasters -- have also questioned why one of the largest cities on the Gulf Coast appeared to wilt under Beryl and was unable to better withstand a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nBeryl was no longer a Category 5 behemoth by the time it reached the U.S. before sunrise Monday. It made landfall as a weakened hurricane with sustained winds of 80 mph (128 kpm) after having already torn a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean.\n\nIn the Houston area, Beryl toppled transmission lines, uprooted trees and snapped branches that crashed onto power lines. By Wedesday afternoon -- nearly 60 hours after landfall -- about 1.3 million homes and businesses were still without power Wednesday, according to CenterPoint Energy. The utility said it had restored electricity to nearly 1 million customers who lost power during Beryl.\n\nTypically sweltering summer heat along the Texas coast has added to the urgency of restoring power. Temperatures on Wednesday were back above 90 degrees (above 32.2 Celsius), prompting the city to open cooling centers for residents without air conditioning.\n\nCenterPoint Energy has defended its preparation for the storm and said that it had brought in nearly 12,000 additional workers from outside Houston since landfall to expedite power restoration.\n\nUnder sometimes sharp questioning Wednesday from Houston city councilmembers about the utiltity's handling of the storm, Brad Tutunjian, vice president for regulatory policy for CenterPoint Energy, said it wouldn't have been safe to pre-position outside crews to \"ride out\" the storm.\n\nHe said the extensive damage to trees and power poles has hampered the ability to restore power quickly.\n\n\"That's where all the time comes in to do the restoration work,\" he said.\n\nRural communities in Beryl's path are also struggling to get power restored quickly. In coastal Matagorda County, where Beryl made landfall, officials said it may take up to two weeks to get the electricity back on for around 2,500 customers in the hard-hit community of Sargent, where homes were destroyed and badly damaged.\n\nBeryl is just the latest natural disaster to wreak havoc on the power grid in the Houston area. In May, a powerful storm that ripped through the area with high winds left nearly 1 million people without power.\n\nHouston was also hit hard in 2021 when Texas' power grid failed during a deadly winter storm that brought plunging temperatures, snow and ice. Millions of Texans lost power during that storm and were left to ride it out in frigid homes, or flee.\n\nIn 2008, Hurricane Ike made landfall on Galveston Island as a Category 2 hurricane with 110-mph (177-kph) sustained winds, bringing flooding and wind damage to the Houston area. After that storm, about 2.2 million CenterPoint customers were without power, according to the Harris County Flood Control District, which said that 75% of the power was restored by day 10.\n\nTexas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick has been the face of the state's response while Gov. Greg Abbott is on an economic development visit to Asia, where he's traveling to Taiwan, South Korea and Japan.\n\nAbbott left Texas on Friday with a delegation that included other lawmakers, state officials and civic leaders. On Tuesday, Abbott posted on social media that he has remained in contact with emergency management officials and Patrick, who is the acting governor while Abbott is traveling.\n\n\"We'll remain engaged until every Texan recovers,\" he wrote.\n\nRepublican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas was criticized in 2021 for traveling to Cancun while his state suffered through a deadly freeze. This week, Cruz has traveled along the coast visiting hard-hit communities alongside state officials. On Tuesday, Cruz said he was sleeping on a friend's couch after his own home in Houston lost power.", "source": {"uri": "ktar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTAR News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The National Weather Service described the conditions as potentially dangerous given the lack of power and air conditioning.\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean.\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, emphasized that restoring power was the top priority.\n\nPatrick, who is serving as acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is overseas, said nursing homes and assisted living centers were the highest priority. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nFor many in the Houston area it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nPatrons on Tuesday lined up on one block to eat at KFC, Jack in the Box or Denny's. Dwight Yell took a disabled neighbor who did not have power to Denny's for some food.\n\nHe complained that city and state officials did not alert residents well enough to a storm initially projected to land much farther down the coast: \"They didn't give us enough warning, where maybe we could go get gas or prepare to go out of town if the lights go out.\"\n\nRobin Taylor, who got takeout from Denny's, has been living a hotel since her home was damaged by the storms in May. When Beryl hit, her hotel room flooded.\n\n\"No WiFi, no power, and it's hot outside,\" Taylor said. \"People will die in this heat in their homes.\"\n\nKyuta Allen brought her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet.\n\n\"During the day you can have the doors open but at night you've got to board up and lock up -- lock yourself like into a sauna,\" she said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas; Sara Cline in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Jeff Martin in Atlanta; and Sarah Brumfield in Silver Spring, Maryland, contributed.",

State officials were questioned whether utilities were prepared in advance, and at least one said they would withhold judgement until after the lights were turned back on.\n\nA heat advisory took effect through Wednesday in the Houston area and beyond, with temperatures expected to soar into the 90s and humidity that could make it feel as hot as 105 degrees. The National Weather Service described the conditions as potentially dangerous given the lack of power and air conditioning.\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths and at least 11 in the Caribbean. At midday Tuesday, it was a post-tropical cyclone centered over Arkansas and was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flooding to a swath extending to the Great Lakes and Canada.\n\nPeople are also reading...

For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nFood spoiled in powerless refrigerators in neighborhoods that pined for air conditioning. Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck or gas station that had power and was open.\n\nPatrons lined up on one block to eat at KFC, Jack in the Box or Denny's -- or just to get a few minutes in some cooler air.\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, said at a news conference with other officials that restoring power is the No. 1 priority. In Washington, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration.\n\nEmergency crews hoped to have power restored to an additional 1 million people by the end of the day, she said.\n\nIt could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country. Sixteen hospitals were on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nPatrick said he would evaluate later whether utilities had taken proper steps before the storm to mount a swift response.\n\nCenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, said it would bring in about 12,000 workers from around the region to help restore power. A company spokesperson said those workers weren't staged in the Houston area before the storm hit, noting that forecasts initially predicted it would go much further south.\n\nKyuta Allen brought her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet for work and the night classes she takes online.\n\n\"You can't really get a lot of stuff done when you are hot,\" she said, adding it is also hard to sleep in the heat.\n\n\"During the day you can have the doors open but at night you've got to board up and lock up -- lock yourself like into a sauna,\" she said.\n\nLesley Briones, a Harris County commissioner, who visited a community center, said she's been told of people waiting hours to get gas.\n\n\"It's catastrophic when you lose everything in your fridge and you are living check to check,\" Briones said.\n\nBeryl's strength at midday Tuesday -- with sustained winds near 30 mph -- wasn't expected to change much in the next two days. It was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry issued a state of emergency Tuesday afternoon for part of that state after trees were knocked down, homes were damaged and thousands lost power.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that already teetered in saturated earth and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\nBeryl was the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 in the Atlantic. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed more than $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nFrom the Caribbean to Texas, Hurricane Beryl leaves a trail of destruction 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nLocal Weather\n\nGet the daily forecast and severe weather alerts in your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "siouxcityjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sioux City Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "juan_a_lozano@siouxcityjournal.com", "name": "Juan A.

At midday Tuesday, it was a post-tropical cyclone centered over Arkansas and was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flooding to a swath extending to the Great Lakes and Canada.\n\nMore than 2.1 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, said at a news conference with other officials that restoring power is the No. 1 priority. And in Washington, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration. Emergency crews hope to have power restored to another 1 million people by the end of the day, she said.\n\nFood spoiled in listless refrigerators in neighborhoods that pined for air conditioning. Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck or gas station that had power and was open.\n\nDamonte Oliver, 32, visited Osteen's Lakewood Church with his girlfriend and her mother. Their apartment had lost power for days after the May storm.\n\n\"I know they are trying to do their best to get everything back on. It's just a waiting game on how long it's going to take,\" he said before walking to a convenience store to buy cigarettes.\n\n\"I've got to calm down a little bit myself,\" Oliver said.\n\nIt could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nBeryl's strength at midday Tuesday -- with sustained winds near 30 mph (48 kph) -- wasn't expected to change much in the next two days. It was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in saturated earth and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\nBeryl was the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 in the Atlantic. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\n___\n\nContributing

State officials faced questions over whether the power utility that covers much of the area had sufficiently prepared.\n\nTexas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said that a sports and event complex would be used to temporarily hold up to 250 hospital patients who are awaiting discharge but cannot be released to homes with no power.\n\nBeryl, which made landfall in Texas early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean. It weakened as it moved deeper into the U.S. and early Wednesday was a post-tropical cyclone centered over northeastern Indiana.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. The storm spawned suspected tornadoes in parts of Indiana and Kentucky.\n\nIn the Houston area, Beryl compounded and repeated the misery of May, when storms killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power.\n\nHigh temperatures Tuesday climbed into the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius) with humidity that made it feel even hotter. Similar heat and humidity were expected on Wednesday. The National Weather Service described the conditions as potentially dangerous, given the lack of power and air conditioning.\n\nPeople coped as best they could.

State officials were questioned whether utilities were prepared in advance, and at least one said they would withhold judgement until after the lights were turned back on.\n\nA heat advisory took effect through Wednesday in the Houston area and beyond, with temperatures expected to soar into the 90s and humidity that could make it feel as hot as 105 degrees. The National Weather Service described the conditions as potentially dangerous given the lack of power and air conditioning.\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths and at least 11 in the Caribbean. At midday Tuesday, it was a post-tropical cyclone centered over Arkansas and was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flooding to a swath extending to the Great Lakes and Canada.\n\nPeople are also reading...

For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nFood spoiled in powerless refrigerators in neighborhoods that pined for air conditioning. Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck or gas station that had power and was open.\n\nPatrons lined up on one block to eat at KFC, Jack in the Box or Denny's -- or just to get a few minutes in some cooler air.\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, said at a news conference with other officials that restoring power is the No. 1 priority. In Washington, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration.\n\nEmergency crews hoped to have power restored to an additional 1 million people by the end of the day, she said.\n\nIt could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country. Sixteen hospitals were on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nPatrick said he would evaluate later whether utilities had taken proper steps before the storm to mount a swift response.\n\nCenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, said it would bring in about 12,000 workers from around the region to help restore power. A company spokesperson said those workers weren't staged in the Houston area before the storm hit, noting that forecasts initially predicted it would go much further south.\n\nKyuta Allen brought her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet for work and the night classes she takes online.\n\n\"You can't really get a lot of stuff done when you are hot,\" she said, adding it is also hard to sleep in the heat.\n\n\"During the day you can have the doors open but at night you've got to board up and lock up -- lock yourself like into a sauna,\" she said.\n\nLesley Briones, a Harris County commissioner, who visited a community center, said she's been told of people waiting hours to get gas.\n\n\"It's catastrophic when you lose everything in your fridge and you are living check to check,\" Briones said.\n\nBeryl's strength at midday Tuesday -- with sustained winds near 30 mph -- wasn't expected to change much in the next two days. It was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry issued a state of emergency Tuesday afternoon for part of that state after trees were knocked down, homes were damaged and thousands lost power.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean.

It still threatens flooding on its path northward", "body": "Kira Dehnel, center, walks with Samantha Ratra, right, and Noah Dehnel in the choppy surf on the beach as the remaining rain bands approach from Beryl Monday, July 8, 2024, in Galveston, Texas. Tropical Storm Beryl was unleashing heavy rains and powerful winds along the Texas coast, knocking out power to homes and businesses and flooding streets with fast-rising waters.\n\nHOUSTON (AP) -- Many of the millions left without power after Hurricane Beryl crashed into Texas, killing several people and unleashing flooding, sweltered and fretted Tuesday as the storm deprived them of air conditioning, food and water in dangerous heat.\n\nA heat advisory took effect through Wednesday in the Houston area and beyond, with temperatures expected to soar into the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius) and humidity that could make it feel as hot as 105 degrees (40.5 Celsius).\n\n\"We can handle it, but not the kids,\" said Walter Perez, 49, as he arrived early Tuesday at celebrity pastor Joel Osteen's megachurch in Houston, which served as a cooling center and distributed 40-bottle packs of water to cars that drove up.\n\nPerez said he, his wife, their 3-year-old son and 3-week-old daughter, and his father-in-law retreated from their apartment after a night he described as \"bad, bad, bad, bad.\"\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas, officials said. At midday Tuesday, it was a post-tropical cyclone centered over Arkansas and was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flooding to a swath extending to the Great Lakes and Canada.\n\nMore than 2.2 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nFood spoiled in listless refrigerators in neighborhoods that pined for air conditioning. Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck or gas station that had power and was open.\n\nDamonte Oliver, 32, visited Osteen's Lakewood Church with his girlfriend and her mother. Their apartment had lost power for days after the May storm.\n\n\"I know they are trying to do their best to get everything back on. It's just a waiting game on how long it's going to take,\" he said before walking to a convenience store to buy cigarettes.\n\n\"I've got to calm down a little bit myself,\" Oliver said.\n\nIt could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nBeryl's strength at midday Tuesday -- with sustained winds near 30 mph (48 kph) -- wasn't expected to change much in the next two days. It was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in saturated earth and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\nBeryl, the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nContributing to this report were Associated Press journalists Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas; Sara Cline in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Jeff Martin in Atlanta; and Sarah Brumfield in Silver Spring, Maryland.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@register-herald.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "juan_a_lozano@register-herald.com", "name": "Juan A.

As frustration mounted, state officials faced questions over whether the power utility that covers much of the area had sufficiently prepared.\n\nNearly 36 hours after Beryl made landfall, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said that a sports and event complex would be used to temporarily hold up to 250 hospital patients who are awaiting discharge but cannot be released to homes with no power.\n\nPeople were coping as best they could.\n\n\"We can handle it, but not the kids,\" Walter Perez said as he arrived at celebrity pastor Joel Osteen's megachurch in Houston, which served as a cooling center and distributed 40-bottle packs of water.\n\nPerez said his wife, 3-year-old son, 3-week-old daughter and his father-in-law retreated from their apartment after a night he described as \"bad, bad, bad, bad.\"\n\nAn executive for CenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, defended the utility's preparation and response.\n\n\"From my perspective to have a storm pass at 3 p.m. in the afternoon, have those crews come in in the late evening, and have everything ready by 5 a.m. to go out and get out and start the workforce is rather impressive because we're talking about thousands of crews,\" Brad Tutunjian, vice president of regulatory policy with CenterPoint Energy, said at a media briefing.\n\nHighs in the Houston area on Tuesday climbed back into the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius) with humidity that made it feel even hotter. Similar heat and humidity was expected Wednesday. The National Weather Service described the conditions as potentially dangerous given the lack of power and air conditioning.\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean.\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, emphasized that restoring power was the top priority.\n\nPatrick, who is serving as acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is overseas, said nursing homes and assisted living centers were the highest priority. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nFor many in the Houston area it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nPatrons on Tuesday lined up on one block to eat at KFC, Jack in the Box or Denny's. Dwight Yell took a disabled neighbor who did not have power to Denny's for some food.\n\nHe complained that city and state officials did not alert residents well enough to a storm initially projected to land much farther down the coast: \"They didn't give us enough warning, where maybe we could go get gas or prepare to go out of town if the lights go out.\"\n\nRobin Taylor, who got takeout from Denny's, has been living a hotel since her home was damaged by the storms in May. When Beryl hit, her hotel room flooded.\n\n\"No WiFi, no power, and it's hot outside,\" Taylor said. \"People will die in this heat in their homes.\"\n\nKyuta Allen brought her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet.\n\n\"During the day you can have the doors open but at night you've got to board up and lock up -- lock yourself like into a sauna,\" she said.\n\nAssociated Press journalists Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas; Sara Cline in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Jeff Martin in Atlanta; and Sarah Brumfield in Silver Spring, Maryland, contributed.\n\nMore from this section\n\nInformative Research Adds Brandon Hall as New EVP of Operations\n\nDirect Mail Benchmark Report 2024 reveals 61% of marketers have increased direct mail investments in the last year\n\nProNotary Announces Exciting New Partner Program", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kulr8.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "juan_a_lozano@kulr8.com", "name": "Juan A.

That's down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday.\n\nA heat advisory took effect through Wednesday in the Houston area and beyond, with temperatures expected to soar into the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius) and humidity that could make it feel as hot as 105 degrees (40.5 Celsius).\n\nREAD MORE: We're in literal hot water this hurricane season\n\n\"We can handle it, but not the kids,\" said Walter Perez, 49, as he arrived early Tuesday at celebrity pastor Joel Osteen's megachurch in Houston, which served as a cooling center and distributed 40-bottle packs of water to cars that drove up.\n\nPerez said he, his wife, their 3-year-old son and 3-week-old daughter, and his father-in-law retreated from their apartment after a night he described as \"bad, bad, bad, bad.\"\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean. At midday Tuesday, it was a post-tropical cyclone centered over Arkansas and was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flooding to a swath extending to the Great Lakes and Canada.\n\nFor many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nFood spoiled in listless refrigerators in neighborhoods that pined for air conditioning. Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck or gas station that had power and was open.\n\nDamonte Oliver, 32, visited Osteen's Lakewood Church with his girlfriend and her mother. Their apartment had lost power for days after the May storm.\n\n\"I know they are trying to do their best to get everything back on. It's just a waiting game on how long it's going to take,\" he said before walking to a convenience store to buy cigarettes.\n\n\"I've got to calm down a little bit myself,\" Oliver said.\n\nIt could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nBeryl's strength at midday Tuesday -- with sustained winds near 30 mph (48 kph) -- wasn't expected to change much in the next two days. It was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in saturated earth and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\nBeryl was the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 in the Atlantic. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\n___\n\nContributing to this report were Associated Press journalists Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas; Sara Cline in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Jeff Martin in Atlanta; and Sarah Brumfield in Silver Spring, Maryland.", "source": {"uri": "pbs.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "PBS.org"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@pbs.org", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "juan_a_lozano@pbs.org", "name": "Juan A.

Residents were left struggling to find ways to stay cool and access fuel as prolonged power outages put a strain on one of the nation's major cities.\n\nThere was growing frustration over Houston's response to a storm that was less severe than previous ones, prompting inquiries into whether the local power utility had adequately prepared for the situation.\n\nTexas officials faced scrutiny for the handling of the aftermath, with questions raised about the readiness of the utility company serving much of the affected area. Nearly two days after Beryl's landfall, the lieutenant governor announced plans to utilize a sports and event complex to accommodate around 250 hospital patients awaiting discharge but unable to return home due to power outages.\n\nPeople were coping as best they could.\n\n\"We can handle it, but not the kids,\" Walter Perez said as he arrived Tuesday at celebrity pastor Joel Osteen's megachurch in Houston, which served as a cooling center and distributed 40-bottle packs of water.\n\nPerez said his wife, 3-year-old son, 3-week-old daughter and his father-in-law retreated from their apartment after a night he described as \"bad, bad, bad, bad.\"\n\nHighs in the Houston area on Tuesday climbed back into the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius) with humidity that made it feel even hotter. Similar heat and humidity was expected on Wednesday. The National Weather Service described the conditions as potentially dangerous given the lack of power and air conditioning.\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean.\n\nMore than 1.7 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday night, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nPatrons on Tuesday lined up on one block to eat at KFC, Jack in the Box or Denny's. Dwight Yell took a disabled neighbor who did not have power to Denny's for some food.\n\nHe complained that city and state officials did not alert residents well enough to a storm initially projected to land much farther down the coast: \"They didn't give us enough warning, where maybe we could go get gas or prepare to go out of town if the lights go out.\"\n\nRobin Taylor, who got takeout from Denny's, has been living a hotel since her home was damaged by storms that hit the city in May. When Beryl hit, her hotel room flooded.\n\n\"No WiFi, no power, and it's hot outside,\" Taylor said. \"People will die in this heat in their homes.\"\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, emphasized that restoring power was the top priority. CenterPoint Energy in Houston has said it aims to restore power to 1 million customers by the end of Wednesday.\n\nTexas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is serving as acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is overseas, said nursing homes and assisted living centers were the highest priority. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nAn executive for CenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, defended the utility's preparation and response.\n\n\"From my perspective to have a storm pass at 3 p.m. in the afternoon, have those crews come in in the late evening, and have everything ready by 5 a.m. to go out and get out and start the workforce is rather impressive because we're talking about thousands of crews,\" Brad Tutunjian, vice president of regulatory policy with CenterPoint Energy, said at a media briefing on Tuesday.\n\nKyuta Allen brought her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet.\n\n\"During the day you can have the doors open but at night you've got to board up and lock up - lock yourself like into a sauna,\" she said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas; Sara Cline in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Jeff Martin

The super storm brought howling winds and torrential rain on Monday, flooding highways, closing oil ports, canceling more than 1,300 flights and knocking out power at more than 2.7 million houses and businesses. Some hospitals in the Houston suffered damage during the storm and have been forced to close their doors Tuesday to non-emergency appointments. At least one is operating on generator power.\n\nBeryl hit land as a Category 1 hurricane, strengthening from a tropical storm over the Gulf of Mexico. It later weakened into a tropical depression with maximum wind speeds of about 35mph. The storm, which was expected to rapidly weaken as it moved inland, swept a destructive path through Jamaica, Grenada, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines last week. It killed at least 11 in Mexico and the Caribbean and before reaching Texas. Beryl was blamed for killing several people in Texas on Monday and at least one person in Louisiana , officials said.\n\nAfter a peak Monday of more than 2.7million customers around Houston without power, the numbers improved to more than 2.4million homes and businesses lacking electricity by Monday night, according to PowerOutage.us. Several hospitals and health clinics throughout the Greater Houston area were forced to hunker down during the storm, impacting their services. Most hospitals have remained open and are providing emergency medical assistance, The Houston Business Journal reported.\n\nHowever, some have closed outpatient services, specialty facilities, health centers, and same-day clinics. Patients whose appointments have been canceled will be rescheduled. St. Luke's Health system's Brazosport Hospital, located in Lake Jackson, was among the facilities damaged during the storm. It is currently operating on generator power and accepted new emergency patients. Officials told the newspaper that no staff or patients were injured, however some people receiving treatment had to be relocated in the facility. MD Anderson Cancer Center has closed its facility for all appointments except for emergency procedures at its Texas Medical Center campus.\n\nState officials have yet to assess the economic damage as officials remained on a rescue footing while powerful winds continued to blow. Restoring power would take several days, said Thomas Gleeson, chair of the Texas Public Utility Commission. More than 2,500 first responders were deployed statewide, said Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management. The lack of cooling to people's homes, downed power lines and non-functioning traffic lights has led officials to ask residents to stay home if possible.\n\n'Houstonians need to know we're working around the clock so you will be safe,' Houston Mayor John Whitmire said Monday at a media briefing, urging residents to also know the dangers of high water, to stay hydrated and to check on their neighbors. Power crews are working to restore service as quickly as possible, an urgent priority for homes also left without air conditioning in the middle of summer. Temperatures in the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius) were expected Tuesday. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory that said the area heat index could reach 105 F (40.5 C).\n\nThe state was opening cooling centers as well as food and water distribution centers, said Nim Kidd, chief of state emergency operations. A flood watch was in place Tuesday across multiple U.S. states as tropical depression Beryl lashes the country's south with heavy rain after killing at least four people in Texas. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) said Beryl could bring flash flooding 'from the lower and mid Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes' through Wednesday as it sweeps across swathes of the United States. A tornado is also possible Tuesday across parts of the south, the NHC said in its latest advisory.\n\nDespite weakening to a tropical depression, Beryl still packed a punch on Monday, with the National Weather Service confirming that tornadoes had been spotted in northeastern Louisiana. Bossier Sheriff Julian Whittington said in a Facebook post that a woman was killed in the Benton area when a tree fell on her home. Dozens of tornado warnings were issued in Louisiana and Arkansas on Monday evening and they continued into the night.\n\nTexas state and local officials warned it could take several days to fully restore power after Beryl came ashore as a Category 1 hurricane and toppled 10 transmission lines and knocked down trees that took down power lines. Beryl on Tuesday was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean last weekend. But its winds and rains were still powerful enough to knock down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in water-saturated earth, and strand dozens of cars on flooded roadways. 'We're not past any difficult conditions,' said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

At midday Tuesday, it was a post-tropical cyclone centered over Arkansas and was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flooding to a swath extending to the Great Lakes and Canada.\n\nMore than 2.2 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nFood spoiled in listless refrigerators in neighborhoods that pined for air conditioning. Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck or gas station that had power and was open.\n\nDamonte Oliver, 32, visited Osteen's Lakewood Church with his girlfriend and her mother. Their apartment had lost power for days after the May storm.\n\n\"I know they are trying to do their best to get everything back on. It's just a waiting game on how long it's going to take,\" he said before walking to a convenience store to buy cigarettes.\n\n\"I've got to calm down a little bit myself,\" Oliver said.\n\nIt could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nBeryl's strength at midday Tuesday -- with sustained winds near 30 mph (48 kph) -- wasn't expected to change much in the next two days. It was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in saturated earth and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\nBeryl was the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 in the Atlantic. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.", "source": {"uri":

State officials were questioned whether utilities were prepared in advance, and at least one said they would withhold judgement until after the lights were turned back on.\n\nA heat advisory took effect through Wednesday in the Houston area and beyond, with temperatures expected to soar into the 90s and humidity that could make it feel as hot as 105 degrees. The National Weather Service described the conditions as potentially dangerous given the lack of power and air conditioning.\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths and at least 11 in the Caribbean. At midday Tuesday, it was a post-tropical cyclone centered over Arkansas and was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flooding to a swath extending to the Great Lakes and Canada.\n\nPeople are also reading...

For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nFood spoiled in powerless refrigerators in neighborhoods that pined for air conditioning. Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck or gas station that had power and was open.\n\nPatrons lined up on one block to eat at KFC, Jack in the Box or Denny's -- or just to get a few minutes in some cooler air.\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, said at a news conference with other officials that restoring power is the No. 1 priority. In Washington, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration.\n\nEmergency crews hoped to have power restored to an additional 1 million people by the end of the day, she said.\n\nIt could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country. Sixteen hospitals were on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nPatrick said he would evaluate later whether utilities had taken proper steps before the storm to mount a swift response.\n\nCenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, said it would bring in about 12,000 workers from around the region to help restore power. A company spokesperson said those workers weren't staged in the Houston area before the storm hit, noting that forecasts initially predicted it would go much further south.\n\nKyuta Allen brought her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet for work and the night classes she takes online.\n\n\"You can't really get a lot of stuff done when you are hot,\" she said, adding it is also hard to sleep in the heat.\n\n\"During the day you can have the doors open but at night you've got to board up and lock up -- lock yourself like into a sauna,\" she said.\n\nLesley Briones, a Harris County commissioner, who visited a community center, said she's been told of people waiting hours to get gas.\n\n\"It's catastrophic when you lose everything in your fridge and you are living check to check,\" Briones said.\n\nBeryl's strength at midday Tuesday -- with sustained winds near 30 mph -- wasn't expected to change much in the next two days. It was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry issued a state of emergency Tuesday afternoon for part of that state after trees were knocked down, homes were damaged and thousands lost power.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that already teetered in saturated earth and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\nBeryl was the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 in the Atlantic. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed more than $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nFrom the Caribbean to Texas, Hurricane Beryl leaves a trail of destruction 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nLocal Weather\n\nGet the daily forecast and severe weather alerts in your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "qctimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Quad-City Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "juan_a_lozano@qctimes.com", "name": "Juan A.

The National Weather Service described the conditions as potentially dangerous given the lack of power and air conditioning.\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category one hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven US deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean.\n\nNearly two million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly one million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nFood spoilt in listless refrigerators in neighbourhoods that pined for air conditioning. Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck or gas station that had power and was open.\n\nPatrons lined up on one block to eat at KFC, Jack in the Box or Denny's -- or just to get a few minutes in some cooler air. Dwight Yell, 54, had power at his house but took a disabled neighbour, who did not, to Denny's for some food.\n\nHe complained that city and state officials did not alert residents well enough to a storm initially projected to land much farther down the coast: \"They didn't give us enough warning, where maybe we could go get gas or prepare to go out of town if the lights go out.\"\n\nRobin Taylor, who got takeout from Denny's, was getting tired of the same old struggle. She has been living in a hotel since her home was damaged by the storms in May. When Beryl hit, her hotel room flooded.\n\nShe was angry that Houston didn't appear prepared to handle the Category one storm after it had weathered much stronger ones in the past.\n\n\"No Wi-Fi, no power, and it's hot outside. That's dangerous for people. That's really the big issue,\" Taylor said. \"People will die in this heat in their homes.\"\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, emphasised that restoring power was the top priority. CenterPoint Energy in Houston has said it aims to restore power to one million customers by the end of Wednesday.\n\nBut for others, getting the lights back could take several more days or longer. Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, who is serving as acting governor while Governor Greg Abbott is overseas, said nursing homes and assisted living centres were the highest priority. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nPatrick urged utilities to restore power quickly and said he would evaluate later whether they did enough before the storm.\n\nAn executive for CenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, defended the utility's preparation and response.\n\n\"From my perspective to have a storm pass at 3 p.m. in the afternoon, have those crews come in in the late evening, and have everything ready by 5 a.m. to go out and get out and start the workforce is rather impressive because we're talking about thousands of crews,\" Brad Tutunjian, vice president of regulatory policy with CenterPoint Energy, said at a media briefing on Tuesday .", "source": {"uri":

Similar heat and humidity was expected on Wednesday. The National Weather Service described the conditions as potentially dangerous given the lack of power and air conditioning.\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean.\n\nMore than 1.7 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday night, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nPatrons on Tuesday lined up on one block to eat at KFC, Jack in the Box or Denny's. Dwight Yell took a disabled neighbor who did not have power to Denny's for some food.\n\nHe complained that city and state officials did not alert residents well enough to a storm initially projected to land much farther down the coast: \"They didn't give us enough warning, where maybe we could go get gas or prepare to go out of town if the lights go out.\"\n\nRobin Taylor, who got takeout from Denny's, has been living a hotel since her home was damaged by storms that hit the city in May. When Beryl hit, her hotel room flooded.\n\n\"No WiFi, no power, and it's hot outside,\" Taylor said. \"People will die in this heat in their homes.\"\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, emphasized that restoring power was the top priority. CenterPoint Energy in Houston has said it aims to restore power to 1 million customers by the end of Wednesday.\n\nTexas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is serving as acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is overseas, said nursing homes and assisted living centers were the highest priority. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nAn executive for CenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, defended the utility's preparation and response.\n\n\"From my perspective to have a storm pass at 3 p.m. in the afternoon, have those crews come in in the late evening, and have everything ready by 5 a.m. to go out and get out and start the workforce is rather impressive because we're talking about thousands of crews,\" Brad Tutunjian, vice president of regulatory policy with CenterPoint Energy, said at a media briefing on Tuesday.\n\nKyuta Allen brought her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet.\n\n\"During the day you can have the doors open but at night

After Beryl tore through the state on Monday, leaving at least eight dead -- in the first of a hurricane season that is expected to be historic -- the risk of flooding persists as temperatures increase, driven by a heat wave that is affecting the entire country. State authorities estimate that returning power to the nearly three million homes and businesses that suffered outages from the Category 1 storm will take anywhere from a few days to two weeks.\n\nActing Governor Dan Patrick, who is filling in for Greg Abbott while the latter is out of the country, announced that energy company CenterPoint Energy will bring in thousands of additional workers to restore power. According to Patrick, the hurricane took down 10 transmission lines and many of the service outages were caused by downed trees. Fallen trees also caused several of the deaths attributed to Beryl, along with a house fire believed to have been caused by lightning, and drowning.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall in Texas on Monday it was far from the Category 5 hurricane that had destroyed Caribbean islands and hit parts of Mexico a few days earlier; by then it had been downgraded to tropical storm, but it still unleashed heavy rains. In a short time the flooding had trapped dozens of cars on streets and highways, while the winds knocked down hundreds of trees, already fragile due to the saturated soil. In the coming days the storm is expected to affect several other states. According to the National Hurricane Center, dangerous winds and flash flooding will continue as the storm moves forward.\n\nAs the dark clouds of Beryl gave way to the harsh summer sun, the need to restore power became increasingly urgent as Texas grapples with a heat wave. In the Houston metropolitan area, the fourth most populated city in the country, more than two million homes and businesses suffered outages due to storms for the second time this year, while temperatures were forecast to climb into the mid-90s on Wednesday. The National Weather Service in Houston had a heat advisory in place for Wednesday, warning that \"with power outages continuing across South-East Texas, the lack of air conditioning will aggravate the risk for heat-related illnesses.\"\n\nIn the city of Galveston, south of Houston, authorities warned of difficulties still ahead. \"As efforts move full steam ahead, we want residents to be aware and prepare for a possible multi-day outage. The estimate is between 72 hours and two weeks in some areas.\"\n\nOn Monday afternoon in Houston, the sound of chainsaws echoed as citizens got to work clearing streets and sidewalks of trees and branches that were blocking the roads. But acting governor Patrick warned that flooding could return within the week if heavy rain fell on already highly saturated areas.\n\nThe situation has also affected the industrial engine of the state. This area of Texas has a large number of oil refineries and several companies announced that it has become necessary to activate flaring -- the burning of residual or preventive natural gas due to pressure changes in the plant -- because of changes in the electrical supply. It is not yet clear how much gas was burned, nor what impact on emissions this may have had.\n\nBeryl, the fastest storm to become a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean towards Texas. The storm ripped off doors, windows and roofs with devastating winds and tides fueled by record-breaking Atlantic heat. On three occasions in the past week, Beryl increased its wind speed by 35 miles per hour (56 km/h) in 24 hours or less, the official definition of rapid intensification.\n\nBeryl's explosive growth is due to warm water from the Atlantic and Caribbean and is just a prelude to what the Atlantic hurricane belt can expect for the rest of the season, experts have warned. In Jamaica, authorities said Monday that island residents will face food shortages after Beryl destroyed more than $6.4 million worth of crops and infrastructure.\n\nIn Louisiana, \"the risk will be for heavy rain and the potential for flash flooding,\" the National Weather Service said. State meteorologists are also watching out for \"fast-moving tornadoes,\" said Donald Jones, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Lake Charles, Louisiana. \"It's just a matter of exactly where it's going to be,\" Jones added. \"It is very difficult to predict it more than an hour in advance.\"\n\nBeryl is forecast to bring more rain and strong winds to other states in the coming days. One of them, Missouri, is already dealing with a wet summer. Heavy rains unrelated to the storm prompted several water rescues around the city of Columbia, where rivers and streams were already swollen before Beryl's arrival on Tuesday.", "source": {"uri":

At midday Tuesday, it was a post-tropical cyclone centered over Arkansas and was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flooding to a swath extending to the Great Lakes and Canada.\n\nMore than 2.1 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, said at a news conference with other officials that restoring power is the No. 1 priority. And in Washington, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration. Emergency crews hope to have power restored to another 1 million people by the end of the day, she said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nFood spoiled in listless refrigerators in neighborhoods that pined for air conditioning. Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck or gas station that had power and was open.\n\nDamonte Oliver, 32, visited Osteen's Lakewood Church with his girlfriend and her mother. Their apartment had lost power for days after the May storm.\n\n\"I know they are trying to do their best to get everything back on. It's just a waiting game on how long it's going to take,\" he said before walking to a convenience store to buy cigarettes. \"I've got to calm down a little bit myself.\"\n\nIt could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nBeryl's strength at midday Tuesday -- with sustained winds near 30 mph -- wasn't expected to change much in the next two days. It was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in saturated earth and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\nBeryl was the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 in the Atlantic.

The effects of Hurricane Beryl left most in the area without power. Eric Gay/Associated Press\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas, officials said. At midday Tuesday, it was a post-tropical cyclone centered over Arkansas and was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flooding to a swath extending to the Great Lakes and Canada.\n\nMore than 2.2 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFood spoiled in listless refrigerators in neighborhoods that pined for air conditioning. Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck or gas station that had power and was open.\n\nDamonte Oliver, 32, visited Osteen's Lakewood Church with his girlfriend and her mother. Their apartment had lost power for days after the May storm.\n\n\"I know they are trying to do their best to get everything back on.

Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nBeryl's strength at midday Tuesday -- with sustained winds near 30 mph -- wasn't expected to change much in the next two days. It was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in saturated earth and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\nBeryl, the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nContributing to this report were Associated Press journalists Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas; Sara Cline in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Jeff Martin in Atlanta; and Sarah Brumfield in Silver Spring, Maryland.\n\nCopy the Story

It was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in saturated earth and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\nBeryl, the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nContributing to this report were Associated Press journalists Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas; Sara Cline in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Jeff Martin in Atlanta; and Sarah Brumfield in Silver Spring, Maryland.\n\nMore from this section\n\nNew Industrial Manufacturing Projects Third Month in a Row of Growth with 164 New Projects for June 2024\n\nDirect Mail Benchmark Report 2024 reveals 61% of marketers have increased direct mail investments in the last year\n\nEighteen homebuyer assistance programs offering up to $117,000 are available to help people with disabilities and family caregivers purchase or modify a home", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kulr8.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "juan_a_lozano@kulr8.com", "name": "Juan A.

State officials faced questions over whether the power utility that covers much of the area had sufficiently prepared.\n\nTexas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said that a sports and event complex would be used to temporarily hold up to 250 hospital patients who are awaiting discharge but cannot be released to homes with no power.\n\nBeryl, which made landfall in Texas early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean. It weakened as it moved deeper into the U.S. and early Wednesday was a post-tropical cyclone centered over northeastern Indiana.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. The storm spawned suspected tornadoes in parts of Indiana and Kentucky.\n\nIn the Houston area, Beryl compounded and repeated the misery of May, when storms killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power.\n\nHigh temperatures Tuesday climbed into the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius) with humidity that made it feel even hotter. Similar heat and humidity were expected Wednesday. The National Weather Service described the conditions as potentially dangerous, given the lack of power and air conditioning.\n\nPeople coped as best they could. Kyuta Allen took her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet.\n\n\"During the day you can have the doors open, but at night you've got to board up and lock up -- lock yourself like into a sauna,\" she said.\n\nAn executive for CenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, defended the utility's preparation and response.\n\n\"From my perspective, to have a storm pass at 3 p.m. in the afternoon, have those crews come in in the late evening, and have everything ready by 5 a.m. to go out and get out and start the workforce is rather impressive, because we're talking about thousands of crews,\" said Brad Tutunjian, vice president of regulatory policy.\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, stressed that restoring power was the top priority.\n\nPatrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is overseas, said nursing homes and assisted living centers were the highest priority.

It still threatens flooding on its path northward", "body": "HOUSTON (AP) -- Many of the millions left without power after Hurricane Beryl crashed into Texas, killing several people and unleashing flooding, sweltered and fretted Tuesday as the storm deprived them of air conditioning, food and water in dangerous heat.\n\nA heat advisory took effect through Wednesday in the Houston area and beyond, with temperatures expected to soar into the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius) and humidity that could make it feel as hot as 105 degrees (40.5 Celsius).\n\n\"We can handle it, but not the kids,\" said Walter Perez, 49, as he arrived early Tuesday at celebrity pastor Joel Osteen's megachurch in Houston, which served as a cooling center and distributed 40-bottle packs of water to cars that drove up.\n\nPerez said he, his wife, their 3-year-old son and 3-week-old daughter, and his father-in-law retreated from their apartment after a night he described as \"bad, bad, bad, bad.\"\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas, officials said. At midday Tuesday, it was a post-tropical cyclone centered over Arkansas and was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flooding to a swath extending to the Great Lakes and Canada.\n\nMore than 2.2 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nFood spoiled in listless refrigerators in neighborhoods that pined for air conditioning. Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck or gas station that had power and was open.\n\nDamonte Oliver, 32, visited Osteen's Lakewood Church with his girlfriend and her mother. Their apartment had lost power for days after the May storm.\n\n\"I know they are trying to do their best to get everything back on. It's just a waiting game on how long it's going to take,\" he said before walking to a convenience store to buy cigarettes.\n\n\"I've got to calm down a little bit myself,\" Oliver said.\n\nIt could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nBeryl's strength at midday Tuesday -- with sustained winds near 30 mph (48 kph) -- wasn't expected to change much in the next two days. It was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in saturated earth and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\nBeryl, the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean on its way to Texas. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\n___\n\nContributing

In my opinion, respectfully, they should be on,\" Kamin told a CenterPoint Energy executive during a council meeting.\n\n\"This was a Category 1 (storm),\" Kamin said, referring to the weakest type of hurricane. \"We know that this severe weather, the extreme weather due to climate change, is real and we've known for some time.\"\n\nPower outages peaked at 2.7 million customers after the storm made landfall in Texas on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. Brad Tutunjian, vice president for regulatory policy for CenterPoint Energy, defended the company's response and told council members that more than 1 million customers had their power restored by Wednesday morning, although the company's online tracker put the figure at just under a million at the time.\n\n\"To me, I think that's a monumental number right there,\" he said.\n\nThe company has acknowledged that most of the 12,000 workers it brought in to help the recovery effort were not in the Houston area when the storm arrived. Initial forecasts had the storm blowing ashore much farther south along Gulf Coast, near the Texas-Mexico border, before heading toward Houston.\n\nThe company would not ask third-party workers from other companies and municipalities to pre-position and \"ride out\" the storm, \"because that is not safe,\" he said.\n\n\"We ask you to get as close as possible, so you can respond as efficiently as practical,\" he said of the instructions given to the workers.\n\nTutunjian noted how difficult it is to quickly restore power that was cut off by falling trees and branches.\n\n\"When we have storms such as this, with the tree completely coming down ... taking out our lines and our poles, that's where all the time comes in to do the restoration work,\" he said.\n\nCouncil members pressed Tutunjian about why the company, which has been the Houston area for about 100 years, hasn't lain more of its power lines underground. He replied that it has been laying all new lines underground in residential areas for decades.\n\nTwo council members said they received a text about a house that burned down after reporting a downed power line. The texts reported the fire department said it could not do anything, and the utility company did not respond.\n\nBeryl has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean. It weakened as it moved deeper into the U.S. and early Wednesday was a post-tropical cyclone centered over northeastern Indiana.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. The storm spawned suspected tornadoes in parts of Indiana and Kentucky.\n\nIn the Houston area, Beryl compounded and repeated the misery of May, when storms killed eight people and left nearly a million customers without power.\n\nHigh temperatures in Houston on Wednesday were expected to climb into the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius), with humidity making it feel even hotter.\n\nPeople coped as best they could. Kyuta Allen took her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet.\n\n\"During the day, you can have the doors open. But at night, you've got to board up and lock up -- lock yourself like into a sauna,\" she said.\n\nRaquel Desimone, who sought relief in a cooling center, has lived in the Houston area since about 2000 and has been through multiple hurricanes and tropical storms. Still, was surprised and frustrated having to scrambled yet again for power and shelter from the heat.\n\n\"I went through Rita, Ike, Imelda and Harvey,\" Desimone said. \"That the infrastructure can't handle a basic storm, leaving for a Category 1, (it) is sort of crazy to me that I'm having to do this.\"\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, stressed that restoring power was the top priority.\n\nTexas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is overseas, said nursing homes and assisted living centers were the highest priority. Sixteen hospitals ran on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nState officials planned to use a sports and event complex to temporarily hold up to 250 hospital patients who are awaiting discharge but cannot be released to homes with no power.\n\nPatrick said Tuesday that he would wait until after the recovery effort to focus on CenterPoint's response and whether the company was poorly prepared.\n\n\"CenterPoint will have to answer for themselves, if they were prepared, if they were positions. Their company is responsible for that. The state was in position,\" he said. \"I'll tell you whether I'm satisfied or not when I have a full report of where their crews were when they were asked to come in.\"", "source": {"uri":

State officials faced questions over whether Houston's power utility had sufficiently prepared, including one who said he would withhold judgement until after the lights are back on.\n\nHospitals also started to feel the pinch: Nearly 36 hours after Beryl made landfall, Texas' lieutenant governor said a sports and event complex would be used to temporarily hold up to 250 patients who are awaiting discharge but cannot be released to homes with no power.\n\nPeople coped as best they could.\n\n\"We can handle it, but not the kids,\" said Walter Perez, 49, as he arrived early Tuesday at celebrity pastor Joel Osteen's megachurch in Houston, which served as a cooling center and distributed 40-bottle packs of water.\n\nPerez said his family -- including his wife, a 3-year-old son, a 3-week-old daughter and his father-in-law -- retreated from their apartment after a night he described as \"bad, bad, bad, bad.\"\n\nHighs in the Houston on Tuesday climbed back into the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius) and humidity that could make it feel even hotter. The National Weather Service described the conditions as potentially dangerous given the lack of power and air conditioning.\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean.\n\nNearly 2 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nFood spoiled in listless refrigerators in neighborhoods that pined for air conditioning. Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck or gas station that had power and was open.\n\nPatrons lined up on one block to eat at KFC, Jack in the Box or Denny's -- or just to get a few minutes in some cooler air. Dwight Yell, 54, had power at his house but took a disabled neighbor, who did not, to Denny's for some food.\n\nHe complained that city and state officials did not alert residents well enough to a storm initially projected to land much farther down the coast: \"They didn't give us enough warning, where maybe we could go get gas or prepare to go out of town if the lights go out.\"\n\nRobin Taylor, who got takeout from Denny's, was getting tired of the same old struggle. She has been living a hotel since her home was damaged by the storms in May. When Beryl hit, her hotel room flooded.\n\nShe was angry that Houston didn't appear prepared to handle the Category 1 storm after it had weathered much stronger ones in the past.\n\nToday's Top Headlines\n\nStory continues below\n\nSC restaurateurs charged with bilking federal pandemic loan programs out of $591K A good neighbor's bad decision.

Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is serving as acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is oveseas, said nursing homes and assisted living centers were the highest priority. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nPatrick urged utilities to restore power quickly and said he would evaluate later whether they did enough before the storm.\n\nBrad Tutunjian, vice president of regulatory policy with CenterPoint Energy, said at a media briefing on Tuesday that the utility was fully prepared for the storm and that because the storm didn't move out of the area until Monday afternoon, it took until early Tuesday to get a large number of crews out and working.\n\nAn executive for CenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, defended the utility's preparation and response.\n\n\"From my perspective to have a storm pass at 3 p.m. in the afternoon, have those crews come in in the late evening, and have everything ready by 5 a.m. to go out and get out and start the workforce is rather impressive because we're talking about thousands of crews,\" Brad Tutunjian, vice president of regulatory policy with CenterPoint Energy, said at a media briefing on Tuesday .\n\nKyuta Allen brought her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet for work and the night classes she takes online.\n\n\"During the day you can have the doors open but at night you've got to board up and lock up - lock yourself like into a sauna,\" she said.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry issued a state of emergency Tuesday afternoon for part of that state after trees were knocked down, homes were damaged and thousands lost power.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean.\n\nBeryl was the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 in the Atlantic. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed over $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nContributing to this report were Associated Press journalists Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas; Sara Cline in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Jeff Martin in Atlanta; and Sarah Brumfield in Silver Spring, Maryland.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@postandcourier.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denny's", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denny's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Abu_Dhabi)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The National (Abu Dhabi)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Osteen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joel Osteen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megachurch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Megachurch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Celsius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamma_Mia!_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mamma Mia!

At midday Tuesday, it was a post-tropical cyclone centered over Arkansas and was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flooding to a swath extending to the Great Lakes and Canada.\n\nMore than 2.1 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, said at a news conference with other officials that restoring power is the No. 1 priority. And in Washington, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration. Emergency crews hope to have power restored to another 1 million people by the end of the day, she said.\n\nFood spoiled in listless refrigerators in neighborhoods that pined for air conditioning.

Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country. Sixteen hospitals were running on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nBeryl's strength at midday Tuesday -- with sustained winds near 30 mph (48 kph) -- wasn't expected to change much in the next two days. It was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that had already been teetering in saturated earth and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\nBeryl was the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 in the Atlantic.

Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck or gas station that had power and was open.\n\nPatrons lined up on one block to eat at KFC, Jack in the Box or Denny's -- or just to get a few minutes in some cooler air.\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, said at a news conference with other officials that restoring power is the No. 1 priority. In Washington, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration.\n\nEmergency crews hoped to have power restored to an additional 1 million people by the end of the day, she said.\n\nIt could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country. Sixteen hospitals were on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nPatrick said he would evaluate later whether utilities had taken proper steps before the storm to mount a swift response.\n\nCenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, said it would bring in about 12,000 workers from around the region to help restore power. A company spokesperson said those workers weren't staged in the Houston area before the storm hit, noting that forecasts initially predicted it would go much further south.\n\nKyuta Allen brought her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet for work and the night classes she takes online.\n\n\"You can't really get a lot of stuff done when you are hot,\" she said, adding it is also hard to sleep in the heat.\n\n\"During the day you can have the doors open but at night you've got to board up and lock up -- lock yourself like into a sauna,\" she said.\n\nLesley Briones, a Harris County commissioner, who visited a community center, said she's been told of people waiting hours to get gas.\n\n\"It's catastrophic when you lose everything in your fridge and you are living check to check,\" Briones said.\n\nBeryl's strength at midday Tuesday -- with sustained winds near 30 mph -- wasn't expected to change much in the next two days. It was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry issued a state of emergency Tuesday afternoon for part of that state after trees were knocked down, homes were damaged and thousands lost power.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that already teetered in saturated earth and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\nBeryl was the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 in the Atlantic. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed more than $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "juan_a_lozano@stltoday.com", "name": "Juan A.

That's what they're trained for. It's working.\"\n\nDamaging winds and flash flooding would continue as Beryl pushes inland, forecasters said.\n\nWith parts of the area sweltering in a heatwave, restoring power is an urgent

State officials faced questions over whether the power utility that covers much of the area had sufficiently prepared.\n\nTexas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said that a sports and event complex would be used to temporarily hold up to 250 hospital patients who are awaiting discharge but cannot be released to homes with no power.\n\nBeryl, which made landfall in Texas early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths -- one in Louisiana and six in Texas -- and at least 11 in the Caribbean. It weakened as it moved deeper into the U.S. and early Wednesday was a post-tropical cyclone centered over northeastern Indiana.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. The storm spawned suspected tornadoes in parts of Indiana and Kentucky.\n\nIn the Houston area, Beryl compounded and repeated the misery of May, when storms killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power.\n\nHigh temperatures Tuesday climbed into the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius) with humidity that made it feel even hotter. Similar heat and humidity were expected Wednesday. The National Weather Service described the conditions as potentially dangerous, given the lack of power and air conditioning.\n\nPeople coped as best they could. Kyuta Allen took her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet.\n\n\"During the day you can have the doors open, but at night you've got to board up and lock up -- lock yourself like into a sauna,\" she said.\n\nAn executive for CenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, defended the utility's preparation and response.\n\n\"From my perspective, to have a storm pass at 3 p.m. in the afternoon, have those crews come in in the late evening, and have everything ready by 5 a.m. to go out and get out and start the workforce is rather impressive, because we're talking about thousands of crews,\" said Brad Tutunjian, vice president of regulatory policy.\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, stressed that restoring power was the top priority.\n\nPatrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is overseas, said nursing homes and assisted living centers were the highest priority. Sixteen hospitals ran on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nDownload the FOX13 Memphis app to receive alerts from breaking news in your

At midday Tuesday, it was a post-tropical cyclone centered over Arkansas and was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flooding to a swath extending to the Great Lakes and Canada.\n\nMore than 2 million homes and businesses around Houston lacked electricity Tuesday, down from a peak of more than 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. For many, it was a miserable repeat after storms in May killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power amid flooded streets.\n\nFood spoiled in powerless refrigerators in neighborhoods that pined for air conditioning. Long lines of cars and people queued up at any fast food restaurant, food truck or gas station that had power and was open.\n\nPatrons lined up on one block to eat at KFC, Jack in the Box or Denny's -- or just to get a few minutes in some cooler air.\n\nNim Kidd, head of the state's division of emergency management, said at a news conference with other officials that restoring power is the No. 1 priority. In Washington, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration.\n\nEmergency crews hoped to have power restored to an additional 1 million people by the end of the day, she said.\n\nIt could take days to fully return power in Texas after Beryl toppled 10 transmission lines. Top priorities for power restoration include nursing homes and assisted living centers, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country. Sixteen hospitals were on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nPatrick said he would evaluate later whether utilities had taken proper steps before the storm to mount a swift response.\n\nCenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, said it would bring in about 12,000 workers from around the region to help restore power. A company spokesperson said those workers weren't staged in the Houston area before the storm hit, noting that forecasts initially predicted it would go much further south.\n\nKyuta Allen brought her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet for work and the night classes she takes online.\n\n\"You can't really get a lot of stuff done when you are hot,\" she said, adding it is also hard to sleep in the heat.\n\n\"During the day you can have the doors open but at night you've got to board up and lock up -- lock yourself like into a sauna,\" she said.\n\nLesley Briones, a Harris County commissioner, who visited a community center, said she's been told of people waiting hours to get gas.\n\n\"It's catastrophic when you lose everything in your fridge and you are living check to check,\" Briones said.\n\nBeryl's strength at midday Tuesday -- with sustained winds near 30 mph -- wasn't expected to change much in the next two days. It was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry issued a state of emergency Tuesday afternoon for part of that state after trees were knocked down, homes were damaged and thousands lost power.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that already teetered in saturated earth and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\nBeryl was the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 in the Atlantic. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed more than $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nFrom the Caribbean to Texas, Hurricane Beryl leaves a trail of destruction 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nLocal Weather\n\nGet the daily forecast and severe weather alerts in your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "wcfcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "juan_a_lozano@wcfcourier.com", "name": "Juan A.

Sixteen hospitals were on generator power Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nPatrick said he would evaluate later whether utilities had taken proper steps before the storm to mount a swift response.\n\nCenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, said it would bring in about 12,000 workers from around the region to help restore power. A company spokesperson said those workers weren't staged in the Houston area before the storm hit, noting that forecasts initially predicted it would go much further south.\n\nKyuta Allen brought her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet for work and the night classes she takes online.\n\n\"You can't really get a lot of stuff done when you are hot,\" she said, adding it is also hard to sleep in the heat.\n\n\"During the day you can have the doors open but at night you've got to board up and lock up -- lock yourself like into a sauna,\" she said.\n\nLesley Briones, a Harris County commissioner, who visited a community center, said she's been told of people waiting hours to get gas.\n\n\"It's catastrophic when you lose everything in your fridge and you are living check to check,\" Briones said.\n\nBeryl's strength at midday Tuesday -- with sustained winds near 30 mph -- wasn't expected to change much in the next two days. It was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flash flooding from the lower and mid-Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes into Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. A few tornadoes were possible in Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, forecasters said.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry issued a state of emergency Tuesday afternoon for part of that state after trees were knocked down, homes were damaged and thousands lost power.\n\nWhen Beryl made landfall, it was far less powerful than the Category 5 behemoth that tore a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean. But its winds and rains still knocked down hundreds of trees that already teetered in saturated earth and stranded dozens of cars on flooded roads.\n\nBeryl was the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 in the Atlantic. In Jamaica, officials said Monday that island residents will have to contend with food shortages after Beryl destroyed more than $6.4 million in crops and supporting infrastructure.\n\nFrom the Caribbean to Texas, Hurricane Beryl leaves a trail of destruction Local Weather\n\nGet the daily forecast and severe weather alerts in your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "mcdowellnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "McDowellNews.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "juan_a_lozano@mcdowellnews.com", "name": "Juan A.

State officials were questioned whether utilities were prepared in advance, and at least one said they would withhold judgement until after the lights were turned back on.\n\nA heat advisory took effect through Wednesday in the Houston area and beyond, with temperatures expected to soar into the 90s and humidity that could make it feel as hot as 105 degrees. The National Weather Service described the conditions as potentially dangerous given the lack of power and air conditioning.\n\nBeryl, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths and at least 11 in the Caribbean. At midday Tuesday, it was a post-tropical cyclone centered over Arkansas and was forecast to bring heavy rains and possible flooding to a swath extending to the Great Lakes and Canada.\n\nPeople are also reading...

David Goodman, Judson Jones and Shannon Sims NYT News Service/Syndicate Stories\n\nTropical Storm Beryl ripped a path of destruction through the heart of Houston on Monday, transforming roads into rivers, killing at least four people and knocking out power for more than 2 million customers across Texas.\n\nThe storm, which made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, weakened as it passed over the city and continued its swirling march north.\n\nBut its relatively modest official strength undersold its power, local authorities said. As it churned through Houston, officials warned people to stay inside and away from windows, \"as though there was a tornado coming your way,\" Lina Hidalgo, the top official in Harris County, which includes Houston, cautioned residents.\n\nThe center passed just to the west of the city, meaning Houston received some of the worst of the storm as it spun counterclockwise.\n\nBy Monday afternoon, officials were beginning to assess the destruction as residents emerged to find a landscape of downed power lines, damaged homes, fallen trees and rippling water along the streets. The city's airports remained closed into the afternoon because of lingering strong winds.\n\nHoustonians have long been accustomed to power outages and strong weather. But Beryl, which began as an unusually powerful storm in the Caribbean, offered an ill omen, striking early in a hurricane season that has been predicted to be unusually active.\n\n\"The wind gusts were way stronger than I expected for a Cat 1,\" said Julie Kickham, who rode out the storm in the Montrose neighborhood of Houston. \"This makes me nervous for the rest of hurricane season.\"\n\nIt was the second time in less than two months that residents found their city battered by winds and plunged into darkness. Even before the hurricane season had started, an unexpectedly strong storm struck Houston and its surrounding suburbs in May, killing at least seven people and leaving hundreds of thousands without power for days.\n\nFar more were without power Monday: About 1 in 5 electricity customers in Texas had lost power by midday, with most of the more than 2.7 million outages at one utility, CenterPoint Energy, in the Houston area.\n\n\"I do not have power,\" Mayor John Whitmire said during a news conference. \"We're all in this together.\"\n\nOfficials warned that it could take days for many in the city to get their power and air conditioning back, with temperatures forecast to climb into the 90s on Tuesday. In areas where residents could afford them, the sounds of backup generators could be heard rumbling in the streets.\n\nTwo people were killed inside their homes, officials said, crushed under the weight of trees that had been knocked over in the winds. One was a man at home with his family in the Atascocita area north of Houston; the other, a 74-year-old woman, was killed in a northwestern neighborhood near Interstate 45, officials said.\n\nA third victim, a civilian employee of the Houston Police Department, drowned when his car became submerged in high water, Whitmire said. The employee had been exiting an interstate and went into a flooded underpass. Whitmire said the man had tried to call other members of the department for help, but they were not able to reach him in time.\n\nA fourth death, caused by a house fire on Monday morning, was also connected to the storm.\n\nIn Louisiana, a woman died when a tree fell on her home in Bossier Parish near the Texas border, the sheriff's office said in a Facebook post.\n\nNine others died after the storm hammered the Caribbean islands and Mexico's Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula last week.\n\nOn Monday night, Beryl fell to tropical depression status, according to the National Hurricane Center's 11 p.m. Eastern advisory. The storm was about 20 miles east-northeast of Tyler, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph. It was moving north-northeast at 17 mph.\n\nAs with previous strong storms that have hit the city, Beryl transformed Houston's urban landscape.\n\nTrees blocked roadways. Toads, whose mating call is usually heard when the weather cools at night, sang in the daylight. Sections of highways filled with water that was whipped into white caps, looking like rough seas in the middle of the city.\n\nA rescue team using a crane pulled a man from a pickup truck that had become surrounded by rough and rising waters along Highway 288. At least eight people had been rescued from high water as of the middle of the day, said Thomas Hardin, an assistant police chief.\n\nSeveral of Houston's bayous, which help to drain water from the city during storms, were filled to their banks, or in some cases overtopped. The county's flood warning system showed several places where the bayous were over capacity, including one near downtown.\n\nThe fuel giant Marathon Petroleum said Monday that its Galveston Bay Refinery had briefly lost power during the storm, and that it was burning off excess gases as a safety measure.\n\nBut unlike during Hurricane Harvey in 2017, which stalled over the city and rained for days, Beryl moved through Houston relatively quickly, allowing the floodwaters to begin slowly receding by afternoon with no apparent large-scale industrial damage.\n\nBy later in the day, some coastal areas were beginning to emerge from the storm and return to their ordinary rhythms. In the city of Galveston, along the Gulf of Mexico, several people gathered in Robert's Lafitte bar, two blocks from the beach. The owner, Scott Butler, said the bar had no electricity but plenty to drink.\n\nThe National Weather Service Lake Charles confirmed a tornado near Jasper, Texas, at 11:11 a.m. local time with 30 to 40 homes damaged, according to Jasper County Judge Mark Allen. The tornado hit an apartment complex and nursing home facility.\n\nA tornado also touched down in the east Texas town of Timpson. And there were tornadoes near the Texas-Lousiana border.\n\nThe tornado risk will spread into southeast Missouri, northern Tennessee, Kentucky, southern Illinois, southern Indiana and Ohio on Tuesday.\n\nThe hurricane center said the fast-moving storm is expected to move into the Lower Mississippi Valley on Tuesday and then the Ohio Valley by Wednesday.\n\nHeavy rainfall of 3 to 5 inches, with locally higher amounts, is expected across portions of far southeastern Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri through Tuesday. Local flash and urban flooding are expected.", "source": {"uri": "bradenton.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bradenton Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Phone and internet access has also been cut off in some communities, including Galveston.\n\n\"No WiFi, no power, and it's hot outside. That's dangerous for people. That's really the big issue,\" resident Robin Taylor told the AP. \"People will die in this heat in their homes.\"\n\nBeryl has been blamed for at least 10 deaths in Texas and Louisiana, mainly from fallen trees. However, two deaths in Houston's Harris County were the result of carbon monoxide poisoning, Texas emergency officials said, prompting warnings about the dangers using generators in areas where families are living and sleeping.\n\nCooling centers have opened across the region as temperatures creep into the 90s and heat indices reach 105 degrees in some areas. The heat index is a measurement of how the body feels under both heat and humidity.\n\nProlonged heat exposure poses significant health risks for people without adequate cooling and may be especially dangerous for Texans working outdoors to clear debris or damaged infrastructure. Heat also presents increased risks for the elderly, people with chronic medical conditions, homeless people and children.\n\nHospitals in Houston are at risk of overcrowding as they are unable to release patients to homes without power, prompting city officials to organize overflow beds in a sports stadium, Lt. Governor Dan Patrick said Tuesday.\n\nLong lines of cars and residents snaked out of fast food restaurants, food trucks and gas stations in the hopes of getting a few minutes of cool air or a bite to eat, according to the AP. Dwight Yell, 54, had power at his house but took a disabled neighbor, who did not, to Denny's for some food, the outlet reports.\n\nPatrick said he has stressed to CenterPoint Energy, the utility with the vast majority of outages in the area, the importance of restoring power as quickly as possible. The utility estimates about 80% of its customers in Houston are without power.\n\n\"It's tough to be in the heat. It's tough now to be able to refrigerate anything and tough not being able to go out and get food,\" Patrick said. \"I made sure that CenterPoint was aware of that and asked them to pull out all the stops to get power back as quickly as they could.\"\n\nBut CenterPoint officials say it could be several days before power is fully restored to its customers, though it hopes to restore service to 1 million customers by Wednesday night. As of Tuesday night, more than 1.3 million of its customers were still in the dark.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved a federal emergency disaster declaration that will assist with some recovery costs, including clearing debris, Texas Governor Greg Abbott's office said.\n\nBut before long-term recovery efforts get underway, many frustrated residents are grappling with how to address their immediate needs.\n\n\"It's catastrophic when you lose everything in your fridge and you are living check to check,\" Harris County commissioner Lesley Briones told the AP.\n\nA home in Surfside Beach, Texas, was destroyed by Hurricane Beryl on July 8.\n\nMark Felix/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBeryl barrels into Northeast\n\nThough Beryl has substantially weakened since slamming into Texas as a Category 1 hurricane, its remnants still pose serious flood and tornado threats as they blow through the Ohio Valley and Northeast on Wednesday.\n\n\"On Wednesday, Beryl will continue northeastward through Ohio and into Ontario and rainfall will increase over northern areas of New York into New England,\" the National Weather Service said.\n\nMore than 2 million people are under flood watches across parts of the Midwest and Northeast. The watches will begin to expire for the Midwest by the end of the day Wednesday but will last in New England until Thursday morning.\n\nHeavy rainfall and winds could also churn up tornadoes, with the biggest threat spreading from northern Pennsylvania to southern New Hampshire and Vermont. That includes Syracuse and Albany, New York, and Scranton, Pennsylvania.\n\nBeryl whipped up more than a dozen tornadoes across Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana on Monday and two in Indiana and Kentucky on Tuesday. The National Weather Service in Shreveport, Louisiana, issued 67 tornado warnings on Monday, the most it has ever issued in a single day.\n\nCNN's Robert Shackelford, Joe Sutton, Sarah Dewberry and

Actual temperatures will exceed 90F.\n\nWhile those temperatures aren't unusual for Houston at this time of year, scorching weather and humidity combined with the lack of power will make for brutal conditions, as people won't be able to turn on air conditioners for a break from the heat. The sweltering conditions and significant power outages are both expected to last for days.\n\nMore than 2.1 million homes and businesses are still without power in eastern Texas, mostly concentrated in the Houston area, according to PowerOutage.us. Over 75% of those are customers of CenterPoint Energy Inc., the Houston area's main electric utility. Mobile phone service was also beginning to falter in and around the city on Tuesday.\n\nActing Governor Dan Patrick said President Joe Biden has granted his request for a federal emergency disaster declaration, which will help cover some costs from the storm. At a press conference on Tuesday, Patrick said he's talked to CenterPoint several times and that the company is working to restore power safely and quickly.\n\nBased on current progress with damage assessment and initial restoration, CenterPoint expects to have power restored to 1 million impacted customers by the end of day on July 10, the company said in a statement late Monday.\n\nBeryl left the Houston metro area -- home to roughly 7 million -- a morass of flooded streets, downed trees, darkened traffic lights and power lines lying on the ground. At least three deaths were blamed on the storm. Beryl, a Category 1 hurricane when it struck Texas early Monday, already had killed 11 people in a week-long rampage across the Caribbean.\n\nDozens of cars were lined up at a west Houston Shell gasoline station Tuesday as frustrated residents sought fuel a day after Beryl made landfall.\n\nThey were lucky the station had power to pump the fuel -- some drivers had already been to multiple sites that were still closed. For Houston residents who've been through this before, the outages are becoming a regular, and infuriating, occurrence.\n\n\"I'm just tired of the power grid basically. We've been through too many storms for them not to know how to handle this,\" said Chrishique Harvey, 31. \"Every hard wind that blows, there's an outage.\"\n\nA spokesperson for grid operator Electric Reliability Council of Texas said the grid is running normally and any outages are local in nature. Ercot doesn't own power plants or transmission lines.\n\nKeion Logan, 24, a recent transplant from Chicago who was waiting in line for gas at the west Houston station, said he'd never been through a hurricane before -- and it was trying his resilience.\n\nThe \"electricity is off, running out of gas, my phone is dead,\" Logan said. \"I'm trying to survive, trying not to give in.\"\n\nThe Port of Houston closed Monday and will remain so Tuesday. Maersk, in a separate advisory, said some of its local trucking operations facilities are without power but it expects to resume operations once the Houston terminal gates open. BNSF Railway said its Pearland Intermodal Facility in Houston will be closed until it is safe to resume operations.\n\nBeryl, now a post-tropical cyclone, is sweeping across the South, with heavy rainfall expected in the Mississippi Valley. Tornadoes are possible across Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. Almost 30,000 homes and businesses are without power Tuesday in Louisiana, Tennessee and Arkansas.\n\nScorching weather is also set to bake western states this week, raising fire risks from Canada to Mexico. A million people are under an excessive heat warning in the US West, according to Bryan Jackson, a meteorologist at the Weather Prediction Center.\n\nLas Vegas on Sunday hit an all-time high temperature of 120F (49C). Palm Springs and Redding in California have also set records. The high in Sacramento may reach 110F on Thursday, while Furnace Creek -- the gateway to Death Valley -- is poised to hit 128F.\n\n--With assistance from Tope Alake, Millie Munshi, Naureen S.

Phone and internet access has also been cut off in some communities, including Galveston.\n\n\"No WiFi, no power, and it's hot outside. That's dangerous for people. That's really the big issue,\" resident Robin Taylor told the AP. \"People will die in this heat in their homes.\"\n\nBeryl has been blamed for at least 10 deaths in Texas and Louisiana, mainly from fallen trees. However, two deaths in Houston's Harris County were the result of carbon monoxide poisoning, Texas emergency officials said, prompting warnings about the dangers using generators in areas where families are living and sleeping.\n\nCooling centers have opened across the region as temperatures creep into the 90s and heat indices reach 105 degrees in some areas. The heat index is a measurement of how the body feels under both heat and humidity.\n\nProlonged heat exposure poses significant health risks for people without adequate cooling and may be especially dangerous for Texans working outdoors to clear debris or damaged infrastructure. Heat also presents increased risks for the elderly, people with chronic medical conditions, homeless people and children.\n\nHospitals in Houston are at risk of overcrowding as they are unable to release patients to homes without power, prompting city officials to organize overflow beds in a sports stadium, Lt. Governor Dan Patrick said Tuesday.\n\nLong lines of cars and residents snaked out of fast food restaurants, food trucks and gas stations in the hopes of getting a few minutes of cool air or a bite to eat, according to the AP. Dwight Yell, 54, had power at his house but took a disabled neighbor, who did not, to Denny's for some food, the outlet reports.\n\nPatrick said he has stressed to CenterPoint Energy, the utility with the vast majority of outages in the area, the importance of restoring power as quickly as possible. The utility estimates about 80% of its customers in Houston are without power.\n\n\"It's tough to be in the heat. It's tough now to be able to refrigerate anything and tough not being able to go out and get food,\" Patrick said. \"I made sure that CenterPoint was aware of that and asked them to pull out all the stops to get power back as quickly as they could.\"\n\nBut CenterPoint officials say it could be several days before power is fully restored to its customers, though it hopes to restore service to 1 million customers by Wednesday night. As of Tuesday night, more than 1.3 million of its customers were still in the dark.\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved a federal emergency disaster declaration that will assist with some recovery costs, including clearing debris, Texas Governor Greg Abbott's office said.\n\nBut before long-term recovery efforts get underway, many frustrated residents are grappling with how to address their immediate needs.\n\n\"It's catastrophic when you lose everything in your fridge and you are living check to check,\" Harris County commissioner Lesley Briones told the AP.\n\nBeryl barrels into Northeast\n\nThough Beryl has substantially weakened since slamming into Texas as a Category 1 hurricane, its remnants still pose serious flood and tornado threats as they blow through the Ohio Valley and Northeast on Wednesday.\n\n\"On Wednesday, Beryl will continue northeastward through Ohio and into Ontario and rainfall will increase over northern areas of New York into New England,\" the National Weather Service said.\n\nMore than 2 million people are under flood watches across parts of the Midwest and Northeast. The watches will begin to expire for the Midwest by the end of the day Wednesday but will last in New England until Thursday morning.\n\nHeavy rainfall and winds could also churn up tornadoes, with the biggest threat spreading from northern Pennsylvania to southern New Hampshire and Vermont. That includes Syracuse and Albany, New York, and Scranton, Pennsylvania.\n\nBeryl whipped up more than a dozen tornadoes across Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana on Monday and two in Indiana and Kentucky on Tuesday. The National Weather Service in Shreveport, Louisiana, issued 67 tornado warnings on Monday, the most it has ever issued in a single day.\n\nCNN's Robert Shackelford, Joe Sutton, Sarah Dewberry and Fabiana Chaparro contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Let's just wait until tomorrow. Doing a damage assessment on your own property is one thing, but driving around unnecessarily -- we really ask that you avoid it.\"\n\nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is leading the state while Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country, said it will be a \"multiple-day process to get power restored\" to the about 2.7 million customers across Texas experiencing outages.\n\nPatrick said CenterPoint officials told him they were sending in 11,500 people to help with restoration efforts.\n\nThe workers are coming both from out of state and from unaffected counties in Texas, Patrick said during a late Monday afternoon storm briefing in Austin.\n\nHigh water, tree damage and other debris are expected to make roadways unsafe for the next several days, according to officials with TxDOT's Houston district.\n\nSeveral neighbourhoods in Fortbend County, worst affected, saw debris from huge trees on intersections and roads, besides power outages and rising flood waters.\n\nOther neighbourhoods, such as Katy, Cinco Ranch, Cross Creek and Fulshear, have been without power since early Monday morning.\n\nTraffic is off the roads or very sporadic, as very few traffic signals are operational, but all others are down.\n\nStorm damage has largely been limited to downed branches, broken fences and uprooted trees.\n\n\"There isn't much structural damage, just broken branches and stuff,\" said Texas Highway Patrol Officer Corey Robinson, who has been on duty since 6 a.m. on Monday.\n\n\"We've got more patrol officers coming in from other cities.\"\n\nSchool closures will stretch into Tuesday for many of southeast Texas' K-12 districts and higher education institutions. Though schools reported minimal damage no electricity following the storm is a matter of concern.\n\nBeryl, after weakening into a tropical storm, was far less powerful than the Category-5 behemoth that tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean last weekend.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

However, the storm's impact is still being felt across the region. After making landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday, Beryl left widespread destruction including power outages, tornadoes and severe flooding. At least eight people are dead including one person who is thought to have died from a lightning strike.\n\nPower Restoration\n\nOne of the most-felt impacts from Beryl in the U.S. was power outages. At one point, more than 2.5 million homes and businesses in Texas were without power. Efforts are ongoing to restore electricity. CenterPoint Energy, a provider in control of a major portion of the outages, says they expect to restore energy for a million homes and businesses by the end of Wednesday.\n\nTornadoes, Destruction and Fatalities\n\nAfter barreling through the Caribbean, Beryl caused a mess along the American Gulf of Mexico coast. Strong winds knocked down tree limbs, the cause of at least two deaths in Texas. In Houston, a First Tier Civilian employee with Houston Police Department found himself trapped in flooding on Houston Avenue and tragically died, according to official sources. One person is dead in Louisiana; a resident was killed by a falling tree from a possible tornado near the town of Benton. All said, at least eight people are dead; a toll that may rise as search and rescue efforts continue across the region.\n\nHouston Mayor John Whitmire urged residents to stay safe and check on their neighbors. \"Houstonians need to know we're working around the clock so you will be safe,\" Whitemire said at a Monday briefing according to the Associated Press. President Biden has pledged federal support for recovery efforts. Cooling centers and food distribution points have been opened across the state of Texas. Locals can find resources by searching the internet for their specific county. Residents can also search for \"Extreme Heat Cooling Centers\" via Texas 2-1-1.\n\nEnvironmental Impact\n\nIndustrial facilities said that, due to power disruptions, gas flaring was necessary with at least one plant calling it a, \"safe combustion of excess gasses.\" The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality requires companies to share emissions data within 24 hours of a flaring event like this.\n\nWhat Is Next For Beryl?\n\nBeryl's remnants are expected to bring more severe weather to additional states.

Let's just wait until tomorrow. Doing a damage assessment on your own property is one thing, but driving around unnecessarily -- we really ask that you avoid it.\" Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is leading the state while Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country, said it will be a \"multiple-day process to get power restored\" to the about 2.7 million customers across Texas experiencing outages.\n\nPatrick said CenterPoint officials told him they were sending in 11,500 people to help with restoration efforts.\n\nThe workers are coming both from out of state and from unaffected counties in Texas, Patrick said during a late Monday afternoon storm briefing in Austin.\n\nHigh water, tree damage and other debris are expected to make roadways unsafe for the next several days, according to officials with TxDOT's Houston district.\n\nSeveral neighbourhoods in Fortbend County, worst affected, saw debris from huge trees on intersections and roads, besides power outages and rising flood waters.\n\nOther neighbourhoods, such as Katy, Cinco Ranch, Cross Creek and Fulshear, have been without power since early Monday morning.\n\nTraffic is off the roads or very sporadic, as very few traffic signals are operational, but all others are down.\n\nStorm damage has largely been limited to downed branches, broken fences and uprooted trees.\n\n\"There isn't much structural damage, just broken branches and stuff,\" said Texas Highway Patrol Officer Corey Robinson, who has been on duty since 6 a.m. on Monday.\n\n\"We've got more patrol officers coming in from other cities.\" School closures will stretch into Tuesday for many of southeast Texas' K-12 districts and higher education institutions. Though schools reported minimal damage no electricity following the storm is a matter of concern.\n\nBeryl, after weakening into a tropical storm, was far less powerful than the Category-5 behemoth that tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean last weekend.

Actual temperatures will exceed 90F.\n\nWhile those temperatures aren't unusual for Houston at this time of year, scorching weather and humidity combined with the lack of power will make for brutal conditions, as people won't be able to turn on air conditioners for a break from the heat. The sweltering conditions and significant power outages are both expected to last for days.\n\n\"It can be pretty uncomfortable, especially without power,\" said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster at the US Weather Prediction Center. Real temperatures will likely be in the mid 90s for the next few days, which is typical for this time of year. \"It's average hot, but that's still pretty hot.\"\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, about 2.3 million homes and businesses were still without power in eastern Texas, concentrated in the Houston area, according to PowerOutage.us. More than 75% of those without power are customers of CenterPoint Energy Inc., the Houston area's main electric utility.\n\nRead More: Texas' Extreme Weather Pileups Point to World's Climate Future\n\nBeryl left the Houston metro area -- home to roughly 7 million -- a morass of flooded streets, downed trees, darkened traffic lights and power lines lying on the ground. At least three deaths were blamed on the storm. Beryl, a Category 1 hurricane when it struck Texas early Monday, already had killed 11 people in a week-long rampage across the Caribbean.\n\nBased on current progress with damage assessment and initial restoration, CenterPoint expects to have power restored to 1 million impacted customers by the end of day on July 10, the company said in a statement late Monday.\n\nThe storm, now a tropical depression, is sweeping across the South, with heavy rainfall expected in the Mississippi Valley. Tornadoes are possible across Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. Almost 35,000 homes and businesses are without power Tuesday in Louisiana and Arkansas.\n\nScorching weather is also set to bake western states this week, raising fire risks from Canada to Mexico. A million people are under an excessive heat warning in the US West, according to Bryan Jackson, a meteorologist at the Weather Prediction Center.\n\nLas Vegas on Sunday hit an all-time high temperature of 120F (49C). Palm Springs and Redding in California have also set records. The high in Sacramento may reach 110F on Thursday, while Furnace Creek -- the gateway to Death Valley -- is poised to hit 128F.", "source": {"uri": "insurancejournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Let's just wait until tomorrow. Doing a damage assessment on your own property is one thing, but driving around unnecessarily -- we really ask that you avoid it.\" Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is leading the state while Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is out of the country, said it will be a \"multiple-day process to get power restored\" to the about 2.7 million customers across Texas experiencing outages.\n\nPatrick said CenterPoint officials told him they were sending in 11,500 people to help with restoration efforts.\n\nThe workers are coming both from out of state and from unaffected counties in Texas, Patrick said during a late Monday afternoon storm briefing in Austin.\n\nHigh water, tree damage and other debris are expected to make roadways unsafe for the next several days, according to officials with TxDOT's Houston district.\n\nSeveral neighbourhoods in Fortbend County, worst affected, saw debris from huge trees on intersections and roads, besides power outages and rising flood waters.\n\nOther neighbourhoods, such as Katy, Cinco Ranch, Cross Creek and Fulshear, have been without power since early Monday morning.\n\nTraffic is off the roads or very sporadic, as very few traffic signals are operational, but all others are down.\n\nStorm damage has largely been limited to downed branches, broken fences and uprooted trees.\n\n\"There isn't much structural damage, just broken branches and stuff,\" said Texas Highway Patrol Officer Corey Robinson, who has been on duty since 6 a.m. on Monday.\n\n\"We've got more patrol officers coming in from other cities.\" School closures will stretch into Tuesday for many of southeast Texas' K-12 districts and higher education institutions. Though schools reported minimal damage no electricity following the storm is a matter of concern.\n\nBeryl, after weakening into a tropical storm, was far less powerful than the Category-5 behemoth that tore a deadly path of destruction through parts of Mexico and the Caribbean last weekend.

Many streets were also badly flooded.\n\nAP added that at least two people were killed.\n\nSeveral parts of Texas were put under flash flood, storm surge, tornado and tropical storm warnings.\n\nCalishia Mendoza, a TT national who moved to Houston, Texas last year told Newsday her faith in God and constant praying helped her through the storm.\n\nShe said she knew God would \"cover (her) with his hands and keep (her) safe.\n\n\"I was a little terrified but, of course, my mom also kept me calm and prayed as well.\n\n\"It was the first time I experienced a hurricane...I served in the army and normally get to see and experience the aftermath when they sent us out to help the affected areas, but actually being in the middle of it was a new experience for me overall.\"\n\nShe said electricity fluctuated a lot but as of Monday afternoon, it was back for good.\n\n\"I'm truly blessed to have power right now because I know some areas are out of power,\" she added.\n\nShe said while her home was not flooded, she is yet to go outside as it is \"still a little windy.\n\n\"I was worried the whole time but I also kept my faith going and praying every chance I got.\n\n\"I'm grateful to be okay right now as I know so many were affected and didn't have the outcome I did, and I will continue to pray for Houston and everyone affected.\n\n\"Living here, I have notice how resilient these people are and I know they will get through this. I know we all will .\n\nA TT national who preferred not to be named told Newsday she was in Houston, Texas, but for vacation. On Saturday morning, she said, the weather was fine and sunny. She is staying at a hotel.\n\nHowever, around 2am on Monday, \"There was heavy rainfall, wind, lightning, thunder...It was a lot of wind too so the building was kind of shaking.\"\n\nShe said this was the first time she experienced a hurricane and it was really scary.\n\n\"I was really worried. And if this was a category one, then I don't want to ever experience a category two.\"\n\nShe said she remained in touch with her family and friends home, who were also worried about her and her safety. She said at no point did the hotel lose power or any parts of it flooded.\n\n\"There was no flooding or anything like that but when you looked outside, you would see No Parking signs blown to the side, trees bending...But inside, we were pretty safe.\"\n\nShe said hotel guests talked to each other about the experience in shared spaces. She is set to leave Texas on Tuesday.\n\nThe Texas Division of Emergency Management has urged all who experienced property damage to submit an online report via its website.\n\nIt also advised, through its social media platforms, that residents not drive through floodwaters, use flashlights instead of candles, be careful with portable generators and chainsaws, and to not push themselves too much during cleanup efforts.\n\nIn a press conference on Monday afternoon, Houston mayor John Whitmire said the city was experiencing \"the dirty side of a dirty hurricane.\n\n\"Shelter in place. We're in an emergency. We're in a rescue mode...We're literally getting calls across Houston right now asking for first responders to come rescue individuals in desperate life safety conditions.\n\n\"Stay off the road. There is debris. I travelled from my home this morning. The mayor was barely able to get to the emergency centre...That's how dangerous our streets (are).\"\n\nUS media have reported thousands of flights being cancelled owing to the storm.\n\nCBS reported almost 600 cancellations for departing flights at the George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, and 165 outbound flights at William P.

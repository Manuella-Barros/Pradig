However, the Atlanta Dream All-Star appeared to be shot out of a cannon at the start of the skills challenge, setting the tone for a dominant performance in the weekend's opening event.\n\nShe recorded the fastest time in the preliminary round of 31.2 seconds, deliberately using her speed to overcome some misses on the jump-shooting portions. In the final round against Sophie Cunningham, Gray knew she'd be a little more fatigued, which manifested itself in six combined miss 3-pointers from the wing and corner.\n\nHowever, Gray flew through the passing and dribbling obstacles, edging Cunningham by 2.4 seconds.\n\nThis year's Friday night events include a bigger purse for the participants. In addition to the $2,575 of prize money mandated by the CBA, the winners also receive a $55,000 bonus courtesy of Aflac. Nneka Ogwumike, president of the players association, announced the sponsorship Thursday.\n\nPrior to the event, Gray said, \"I'm a big money-saver. I like to invest my money on things so who knows it could be my starting money for another business.\" However, after winning, Gray said she'd go on a shopping and golfing spree with her earnings.\n\nBrittney Griner of the Phoenix Mercury led things off in the first round, but the 3-pointers befuddled the 6-foot-9 center in the skills challenge course. She was redeemed by a strong performance from her teammate Cunningham, who was the final entrant in the field of five and secured a top-two time by 0.2 seconds to advance to the final.\n\nCunningham implored the Phoenix crowd to get louder for her prior to the second round, led off with an improved time. Despite missing four jumpers, she shaved 1.0 seconds off her effort in the preliminary round, putting some real pressure on Gray. -- Sabreena Merchant, women's basketball writer\n\nKelsey Mitchell's jersey also took a second glance to get used to, but for a different reason. Mitchell was a last-second entrant to the competition after her teammate Erica Wheeler had a flight issue and was unable to make it to Phoenix. Mitchell wore Wheeler's jersey in her stead but couldn't get the victory for the Indiana Fever. -- Merchant\n\nIt took until Wednesday evening for the WNBA to publicly announce the fields for Friday evening's skills challenge and 3-point shootout.\n\nA member of the New York Liberty (Jonquel Jones) and Fever (Mitchell, having replaced Wheeler) were included, but they were not the players who many expected; Liberty guard Sabrina Ionescu and Indiana guard Caitlin Clark were not among the shootout's field.\n\nThe WNBA confirmed both Clark and Ionescu received invitations to participate in the 3-point contest, but that both declined.\n\n\"It's not an easy thing to show up and shoot off the racks. It's not something I've ever done before,\" Clark said. \"It's not something I've had a lot of time to practice. I've been focusing on helping my team win games. So I think just enjoying this break. I think there are going to be plenty of opportunities for me to do that at some point.\"\n\nSky forward Angel Reese was also not listed in any of the events. Reese told reporters the WNBA invited her to participate in the skills challenge but that she declined the invite. \"I just wanted to enjoy my first All-Star, watch everything and just enjoy the moment,\" Reese said. -- Ben Pickman, women's basketball writer", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sabreena_merchant@nytimes.com", "name": "Sabreena Merchant", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "ben_pickman@nytimes.com", "name": "Ben Pickman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Cunningham_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sophie Cunningham (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Mercury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Mercury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allisha_Gray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allisha Gray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nneka_Ogwumike", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nneka Ogwumike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittney_Griner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brittney Griner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Continental Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Mitchell_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Mitchell (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erica_Wheeler_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erica Wheeler (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_Ionescu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sabrina Ionescu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonquel_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonquel Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberty University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/07/19215305/USATSI_23779733-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748529", "eventUri": "eng-9748529", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

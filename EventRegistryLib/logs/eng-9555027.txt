Ned Lamont for promised signature\n\nThe Senate voted Monday night for final passage of Democratic legislation that will expand Connecticut's groundbreaking, if limited, paid sick days mandate into a nearly universal benefit by Jan. 1, 2027.\n\nGov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat whose centrist politics often place him between business and labor, pledged to the sign the bill as a reasonable standard for ensuring that workers need not choose between lost wages or working while ill.\n\nHouse Bill 5005, the measure on its way to Lamont, does not require additional time off at workplaces that already offer 40 hours of any paid time off, regardless of whether it is classified as vacation, personal days or sick time.\n\nThe bill passed on a 23-12 party line vote, with every Republican opposed and one Democrat, Sen. Joan Hartley of Waterbury, not voting.\n\n\"This is a landmark bill for the 2024 session, one that a number of us have worked on for a long time,\" said Senate President Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven.\n\nSen. Julie Kushner, D-Danbury, who lobbied for the original law as a UAW regional executive and ran for the Senate in 2018 on a promise to expand the coverage, called passage timely, if not overdue.\n\nBy her estimation, the original law passed in 2011 covered only 12% of workers. It applied to certain employers with 50 or more workers, limited to a list of specific retail and service occupations. Seasonal workers were exempt.\n\nThe bill expands coverage in three phases by lowering the threshold for coverage from companies with 50 or more employees to those with 25 or more on Jan. 1, 2025; to 11 in 2026; and to one in 2027.\n\n\"We now will be expanding paid sick days to every worker in Connecticut,\" said Kushner, the co-chair of the Labor and Public Employees Committee. Seasonal workers will largely remain exempt.\n\nThe original law made Connecticut the first state to require any private employers to offer paid sick time, and it marked the shift in power that came with the election of Dannel P. Malloy, the state's first Democratic governor in two decades.\n\nMalloy won, if barely, with a cross-endorsement by the labor-funded Working Families Party. He delivered on two promises to labor: winning passage of a paid sick days law and a higher minimum wage.\n\nSimilarly, Lamont has supported paid sick days and a higher minimum wage, even while angering labor and the political left by defending spending caps he credits for stabilizing the state's finances.\n\nRepublicans won half the Senate seats in 2016 and came within five votes of a majority in the House, but Lamont was elected in 2018 and reelected in 2022 with huge Democratic majorities.\n\nDemocrats now control the Senate, 24-12, and the House, 98-53.\n\nSen. John Kissel of Enfield, the only Republican to vote for the original law, argued against the expansion, quoting Alexis de Tocqueville's admonition against a \"tyranny of the majority\" in cautioning Democrats to hear the GOP minority.\n\n\"Just 'cause you have the numbers doesn't mean you should do it. Just because you have the votes doesn't make it right,\" Kissel said. \"I just feel that moderation is so much better. And working across party lines is so much better.\"\n\nHe was one of the Republicans who lined up against the bill over more than seven hours, each warning against the impact on small businesses of giving even five days of paid time off.\n\n\"My friends, we've see this movie before. It doesn't end well,\" said Sen. Ryan Fazio, R- Greenwich. \"It results in lower job creation, lower wages, less prosperity for the working class and middle class, less opportunity for people who need it, and less success for small businesses and Connecticut's economy.\"\n\nSen. Heather Somers, R-Groton, a former business owner, said the legislation was well intended but poorly executed and certain to harm the state's reputation as a place to do business.\n\n\"Connecticut is not an easy place to do business,\" Somers said. \"It's very expensive. There's a lot of regulations. And as you heard Senator Fazio speak just a few moments ago, we're still ranked in the bottom of the business-friendly community and state.\"\n\nSen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, offered a series of amendments to limit the bill. All failed on party-line votes.\n\n\"This is going to have a negative impact on businesses across the state of all sizes,\" Sampson said.\n\nUnder the bill, employees would accrue one hour of paid time off for every 30 hours worked up to a maximum mandated benefit of 40 hours of paid time off in a year. The benefit would become available after the 120th calendar day of employment, and unused time could be carried over to the next year. There is no requirement that the time be used for sickness.\n\nLooney, a Democrat who was elected to the House in 1980 and moved to the Senate a dozen years later, said the Republicans' concerns about the bill being overly burdensome to business were not new.\n\n\"This is the same argument that has been made about every progressive labor reform for the past 100 years,\" Looney said. \"There were those who argued that child labor shouldn't be interfered with because it interfered with the freedom of contract between a little kid and a major corporation. And as we all know, that was bogus.\"\n\nThe same is true, he said, of complaints that federal safety regulations and the 40-hour work week were radical and ruinous. The history of labor is one of struggle, often of violence, he said.\n\n\"That's one of the reasons why I fought a number of years ago to have a labor history curriculum for our school system,\" Looney said. \"This is something that too many of our young people now take for granted.\"", "source": {"uri": "ctmirror.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The CT Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Ned Lamont, a business-friendly Democrat twice endorsed by labor, said Thursday he will veto a Connecticut AFL-CIO priority bill that would have created a $3 million state fund to assist strikers without explicitly saying so.\n\n\"I just think it was too cute by half,\" Lamont said. \"If you want to have public dollars to support striking workers, have a vote up or down: 'I want public dollars to go to support striking workers.'\"\n\nThe bill was drafted in the waning days of the session as an attempt to sidestep Lamont's objection to another proposal that was labor's preference -- letting striking workers qualify for unemployment after two weeks on the picket line.\n\nThe hope was Lamont would become amenable to a compromise that attempted to do much the same thing outside the unemployment system, sparing employers from a potential rate increase in their unemployment insurance premiums.\n\n\"It removed the burden from business and shifted it to the taxpayer,\" said Chris DiPentima, the president of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association. \"That's not a good use of taxpayer money.\"\n\nSenate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, who cut a deal with the Republican minority that allowed passage Wednesday night in the final minutes of the 2024 session, could not be reached for comment.\n\n[RELATED: At deadline, CT Senate passes bill benefiting strikers]\n\nEd Hawthorne, the AFL-CIO president who celebrated the passage just 12 hours earlier, texted his disappointment but was unavailable to talk about the veto's impact on Lamont's relationship with labor.\n\n\"We are deeply disappointed that Gov. Lamont plants to veto this critical pro-worker legislation,\" Hawthorne said. \"This legislation would give countless workers a fair shot to negotiate a living wage and affordable benefits.\"\n\nThe legislation would have shifted $3 million in unexpended funds held by the state comptroller's office to a new \"Connecticut families and workers account\" and direct the comptroller to use it \"for the purposes of assisting low-income workers.\"\n\nThe House passed the bill Friday night on a 90-59 vote, with seven Democrats and 52 Republicans opposed. No Republican voted for the measure, but the GOP caucus offered tacit consent by agreeing not to debate, much less filibuster. The Senate passed it on a party-line vote, with one abstention, Sen. Joan Hartley, D-Waterbury.\n\nComptroller Sean Scanlon would have had sole discretion to set standards for paying benefits from the fund, most likely through regulations he would have had to submit for review to the legislature's bipartisan Regulation Review Committee.\n\n\"It's really important the governor stood up. He said from the beginning he didn't like this concept,\" said DiPentima, who criticized efforts to make it more palatable. \"It was a complete work-around.\"\n\nLamont largely agreed Thursday, but he appeared less than eager to reject the labor bill.\n\nThe governor has bucked unions on fiscal issues, opposing revisions to spending caps he says have stabilized Connecticut's finances and improved its business environment. But he has stood with them by supporting raises to the minimum wage, creation of a family and medical leave program, and this year's bill expanding the limited mandate on private employers to provide paid sick days.\n\nMeeting with reporters in his office to discuss the session, he repeatedly declined to directly answer when asked if he would sign or veto the strikers bill.\n\n\"I'm not gonna support it,\" Lamont said. \"Let me see what we end up with. Let me take a look at it. It's so damn vague. I don't really know what's in it.\"\n\nHe was pressed again to answer, reminded that he had been told by legislative leaders exactly what was the intent before the vote as midnight approached.\n\n\"That said, everything I know about it, I'm not going to support it,\" Lamont said. \"If you want to do this, have a have a real vote next year, so people know what they're voting on, not at 11:45\" p.m.\n\nHe acknowledged he does not support the concept of jobless benefits for strikers, but he cast that opinion in the context of being a friend to labor, especially the right to organize. He noted that makes him an anomaly in his hometown, where he founded a cable television company.\n\n\"I'm, you know, one of the six pro-union guys in Greenwich, Conn. I think because the union movement was not strong over the last 30 years, we've hollowed out our middle class, especially when it comes to the service sector,\" Lamont said. \"I want to make sure that we have a strong labor that's able to negotiate at the table. Does that mean I want the taxpayers subsidizing striking workers? I don't think I do.\"\n\nIt was only as the press conference broke up that Lamont confirmed a veto was coming -- even if he never uttered the word.\n\nHe was asked: Would it be incorrect to report that he intends to veto the bill?", "source": {"uri": "ctmirror.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The CT Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_pazniokas@ctmirror.org", "name": "Mark Pazniokas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ned_Lamont", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ned Lamont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL\u2013CIO", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AFL\u2013CIO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Looney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martin Looney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of the Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comptroller", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comptroller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_tempore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro tempore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_benefits", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment benefits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Comptroller", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York State Comptroller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Hartley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joan Hartley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_wage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Living wage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abstention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filibuster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sick_leave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sick leave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minimum wage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greenwich, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greenwich, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://ctmirror-images.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_4081.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555027", "eventUri": "eng-9555027", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Looney of New Haven, took pains to avoid: The measure is aimed at delivering a union goal of aiding strikers.\n\n\"It is good. It is humane. It is something that recognizes that workers who are undertaking a strike because negotiations have failed, often because stonewalling has occurred by employers,\" Looney said.\n\nThe Senate voted 23-12, with all Republicans opposed and one conservative Democrat, Sen. Joan Hartley of Waterbury, not voting. She exited the chamber prior to the vote and returned at its conclusion.\n\nGov. Ned Lamont, who opposed a bill that would have given strikers unemployment benefits, has yet to say if he will sign or veto a compromise that attempts to do much the same thing outside the unemployment system.\n\nThe legislation would shift $3 million in unexpended funds held by the state comptroller's office to a new \"Connecticut families and workers account\" and direct the comptroller to use it \"for the purposes of assisting low-income workers.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, told The Connecticut Mirror after it passed the House on Friday night that the legislation was an attempt to aid strikers in a way advocates hoped might appeal to Lamont.\n\nPassage required cooperation from the Senate Republican minority, as was the case in the House. The bill was called for debate with less than an hour until the constitutional adjournment deadline of midnight, but the GOP declined to mount a filibuster threatened by Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding of Brookfield.\n\nA bit of brinksmanship led to a deal: Looney had broadly hinted in a CT Mirror interview Tuesday night, and more directly in negotiations Wednesday, that he would employ a rarely used maneuver to end debate and call a vote if the GOP talked until midnight on the strikers' bill and another declaring a climate crisis.\n\nHarding said he agreed not to filibuster on the strikers bill if Looney gave up on the climate legislation and a few other bills.\n\n\"We had to make a choice here,\" Looney said. \"Doing everything was not possible in this narrowing funnel here. But doing that [labor bill] was possible, and I'm glad we got it done. We met earlier today with Sen. Harding and his chief of staff and just talked about the process today and talked about working in good faith.\"\n\nBoth men wished to avoid calling the question, or ending debate, even if Looney said he was prepared to do so to pass a strikers bill he had long sought to give labor a little more leverage at the bargaining table.\n\n\"I think ultimately it was the right decision,\" said Harding, who took over leadership of the caucus in mid-session. \"There was always that threat of calling the question.\"\n\nThe Republicans agreed to argue against passage but not try to block a vote by the Democrats, who control the Senate, 24-12.\n\n\"Honestly, I wanted them to vote on it,\" said Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, who frequently has spoken for hours on bills this year.\n\nUnlike in the House, where Republicans asked no questions about the purpose of the bill during a three-minute debate, their Senate counterparts tried to get Democrats on the record about its origins and purpose.\n\n\"Is this in fact ... the striking workers bill?\" Sampson asked.\n\n\"This bill is what it says it is -- the creation of a fund in the comptroller's office to assist low income workers,\" replied Sen. Julie Kushner, D-Danbury, a retired UAW executive who co-chairs the Labor and Public Employees Committee.\n\nThe bill gives complete discretion to Comptroller Sean Scanlan to set standards for the new fund, if it becomes law with Lamont's signature. The governor is holding a press conference Thursday morning to talk about the session.\n\nSampson said giving the comptroller discretion over a fund with no statutory standards was unprecedented, at least in his career. He was elected to the General Assembly in 2010.\n\n\"I've seen some stuff come through this chamber, but I have got to tell you, this is borderline probably the most brazen and absurd piece of legislation that I have seen to date,\" Sampson said.\n\nChris DiPentima, the president of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, said the new fund would label the state as hostile to business.\n\nEd Hawthorne, president of the Connecticut AFL-CIO, said the power in negotiations rests with management, and the bill was a balancing effort.\n\n\"Labor law is heavily weighted in favor of employers. In fact, they have their thumb on the scale during negotiations,\" he said. \"Corporate CEOs are attempting to maintain their power to starve workers out on strike while hiring replacement workers to do their jobs.\"\n\nThe bill passed Wednesday night, he said, is \"a major step towards leveling the playing field for working people by establishing a fund to aid striking workers.\"\n\nRob Baril, who represents nursing home workers and other caregivers as president of SEIU District 1199NE, called the a bill a step in the right direction.\n\n\"Caregivers strike as a last resort, and if the state does not protect their right to strike by allowing them to express their grievances without time restrictions or debilitating financial consequences, it grants corporations undue power to prolong negotiations,\" he said.\n\nGeneral Dynamics Electric Boat sent a letter to Ritter, House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, and House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, last week saying that either the jobless benefits bill or the new one would upset the \"delicate balance\" between labor and management.\n\nPeter Baker, who represents about 4,000 EB workers as president of the Metal Trades Council of New London, said the submarine manufacturer had nothing to fear.\n\n\"Our recent contract negotiations demonstrate that the collective bargaining process works when all parties act in good faith,\" Baker said. \"House Bill 5431 will encourage all private sector employers to behave as Electric Boat has done to reach agreement on our new five-year contract.\"\n\nThe House and Senate moved at a glacial pace until negotiations finally resolved differences among Democrats and Republicans, as well as in the House and Senate.

It is always a financial struggle for families,\" Senate President Pro-Tempore Martin Looney said as he recalled the stress and anxiety his family incurred when his own father went on strike. \"This now provides at least some partial safety net.\"\n\nNow in the hands of the governor, the bill's fate is uncertain.\n\nTowing the line between pro-labor and pro-business concerns, Gov. Ned Lamont has remained skeptical of, but open to, extending benefits to striking workers.\n\nThe concept, which union advocates have pushed for years as critical to protect the livelihood of striking workers, was decried by business advocates who say state compensation will encourage strikes and disrupt the economy.\n\nWithin minutes of the bill's passage Sen. Republican Leader Stephen Harding, Sen. Rob Sampson and Sen. Eric Berthel released a joint statement urging the governor to veto the legislation \"as soon as it hits his desk.\"\n\n\"Democrats just voted for one of the most absurd bills we have ever seen,\" the senators said. \"It had no public hearing. It had no definitions. It creates a slush fund for the State Comptroller. It is all about trickery and that is insulting to Connecticut taxpayers. This brazen bill epitomizes the arrogance of Democrats who control all the levers of power in Connecticut. It's more fiscal mismanagement and another attempt to go around the fiscal guardrails.\"\n\nIn a report by the Connecticut Mirror House Speaker Matt Ritter described the bill as a compromise between Lamont and labor advocates, who eyed House Bill 5164 as a top priority for the 2024 session. The original proposal would have made workers eligible for unemployment benefits after 14 days on strike, starting Dec. 14, 2025. Under the bill, the Connecticut Department of Labor would run the program through the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund.\n\nCloaked in ambiguity and non-specifics, the controversial proposal cleared the House in a 90-59 vote Friday, after mere minutes of discussion that neglected to include even an utterance of the word \"strike.\"\n\nWhen grilled by Republicans on the true intent of the bill Wednesday, Labor Committee Chair Sen. Julie Kushner adhered to the bill's language, saying the \"Comptroller will determine how to use the fund,\" which she said will \"assist low income workers.\"\n\nAs debate closed, it was Looney who finally said \"Clearly 'low income working people' would include potentially striking workers.\"\n\n\"It is good. It is humane. It is something that recognizes that workers who are undertaking a strike because negotiations have failed often because stonewalling has occurred by employers,\" Looney said. \"This now provides at least some partial safety net, in those circumstances, potentially as an eligible use of this fund.\"\n\nOnly two states, New York and New Jersey offer unemployment benefits to striking workers. In both states, workers become eligible after 14 days of strike.\n\nConnecticut's proposal received staunch opposition from business advocates, including the Connecticut Business and Industry Association.\n\nOn Monday the CBIA published a letter by the RTX Corporation, the owners of Pratt and Whitney and Collins Aerospace, that urged state senators to oppose H.B. 5431.\n\nRTX, which employs over more than 16,500 workers in Connecticut, said the proposal would \"erode Connecticut's business climate, rendering other states more viable options for future work.\"\n\nRTX said that strikes are \"relatively rare\" under the current framework because when \"Employees collectively leverage the right to withhold their labor to secure better agreements...It is balanced by the personal economic loss of a strike.\"\n\n\"State-funded compensation would significantly skew the careful balance intended under the National Labor Relations Act,\" RTX Said. \"Paying people to strike would serve only to increase the frequency and duration of work stoppages in Connecticut. Such a significant skewing of the negotiating parties' leverages could yield unsustainable labor contracts for Connecticut manufacturers.\"\n\nLabor advocates argue that the legislation will not lead to an increase in strikes, but will encourage employers to foster good-faith negotiations.\n\n\"Workers attempting to form a union and negotiate a fair contract face significant power imbalances and obstacles,\" Ed Hawthorne, the president of the Connecticut branch of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, said in testimony presented to the labor committee in February.\n\nBy compensating striking workers, Hawthorne said the state \"will incentivize employers to act in good faith and ensure workers have a fair opportunity to provide for themselves and their families.\"\n\nHawthorne said that since 2021, 18 strikes have occurred in Connecticut and \"only four lasted longer than two weeks.\"\n\n\"Voting to authorize a strike is one of the most difficult and traumatic experiences a worker and their colleagues can face,\" Hawthorne said. \"They risk losing their income, their jobs if replacement workers are hired, and employer retaliation. But many believe the alternative - the chance to achieve long-term improvements in pay, benefits and working conditions - is worth the risk. At that point, it's not really a choice.\"\n\n\"When striking workers can pay the rent and afford groceries, it creates a safety net for their families, small businesses, and entire communities,\" Hawthorne said.", "source": {"uri": "courant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hartfort Courant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alison_cross@courant.com", "name": "Alison Cross", "type": "author",

Ned Lamont plans to veto a bill that would give financial aid to striking workers.\n\nLamont told reporters in his office about his decision Thursday while reflecting on the legislative session that ended at midnight.\n\n\"Does that mean I want the taxpayers subsidizing striking workers? I don't think I do,\" Lamont said, defending his record as a pro-labor governor.\n\nAside from the veto, Lamont was mostly positive about the legislative session.\n\n\"I think the legislature did some important things this session, even though it was a short session,\" he said.\n\nLamont specifically touted bills to expand paid sick leave to almost all workers by 2027 and a housing bill that includes incentives for municipalities to build more affordable housing.\n\nBut when asked by reporters, he said he is against a bill to let striking workers receive aid from a $3 million state fund.\n\nDemocrats were able to push the bill through the Senate with 10 minutes to spare Wednesday, despite Republican threats of a filibuster.\n\n\"What it comes down to for the striking workers is standing up for every worker that's out there,\" said Sen. Bob Duff, (D-Majority Leader) before Wednesday's vote.\n\nLamont also praised plans to spend as much as $400 million in unused American Rescue Plan Act funding on certain priorities, including higher education, early childhood education, and nonprofit service providers.\n\nThe deal came after the Appropriations Committee decided not to reopen the current two-year budget. The move delayed a looming debate over the fiscal guardrails.\n\nDemocratic leaders in the legislature say they need flexibility, especially around the volatility cap.\n\nThe cap limits how much the legislature can spend from certain volatile revenue streams, like quarterly income tax payments from wealthy investors.\n\nConnecticut raked in more than $1 billion over the cap, a figure that doesn't include a $256 million surplus in the operating budget.\n\nMoney above the volatility cap can only go toward one of two uses: the budget reserve fund - also known as the Rainy Day Fund - or into pensions.\n\n\"We have to recognize needs have expanded since then, we have the resources to deal with them,\" said Sen. Martin Looney, (D-President Pro Tem.\n\nLamont, though, continues to be far more supportive of a strict interpretation.\n\n\"Maybe some think that's too fast, I think that's the right thing,\" he said. \"It's saving the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\"\n\nRepublicans agree that the state should continue to use excess revenues to pay down pension debt.\n\n\"I don't understand complaining about a volatility cap that's ensuring paying down the second highest debt per capita in the country,\" said Sen. Stephen Harding (R-Minority Leader).\n\nBusiness leaders say the fiscal guardrails help make the state more attractive to employers.\n\n\"They're keeping spending in check to levels that we can not only afford now but also looking into future years,\" Connecticut Business and Industry Association Vice President of Public Policy Chris David said.\n\nNonprofit service providers, though, say they've been underfunded for years, and they need help.\n\n\"If a family was on hard times and was having trouble putting food on the table but got extra money in, it would both put food on the table and pay debt,\" Connecticut Nonprofit Community Alliance President and CEO Gian-Carl Casa said.", "source": {"uri": "nbcconnecticut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Connecticut"}, "authors":

The pop legends said it felt like \"the perfect time\" to revive the smash hit and raise cash for charity, as Scotland men\u2019s football team heads to Germany for the Euros. Singers Rod and Susan Boyle star in the music video dancing along to the song with iconic tartan scarves. The band performed the new version in front of hundreds of Tartan Army before the Northern Ireland friendly match at the Shed nightclub in March and launched the video on Friday, 7 June. Footage from the set was used in the video, which stars scores of well-known faces from the worlds of music, film, television, media and sport. The idea for a new version of the anthemic hit was born live on air when the Bay City Rollers joined Ewen and Cat at Breakfast on Greatest Hits Radio Scotland in December. Woody, who joined the band in 1974, talked about how the song would turn 50 just when Scotland were heading to the Euros in Germany. He said it was thanks to Ewen and Cat that they got the ball rolling with the new single. Gordon Strachan, radio presenters Ewen Cameron and Cat Harvey and other famous Scots including Jackie Bird, Michelle McManus, Callum Beattie, Kyle Falconer and John Mackay of STV all star in the charity single's video. Some of the cast from Still Game and River City, ICW wrestling World Champion Jack Jester and Greatest Hits Radio presenters Webster, Fred McAuley, Boogie and Arlene also joined in. People from across Scotland who sent in clips are also featured, dancing in a fish factory, singing in the sea, and waving flags while all singing along. All cash raised will be donated to Cash for Kids, supporting vulnerable and disadvantaged children locally and across Scotland. Musician John McLaughlin said: \u201cIt\u2019s the 50th anniversary which is incredible, and we wanted to celebrate in a spectacular fashion. \u201cWe were in with Cat and Ewen and it felt natural to do this. It felt like a good idea to freshen it up. \u201cFrom the opening chords, people seem to react with that instantly. It doesn\u2019t make sense, but Shang-A-Lang sounds like such a Scottish word. \u201cThe feel of the song has such a brilliant Scottishness to it. With the Scottish team being at Euros, it all adds up to make a perfect storm.\u201d Clyde radio presenter Ewen Cameron told STV News: \u201cThe response has been amazing. It\u2019s been so much fun making a music video, it\u2019s flying on social media. \u201cShang-A-Lang is a Scottish anthem. Everyone got involved and was singing along. It has crossed generations. \u201cIt\u2019s been a brilliant experience.\u201d Since then, Ewen and Cat asked their listeners to send in videos and some of them have been exceptional. Cat said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been inundated with amazing clips from all over Scotland because our listeners have been very creative with their mobile phones. \u201cWe have people dancing in a fish factory, folk waving flags and singing in the sea, grannies, babies, pensioners groups, disabled groups, families, friends and celebrities all dancing and singing along. \u201cThis song is such a celebration, and we can tell everyone has had loads of fun joining in.\u201d Shang-A-Lang 50 launched on Friday June 7 on all platforms, with all profits going to Cash for Kids.

For the Baltimore Ravens' new running back Derrick Henry, a lot of time, restrictions, and money.\n\nHenry is entering his first season with the Ravens, a match that looks made in heaven, with one of the league's greatest running backs joining one of the NFL's elite rushing offenses.\n\nAt 30, there is some thought that Henry could be on the decline, as he's had a ton of carries under his belt. The 2023 season was one of Henry's worst statistical seasons (though he still produced 1,167 yards and 12 touchdowns on 4.2 yards per carry).\n\nBut according to The Athletic's Dan Pompei, Henry goes to extreme lengths to stay fit and stave off a physical decline.\n\nPompei reports that Henry spends an estimated $240,000 a year on \"body maintenance.\" That includes a personal chef and advanced recovery methods like massages, hyperbaric oxygen, and infrared saunas. Henry also receives IVs with vitamins and nutrients three times a week.\n\nAccording to Pompei, Henry eats a strict diet with an unusual schedule. Henry avoids gluten, artificial sugar, fried foods, and dairy. During the season, Henry reportedly doesn't eat until 4 or 5 p.m. and will have only other meal afterward. But those meals are massive in nature.\n\n\"I probably eat three chicken breasts, some rice and broccoli,\" Henry told Pompei. \"Then I have some gluten-free pancakes, scrambled eggs, diced potatoes, home fries and some steak.\"\n\nAnd Henry is maniacal about working out. He does two-a-days shortly after the season, hardly taking any time off. And his lifting regimen includes massive weights, like 80 lb dumbbell curls and Bulgarian split squats with 120 lb dumbbells.\n\nThe Ravens have reportedly been confident that Henry will be able to maintain his success in Baltimore, thanks in part to his work ethic and care for his body. That also extends to Henry's demeanor in the film room and at practice.\n\n\"One thing about Derrick -- he works,\" Ravens coach John Harbaugh previously told ESPN's Jamison Hensley. \"He is a worker, 100% every day, locked in, asks questions, ready to go at practice, in the weight room, training room. [I'm] very impressed. This guy is a true pro, ultimate pro.\"\n\nThe Ravens have not had an elite rusher like Henry in the Lamar Jackson era. And Henry could have a bounce-back year for a team that knows how to run the ball, has an elite dual-threat quarterback in Jackson, and should be leading in a lot games.\n\nIf Henry can't get back to his peak this season, it won't be for a lack of trying.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompei", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pompei"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pompei"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heaven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumbbell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dumbbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infrared"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauna", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sauna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrambled_eggs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scrambled eggs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gluten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten-free_diet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gluten-free diet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nutrient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pancake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oxygen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broccoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Broccoli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vitamin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harbaugh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Harbaugh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lamar Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bulgaria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bulgaria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical_Personages", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical Personages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-07/USATSI_22085269.jpg?itok=zrveTO_w", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744423", "eventUri": "eng-9744423", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Even in an environment teeming with abnormally proportioned human beings, the 6-foot-3, 252-pound running back is different. Ravens running backs coach Willie Taggart says he's a \"mutant,\" trainer Melvin Sanders calls him a \"freak.\"\n\nThe former Tennessee Titan is different in other ways, too.\n\nAs he walks in, his expression is anguished and distant.\n\nWell, he just came off the field after a June practice with his new team. He messed up a blitz protection. The quarterback didn't take a hit, the defense didn't make a big play, no game was lost. But Henry will think about it until he sleeps, assuming he can.\n\nAnd his glower explains why he may be the best offseason addition for any NFL team.\n\nHenry's fascination with running the football started as a child. He was inspired by two older cousins -- Justin Glover, who ran the ball for Bolles High in Jacksonville on a 2A state championship team, and Tahj Kimble, who earned a scholarship from Boston College.\n\nConvinced being a running back was his calling, Henry studied the best: Gale Sayers, Walter Payton, Earl Campbell and Eric Dickerson. Emmitt Smith was from Florida, too, so Henry watched him whenever possible.\n\nHe was a fan of Jacksonville's Fred Taylor, who played not far from Henry's home in Yulee, Fla. There were fascinations with Barry Sanders, Maurice Jones-Drew, Edgerrin James, Ricky Williams, Curtis Martin, Shaun Alexander, Stephen Jackson, Eddie George, Jamaal Lewis, Priest Holmes, Larry Johnson and Frank Gore.\n\nAt Yulee High, he ran for 485 yards in a game, 4,261 yards in a season and 12,124 yards in his career. At Alabama in 2015, he had more rushing yards in a season than any player in the history of the SEC, breaking a record that had been held for 34 years. Henry also won the Heisman Trophy and helped the Crimson Tide to a national championship that year.\n\nThe Titans didn't plan to draft him, but when he was available 14 picks into the second round in 2016, they veered.\n\nThey had recently traded for DeMarco Murray, who led the league in rushing just two seasons earlier, and it would be Murray's ball to carry. For two seasons, Henry was more of an annoyance to Murray than he was to opponents. When coaches tried to send Henry on the field to spell Murray, the veteran sometimes waved him off.\n\nThis was a challenge unlike any Henry had experienced.\n\n\"He went from being the Heisman winner, the man, the one everybody counted on to do it all at Alabama to maybe seeing the field five minutes a game,\" says Adrianna Rivas, Henry's girlfriend since his rookie year. \"It was kind of a shock. And it was tough, really tough for him.\"\n\nOn days when Murray missed practice, Henry made teammates wonder why he was second string. When he was sent in during mop-up time to eat up clock, he ate up yards instead.\n\nTitans center Ben Jones, a captain at the time, took note. Jones became many things to Henry -- blocker, mentor, adviser and friend, really good friend. They shared three meals a day, as well as an acupuncture therapist. After every game, Henry returned home and called Jones to review his performance.\n\nThrough the first seven games of this third season, it still wasn't coming together. Henry was averaging 3.25 yards per carry and had one touchdown. He was second-string, this time behind free-agent signing Dion Lewis, and on the trade block. He says he feared being cut.\n\nThat's when he asked former Titans star Eddie George what he was doing wrong. George told him he was trying to score on every carry instead of taking what the defense gave him. He said he needed to play to his strength -- literally -- and wear defenses down with contact.\n\nSometimes, George told him, a 2-yard run is a win.\n\nOver the last four weeks of the 2018 season, Henry rushed for 585 yards and seven touchdowns, averaging 6.7 yards per carry.\n\nIn an early December game against the Jaguars, Henry took his sixth carry of the day in the Tennessee end zone and ran up the middle before breaking outside. At the 18, a stiff arm drove cornerback A.J. Bouye backward. Linebacker Leon Jacobs had an angle on Henry, but he swatted him away as if he were an insect. Finally, Henry ran through a tackle attempt by linebacker Myles Jack before scoring. Titans tackle Taylor Lewan called the 99-yard run \"the greatest football play I've ever seen.\"\n\nHenry led the league in rushing in each of the next two seasons. Since 2018, he has had 1,757 more rushing yards (1,136 after contact), 37 more broken tackles and 27 more rushing touchdowns than any player in the league. NFL Network named him a top-25 player four times and a top-10 player twice.\n\nIt wasn't just the adjustment in his running style. Henry takes care of his body better than anyone Jones has known. \"He does everything right,\" Jones says.\n\nHenry's financial adviser, Pete Kotos, estimates Henry spends $240,000 yearly on body maintenance, which includes employing a personal chef who prepares all of Henry's meals. Henry eats no fried foods, gluten, dairy or artificial sugars.\n\nDuring the season, he doesn't eat his first meal until 4 or 5 p.m. and eats only one other meal, usually around 8 p.m. (in the offseason, his first meal is around 1 p.m.). When he does eat, he consumes nearly enough for a pride of lions.\n\n\"I probably eat three chicken breasts, some rice and broccoli,\" he says. \"Then I have some gluten-free pancakes, scrambled eggs, diced potatoes, home fries and some steak.\"\n\nBefore practice, he might have kale, an avocado or a banana to get something in his system. Three days a week, he takes IV fluids that contain a shot of vitamin E, Coenzyme Q10 and other nutrients.\n\nHenry begins two-a-day workouts at SandersFit Performance Center in Dallas a couple of days after every season ends. He takes no days off.\n\n\"If I am going to spend time somewhere, it probably will be a gym because that's what I love doing,\" he says.\n\nHe loves running hills. At SandersFit, he does up to 10 sprints on a 100-yard hill. He loves working his arms, doing hammer curls with 80-pound dumbbells. And he loves working his legs, doing Bulgarian split squats with 120-pound dumbbells.\n\nHenry also takes recovery seriously, using cold therapy, infrared sauna, hyperbaric oxygen, massage therapy and bodywork to come back stronger. Sanders said he believes Henry is stronger than he's ever been.\n\nPart of it is competitive spirit. Henry competes with the league's other running backs, with middle linebackers lined up across from him, with the player he used to be and the player critics say he is becoming.\n\nHenry works up a sweat at Dave & Buster's and Topgolf. He and Rivas stayed at an Airbnb in Orlando for the Pro Bowl earlier this year, and the unit had a Pop-A-Shot game. Henry tried to get the top score, then Rivas tried, then two friends tried, then Rivas' two brothers tried, all without success. But Henry kept trying. When Rivas heard him yell later, she knew what happened.\n\n\"Of course, he beat the score,\" she says. \"He wasn't going to stop until he did.\"\n\nIn the first drive of a 2019 game against the Raiders, Henry felt his hamstring pull. Later it was discovered that nearly half of his muscle was torn, but he didn't come out of the game, rushing 18 times for 103 yards and two touchdowns. He played the following week, too, adding 86 more yards before being forced to sit out one week.\n\n\"If I'm available to go, I'm gonna go,\" Henry says. \"If I can't go, I'm still gonna try to go until somebody stops me.\"\n\nIn 2021, Henry broke the fifth metatarsal in his right foot in the first quarter of a game against the Colts. Henry felt awful pain but gave no indication he was injured other than asking for more tape on his foot at the end of the drive. The game went into overtime, so he played nearly four full quarters with a broken bone, rushing 28 times. Henry had surgery that week and missed the next nine games. Titans trainer Todd Toriscelli says he isn't sure how Henry kept playing.\n\n\"He would come in on Monday after 30 carries on Sunday and deny any soreness,\" Toriscelli says. \"Then he would go lift weights for two hours. He would then come into my office and hit a few poses and say, 'Does this look sore?' He actually got upset if I asked him if he was OK.\"\n\nLast October, with Henry in the final year of his Titans contract, there were rumblings he would like to play for the Ravens.\n\nRavens general manager Eric DeCosta was listening. He remembered the 2019 Pro Bowl, when Henry played for Baltimore coaches and DeCosta experienced Henry's humility and magnetism. Then he thought about Henry carrying 12 times for 97 yards against the Ravens a couple of weeks prior and how he crushed them with 133 rushing yards in 2020.\n\n\"He decimated us,\" DeCosta says. \"If you believe in your team and an opponent torments you, that resonates.\"\n\nDeCosta agreed to the framework of a trade with Tennessee general manager Ran Carthon -- a fourth-round pick that could have become a third had Henry reached certain production levels. However, others in the Titans hierarchy apparently were not on board with the deal, so Henry played out the season in Nashville.\n\nIn his last game, he rushed for 153 yards in an upset over the Jaguars, then took a microphone onto the field to express his appreciation to the fans for the greatest eight years of his life. In the news conference that followed, he thanked coaches, teammates, seven members of the kitchen staff, seven members of the equipment staff, three members of the media relations staff, two members of the security staff, two members of the cleaning staff and three people responsible for website content -- 25 people in all.\n\nThe Ravens were very interested. The Texans called. On the second day of the negotiating period, after Aaron Jones agreed to terms with the Vikings, Henry became the eighth running back to find a new team when he accepted a two-year, $16 million offer from Baltimore.\n\nWhat DeCosta saw was a 16-wheeler with the acceleration of a Tesla. According to a Next Gen report, Henry ran 21.68 miles per hour after taking one handoff last season -- faster than any of the backs who signed ahead of him and tied for the seventh-fastest speed in the NFL. Four of the faster players were wide receivers, and no one in the top seven weighs near 252 pounds.\n\nIn 2023, Henry had more rushing yards (1,167, second in the NFL) and more rushing touchdowns (12, seventh in the NFL) than any of the backs who signed before him. And while his 4.2 yards-per-carry average tied for the lowest of his career, it didn't bother DeCosta, who noted the Titans' offensive line inconsistencies.\n\nThe teams that valued other backs more highly probably were focused on two of Henry's numbers -- 30, his age, and 2,030, his carries, which is more than any active running back except Ezekiel Elliott, who has 2,065.\n\nIn late April, Rivas gave birth to the couple's second daughter, Celine Amor. The plan was for Henry to skip a week of OTAs about a month later and spend the time with his family in Dallas. But after the last practice of the prior week, Henry told Rivas he couldn't take the week off.\n\n\"I did terrible, absolutely terrible,\" he told her. \"I didn't know what I was doing. I can't end like that. I have to come back. I'm sorry.\"\n\nHenry eventually took a week to stay home -- but only after redeeming himself at practice. And when he was away, he repeatedly called and texted Taggart with questions from his tape study.\n\nHenry values family time. These days, daughter Valentina, 4, often accompanies her father to his second workout of the day. One of his first priorities after moving into a new house in Dallas was building a play area for her in the yard -- Valentina's Park, they call it. He and Valentina pretend they are monsters.\n\nThe Tennessee house is for sale. Henry says Nashville and its people -- especially his teammates -- will always hold a special place in his heart, but change, he knows, invigorates.\n\n\"It will be good for him,\" Rivas says. \"He has fresh left in him.\"\n\nHenry plans to play for as long as his body will allow, though he says a Super Bowl victory could change his mind. And he believes a ring is possible with his new team.\n\nHe's reflecting on what could be now, about how he can blend into John Harbaugh's vision of offensive football and how he's ready for any amount of carries that offensive coordinator Todd Monken wants to give him.\n\nThe idea of playing out of the shotgun more frequently excites him because he believes he can get more explosive runs against a spread-out defense.

And among players 6-3 or taller, only Eric Dickerson and Eddie George have carried the ball more times. At 247 pounds, Henry is also the 14th-heaviest player to ever record at least 250 carries. And among players 245 pounds or heavier, only Jerome Bettis and Jamal Lewis have more carries than Henry.\n\nNot only does he exist in those very small groups, Henry also leads them both in average yards per carry. In other words, it's incredibly anomalous for someone Henry's size to have the type of success he's had in his career, which has so far seen him rush 2,030 times for 9,502 yards and 90 touchdowns, lead the league in carries four times and both rushing yards and rushing touchdowns twice, make four Pro Bowls and two All-Pro teams, and win an AP Offensive Player of the Year award.\n\nObviously, to do all that, Henry has had to take care of his body. And according to The Athletic, the process for him to do that is quite extensive, and quite expensive.\n\nHenry's financial adviser, Pete Kotos, estimates Henry spends $240,000 yearly on body maintenance, which includes employing a personal chef who prepares all of Henry's meals. Henry eats no fried foods, gluten, dairy or artificial sugars.\n\nDuring the season, he doesn't eat his first meal until 4 or 5 p.m. and eats only one other meal, usually around 8 p.m. (In the offseason, his first meal is around 1 p.m.). When he does eat, he consumes nearly enough for a pride of lions.\n\n\"I probably eat three chicken breasts, some rice and broccoli,\" he says. \"Then I have some gluten-free pancakes, scrambled eggs, diced potatoes, home fries and some steak.\"\n\nBefore practice, he might have kale, an avocado or a banana to get something in his system. Three days a week, he takes IV fluids that contain a shot of vitamin E, Coenzyme Q10 and other nutrients.\n\nHenry begins two-a-day workouts at SandersFit Performance Center in Dallas a couple of days after every season ends. He takes no days off ...\n\nHe loves running hills. At SandersFit, he does up to 10 sprints on a 100-yard hill. He loves working his arms, doing hammer curls with 80-pound dumbbells. And he loves working his legs, doing Bulgarian split squats with 120-pound dumbbells.\n\nHenry also takes recovery seriously, using cold therapy, infrared sauna, hyperbaric oxygen, massage therapy and bodywork to come back stronger. Sanders said he believes Henry is stronger than he's ever been.\n\nThat is an intense regimen. It's a lot of work to keep your body right to be an NFL running back at all, let alone deep into your 20s like Henry has so far. It's even more work when you are Henry's size. But he's managed to do it and remain productive for eight seasons, even if his efficiency has waned in recent seasons.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens are betting on a bounceback season, efficiency-wise, with Henry playing behind a better offensive line and alongside Lamar Jackson in the backfield. Mobile quarterbacks like Jackson have routinely raised the efficiency for their backfield mates due to the space they can create, and Henry is still the kind of player who needs only a body-sized crease through which to fit before he can rip off a long run and take it to the house. But of course, he can't do that at all unless he's on the field, and the routine he uses is what helps him stay upright.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jared_dubin@cbssports.com", "name": "Jared Dubin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Lewis_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Lewis (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Dickerson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Dickerson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Bettis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Bettis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_George", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eddie George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press_NFL_Offensive_Player_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumbbell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dumbbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steak", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intravenous therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Banana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrambled_eggs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scrambled eggs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avocado", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Avocado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gluten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten-free_diet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gluten-free diet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pancake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Potato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broccoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Broccoli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lamar Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bulgaria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bulgaria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2020/09/14/7e8aa1ce-11de-4bc1-b336-3d441036149b/thumbnail/1200x675/091e62068f047c80b108329a3465368e/derrick-henry.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744423", "eventUri": "eng-9744423", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

In fact, over the last five, he's bested them all in rushing yards.\n\nIn that half a decade, Henry has rushed for 7,209 yards, with the next closest running back being Josh Jacobs with 5,545 yards. Henry also ranks best for rushing yards per game (100.1) and rushing touchdowns (68) in that span as well.\n\nEntering his ninth season, Henry has still yet to hit that proverbial wall that running backs typically hit at or near his age. Just last season he had 280 carries (most in the NFL) for 1,167 yards (second behind Christian McCaffrey) and 12 touchdowns on what was a very pedestrian offense for the Tennessee Titans.\n\nBut no longer is Henry with the team that drafted him out of Alabama back in 2016. This upcoming season, Henry will be playing for the team that has been in the top three in rushing the last three years: the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nAs the 30-year-old running back sets off on a new chapter of his career, he's pulling no punches in his preparation, going to great lengths to ensure he is in top physical shape.\n\nHenry spends around $240,000 annually on body care to stay in peak physical condition, according to his financial adviser Pete Kotos, per The Athletic. This investment includes hiring a personal chef to prepare all his meals, ensuring he adheres to a strict dietary plan.\n\nHis meal plan consists of chicken breasts, steaks, potatoes, rice, and broccoli, avoiding fried foods, gluten, dairy, and artificial sugars.\n\nHenry has been a 1,000-yard rusher in five of the last six seasons and was just 63 yards shy of that mark in 2021. He also rushed for a league-leading 2,027 yards in 2020.\n\nIt's clear that the veteran is doing everything in his power to prove he's still one of the league's best, helping the Ravens reach the Super Bowl this upcoming season.

Titans writer Paul Kuharsky had a strong message to the fans still rooting for Henry even though he is elsewhere.\n\n\"If you root for Derrick Henry to the extent that you want the Ravens to win so much as a game, you are not the #Titans' fan you think you are. Period. Not up for debate,\" Kuharsky wrote. \"If they are on the goal line at the end of a game they are trailing by 4, and you want him to score, you are not the TEN fan you think you are.\"\n\nWell, Henry didn't like that message and responded with six words: \"Paul go find something to do.\"\n\nThe Ravens' new weapon isn't too happy with these comments from Kuharsky, especially after #22's loyalty to the organization ever since being drafted out of Alabama.\n\nHis time in Tennessee included four trips to the Pro Bowl, a pair of NFL rushing yard crowns as well as rushing touchdowns, and the 2020 NFL Offensive Player of the Year.\n\nHenry rushed for over 2,000 yards in 2020 and put together five seasons with over 1,000 yards as he was a constant force for Tennessee.\n\nIt's quite a debate for Titans fans, as some want Henry to have a good run with the Ravens and others want the opposite. Of course, with Henry now in Baltimore, the Ravens enter the 2024 season as a Super Bowl contender, and the addition of Derrick Henry is a big reason why.\n\nYet, Kuharsky's message to the fans who are still rooting for Henry didn't rub off too well with the running back.\n\nRelated: Joe Burrow Makes Massive Change To Personal Appearance Before NFL Season", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_wadleigh@postandcourier.com", "name": "Matt Wadleigh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lamar Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Burrow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Burrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744423", "eventUri": "eng-9744423", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

And he's also a running back trying to out sprint ahead of aging. After all, he'll be 31 in January.\n\nBut the running back, the former Alabama star known to most as \"King Henry,\" has a plan for staying dominant for many more years. The newest Ravens running back works out every day and uses unique and pricy training methods. He follows the methods religiously.\n\nThe Athletic, in a story posted this week, said Henry spends an extra $240,000 a year on what it describes as \"body maintenance.\" This includes a personal chef, who prepares all the running back's meals, that is when Henry decides to eat.\n\nHenry doesn't like to consume his first meal during the season until at least 4 p.m. He'll follow that up with another meal at 8. And when he eats, he eats lots of specific kinds of foods.\n\n\"I probably eat three chicken breasts, some rice and broccoli,\" Derrick Henry told The Athletic. \"Then I have some gluten-free pancakes, scrambled eggs, diced potatoes, home fries and some steak.\"\n\nThere are other dietary restrictions. He won't eat fried foods or dairy, gluten or anything laden with artificial sugars.\n\nNow, once Ravens training camp begins Sunday, Henry will eat something before he practices. He'll consume some kale, maybe a banana or an avocado. And he takes heaping doses of vitamins and supplements. The Athletic said that Henry takes an IV infusion of CoQ10 and vitamin E, with some other nutrients blended in, three days a week. An athlete would take CoQ10 to reduce inflammation linked to exercise. The supplement also can help speed up recovery and reduce damage on muscles. Vitamin E also helps with recovery.\n\nThen there is all the extra working out that Henry does to prepare for the NFL season or keep in in shape during it or when it's finished. The Athletic said Henry does his own personal two-a-day practices -- after the season ends.\n\nHenry is pretty religious about the workouts. The Ravens running back says \"If I am going to spend time somewhere,\" he says, \"it probably will be a gym because that's what I love doing.\"\n\nThe Athletic described some specific kinds of drills. He'll run 10 sprints up a 100-yard hill. He'll do arm curls using 80-pound weights. And he'll work on his quadriceps and glutes with 120-pound weights as he does Bulgarian split squats.\n\nAnd at age 30, recovery also is of premium importance. He uses hyperbaric oxygen treatment, which helps the blood reach his muscles and other body tissue. Studies show it can help speed up recovery from injury by up to 50 percent. There's an infrared sauna which treats soreness and stiffness. He uses cold therapy to treat inflammation. And of course, there's old school massage.\n\nBefore signing a two-year, $16 million deal with the Ravens, Henry only had played for the Titans. But he dropped hints last fall that he'd like a change of venue, maybe going from Nashville to Baltimore. The Ravens seem like a perfect place for Henry's talents. With Lamar Jackson under center, the Ravens running game could be the most effective in the NFL.\n\nHe's rushed for at least 1,000 yards in five of his past six seasons. putting together years of 2,027 (2020), 1,540 (2019) and 1,538 (2022). His production took a dip -- by Henry's standards -- last season when he rushed for only 1,167 yards. His 280 carries were the fewest since 2018.

The Jacksonville Jaguars defeated the Tennessee Titans 34-14. [Corey Perrine/Florida Times-Union] / Corey Perrine/Florida Times-Union / USA\n\nWith the Baltimore Ravens already boasting the league's best rushing offense, the addition of perennial star running back Derrick Henry brings great hype with it.\n\nHenry, who spent the first eight years of his career with the Tennessee Titans, has been arguably the NFL's best running back for half a decade now, and his punishing style of running has captured the hearts of fans league-wide. Now, he joins a team that runs the ball more than any other, and teams up with possibly the greatest rushing quarterback to ever play in the shifty Lamar Jackson. Needless to say, fans can't wait to see how Henry fares in this new offense.\n\nPossibly the biggest fan of this team-up is Fox Sports' Ben Arthur, who believes Henry will unlock \"God mode\" in Baltimore.\n\n\"Henry isn't the same player he was in his prime, when he became the eighth player in NFL history to rush for 2,000 yards in a single season. The inevitable decline becomes a growing concern when you're a 30-year-old running back, even one as great as Henry, who takes incredible care of his body,\" Arthur writes. \"But he still has a ton left in the tank. He ranked second in the NFL last season in rushing playing behind a terrible offensive line for a team that also had a bad passing attack. Opposing defenses were able to lock in on him and he still found success anyway (even if that success came less efficiently).\"\n\nAn underrated facet of the Henry addition is how it will impact the passing game. Henry himself has never been too much of a factor as a receiver, but with his rushing prowess, he will force defenses to stack the box and in turn open up the passing game. Jackson already improved as a passer last season, and should continue to do so with more opportunities to throw.\n\n\"Having two reliable targets in the passing game to boot (ascending second-year receiver Zay Flowers and star tight end Mark Andrews) gives Baltimore one of the NFL's most balanced offenses.

Going from workout to workout, he has been a workhorse.\n\n\"Summer training (has) been going well,\" Henry said. \"Just been staying active every day moving towards the start of the season.\"\n\nHenry received two significant honors this offseason. He was named running back MVP of the Rivals Camp Series Indianapolis and underclassman running back MVP of the 2024 2Tenths Top 150 Camp. The latter was a showcase of 150 of the best high school players in the greater Allegheny region.\n\nHenry said his performance at the camps reflected his mentality of simply focusing on training and letting the results speak for themselves.\n\nCentral Valley coach Mark Lyons likes that about Henry.\n\n\"He brought a work ethic, a mindset that nobody is gonna outwork him,\" Lyons said. \"He's brought that mentality to our program.\"\n\nAn all-Parkway Conference selection at running back last season, Henry has picked up significant interest from Division I programs.

It's really nice being in the (position) where I am able to visit all these schools and learn more about the programs as a whole for the future,\" Henry said.\n\nAs heat week approaches, Henry has the confidence necessary to enjoy a successful 2024 campaign, believing that his training has set him up for great accomplishments down the line.\n\n\"The goals for this season (are) to get somewhere in that 2,000-yard range, but (I want) to ultimately get to the state championship game in December,\" Henry said. \"This season I (am) looking to improve more on my long runs.

If he can break open more big runs and take on a larger workload, it seems plausible that he and the Warriors can achieve all their desires.\n\nWhile nearly doubling his output from last season may seem ambitious, Lyons said Henry can be the bellcow for an aspiring Central Valley team.\n\n\"I'm excited about Jance.

Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports / Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBaltimore Ravens fans are eagerly awaiting the debut of star running back Derrick Henry, especially after years of him tormening them as a member of the Tennessee Titans.\n\nAs it turns out, though, Henry could've made his debut in purple and black much earlier than he actually will.\n\nIn an article released on Wednesday, Dan Pompei of The Athletic revealed that the Ravens and Titans had a Henry trade in place, but some higher-ups in Tennessee wound up nixing the deal before it could go through.\n\n\"[Baltimore general manager Eric] DeCosta agreed to the framework of a trade with Tennessee general manager Ran Carthon -- a fourth-round pick that could have become a third had Henry reached certain production levels. However, others in the Titans hierarchy apparently were not on board with the deal, so Henry played out the season in Nashville,\"\n\nHenry ultimately did land in Baltimore, signing a two-year, $16 million deal in March. However, it would've been interesting to see how differently the season would've gone if this deal had been completed.\n\nOn the Ravens' end, Henry would've made the ground game that much more dangerous, but Baltimore likely would've given some touches to Gus Edwards as well. More importantly, perhaps Henry's presence means the Ravens don't abandon the run against the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Championship game, and perhaps he makes enough of an impact to send Baltimore to the Super Bowl instead. Farfetched for sure, but it wouldn't have been out of the realm of possibility.\n\nThere's also the Titans' side of the equation, which is equally fascinating. Henry was relatively quiet after the Oct. 31 trade deadline, surpassing 100 yards just twice in 10 games. However, one of those games was the regular season finale against the Jacksonville Jaguars, where he ran for 153 yards and a touchdown before bidding an emotional farewell to the Tennessee faithful.\n\nOf course, that game completed an epic collapse by the Jaguars, which saw them lose five of their final six games to fall out of the playoffs. If Henry isn't in Tennessee, though, Jacksonville probably wins that game and wins the AFC South over the Houston Texans. If that happens, perhaps we aren't talking about the Texans as a rising Super Bowl contender, and we're instead talking about the Jaguars in such a fashion.\n\nNo one can say for sure what would've happened if the Henry trade went through, but it's a fascinating hypothetical to think about.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_International_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL International Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_South", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC South"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Texans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Texans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_8001,h_4500,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/raven_country/01j342zdck2ex89tqm16.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744423", "eventUri": "eng-9744423", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-31", "textStart": 1960, "textEnd": 1967}, {"amb": false, "date": "2015-10-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Josh Jacobs and Derrick Henry are available. Who should you choose?\n\nBoth players have moved to new offenses this season.\n\nJacobs goes to Matt LaFleur's Green Bay Packers. The Packers have a promising young signal-caller in Jordan Love, who likes to spread the ball around and is a real threat in the passing game. Last season, they went 9-8 on the back of a solid second half. They ultimately got into the playoffs and defeated the Dallas Cowboys, making them the only seventh-seed in history to win a postseason game.\n\nThe ground game for Green Bay, led by Aaron Jones when he was healthy and AJ Dillon when he was not, averaged 112 rushing yards per game last season (12th) with a mere 10 rushing touchdowns (23rd). Dillon was inefficient (3.4 yards per attempt), and it was Jones's least efficient season on the ground for his career (4.6 yards per attempt). The Packers' 441 attempts ranked 22nd in the league.\n\nJacobs averaged just 3.5 yards per attempt last season in Las Vegas. The Packers also added RB MarShawn Lloyd out of USC in the draft.\n\nCertainly, Green Bay has a better offense than Las Vegas, and the offensive line is a boost for Jacobs. Still, LaFleur is unlikely to commit to one lead runner, stating, \"Philosophically, no matter who the runner is, typically, we like to platoon those guys, whether it's two guys or three guys. I just think it allows the running backs to stay fresh throughout the season. ... Then, when it gets down to the end of it, you've got to roll with whoever you feel gives you the best opportunity to win games.\"\n\nDerrick Henry heads to the Ravens, joining the reigning MVP, Lamar Jackson, in Baltimore. This offense looked a little different with Todd Monken last season, but they still lead the league with 541 team rushing attempts. Jackson was responsible for 148 of those attempts and 821 ground yards- his most since 2020. The rest of the ground game was led by Gus Edwards, Keaton Mitchell, and Justice Hill. Edwards led the group with 810 rushing yards and 13 rushing touchdowns. Edwards is now gone to the Chargers, and Keaton Mitchell is currently on the PUP list and is expected to miss the beginning of the season.\n\nHenry led the league with 280 attempts for the Titans last season, averaging 4.17 yards per carry (Edwards averaged 4.09) for a total of 1,167 yards and tallied 12 rushing touchdowns.\n\nAs mentioned above, Love is a skilled passer who should only improve. That should open up the ground game for Jacobs. He also targeted Jones an average of four times per game for 21.2 receiving yards per game. Jacobs should continue to see some work in the passing game for Green Bay.\n\nLamar Jackson should cede some of the running to Henry, but he won an MVP by doing a lot of it himself. Though Jackson could steal some of the rushing yards, he is unlikely to steal the goal-line carries. Despite leading all QBs in rushing yards last season, he only tallied five rushing touchdowns. That's fewer than Joshua Dobbs and only one more than Trevor Lawrence. Henry should still be a goal-line monster. Jackson has a career 5.9% passing touchdown rate - that's better than Josh Allen, Jalen Hurts, and Kyler Murray. Look for Monken to encourage more of it from Jackson.\n\nJosh Jacobs had a career year in 2022, rushing for a league-leading 1653 yards and logging 12 rushing touchdowns. He also was active in the receiving game with 53 catches for 400 receiving yards. For his career, Jacobs has averaged 4.2 yards per carry, 76 ground yards, and 19.8 receiving yards per game.\n\nLast season was a disappointment. Jacobs averaged just 3.5 yards per attempt and 12.5 fantasy points per game (13th) in his 13 games played despite having 17.9 rushing attempts per game, second only to Kyren Williams. Per Fantasy Points' data, Jacobs had the 12th-highest stuff rate, ranked 37th in missed tackles forced per attempt, and just 44th in yards after contact per attempt.\n\nDerrick Henry has logged 1,000 or more yards in five of his last six seasons, with the only outlier being in 2021, when he missed half the season due to injury. He still tallied 937 rushing yards in 2021 in fewer than eight complete games, putting him on pace for potential back-to-back 2,000-yard seasons. He led the league in rushing yards in the 2019 and 2020 seasons.\n\nFor his career, he has averaged 79.8 yards per game and 4.7 yards per attempt, which are superior to Jacobs's.\n\nHenry logged another excellent season in 2023, with 1,167 rushing yards and 12 rushing touchdowns (tied for 5th), despite a struggling offense, inconsistent quarterback play, and an offensive line that ranked among the worst in the NFL.\n\nHenry has been incredibly durable throughout his career, with the broken foot in 2021 being the outlier. Even playing fewer than eight games that season, he tallied more rushing yards than most runners in an entire season (937).\n\nThe biggest knock on Henry is undoubtedly not his health- it's his age. Henry is in his age-30 season. Injury risk is less of a concern than potential age-related decline. Typically, running backs decline quickly after age 28. However, it's fair to say that Derrick Henry is far from typical.\n\nJacobs missed the last four games in 2023 due to a quad injury. Jacobs has been a tough player throughout his career, playing through multiple shoulder and ankle injuries.\n\nAnyone who follows my content knows I love to use the Sportsbook as a cheat code. Let's face it: Las Vegas is rarely wrong.\n\nJacobs has arguably the worst running back schedule in the NFL this season (32nd). Henry's schedule is middle-of-the-pack (17th).\n\nWinner: Derrick Henry\n\nAfter breaking this down in detail, the only thing that concerns me about Henry is his age.\n\nJacobs will be more efficient with Green Bay, and I expect improvement from last season, but he will likely have fewer opportunities at the goal line, and probably in general, than Henry in Baltimore. It's closer in PPR than in standard, with Jacobs likely having more of a role in the passing game, but Henry still comes out on top.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Fantasy

Josh Jacobs and Derrick Henry are available. Who should you choose?\n\nLet's break it down.\n\nBoth players have moved to new offenses this season.\n\nJacobs goes to Matt LaFleur's Green Bay Packers. The Packers have a promising young signal-caller in Jordan Love, who likes to spread the ball around and is a real threat in the passing game. Last season, they went 9-8 on the back of a solid second half. They ultimately got into the playoffs and defeated the Dallas Cowboys, making them the only seventh-seed in history to win a postseason game.\n\nThe ground game for Green Bay, led by Aaron Jones when he was healthy and AJ Dillon when he was not, averaged 112 rushing yards per game last season (12th) with a mere 10 rushing touchdowns (23rd). Dillon was inefficient (3.4 yards per attempt), and it was Jones's least efficient season on the ground for his career (4.6 yards per attempt). The Packers' 441 attempts ranked 22nd in the league.\n\nJacobs averaged just 3.5 yards per attempt last season in Las Vegas. The Packers also added RB MarShawn Lloyd out of USC in the draft.\n\nCertainly, Green Bay has a better offense than Las Vegas, and the offensive line is a boost for Jacobs. Still, LaFleur is unlikely to commit to one lead runner, stating, \"Philosophically, no matter who the runner is, typically, we like to platoon those guys, whether it's two guys or three guys. I just think it allows the running backs to stay fresh throughout the season. ... Then, when it gets down to the end of it, you've got to roll with whoever you feel gives you the best opportunity to win games.\"\n\nDerrick Henry heads to the Ravens, joining the reigning MVP, Lamar Jackson, in Baltimore. This offense looked a little different with Todd Monken last season, but they still lead the league with 541 team rushing attempts. Jackson was responsible for 148 of those attempts and 821 ground yards- his most since 2020. The rest of the ground game was led by Gus Edwards, Keaton Mitchell, and Justice Hill. Edwards led the group with 810 rushing yards and 13 rushing touchdowns. Edwards is now gone to the Chargers, and Keaton Mitchell is currently on the PUP list and is expected to miss the beginning of the season.\n\nHenry led the league with 280 attempts for the Titans last season, averaging 4.17 yards per carry (Edwards averaged 4.09) for a total of 1,167 yards and tallied 12 rushing touchdowns.\n\nEdge: Derrick Henry\n\nAs mentioned above, Love is a skilled passer who should only improve. That should open up the ground game for Jacobs. He also targeted Jones an average of four times per game for 21.2 receiving yards per game. Jacobs should continue to see some work in the passing game for Green Bay.\n\nLamar Jackson should cede some of the running to Henry, but he won an MVP by doing a lot of it himself. Though Jackson could steal some of the rushing yards, he is unlikely to steal the goal-line carries. Despite leading all QBs in rushing yards last season, he only tallied five rushing touchdowns. That's fewer than Joshua Dobbs and only one more than Trevor Lawrence. Henry should still be a goal-line monster. Jackson has a career 5.9% passing touchdown rate -- that's better than Josh Allen, Jalen Hurts, and Kyler Murray. Look for Monken to encourage more of it from Jackson.\n\nEdge: Push\n\nJosh Jacobs had a career year in 2022, rushing for a league-leading 1653 yards and logging 12 rushing touchdowns. He also was active in the receiving game with 53 catches for 400 receiving yards. For his career, Jacobs has averaged 4.2 yards per carry, 76 ground yards, and 19.8 receiving yards per game.\n\nLast season was a disappointment. Jacobs averaged just 3.5 yards per attempt and 12.5 fantasy points per game (13th) in his 13 games played despite having 17.9 rushing attempts per game, second only to Kyren Williams. Per Fantasy Points' data, Jacobs had the 12th-highest stuff rate, ranked 37th in missed tackles forced per attempt, and just 44th in yards after contact per attempt.\n\nDerrick Henry has logged 1,000 or more yards in five of his last six seasons, with the only outlier being in 2021, when he missed half the season due to injury. He still tallied 937 rushing yards in 2021 in fewer than eight complete games, putting him on pace for potential back-to-back 2,000-yard seasons. He led the league in rushing yards in the 2019 and 2020 seasons.\n\nFor his career, he has averaged 79.8 yards per game and 4.7 yards per attempt, which are superior to Jacobs's.\n\nHenry logged another excellent season in 2023, with 1,167 rushing yards and 12 rushing touchdowns (tied for 5th), despite a struggling offense, inconsistent quarterback play, and an offensive line that ranked among the worst in the NFL.\n\nHenry has been incredibly durable throughout his career, with the broken foot in 2021 being the outlier. Even playing fewer than eight games that season, he tallied more rushing yards than most runners in an entire season (937).\n\nThe biggest knock on Henry is undoubtedly not his health- it's his age. Henry is in his age-30 season. Injury risk is less of a concern than potential age-related decline. Typically, running backs decline quickly after age 28. However, it's fair to say that Derrick Henry is far from typical.\n\nJacobs missed the last four games in 2023 due to a quad injury. Jacobs has been a tough player throughout his career, playing through multiple shoulder and ankle injuries.\n\nEdge: Henry\n\nAnyone who follows my content knows I love to use the Sportsbook as a cheat code. Let's face it: Las Vegas is rarely wrong.\n\nJacobs has arguably the worst running back schedule in the NFL this season (32nd). Henry's schedule is middle-of-the-pack (17th).\n\nAfter breaking this down in detail, the only thing that concerns me about Henry is his age.\n\nJacobs will be more efficient with Green Bay, and I expect improvement from last season, but he will likely have fewer opportunities at the goal line, and probably in general, than Henry in Baltimore. It's closer in PPR than in standard, with Jacobs likely having more of a role in the passing game, but Henry still comes out on top.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports

The Fringe is one of the biggest annual cultural gatherings in the world with theater, comedy, music, dance, musicals, variety shows, children's shows and cabaret taking place on hundreds of stages in Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland.\n\nBefore they depart, the Ghost Light Players will perform \"Henry V\" at 6 p.m. August 3 at the Marlborough Senior Center, 40 New St., Marlborough.\n\nThe visit to Edinburgh will be a return journey for some of the members of the nonprofit Ghost Light Players, who put on their version of Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" there in 2017.\n\n\"The experience itself was phenomenal. Five performances -- four sold out. People came back to see it which is unusual at the Fringe (because there is so much going on),\" said Kat Alix-Gaudreau, president and artistic director of the Ghost Light Players who directed \"Hamlet\" and is now directing \"Henry V.\"\n\n\"Everyone said 'When we are we going back?' I said 'we're not going back unless it is as special as this one ('Hamlet') was.' Then I started thinking, 'I have an idea for 'Henry V.'\"\n\nThe Ghost Light Players are calling it the Fringe 2024 Project.\n\n'O, for a muse of fire'\n\n\"Henry V\" is one of Shakespeare's history plays and focuses on the invasion of France by England's King Henry V (1386-1422) during the 100 Years War. The king uncovers an assassination plot (and treats the traitors ruthlessly), besieges the French port of Harfleur (imploring, \"Once more unto the breach, dear friends\"), and goes on to lead a famous victory at the Battle of Agincourt on Saint Crispin's Day in 1415 despite being heavily outnumbered by French forces over-confident of victory. Before the battle, Shakespeare gives Henry V his famous St. Crispin's Day speech where he rallies his soldiers with words such as \"We few, we happy few, we band of brothers.\"\n\nShakespeare also wrote \"Henry IV\" parts 1 and 2, which shows the often wastrel young Prince Hal (Henry) in his father's reign before he becomes king. \"Henry VI\" parts I, II and III, depicts the horrific Wars of the Roses that unfolded after Henry V's premature death and leaving the kingdom to a child who will prove to be a weak leader.\n\nSo while in \"Henry V\" Shakespeare gives a narrative of the one of the most stirring military victories in England's history, he also provides a study of what it is to be a leader, and the potential of that leader to become dehumanized as a result.\n\n'We band of brothers'\n\nAlix-Gaudreau, who has directed a number of Shakespeare's plays and is also a Shakespeare scholar and teacher, said she has wanted to stage \"Henry V\" for several years.\n\n\"I was struck by the idea of taking that show to the Fringe in the context of what is going on in the world right now,\" she said.\n\n\"I wanted to do a version there we peeled back the glamour and looked at the impact of war and focused on the cost of it. It seemed timely.\"\n\nAlix-Gaudreau will have five actors play King Henry V chronologically during the course of the play to represent five different aspects of his character.\n\n\"Rather than having King Henry V as a good looking charismatic young man I wanted to break the mold,\" she said.\n\nThree of the actors playing the king are women. The five actors are Karina Beleno Carney (UK Performances only), Jennifer Drummond, Natalie Hebert, Chris JM Maloney and Rob Slotnick.\n\nEach actor will in turn literally pass the crown to the next actor to become the king so that the audience will be able to follow along.\n\n\"In each of the five Henry's we are showing the complexity of the character and how the character changes in the course of the play and what it costs him as a king,\" Alix-Gaudreau said. \"This is a person making choices and the choices have consequences.\"\n\nKrisha Hoyt-Mackler, one of the production's producers and also the assistant director, said that Alix-Goudreau has let the cast and crew in on making choices for the show. \"Kat is the kind of director where we can ask questions and build a work together. It's really a collaborative production,\" she said,\n\nThe five different manifestations of King Henry V reflect something \"we see so often in people in positions of power. They become a different person,\" Hoyt-Mackler said.\n\n'A kingdom for a stage'\n\nSir John Falstaff was a drinking friend of Henry when he was a prince, but is rejected by the newly crowned King Henry V at the end of \"Henry IV, Part2\" because he must now act as a king. Alix-Gaudreau takes that scene to help frame the news of Falstaff's death in \"Henry V.\" Similarly she has the funeral of King Henry V in \"Henry VI, Part I\" to show part of the aftermath.\n\nIn Shakespeare's plays the battle scenes are usually off stage and talked about by the characters on stage. \"We put the battle scenes on stage and the execution of prisoners (so that we can see the consequences),\" Alix-Gaudreau said. An intimate, theater-in-the-round setting will combine the performances with deadly combat staging, movement sequences, and modern music. The costumes are in shades of gray. \"We haven't based the show in a historical period necessarily.\"\n\nAlso in \"Henry V,\" Shakespeare has a character, Chorus, introducing and the setting the scenes during the course of the play. Alix-Gaudreau said \"We decided to go back to a more Greek chorus.\" So five actors will take the stage together as Chorus. The Ghost Light Players production has a total cast of twelve in Scotland with most of the actors doubling up and more to play different roles. \"It gives everyone a lot of range,\" she said.\n\nOne important practical facet of the costumes and stage props is that \"they are easy to pack ... Everything has to go to Scotland. We have to keep everything simple.\"\n\nBut the trip is not something to be undertaken lightly. The cost, for example. \"It's a lot of money.\" All told the cost for Fringe Project will be $43,000, Alix-Gaudreau said.\n\nThere has been an IndieGoGo campaign to help raise money, people have made private donations, and every Fringe team member has contributed, she said. \"We're still fundraising.\" Proceeds from the Aug. 3 performance will go to the Fringe Project.\n\nHowever, the Ghost Light Players are not relying on theater ticket sales in Scotland to fund the trip. Any surplus from the production will go to a non-profit group such as Doctors Without Borders or Amnesty International.\n\nAfter the Aug. 3 performance in Marlborough, \"Henry V\" team members will fly out on Aug. 9, land in Scotland Aug. 10, have a tech day for the production Aug. 11, perform \"Henry V\" Aug. 12-16, and fly home Aug. 17. \"It's a whirlwind,\" Alix-Goudreau said.\n\nThe show falls right in the middle of the Fringe Festival. \"Henry V\" will be performed at a space called the Space@Niddry Street in Edinburgh. The theater seats about 70.\n\n\"The Fringe has a box office. We've already sold some tickets,\" Alix-Goudreau said.\n\nHoyt-Mackler also made the trip to Edinburgh in 2017 with \"Hamlet.\" The festival draws \"thousands of people. It's a unique experience you can't find anywhere else,\" she said. \"The Fringe is such a great opportunity for actors and theater makers to share their work with each other.\"\n\nBack home, the Ghost Light Players have been putting on productions since 2012 with a large percentage of them Shakespeare plays, and people seem to like experiencing them in Marlborough as well. \"They're (Shakespeare plays) some of our best attended shows,\" Hoyt-Mackler said.\n\n\"People like having Shakespeare right in their own back yards.\"", "source": {"uri": "eu.telegram.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Period. Not up for debate,\" Kuharsky wrote on X on Friday morning.\n\n\"If they are on the goal line at the end of a game they are trailing by 4, and you want him to score, you are not the TEN fan you think you are.\"\n\nHenry saw the tweet and sent a six-word response: \"Paul go find something to do.\"\n\nLater, Kuharsky explained his rationale given that there's somewhat of a rivalry between the Ravens and Titans.\n\nPresented with a hypothetical where the Ravens were playing the Titans' AFC-South-rival Texans, Kuharsky responded, \"That's one game. I'm making perfect sense. Ravens are probably No. 1 most-hated team for vast majority of TEN fans.\"\n\nIn 2021, the Ravens knocked the Titans out of the playoffs with a 20-13 win in the Wild Card round, avenging a Divisional round game the year before when the Titans won 28-12.\n\nThere has been some chippiness when the teams have played each other in recent years, and last year a fight between then-Ravens wideout Odell Beckham Jr. and Titans defensive end Jeffrey Simmons apparently spilled into the postgame after a physical game in London.\n\nThis offseason, Henry signed a two-year deal with the Ravens for $16 million, with $9 million guaranteed.\n\nHe played his first eight NFL seasons with the Titans, with the highlight coming in 2020 when he rushed for over 2,000 yards and won the AP Offensive Player of the Year.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_FBS_independent_schools", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I FBS independent schools"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Volunteers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Volunteers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odell_Beckham_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Odell Beckham Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press_NFL_Offensive_Player_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/tennessee-titans-running-back-derrick-18841015.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744423", "eventUri": "eng-9744423", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

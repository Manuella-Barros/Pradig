Shane Lowry is one of 18 Olympians in the 2024 Wyndham Championship field, heading straight from Paris to Greensboro, N.C. Lowry is the second-highest ranked golfer in the FedEx Cup Standings who is in the field this week, with his No. 10 ranking one spot worse than Sungjae Im (No. 9). The top 70 players in points advance to the playoffs, so there are multiple players trying to make a crucial move up the standings this week.\n\nBrendon Todd (No. 70), Victor Perez (No. 71), Davis Riley (No. 72) and Andrew Putnam (No. 73) are all on the bubble heading into Thursday's opening round (6:50 a.m. ET start). They are all longshots on the PGA odds board, so should you back any of them with your 2024 Wyndham Championship bets? Before locking in your 2024 Wyndham Championship picks or PGA props, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.\n\nOur proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up more than $9,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.\n\nThis same model has also nailed a whopping 13 majors entering the weekend, including the 2024 Masters -- its third Masters in a row -- and this year's PGA Championship and U.S. Open. Anyone who has followed it has seen massive returns.\n\nNow with the Wyndham Championship 2024 field set, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard.\n\nTop 2024 Wyndham Championship golf predictions\n\nOne surprise: Jordan Spieth, a three-time major champion, does not finish inside the top 10 this week. He is narrowly inside the top 70 in the FedEx Cup point standings, currently sitting at No. 63. The 31-year-old is making his fourth Wyndham Championship appearance and his first since 2020, with his best finish being a runner-up during his 2013 rookie season.\n\nIt has been another disappointing campaign for Spieth, who has just three top-10 finishes in 20 tournaments. He has not finished better than T25 since early April, and he has missed the cut on six occasions. Spieth ranks No. 116 on the PGA Tour in strokes gained approaching the green, which is one reason why the model has him finishing outside the top 10 this week.\n\nThe model has also examined where Im finishes. The 26-year-old Korean is a two-time PGA Tour winner but he's having arguably his most consistent season as a professional, collecting seven top-10 finishes on tour this season in 21 starts. He won in Korea earlier in 2024 and he's been 12th or better in nine of his last 11 worldwide starts.\n\nIm has also had three top-10 finishes in five career starts at the Wyndham Championship but he's gone nearly three years now since his last PGA Tour victory. He ranks 92nd on tour this season in strokes gained: approach (0.075) and 81st in strokes gained: putting (0.095), so he'll need to clean up those two areas of his game to finally end this winless drought. The model just locked in its Sungjae Im Wyndham Championship picks here.\n\nHow to make 2024 Wyndham Championship picks\n\nThe model has revealed where Sungjae Im and Jordan Spieth finish, along with identifying four golfers with odds of 35-1 or longer to make a strong run at the title. Anyone who backs these longshots could hit it big. You can only see the model's picks here.\n\nWho will win the 2024 Wyndham Championship, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

The top 125 players in the FedEx Cup standings retain their PGA Tour cards, while only the top 70 will be eligible to play the FedEx St. Jude Championship to begin the PGA Tour playoffs next week. Frenchman Victor Perez finished just off the podium in the Olympic men's golf tournament last week in Paris but now he'll have to make the quick turnaround to play this week at Sedgefield Country Club in Greensboro. The first tee times come at 6:50 a.m. ET on Thursday.\n\nPerez is currently 71st in the FedEx Cup standings and he's listed as an 80-1 longshot in the 2024 Wyndham Championship odds. Meanwhile, Sungjae Im is the 16-1 favorite in this week's PGA Tour odds, while Shane Lowry, Billy Horschel and Si Woo Kim are all priced at 25-1. Before locking in your 2024 Wyndham Championship picks, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.\n\nSportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up nearly $9,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.\n\nThis same model has also nailed a whopping 13 majors entering the weekend, including the 2024 Masters -- its third Masters in a row -- and this year's PGA Championship and U.S. Open. Anyone who has followed it has seen massive returns.\n\nNow with the 2024 Wyndham Championship field locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard.\n\nTop 2024 Wyndham Championship predictions\n\nOne major surprise the model is calling for at the 2024 Wyndham Championship: Horschel (25-1), an eight-time winner on the PGA Tour and one of the top favorites, stumbles this week and barely cracks the top 10. Horschel is coming off an impressive T-2 finish at the Open Championship, his best-ever showing in a major championship.\n\nHowever, Horschel had been struggling mightily prior to that outing, finishing T-41 or worse in three consecutive starts, which included a missed cut at the Genesis Scottish Open. Horschel's iron play has been wildly inconsistent all season and he enters the Wyndham Championship ranked 102nd in greens in regulation percentage (65.65%) and 120th in strokes gained: approach to green (-0.113), which doesn't bode well for his chances to finish on top of the leaderboard this week. See who else to fade here.\n\nAnother surprise: Keith Mitchell, a 60-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He has a much better chance to win it all than his odds imply, so he's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. Like Perez, Mitchell needs a big week at Sedgefield to earn his spot in the 2024 FedEx Cup Playoffs. He's currently 79th in the FedEx Cup standings and is the 91st-ranked player in the Official World Golf Ranking.\n\nMitchell scored his lone PGA Tour win at the 2019 Honda Classic but he's had three top-10 finishes this season and has been top 25 nine times while making the cut 15 times in 21 PGA Tour starts. He's made the cut in three of his four career starts at the Wyndham Championship and his ball striking should come in handy this week. Mitchell ranks fifth on the PGA Tour this season in strokes gained: tee-to-green (1.399).

This year, the longstanding event in Greensboro, North Carolina falls in the aftermath of a captivating Men's Golf competition at the Paris Olympics. (19 golfers will tee it up at Le Golf National and Sedgefield Country Club.) In similar fashion, the Wyndham has a chance to produce a host of compelling storylines.\n\nHere's why the Wyndham is a big deal, beyond just the 500 FedExCup points and $1.4 million (of the $7.9 million purse) that goes to the winner.\n\nThe top 125 finishers in the FedExCup standings will be guaranteed PGA Tour membership through 2025. The Wyndham used to be the last opportunity for dozens of golfers to cement their status. Beginning this year, players can accrue points in the FedExCup Fall -- a spate of events culminating with the RSM Classic.\n\nStill, a strong showing at Sedgefield can go a long way.\n\n\"There's going to be a tournament to win and that will be a focus,\" Jordan Spieth said at his pre-tournament press conference in Greensboro. \"But you almost get to have double the excitement on some of the things, guys making the Playoffs, guys kind of getting in the top 125 or making a big push to where they can get their jobs back through the rest of the fall.\n\n\"There's a lot at stake here and I think this event will just continue to get better and better, which is good because it deserves to be.\"\n\nFedExCup Playoffs\n\nThe PGA Tour regular season finale is the last chance for golfers to earn a spot in the FedExCup Playoffs, which begin with next week's FedEx St. Jude Invitational at TPC Southwind in Memphis. The top 70 in the standings post-Wyndham qualify. (This year, no. 71 will make it, in place of Grayson Murray). The top 50 after that progress to the BMW Championship in Denver and secure 2025 Signature Events spots. The final top 30 advance to the TOUR Championship at East Lake.\n\nWe don't need to remind Justin Thomas. Last year, JT needed a birdie on the 18th hole of the Wyndham to make the playoffs, when this happened ...\n\n(Thomas is 19th right now, so he's good.)\n\nJT's buddy, Jordan Spieth, sits 63rd. He's clinched Memphis, but not Denver. Spieth appears headed for offseason wrist surgery, so securing the '25 signature events would be clutch.\n\nFrance's Victor Perez -- who, unfortunately, doesn't get points for his spirited Sunday 63 in front of a frenzied crowd in Paris -- currently occupies the 71st place. The 31-year-old enters the Wyndham with a three-point advantage over no. 71 Davis Riley, eight points ahead of no. 72, Andrew Putnam. Perez needs at least a cut to nab a postseason spot.\n\nNick Dunlap began 2024 as a sophomore at University of Alabama. Eight months later, he's a PGA Tour professional with two (!) wins under his belt. Dunlap is only 65th in the FedEx though, so he'll be focused on protecting his Memphis ticket while trying to book a trip to Denver. Also, he's only 20.\n\nDefending Wyndham champ Lucas Glover, currently 76th in the standings, needs a top-24 result to advance. Last year, Glover's win vaulted him from 112th to 49th -- and he carried the momentum into a victory at the St. Jude.\n\nUnrelated: Wyndham Clark is not in the Wyndham Championship.", "source":

Then the top 50 advance to the BMW Championship at Castle Pines in Colorado, and the top 30 will end the season at the Tour Championship in East Lake in Atlanta, where a $100 million prize pool will be divvied up. The winner walks away with $25 million.\n\nBut the first order of business is getting within that top 70, and the majority of players in the 156-man field this week are looking to get inside that cutoff. Several are trying to stay inside.\n\nOne note: the late Grayson Murray was inside the top 60 in the standings and those behind him will be moving up one spot once the Wyndham begins. So for example Victor Perez, previously 71st in points, will tee at the cutoff spot, No. 70.\n\nHere's a look at some notable names on both sides of the top-70 cutoff.\n\nJordan Spieth (62nd when the Wyndham begins): Will be safe for Memphis but a big effort this week would help his chances for the second round of the playoffs. But once his season is over? He said Tuesday that wrist surgery is in the picture.\n\nNick Dunlap (65th): If this position sounds low for a winner of two Tour events this season, it is-but Dunlap was an amateur when he won the American Express in January and therefore received no money or points, otherwise he'd be on the doorstep for East Lake. Instead he'll have to work harder to get there, starting this week.\n\nJhonattan Vegas(66th): The playoffs may have a Cinderella story already in the 39-year-old Venezuelan, who ended a seven-year victory drought two weeks ago at the 3M Open, vaulting from 139th in points to 66th. He not a playoff lock yet but he's on the right side of the line with one week to go.\n\nVictor Perez (70th): The Frenchman delighted the Olympic crowd with a fourth-place finish but he had to hop back across the pond quickly to Sedgefield and hope the good play continues at least one more week. He is all of three points ahead of the next man, who is ...\n\nDavis Riley (71st): Here's a question: Should the PGA Tour be like NASCAR, where any regular-season win automatically puts you in the playoffs? Riley won the Charles Schwab Challenge in late May, but because he has no other finish higher than T14, he's on the outside looking in with one event to go. One could say \"play better\" but one could also look at the signature event structure, with its elevated points, and wonder if this is fair.\n\nLucas Glover (75th): The South Carolina native was the success story a year ago in North Carolina, winning the Wyndham to make the top 70, then winning the first playoff event to sail all the way to East Lake, where he finished T18 (tied with Jon Rahm, by the way). But the momentum hasn't carried over; he's missed four of his last six cuts to fall out of the top 70.\n\nNicolai H\u00f8jgaard (79th): The 2023 Ryder Cup rookie opened his PGA Tour season with a runner-up at the Farmers Insurance Open but earned more points there than the entire rest of the season combined. He's 101 points behind 70th and will need a big week.\n\nRickie Fowler (103rd): This is the end of the line. The fan favorite opted not to play the Wyndham.\n\nMatt Kuchar (112th): Kooch is the only player to qualify for all 17 previous iterations of the playoffs and will need a win this week to keep the streak alive. He finished a season-best T3 at the 3M Open, so he arrives with some form.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Notable Golfers on the FedEx Cup Playoff Bubble (Plus One Who Is

Yes, there are still tournaments to be played after the FedEx Cup playoffs and the Presidents Cup, but the big bonus money and perhaps the postseason awards for the tour are all decided in the three-event playoff series.\n\nFor the elite players in the game, getting to the Tour Championship is sometimes a given, since they generally always have a big season. But for the journeymen players and especially for rookies, the chance to qualify for the playoffs can be a career-changing moment.\n\nHere's five things to know about the chase for the playoffs:\n\nFew multiple winners in 2024\n\nIt has been a year of one-and-done winners on the PGA Tour with players popping in for a win and then not winning again in 2024. Only five players have won at least twice. Scottie Scheffler has won six times, including a major at the Masters. Xander Schauffele has two wins, but both are majors at the PGA Championship and the British Open. Rory McIlroy, Robert McIntyre and The American Express winner Nick Dunlap are the other three multiple winners this year.\n\nMore: One-hit wonder? American Express winner Nick Dunlap proves doubters wrong with second win\n\nOnly the top 70 advance to the playoffs\n\nWhile Scheffler, Schauffele and McIlroy don't have to worry about finishing in the top 70 of the FedEx Cup points race, that's really what the Wyndham Championship is about this week. Players floating around that 70 number need a big performance to secure a top-70 spot in the FedEx St. Jude Championship, the first of the three FedEx Cup playoff events. One of those players is Dunlap, who was denied 500 FedEx Cup points with his The American Express victory because he was still an amateur at the time. Dunlap is 66th entering the Wyndham event.\n\nBig names on the outside\n\nThere are a few names that most golf fans know who are currently outside of the top 70 and need a serious performance. Rickie Fowler, for instance, is 104th on the points list, but he is not in the field of the Wyndham. Players who are outside fighting for a playoff spot include Victor Perez of France, who made a strong run at the Summer Olympics. Perez is 71st on the points list, while other players outside looking in include Lucas Glover (76th), Charley Hoffman (86th), C.T. Pan (89th) and Matt Kuchar (113rd).\n\nTop players are not entered\n\nIf you are among the top points earners for the year, there is a chance you are not only secure into the first playoff event but perhaps all the way into the third event, The Tour Championship. So perhaps it is not a surprise that just one week after the Summer Olympics, eight of the top 10 players in the FedEx Cup points aren't in the field. Sungjae Im at ninth and Shane Lowry at 10th are the top players in the field and have a chance to move up in the Comcast Business Top 10, which awards bonus money for finishing in the top 10 of the point standings for the year.\n\nMaking the playoffs means money\n\nEvery golfer who gets into the FedEx Cup playoffs secures a share of the $100 million bonus pool. The winner gets $25 million, but second place gets $12.5 million.

However, his goal is to make it to East Lake for the first time, which is why he's hoping to bank some extra points - and some bonus cash via the Comcast Business Tour Top 10 - at Sedgefield Country Club.\n\n\"I was trying to make the decision over the last couple of weeks, because if I don't do as well in the The Open, I wasn't going to go and chase it,\" Lowry said. \"I don't like chasing stuff. But I also hate the unknown. I like to know what I'm doing and plan where I'm going. ... I sort of sat down with my coach and my team last week and were like, right, what's the best thing to do? I was like, look, there's only four weeks left in the FedExCup. I think this is probably going to be one of the best chances I'll ever have to actually win the FedExCup, so every point might count at the end of the day as well, not only for Comcast, and if I can make a hundred FedExCup points next week or more, it's certainly going to help me along the way.\n\n\"At the end of the day, I have goal in my head where I want to be going into Atlanta and if I'm there, I think I'll have a shot of doing something cool.\"\n\nJoining Im and Lowry in the Wyndham field are 21 of the current FedExCup top 50, a benchmark that after the FedEx St. Jude secures spots in all of next year's signature events.

Yes, there are still tournaments to be played after the FedEx Cup playoffs and the Presidents Cup, but the big bonus money and perhaps the postseason awards for the tour are all decided in the three-event playoff series.\n\nFor the elite players in the game, getting to the Tour Championship is sometimes a given, since they generally always have a big season. But for the journeymen players and especially for rookies, the chance to qualify for the playoffs can be a career-changing moment.\n\nHere's five things to know about the chase for the playoffs:\n\nIt has been a year of one-and-done winners on the PGA Tour with players popping in for a win and then not winning again in 2024. Only five players have won at least twice. Scottie Scheffler has won six times, including a major at the Masters. Xander Schauffele has two wins, but both are majors at the PGA Championship and the British Open. Rory McIlroy, Robert McIntyre and The American Express winner Nick Dunlap are the other three multiple winners this year.\n\nMore: One-hit wonder? American Express winner Nick Dunlap proves doubters wrong with second win\n\nWhile Scheffler, Schauffele and McIlroy don't have to worry about finishing in the top 70 of the FedEx Cup points race, that's really what the Wyndham Championship is about this week. Players floating around that 70 number need a big performance to secure a top-70 spot in the FedEx St. Jude Championship, the first of the three FedEx Cup playoff events. One of those players is Dunlap, who was denied 500 FedEx Cup points with his The American Express victory because he was still an amateur at the time. Dunlap is 66th entering the Wyndham event.\n\nThere are a few names that most golf fans know who are currently outside of the top 70 and need a serious performance. Rickie Fowler, for instance, is 104th on the points list, but he is not in the field of the Wyndham. Players who are outside fighting for a playoff spot include Victor Perez of France, who made a strong run at the Summer Olympics. Perez is 71st on the points list, while other players outside looking in include Lucas Glover (76th), Charley Hoffman (86th), C.T. Pan (89th) and Matt Kuchar (113rd).\n\nIf you are among the top points earners for the year, there is a chance you are not only secure into the first playoff event but perhaps all the way into the third event, The Tour Championship. So perhaps it is not a surprise that just one week after the Summer Olympics, eight of the top 10 players in the FedEx Cup points aren't in the field. Sungjae Im at ninth and Shane Lowry at 10th are the top players in the field and have a chance to move up in the Comcast Business Top 10, which awards bonus money for finishing in the top 10 of the point standings for the year.\n\nEvery golfer who gets into the FedEx Cup playoffs secures a share of the $100 million bonus pool. The winner gets $25 million, but second place gets $12.5 million. Those numbers decrease until the players who finish last in the playoff pool in the first of the three playoff events still get some guaranteed cash of more than $40,000. So getting to the top 70 isn't just about bragging rights. It's about money, too.\n\nLarry Bohannan is the golf writer for The Desert Sun.

Then the top 50 advance to the BMW Championship at Castle Pines in Colorado, and the top 30 will end the season at the Tour Championship in East Lake in Atlanta, where a $100 million prize pool will be divvied up. The winner walks away with $25 million.\n\nBut the first order of business is getting within that top 70, and the majority of players in the 156-man field this week are looking to get inside that cutoff. Several are trying to stay inside.\n\nOne note: the late Grayson Murray was inside the top 60 in the standings and those behind him will be moving up one spot once the Wyndham begins. So for example Victor Perez, previously 71st in points, will tee at the cutoff spot, No. 70.\n\nHere's a look at some notable names on both sides of the top-70 cutoff.\n\nJordan Spieth (62nd when the Wyndham begins): Will be safe for Memphis but a big effort this week would help his chances for the second round of the playoffs. But once his season is over? He said Tuesday that wrist surgery is in the picture.\n\nNick Dunlap (65th): If this position sounds low for a winner of two Tour events this season, it is -- but Dunlap was an amateur when he won the American Express in January and therefore received no money or points, otherwise he'd be on the doorstep for East Lake. Instead he'll have to work harder to get there, starting this week.\n\nJhonattan Vegas (66th): The playoffs may have a Cinderella story already in the 39-year-old Venezuelan, who ended a seven-year victory drought two weeks ago at the 3M Open, vaulting from 139th in points to 66th. He not a playoff lock yet but he's on the right side of the line with one week to go.\n\nVictor Perez (70th): The Frenchman delighted the Olympic crowd with a fourth-place finish but he had to hop back across the pond quickly to Sedgefield and hope the good play continues at least one more week. He is all of three points ahead of the next man, who is ...\n\nDavis Riley (71st): Here's a question: Should the PGA Tour be like NASCAR, where any regular-season win automatically puts you in the playoffs? Riley won the Charles Schwab Challenge in late May, but because he has no other finish higher than T14, he's on the outside looking in with one event to go. One could say \"play better\" but one could also look at the signature event structure, with its elevated points, and wonder if this is fair.\n\nLucas Glover (75th): The South Carolina native was the success story a year ago in North Carolina, winning the Wyndham to make the top 70, then winning the first playoff event to sail all the way to East Lake, where he finished T18 (tied with Jon Rahm, by the way). But the momentum hasn't carried over; he's missed four of his last six cuts to fall out of the top 70.\n\nNicolai H\u00f8jgaard (79th): The 2023 Ryder Cup rookie opened his PGA Tour season with a runner-up at the Farmers Insurance Open but earned more points there than the entire rest of the season combined. He's 101 points behind 70th and will need a big week.\n\nRickie Fowler (103rd): This is the end of the line. The fan favorite opted not to play the Wyndham.\n\nMatt Kuchar (112th): Kooch is the only player to qualify for all 17 previous iterations of the playoffs and will need a win this week to keep the streak alive. He finished a season-best T3 at the 3M Open, so he arrives with some form.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Looks like the weekend will be beautiful, so, hopefully, we move along just fine and, hopefully, the forecast improves.\"\n\nSpieth, playing for the first time since The Open Championship last month, is No. 63 in the standings. He's in the Wyndham Championship field for just the fourth time, with a memorable 2013 playoff loss to Patrick Reed resulting in his best finish.\n\nWill Zalatoris, who was a college standout at nearby Wake Forest, said the Sedgefield greens tend to be slick and putting up good scores is possible for golfers who find the right touch.\n\n\"It's just trying to run the tables around here,\" Zalatoris said. \"These are some of the best greens we have on tour, so just give yourself as many looks as you can and get hot with the putter and make a run.\"\n\nJhonattan Vegas won the 3M Open two weeks ago, so he will look to build on that.\n\n\"It's a golf course that requires a lot of precision off the tee and into the greens and even around the greens,\" Vegas said. \"I love where I'm at and excited to make a push to the end of the year.\"\n\nSnedeker was presented with the Payne Stewart Award, which is based on character, sportsmanship and charitable giving, on Tuesday at the course. He tends to be a fan favorite here.\n\n\"Obviously been a tough year for me on the golf course,\" said Snedeker, a two-time winner (2007, 2018) in Greensboro. \"But I think grinding and practicing hard and feel like I'm close to doing something really good and hoping all these things line up this week for a good week for me.\"\n\nThe defending champion is Lucas Glover. The tournament hasn't had a back-to-back winner since Sam Snead's 1956 title.\n\nTwenty-one golfers who competed in last week's Olympics are in the field. Keegan Bradley, who was recently named captain of the U.S. team for the 2025 Ryder Cup, is playing in Greensboro for the first time since 2017.", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@myrtlebeachonline.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FedEx Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedgefield_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sedgefield Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Hotels_&_Resorts", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Hotels & Resorts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greensboro,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greensboro, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greensboro, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Zalatoris", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Zalatoris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandt_Snedeker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandt Snedeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jhonattan_Vegas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jhonattan Vegas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3M_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "3M Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Snead", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Snead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Glover", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucas Glover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payne_Stewart_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Payne Stewart Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_Forest_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wake Forest University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/wps/build/images/myrtlebeachonline/facebook.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799086", "eventUri": "eng-9799086", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Outside of a weather-shortened Pebble Beach Pro-Am in February, most of the year has gone off without incident -- until this week.\n\nTropical Storm Debby has delayed the start of the 2024 Wyndham Championship, moving first-round action to Friday -- at least for now. Debby is slamming the East Coast of the United States and could severely disrupt or even shorten the last Tour event before the FedEx Cup Playoffs.\n\nThursday's start time was initially delayed until 3 p.m. ET at Sedgefield Country, and with more rain expected on Friday, there is a chance that the entire tournament does not start until Saturday.\n\nThis affects a variety of players who are trying to play their way into the top 70 in the FedEx Cup standings and into the first playoff event, the FedEx St. Jude Invitational next week in Memphis.\n\nPlayers like Victor Perez, Davis Riley, Andrew Putnam, Kurt Kitayama and Luke List, who are the first five out when it comes to the top 70 that make it on to Memphis. If the event is played, they could feasibly earn enough FedEx Cup points to get into the top 70 and into the playoffs.\n\nAccording to the PGA Tour handbook, \"If conditions exist which make the completion of 72 holes impossible, the next priority is to complete 54 holes, thereby the winner is credited with an official victory.\"\n\nBeyond that, the next priority is 36 holes, a situation in which players would receive official money and FedEx Cup points but the winner would be credited with an unofficial victory.\n\nPlay \"will not extend past Tuesday under any circumstances unless the event can be rescheduled and replayed in its entirety.\"\n\nThe good news here is that the forecast for Greensboro, North Carolina, looks decent starting on Saturday. The bad news is that the golf course is going to be soaked by then, and the tournament could be a bit of a mess if and when they do attempt to play it.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyle_porter@cbssports.com", "name": "Kyle Porter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FedEx Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach_Golf_Links", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach Golf Links"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Riley", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Davis Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Perez_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victor Perez (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGC_Invitational", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WGC Invitational"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Kitayama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kurt Kitayama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_List_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luke List (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Putnam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Putnam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Jude_Children's_Research_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Jude Children's Research Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FedEx"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greensboro,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greensboro, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greensboro, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/08/08/98cddac4-c02d-4c70-9ea3-5abc93fbc5c7/thumbnail/1200x675/10f41077392ac35454c5a8c1203792ac/wyndaham-championship-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799086", "eventUri": "eng-9799086", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

The tournament will be played at the Sedgefield Country Club, a course built in 1926 based on a design by Donald Ross, which has hosted several editions of the Wyndham Championship.\n\nThe first edition of the Greater Greensboro Open (now Wyndham) was played in 1938, won by Sam Snead. Over the years, the tournament has moved to various locations, until 2008, when it returned to Sedgefield and stayed there.\n\nIn 2007, the course underwent a $3 million restoration project to restore the layout to Ross's original layout, and today it retains all of its features, with challenging greens and steep slopes. Several of the champions we saw at the Paris Olympics last week will be on the course to try to break into the top 70 in the FedEx Cup points standings and earn a spot in the upcoming FedEx St.\n\nJude Championship at TPC Southwind. Among the latter will be Shane Lowry of Ireland, Nick Taylor of Canada, Min Woo Lee of Australia and Nicolai H\u00f8jgaard of Denmark. The pros on the course will compete for a spot in the Playoffs, but also for a great prize pool of $1.4 million that will go to the winner of the tournament.\n\nA full 40 of the top 70 FedEx Cup players will play at Sedgefield Country Club, including top-40 players Brian Harman, Robert MacIntyre, Sungjae Im, Keegan Bradley, Cameron Young, Akshay Bhatia, Billy Horschel and Justin Rose.\n\nThe defending champion is Lucas Glover, currently ranked 76th in the FedEx rankings. In 2023, the American champion won by two shots, moving from 112th to 49th to enter the Playoffs and will certainly hope to repeat that feat.\n\nChallenge Tour - Farmfoods Scottish Challenge supported by the R&A\n\nThe Challenge Tour moves to Scotland this week for the Farmfoods Scottish Challenge supported by the R&A, which will be held at Newmachar Golf Club from 8 to 11 August.\n\nThe Scottish Challenge has been a fixture on the Challenge Tour for the best part of 20 years, starting in 2006 at Murcar Links before moving to Macdonald Cardrona for the next two years and Macdonald Spey Valley from 2009 to 2018.\n\nAfter a four-year hiatus, it returned in 2022 at a new venue: Newmachar Golf Club in Aberdeen. The list of past winners has been dominated by British players, with 11 local winners, including DP World Tour winners David Law, who won in 2018, and Andrew 'Beef' Johnston, who recorded his first win in the tournament in 2014.\n\nAlthough there have only been four non-British winners, the list does include five-time Major winner Brooks Koepka, whose 2013 victory was his third of the season and guaranteed him automatic promotion to the DP World Tour.\n\nKoepka also triumphed at the Montecchia Golf Open that season. The Hawkshill course at Newmachar Golf Club was designed by renowned architect Dave Thomas and \"the voice of golf\" Peter Alliss and opened in 1990 after over a decade of planning and construction.\n\nThe heathland course is over 6,150 metres and demands precision in every shot, with narrow fairways lined with trees that require control off the tee. Players will also have to deal with the many bunkers around the greens on their approaches.\n\nA strong field of players gathers in Aberdeen this week, with the Road to Mallorca rankings' two and three - England's John Parry and Spaniard Joel Moscatel - looking for a third win of the season to secure automatic promotion to the DP World Tour.\n\nJoining them are a number of DP World Tour winners, including Denmark's Lucas Bjerregaard, England's David Horsey and Scotsman Marc Warren, who is seeking a second individual title on home soil this week after triumphing at Gleneagles in the 2007 Johnnie Walker Championship.\n\nAlso in attendance at Newmachar are Tapio Pulkkanen, fresh from representing his native Finland at the Olympics, and 16-year-old Junior Ryder Cup winner Kris Kim, who will make his Challenge Tour debut this week. There will be four Italians in the field with Gregorio De Leo, Enrico di Nitto and Aron Zemmer, respectively 38th, 42nd and 47th last week at the K Club, joined by Pietro Bovari and Flavio Michetti.",

I've been very close a couple of times. I'm pretty much guaranteed there now, so it's nice to be playing these next four weeks with a bit of freedom.\n\n\"I feel if I can be in the top six to 10 category going into East Lake and starting a few shots behind Scottie's not great.

Pan (89th), Japan's Ryo Hisatsune (107th) and China's Carl Yuan (126th) who are fighting to qualify for the Playoffs.\n\n\"I know I need to get into the top-2 or win the event,\" said Lee on Wednesday.\n\nThe amiable Korean is counting on a tied ninth finish at the 3M Open two weeks ago to provide the momentum required for a strong finish at Sedgefield Country Club in Greensboro, North Carolina. The popular venue has been a happy hunting ground for Korean golfers in recent times, with Kim Si-woo winning in 2016 and Tom Kim in 2022.\n\n\"This is the final event of the Regular Season. I'm now standing at 99th place but need to grind and push into the top-70. I have prepared a lot after taking a week off. I know this golf course has many Korean winners and I'm looking forward to a great week. I was not able to make top-10 here before but I'm in a good flow from my last event so I'm looking forward to it,\" he said.\n\nTwo years ago, Lee was flying high as he qualified for the Tour Championship at East Lake in Atlanta for the first time in his career and also represented the International Team at the Presidents Cup. Admittedly, his game took a downturn as he missed the Playoffs last year when the qualifying criteria was changed from the top-125 to the top-70.\n\nHe has featured at Sedgefield five times previously, with a T24 in 2021 being his best finish. However, shooting four rounds in the 60s at the 3M, the first time he has done so since March, may just be the confidence boost that he needs. \"Before the 3M Open, I was not performing great with many missed cuts and some withdrawals. However, I was able to enjoy a strong performance at the 3M so I'm trying to stick to what works for me,\" he said.\n\n\"This has been a bit of a tough season. I had some hard times and hard events but I'm trying to finish strong. I still have one event to get into FedExCup Playoffs so I will do my best. If I don't make it, there will be time for me to practice and get better (for the Fall events from October).\"\n\nCompatriots Im Sung-jae, ranked ninth, and Kim Si-woo, who is 36th on the FedExCup points list, are also in the field for the final event of the 2024 PGA Tour Regular Season. The FedExCup Playoffs consists of three tournaments -- FedEx St. Jude Championship (top-70), BMW Championship (top-50) and Tour Championship (top-30).\n\nBY CHUAH CHOO CHIANG [kjdsports@joongang.co.kr]", "source": {"uri": "koreajoongangdaily.joins.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "\uc911\uc559\uc77c\ubcf4"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3M_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "3M Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Kyoung-hoon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lee Kyoung-hoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/89th_Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "89th Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taipei"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Taipei"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of China (Taiwan)"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kim", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Kim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Jude_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Jude Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedgefield_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sedgefield Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Si-woo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kim Si-woo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Lake_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East Lake Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greensboro,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greensboro, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greensboro, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Im_Sung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Im Sung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tour Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Championship_(PGA_Tour)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BMW Championship (PGA Tour)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidents_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidents Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedgefield", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sedgefield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sedgefield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/data/photo/2024/08/08/f4e7e301-ad46-426e-b0fe-2fcab5db90f4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799086", "eventUri": "eng-9799086", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

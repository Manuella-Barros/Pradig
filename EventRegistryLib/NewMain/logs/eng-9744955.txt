Southwest Key, the largest housing provider for unaccompanied migrant children has been accused of \"severe, pervasive, and unwelcome sexual abuse of and harassment\" of children in its care, the Justice Department said Thursday, July 18, 2024.\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Employees of the largest housing provider for unaccompanied migrant children in the U.S. repeatedly sexually abused and harassed children in their care for at least eight years, the Justice Department said Thursday, alleging a shocking litany of offenses that took place as the company amassed billions of dollars in government contracts.\n\nSouthwest Key Programs Inc. employees, including supervisors, raped, touched or solicited sex and nude images of children beginning in 2015 and possibly earlier, the Justice Department said in a lawsuit filed this week. At least two employees have been indicted on criminal charges related to the allegations since 2020.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many children are currently in Southwest Key's vast network of shelters across three states, which have room for more than 6,300 children. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment beyond the lawsuit announcement when asked whether the department recommended that children be removed from the shelters or that the the nonprofit's contracts be terminated.\n\n\"In some cases, Southwest Key employees threatened children to maintain their silence,\" the lawsuit states. \"In harassing these children, these Southwest Key employees exploited the children's vulnerabilities, language barriers, and distance from family and loved ones.\"\n\nIn a statement, Southwest Key said it was reviewing the complaint and disputed the portrayal of its care for children.\n\nThe nonprofit organization is the largest provider of housing for unaccompanied migrant children, operating under grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It has 29 child migrant shelters -- 17 in Texas, 10 in Arizona and two in California. The company's largest shelter in Brownsville, Texas, is at a converted Walmart with a capacity for 1,200.\n\nThe provider has been a major but somewhat low-profile player in the government's response to the arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrant children traveling alone in recent years and during the separation of thousands of families in 2017 and 2018 under President Donald Trump's administration. The government awarded the provider more than $3 billion in contracts from 2015 to 2023.\n\nThe Border Patrol must transfer custody of unaccompanied children within 72 hours of arrest to Health and Human Services, which releases most to parents or close relatives after short stays at Southwest Key or shelters operated by other contracted providers.\n\nHealth and Human Services reported 6,228 children at all of its facilities on June 17, according to the most recent data on its website, which does not break numbers down by shelter or provider. The department declined to say how many children are currently in Southwest Key's care or if the agency continues to assign children to its facilities.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Austin, where Southwest Key is based, provides extensive details, saying authorities received more than 100 reports of sexual abuse or harassment at the provider's shelters since 2015.\n\nAmong the lawsuit's allegations: An employee \"repeatedly sexually abused\" three girls ages 5, 8 and 11 at the Casa Franklin shelter in El Paso, Texas. The 8-year-old told investigators that the worker \"repeatedly entered their bedrooms in the middle of the night to touch their 'private area,' and he threatened to kill their families if they disclosed the abuse.\"\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that an employee of the provider's shelter in Tucson, Arizona, took an 11-year-old boy to a hotel and paid him to perform sexual acts for several days in 2020.\n\nChildren were threatened with violence against themselves or family if they reported abuse, according to the lawsuit. It added that testimony from the victims revealed staff in some instances knew about the ongoing abuse and failed to report it or concealed it.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said Thursday that the complaint \"raises serious pattern or practice concerns\" about Southwest Key. \"HHS has a zero-tolerance policy for all forms of sexual abuse, sexual harassment, inappropriate sexual behavior, and discrimination,\" he said in a statement.\n\nSouthwest spokesperson Anais Biera Miracle said Thursday that the provider is still reviewing the complaint, which she said \"does not present the accurate picture of the care and commitment our employees provide to the youth and children.\"\n\nTexas, like Florida, revoked the licenses of facilities that house migrant children in 2021 in response to an extraordinary influx of people across its border from Mexico, creating what some critics said was an oversight void.\n\nThe lawsuit comes less than three weeks after a federal judge granted the Justice Department's request to lift special court oversight of HHS' care of unaccompanied migrant children. President Joe Biden's administration argued that new federal safeguards rendered special oversight unnecessary 27 years after it began.\n\nSpecial court oversight remains in place at the Department of Homeland Security, which includes the Border Patrol.\n\nLeecia Welch, an attorney for unaccompanied children in the case for court oversight, said the allegations against Southwest Key are \"absolutely disgusting\" and blamed Texas' revocation of licenses for \"a powder keg waiting to explode.\"\n\n\"While I applaud the efforts to right the grievous wrongs these children have experienced, I hope the federal government will also take some responsibility for the role it played,\" said Welch, deputy legal director of Children's Rights.\n\nNeha Desai, another attorney involved in court oversight, called the allegations \"profoundly disturbing and shocking.\"\n\n\"I hope that the government takes the most aggressive measures possible to ensure that children currently placed at Southwest Key facilities are not in harm's way,\" said Desai, senior director for immigration at the National Center for Youth Law.\n\nThe Associated Press left email messages Thursday with the offices of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton. The attorneys general of Arizona and California declined to comment on the litigation.\n\nSouthwest grew as unaccompanied children began crossing the border in large numbers in 2014, overwhelming U.S. authorities.\n\nThe company has found itself in the middle of controversies over immigration and has steadfastly maintained that its mission was to provide quality care for children. It names its facilities \"casas,\" Spanish for home.\n\n\"A typical day for children in a Southwest Key Casa includes breakfast, school, lunch, dinner, homework, snacks, and bedtime,\" the Justice Department said in its complaint.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been edited to correct that the HHS numbers are for all children in migrant shelters, not Southwest Key specifically.\n\nGonzalez reported from McAllen, Texas.

Southwest Key, the largest housing provider for unaccompanied migrant children has been accused of \"severe, pervasive, and unwelcome sexual abuse of and harassment\" of children in its care, the Justice Department said Thursday, July 18, 2024.\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Employees of the largest housing provider for unaccompanied migrant children in the U.S. repeatedly sexually abused and harassed children in their care for at least eight years, the Justice Department said Thursday, alleging a shocking litany of offenses that took place as the company amassed billions of dollars in government contracts.\n\nSouthwest Key Programs Inc. employees, including supervisors, raped, touched or solicited sex and nude images of children beginning in 2015 and possibly earlier, the Justice Department said in a lawsuit filed this week. At least two employees have been indicted on criminal charges related to the allegations since 2020.\n\nIt was not immediately clear Thursday how many children are currently in Southwest Key's vast network of shelters across three states, which have room for more than 6,300 children. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to emailed questions about whether it had recommended to federal officals that they remove children from the shelters or terminate the government's contracts with the nonprofit.\n\n\"In some cases, Southwest Key employees threatened children to maintain their silence,\" the lawsuit states. \"In harassing these children, these Southwest Key employees exploited the children's vulnerabilities, language barriers, and distance from family and loved ones.\"\n\nIn a statement, Southwest Key said it was reviewing the complaint and disputed the portrayal of its care for children.\n\nThe nonprofit organization is the largest provider of housing for unaccompanied migrant children, operating under grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It has 29 child migrant shelters -- 17 in Texas, 10 in Arizona and two in California. The company's largest shelter in Brownsville, Texas, is at a converted Walmart with a capacity for 1,200.\n\nThe provider has been a major but somewhat low-profile player in the government's response to the arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrant children traveling alone in recent years and during the separation of thousands of families in 2017 and 2018 under President Donald Trump's administration. The government awarded the provider more than $3 billion in contracts from 2015 to 2023.\n\nThe Border Patrol must transfer custody of unaccompanied children within 72 hours of arrest to Health and Human Services, which releases most to parents or close relatives after short stays at Southwest Key or shelters operated by other contracted providers.\n\nHealth and Human Services reported 6,228 children at all of its facilities on June 17, according to the most recent data on its website, which does not break numbers down by shelter or provider. The department declined to say how many children are currently in Southwest Key's care or if the agency continues to assign children to its facilities.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Austin, where Southwest Key is based, provides extensive details, saying authorities received more than 100 reports of sexual abuse or harassment at the provider's shelters since 2015.\n\nAmong the lawsuit's allegations: An employee \"repeatedly sexually abused\" three girls ages 5, 8 and 11 at the Casa Franklin shelter in El Paso, Texas. The 8-year-old told investigators that the worker \"repeatedly entered their bedrooms in the middle of the night to touch their 'private area,' and he threatened to kill their families if they disclosed the abuse.\"\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that an employee of the provider's shelter in Tucson, Arizona, took an 11-year-old boy to a hotel and paid him to perform sexual acts for several days in 2020.\n\nChildren were threatened with violence against themselves or family if they reported abuse, according to the lawsuit. It added that testimony from the victims revealed staff in some instances knew about the ongoing abuse and failed to report it or concealed it.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said Thursday that the complaint \"raises serious pattern or practice concerns\" about Southwest Key. \"HHS has a zero-tolerance policy for all forms of sexual abuse, sexual harassment, inappropriate sexual behavior, and discrimination,\" he said in a statement.\n\nSouthwest spokesperson Anais Biera Miracle said Thursday that the provider is still reviewing the complaint, which she said \"does not present the accurate picture of the care and commitment our employees provide to the youth and children.\"\n\nTexas, like Florida, revoked the licenses of facilities that house migrant children in 2021 in response to an extraordinary influx of people across its border from Mexico, creating what some critics said was an oversight void.\n\nThe lawsuit comes less than three weeks after a federal judge granted the Justice Department's request to lift special court oversight of HHS' care of unaccompanied migrant children. President Joe Biden's administration argued that new federal safeguards rendered special oversight unnecessary 27 years after it began.\n\nSpecial court oversight remains in place at the Department of Homeland Security, which includes the Border Patrol.\n\nLeecia Welch, an attorney for unaccompanied children in the case for court oversight, said the allegations against Southwest Key are \"absolutely disgusting\" and blamed Texas' revocation of licenses for \"a powder keg waiting to explode.\"\n\n\"While I applaud the efforts to right the grievous wrongs these children have experienced, I hope the federal government will also take some responsibility for the role it played,\" said Welch, deputy legal director of Children's Rights.\n\nNeha Desai, another attorney involved in court oversight, called the allegations \"profoundly disturbing and shocking.\"\n\n\"I hope that the government takes the most aggressive measures possible to ensure that children currently placed at Southwest Key facilities are not in harm's way,\" said Desai, senior director for immigration at the National Center for Youth Law.\n\nThe Associated Press left email messages Thursday with the offices of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and the attorneys general of Arizona and California.\n\nSouthwest grew as unaccompanied children began crossing the border in large numbers in 2014, overwhelming U.S. authorities.\n\nThe company has found itself in the middle of controversies over immigration and has steadfastly maintained that its mission was to provide quality care for children. It names its facilities \"casas,\" Spanish for home.\n\n\"A typical day for children in a Southwest Key Casa includes breakfast, school, lunch, dinner, homework, snacks, and bedtime,\" the Justice Department said in its complaint.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been edited to correct that the HHS numbers are for all children in migrant shelters, not Southwest Key specifically.\n\nGonzalez reported from McAllen, Texas.

At least two employees have been indicted on criminal charges related to the allegations since 2020.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many children are currently in Southwest Key's vast network of shelters across three states, which have room for more than 6,300 children. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment beyond the lawsuit announcement when asked whether the department recommended that children be removed from the shelters or that the the nonprofit's contracts be terminated.\n\n\"In some cases, Southwest Key employees threatened children to maintain their silence,\" the lawsuit states. \"In harassing these children, these Southwest Key employees exploited the children's vulnerabilities, language barriers, and distance from family and loved ones.\"\n\nIn a statement, Southwest Key said it was reviewing the complaint and disputed the portrayal of its care for children.\n\nThe nonprofit organization is the largest provider of housing for unaccompanied migrant children, operating under grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It has 29 child migrant shelters -- 17 in Texas, 10 in Arizona and two in California. The company's largest shelter in Brownsville, Texas, is at a converted Walmart with a capacity for 1,200.\n\nThe provider has been a major but somewhat low-profile player in the government's response to the arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrant children traveling alone in recent years and during the separation of thousands of families in 2017 and 2018 under President Donald Trump's administration. The government awarded the provider more than $3 billion in contracts from 2015 to 2023.\n\nThe Border Patrol must transfer custody of unaccompanied children within 72 hours of arrest to Health and Human Services, which releases most to parents or close relatives after short stays at Southwest Key or shelters operated by other contracted providers.\n\nHealth and Human Services reported 6,228 children at all of its facilities on June 17, according to the most recent data on its website, which does not break numbers down by shelter or provider. The department declined to say how many children are currently in Southwest Key's care or if the agency continues to assign children to its facilities.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Austin, where Southwest Key is based, provides extensive details, saying authorities received more than 100 reports of sexual abuse or harassment at the provider's shelters since 2015.\n\nAmong the lawsuit's allegations: An employee \"repeatedly sexually abused\" three girls ages 5, 8 and 11 at the Casa Franklin shelter in El Paso, Texas. The 8-year-old told investigators that the worker \"repeatedly entered their bedrooms in the middle of the night to touch their 'private area,' and he threatened to kill their families if they disclosed the abuse.\"\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that an employee of the provider's shelter in Tucson, Arizona, took an 11-year-old boy to a hotel and paid him to perform sexual acts for several days in 2020.\n\nChildren were threatened with violence against themselves or family if they reported abuse, according to the lawsuit. It added that testimony from the victims revealed staff in some instances knew about the ongoing abuse and failed to report it or concealed it.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said Thursday that the complaint \"raises serious pattern or practice concerns\" about Southwest Key. \"HHS has a zero-tolerance policy for all forms of sexual abuse, sexual harassment, inappropriate sexual behavior, and discrimination,\" he said in a statement.\n\nSouthwest spokesperson Anais Biera Miracle said Thursday that the provider is still reviewing the complaint, which she said \"does not present the accurate picture of the care and commitment our employees provide to the youth and children.\"\n\nTexas, like Florida, revoked the licenses of facilities that house migrant children in 2021 in response to an extraordinary influx of people across its border from Mexico, creating what some critics said was an oversight void.\n\nThe lawsuit comes less than three weeks after a federal judge granted the Justice Department's request to lift special court oversight of HHS' care of unaccompanied migrant children. President Joe Biden's administration argued that new federal safeguards rendered special oversight unnecessary 27 years after it began.\n\nSpecial court oversight remains in place at the Department of Homeland Security, which includes the Border Patrol.\n\nLeecia Welch, an attorney for unaccompanied children in the case for court oversight, said the allegations against Southwest Key are \"absolutely disgusting\" and blamed Texas' revocation of licenses for \"a powder keg waiting to explode.\"\n\n\"While I applaud the efforts to right the grievous wrongs these children have experienced, I hope the federal government will also take some responsibility for the role it played,\" said Welch, deputy legal director of Children's Rights.\n\nNeha Desai, another attorney involved in court oversight, called the allegations \"profoundly disturbing and shocking.\"\n\n\"I hope that the government takes the most aggressive measures possible to ensure that children currently placed at Southwest Key facilities are not in harm's way,\" said Desai, senior director for immigration at the National Center for Youth Law.\n\nThe Associated Press left email messages Thursday with the offices of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton. The attorneys general of Arizona and California declined to comment on the litigation.\n\nSouthwest grew as unaccompanied children began crossing the border in large numbers in 2014, overwhelming U.S. authorities.\n\nThe company has found itself in the middle of controversies over immigration and has steadfastly maintained that its mission was to provide quality care for children. It names its facilities \"casas,\" Spanish for home.\n\n\"A typical day for children in a Southwest Key Casa includes breakfast, school, lunch, dinner, homework, snacks, and bedtime,\" the Justice Department said in its complaint.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been edited to correct that the HHS numbers are for all children in migrant shelters, not Southwest Key specifically.\n\nGonzalez reported from McAllen, Texas.

It has 29 child migrant shelters - 17 in Texas, 10 in Arizona and two in California. The company's largest shelter in Brownsville, Texas, is at a converted Walmart with a capacity for 1,200.\n\nThe provider has been a major but somewhat low-profile player in the government's response to the arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrant children travelling alone in recent years and during the separation of thousands of families in 2017 and 2018 under President Donald Trump's administration. The government awarded the provider more than $3 billion in contracts from 2015 to 2023.\n\nThe Border Patrol must transfer custody of unaccompanied children within 72 hours of arrest to Health and Human Services, which releases most to parents or close relatives after short stays at Southwest Key or shelters operated by other contracted providers.\n\nHealth and Human Services reported 6,228 children at all of its facilities on June 17, according to the most recent data on its website, which does not break numbers down by shelter or provider. The department declined to say how many children are currently in Southwest Key's care or if the agency continues to assign children to its facilities.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Austin, where Southwest Key is based, provides extensive details, saying authorities received more than 100 reports of sexual abuse or harassment at the provider's shelters since 2015.\n\nAmong the lawsuit's allegations: An employee \"repeatedly sexually abused\" three girls ages 5, 8 and 11 at the Casa Franklin shelter in El Paso, Texas. The 8-year-old told investigators that the worker \"repeatedly entered their bedrooms in the middle of the night to touch their private area, and he threatened to kill their families if they disclosed the abuse\".\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that an employee of the provider's shelter in Tucson, Arizona, took an 11-year-old boy to a hotel and paid him to perform sexual acts for several days in 2020.\n\nChildren were threatened with violence against themselves or family if they reported abuse, according to the lawsuit. It added that testimony from the victims revealed staff in some instances knew about the ongoing abuse and failed to report it or concealed it.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said Thursday that the complaint \"raises serious pattern or practice concerns\" about Southwest Key. \"HHS has a zero-tolerance policy for all forms of sexual abuse, sexual harassment, inappropriate sexual behaviour, and discrimination,\" he said in a statement.\n\nSouthwest spokesperson Anais Biera Miracle said Thursday that the provider is still reviewing the complaint, which she said \"does not present the accurate picture of the care and commitment our employees provide to the youth and children\".\n\nTexas, like Florida, revoked the licenses of facilities that house migrant children in 2021 in response to an extraordinary influx of people across its border from Mexico, creating what some critics said was an oversight void.\n\nThe lawsuit comes less than three weeks after a federal judge granted the Justice Department's request to lift special court oversight of HHS' care of unaccompanied migrant children. President Joe Biden's administration argued that new federal safeguards rendered special oversight unnecessary 27 years after it began.\n\nSpecial court oversight remains in place at the Department of Homeland Security, which includes the Border Patrol.\n\nLeecia Welch, an attorney for unaccompanied children in the case for court oversight, said the allegations against Southwest Key are \"absolutely disgusting\" and blamed Texas' revocation of licenses for \"a powder keg waiting to explode.\"\n\n\"While I applaud the efforts to right the grievous wrongs these children have experienced, I hope the federal government will also take some responsibility for the role it played,\" said Welch, deputy legal director of Children's Rights.\n\nNeha Desai, another attorney involved in court oversight, called the allegations \"profoundly disturbing and shocking.\"\n\n\"I hope that the government takes the most aggressive measures possible to ensure that children currently placed at Southwest Key facilities are not in harm's way,\" said Desai, senior director for immigration at the National Center for Youth Law.\n\nThe Associated Press left email messages Thursday with the offices of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and the attorneys general of Arizona and California.\n\nSouthwest grew as unaccompanied children began crossing the border in large numbers in 2014, overwhelming US authorities.\n\nThe company has found itself in the middle of controversies over immigration and has steadfastly maintained that its mission was to provide quality care for children. It names its facilities \"casas\", Spanish for home.\n\n\"A typical day for children in a Southwest Key Casa includes breakfast, school, lunch, dinner, homework, snacks, and bedtime,\" the Justice Department said in its complaint.", "source": {"uri": "dtnext.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "dtNext.in"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@dtnext.in", "name": "Associated Press", "type":

At least two employees have been charged since 2020.\n\nThe nonprofit organization is the largest provider of housing for unaccompanied migrant children, operating under grants from the US Department of Health and Human Services. It has 29 child migrant shelters -- 17 in Texas, 10 in Arizona and two in California -- with room for 6,350 children. The company's largest shelter in Brownsville is at a converted Walmart with a capacity for 1,200.\n\nSouthwest Key disputed the accuracy of the claims in a written statement late Thursday.\n\nThe provider has been a major but somewhat low-profile player in the government's response to the arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrant children traveling alone in recent years and during the separation of thousands of families in 2017 and 2018 under President Donald Trump's administration. The government awarded the provider more than $3 billion in contracts from 2015 to 2023.\n\nThe Border Patrol must transfer custody of unaccompanied children within 72 hours of arrest to Health and Human Services, which releases most to parents or close relatives after short stays at Southwest Key or shelters operated by other contracted providers.\n\nHealth and Human Services reported 6,228 children at all of its facilities on June 17, according to the most recent data on its website, which does not break numbers down by shelter or provider. The department declined to say how many children are currently in Southwest Key's care or if the agency continues to assign children to its facilities.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Austin, where Southwest Key is based, provides extensive details, saying authorities received more than 100 reports of sexual abuse or harassment at the provider's shelters since 2015.\n\nAmong the suit's allegations: An employee \"repeatedly sexually abused\" three girls ages 5, 8 and 11 at the Casa Franklin shelter in El Paso, Texas. The 8-year-old told investigators that the worker \"repeatedly entered their bedrooms in the middle of the night to touch their 'private area,' and he threatened to kill their families if they disclosed the abuse.\"\n\nThe suit also alleges that an employee of the provider's shelter in Tucson, Arizona, took an 11-year-old boy to a hotel and paid him to perform sexual acts for several days in 2020.\n\nChildren were threatened with violence against themselves or family if they reported abuse, according to the lawsuit. It added that testimony from the victims revealed staff in some instances knew about the ongoing abuse and failed to report it or concealed it.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said Thursday that the complaint \"raises serious pattern or practice concerns\" about Southwest Key. \"HHS has a zero-tolerance policy for all forms of sexual abuse, sexual harassment, inappropriate sexual behavior, and discrimination,\" he said in a statement.\n\nSouthwest spokesperson Anais Biera Miraclea said Thursday that the provider is still reviewing the complaint, which she said \"does not present the accurate picture of the care and commitment our employees provide to the youth and children.\"\n\nTexas, like Florida, revoked licenses of facilities that house migrant children in 2021 in response to an extraordinary influx of people across its border from Mexico, creating what some critics said was an oversight void.\n\nThe lawsuit comes less than three weeks after a federal judge granted the Justice Department's request to lift special court oversight of HHS' care of unaccompanied migrant children. President Joe Biden's administration argued that new federal safeguards rendered special oversight unnecessary 27 years after it began.\n\nSpecial court oversight remains in place at the Department of Homeland Security, which includes the Border Patrol.\n\nLeecia Welch, an attorney for unaccompanied children in the case for court oversight, said the allegations against Southwest Key are \"absolutely disgusting\" and blamed Texas' revocation of licenses for \"a powder keg waiting to explode.\"\n\n\"While I applaud the efforts to right the grievous wrongs these children have experienced, I hope the federal government will also take some responsibility for the role it played,\" said Welch, deputy legal director of Children's Rights.\n\nNeha Desai, another attorney involved in court oversight, called the allegations \"profoundly disturbing and shocking.\"\n\n\"I hope that the government takes the most aggressive measures possible to ensure that children currently placed at Southwest Key facilities are not in harm's way,\" said Desai, senior director for immigration at the National Center for Youth Law.\n\nThe Associated Press left email messages Thursday with the offices of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and the attorneys general of Arizona and California.\n\nSouthwest grew as unaccompanied children began crossing the border in large numbers in 2014, overwhelming US authorities.\n\nThe company has found itself in the middle of controversies over immigration and has steadfastly maintained that its mission was to provide quality care for children. It names its facilities \"casas,\" Spanish for home.\n\n\"A typical day for children in a Southwest Key Casa includes breakfast, school, lunch, dinner, homework, snacks, and bedtime,\" the Justice Department said in its complaint.", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@arab.news", "name": "Associated Press", "type":

At least two employees have been indicted on criminal charges related to the allegations since 2020.\n\nIt was not immediately clear Thursday how many children are currently in Southwest Key's vast network of shelters across three states, which have room for more than 6,300 children. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to emailed questions about whether it had recommended to federal officals that they remove children from the shelters or terminate the government's contracts with the nonprofit.\n\n\"In some cases, Southwest Key employees threatened children to maintain their silence,\" the lawsuit states. \"In harassing these children, these Southwest Key employees exploited the children's vulnerabilities, language barriers, and distance from family and loved ones.\"\n\nIn a statement, Southwest Key said it was reviewing the complaint and disputed the portrayal of its care for children.\n\nThe nonprofit organization is the largest provider of housing for unaccompanied migrant children, operating under grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It has 29 child migrant shelters -- 17 in Texas, 10 in Arizona and two in California. The company's largest shelter in Brownsville, Texas, is at a converted Walmart with a capacity for 1,200.\n\nThe provider has been a major but somewhat low-profile player in the government's response to the arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrant children traveling alone in recent years and during the separation of thousands of families in 2017 and 2018 under President Donald Trump's administration. The government awarded the provider more than $3 billion in contracts from 2015 to 2023.\n\nThe Border Patrol must transfer custody of unaccompanied children within 72 hours of arrest to Health and Human Services, which releases most to parents or close relatives after short stays at Southwest Key or shelters operated by other contracted providers.\n\nHealth and Human Services reported 6,228 children at all of its facilities on June 17, according to the most recent data on its website, which does not break numbers down by shelter or provider. The department declined to say how many children are currently in Southwest Key's care or if the agency continues to assign children to its facilities.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Austin, where Southwest Key is based, provides extensive details, saying authorities received more than 100 reports of sexual abuse or harassment at the provider's shelters since 2015.\n\nAmong the lawsuit's allegations: An employee \"repeatedly sexually abused\" three girls ages 5, 8 and 11 at the Casa Franklin shelter in El Paso, Texas. The 8-year-old told investigators that the worker \"repeatedly entered their bedrooms in the middle of the night to touch their 'private area,' and he threatened to kill their families if they disclosed the abuse.\"\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that an employee of the provider's shelter in Tucson, Arizona, took an 11-year-old boy to a hotel and paid him to perform sexual acts for several days in 2020.\n\nChildren were threatened with violence against themselves or family if they reported abuse, according to the lawsuit. It added that testimony from the victims revealed staff in some instances knew about the ongoing abuse and failed to report it or concealed it.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said Thursday that the complaint \"raises serious pattern or practice concerns\" about Southwest Key. \"HHS has a zero-tolerance policy for all forms of sexual abuse, sexual harassment, inappropriate sexual behavior, and discrimination,\" he said in a statement.\n\nSouthwest spokesperson Anais Biera Miracle said Thursday that the provider is still reviewing the complaint, which she said \"does not present the accurate picture of the care and commitment our employees provide to the youth and children.\"\n\nTexas, like Florida, revoked the licenses of facilities that house migrant children in 2021 in response to an extraordinary influx of people across its border from Mexico, creating what some critics said was an oversight void.\n\nThe lawsuit comes less than three weeks after a federal judge granted the Justice Department's request to lift special court oversight of HHS' care of unaccompanied migrant children. President Joe Biden's administration argued that new federal safeguards rendered special oversight unnecessary 27 years after it began.\n\nSpecial court oversight remains in place at the Department of Homeland Security, which includes the Border Patrol.\n\nLeecia Welch, an attorney for unaccompanied children in the case for court oversight, said the allegations against Southwest Key are \"absolutely disgusting\" and blamed Texas' revocation of licenses for \"a powder keg waiting to explode.\"\n\n\"While I applaud the efforts to right the grievous wrongs these children have experienced, I hope the federal government will also take some responsibility for the role it played,\" said Welch, deputy legal director of Children's Rights.\n\nNeha Desai, another attorney involved in court oversight, called the allegations \"profoundly disturbing and shocking.\"\n\n\"I hope that the government takes the most aggressive measures possible to ensure that children currently placed at Southwest Key facilities are not in harm's way,\" said Desai, senior director for immigration at the National Center for Youth Law.\n\nThe Associated Press left email messages Thursday with the offices of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and the attorneys general of Arizona and California.\n\nSouthwest grew as unaccompanied children began crossing the border in large numbers in 2014, overwhelming U.S. authorities.\n\nThe company has found itself in the middle of controversies over immigration and has steadfastly maintained that its mission was to provide quality care for children. It names its facilities \"casas,\" Spanish for home.\n\n\"A typical day for children in a Southwest Key Casa includes breakfast, school, lunch, dinner, homework, snacks, and bedtime,\" the Justice Department said in its complaint.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been edited to correct that the HHS numbers are for all children in migrant shelters, not Southwest Key specifically.\n\nGonzalez reported from McAllen, Texas.

At least two employees have been indicted on criminal charges related to the allegations since 2020.\n\nAlso Read | Central Government Clears Major Plans To Build 2 Military Airfields in Lakshadweep Amid Rising Chinese Activities in Region.\n\nIt was not immediately clear Thursday how many children are currently in Southwest Key's vast network of shelters across three states, which have room for more than 6,300 children. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to emailed questions about whether it had recommended to federal officials that they remove children from the shelters or terminate the government's contracts with the nonprofit.\n\n\"In some cases, Southwest Key employees threatened children to maintain their silence,\" the lawsuit states. \"In harassing these children, these Southwest Key employees exploited the children's vulnerabilities, language barriers, and distance from family and loved ones.\"\n\nAlso Read | Bangladesh Violence: 11 More People Killed in Dhaka As Violence Escalates Over Student Protests Demanding Reforms of Quota System for Government Jobs.\n\nIn a statement, Southwest Key said it was reviewing the complaint and disputed the portrayal of its care for children.\n\nThe nonprofit organisation is the largest provider of housing for unaccompanied migrant children, operating under grants from the US Department of Health and Human Services. It has 29 child migrant shelters - 17 in Texas, 10 in Arizona and two in California. The company's largest shelter in Brownsville, Texas, is at a converted Walmart with a capacity for 1,200.\n\nThe provider has been a major but somewhat low-profile player in the government's response to the arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrant children travelling alone in recent years and during the separation of thousands of families in 2017 and 2018 under President Donald Trump's administration. The government awarded the provider more than $3 billion in contracts from 2015 to 2023.\n\nThe Border Patrol must transfer custody of unaccompanied children within 72 hours of arrest to Health and Human Services, which releases most to parents or close relatives after short stays at Southwest Key or shelters operated by other contracted providers.\n\nHealth and Human Services reported 6,228 children at all of its facilities on June 17, according to the most recent data on its website, which does not break numbers down by shelter or provider. The department declined to say how many children are currently in Southwest Key's care or if the agency continues to assign children to its facilities.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Austin, where Southwest Key is based, provides extensive details, saying authorities received more than 100 reports of sexual abuse or harassment at the provider's shelters since 2015.\n\nAmong the lawsuit's allegations: An employee \"repeatedly sexually abused\" three girls ages 5, 8 and 11 at the Casa Franklin shelter in El Paso, Texas.

At least two employees have been charged since 2020.\n\nThe nonprofit organization is the largest provider of housing for unaccompanied migrant children, operating under grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It has 29 child migrant shelters -- 17 in Texas, 10 in Arizona and two in California -- with room for 6,350 children. The company's largest shelter in Brownsville is at a converted Walmart with a capacity for 1,200.\n\nSouthwest Key disputed the accuracy of the claims in a written statement late Thursday.\n\nThe provider has been a major but somewhat low-profile player in the government's response to the arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrant children traveling alone in recent years and during the separation of thousands of families in 2017 and 2018 under President Donald Trump's administration. The government awarded the provider more than $3 billion in contracts from 2015 to 2023.\n\nThe Border Patrol must transfer custody of unaccompanied children within 72 hours of arrest to Health and Human Services, which releases most to parents or close relatives after short stays at Southwest Key or shelters operated by other contracted providers.\n\nHealth and Human Services reported 6,228 children at all of its facilities on June 17, according to the most recent data on its website, which does not break numbers down by shelter or provider. The department declined to say how many children are currently in Southwest Key's care or if the agency continues to assign children to its facilities.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Austin, where Southwest Key is based, provides extensive details, saying authorities received more than 100 reports of sexual abuse or harassment at the provider's shelters since 2015.\n\nAmong the suit's allegations: An employee \"repeatedly sexually abused\" three girls ages 5, 8 and 11 at the Casa Franklin shelter in El Paso, Texas. The 8-year-old told investigators that the worker \"repeatedly entered their bedrooms in the middle of the night to touch their 'private area,' and he threatened to kill their families if they disclosed the abuse.\"\n\nThe suit also alleges that an employee of the provider's shelter in Tucson, Arizona, took an 11-year-old boy to a hotel and paid him to perform sexual acts for several days in 2020.\n\nChildren were threatened with violence against themselves or family if they reported abuse, according to the lawsuit. It added that testimony from the victims revealed staff in some instances knew about the ongoing abuse and failed to report it or concealed it.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said Thursday that the complaint \"raises serious pattern or practice concerns\" about Southwest Key. \"HHS has a zero-tolerance policy for all forms of sexual abuse, sexual harassment, inappropriate sexual behavior, and discrimination,\" he said in a statement.\n\nSouthwest spokesperson Anais Biera Miraclea said Thursday that the provider is still reviewing the complaint, which she said \"does not present the accurate picture of the care and commitment our employees provide to the youth and children.\"\n\nTexas, like Florida, revoked licenses of facilities that house migrant children in 2021 in response to an extraordinary influx of people across its border from Mexico, creating what some critics said was an oversight void.\n\nThe lawsuit comes less than three weeks after a federal judge granted the Justice Department's request to lift special court oversight of HHS' care of unaccompanied migrant children.

The allegations include multiple cases of sexual abuse, solicitation, and threats against minors in their care.\n\nMultiple employees at the largest shelter provider for unaccompanied migrant children in the United States sexually abused and harassed minors in their care, the U.S. Department of Justice alleged in a lawsuit filed this week. The lawsuit in the Western District of Texas, alleges a 'pattern' of 'severe or pervasive sexual harassment' going back to at least 2015 in the network of shelters run by the Austin, Texas-based non-profit Southwest Key, which contracts with the federal government to care for young migrants arriving in the U.S. without parents or legal guardians.\n\nThe complaint includes alleged cases of 'severe sexual abuse and rape, solicitation of sex acts, solicitation of nude photos, entreaties for sexually inappropriate relationships, sexual comments and gestures.' Migrant children who arrive at the border unaccompanied are housed by the U.S. government before being released to sponsors in the United States, usually parents or close relatives.\n\nSouthwest Key operates 29 shelters that provide temporary housing for unaccompanied children in Texas, Arizona and California, under grants from the Department of Health and Human Services. The Justice Department said Southwest Key failed to protect the children in its care and did not consistently follow federal requirements for preventing, detecting and reporting abuse.\n\nIn a 2022 case detailed in the complaint, a Southwest Key employee allegedly repeatedly sexually abused a five-year-old girl, an eight-year-old girl, and an 11-year-old girl at Casa Franklin in El Paso, Texas. The eight-year-old girl said the employee threatened to kill their families if they disclosed the abuse, the complaint alleges. In another case, from 2020, an employee took a 15-year-old boy from Casa Kokopelli in Arizona to a hotel room for several days and paid him for sex acts. In both cases, the abuse was documented in Southwest Key's own reports, according to the lawsuit.\n\n'Sexual harassment of children in residential shelters, where a child should be safe and secure, is abusive, dehumanizing and unlawful,' Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement on Thursday. Southwest Key spokesperson Anais Biera Miracle said in a statement the complaint did 'not present the accurate picture of the care and commitment our employees provide to the youth and children.' The shelter operator said it continues to partner with the U.S. government, as it has for the past two decades, to ensure the children it houses are safe.\n\nThere have been a record number of migrant crossings at the U.S. border with Mexico during the administration of President Joe Biden. Biden, a Democrat, is running for re-election against Republican former President Donald Trump who has made criticisms of current border policy a center of his campaign. Since fiscal year 2021 through June of this year more than 500,000 unaccompanied minors have arrived at the southwest border, according to U.S. government data.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com",

Prosecutors allege employees at the Texas-based organization knew about the host of abuses, including rape and coercing nude photos, and failed to protect the children it received billions from the federal government to support, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\"The sexual harassment alleged in the complaint would destroy any child's sense of safety, turning what was an American Dream into a nightmare,\" said U.S. Attorney Alamdar S. Hamdani for the Southern District of Texas in a statement.\n\nThe lawsuit comes as the nonprofit's federal funding has grown tremendously and as it has become the government's leading partner in providing housing for tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors crossing the border annually, according to the lawsuit. Southwest Key operates 29 shelters; houses 6,350 children across Texas, Arizona, and California; and has received over $3 billion from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services over the nine years covered by the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit aims to win a civil penalty for the alleged victims of abuse and a court order requiring Southwest to take steps to avoid future abuse, Justice Department officials said.\n\n\"Sexual harassment of children in residential shelters, where a child should be safe and secure, is abusive, dehumanizing, and unlawful,\" said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. \"Sexual abuse of children is a crisis that we can't ignore or turn a blind eye to. This lawsuit seeks relief for children who have been abused and harmed, and meaningful reforms to ensure no child in these shelters is ever subjected to sexual abuse again.\"\n\n'Severe sexual abuse and rape'\n\nThe lawsuit details a litany of allegations against unnamed Southwest Key employees, including everything from \"severe sexual abuse and rape\" to solicitation of sex acts and nude photos.\n\nIn Channelview, Texas, an employee \"repeatedly raped, abused, and threatened a teenage girl\" throughout her stay at the nonprofit's Casa Montezuma shelter in 2019, according to the lawsuit. He threatened to hospitalize her if she spoke about the abuse, court filings say. Prosecutors allege other employees knew about the abuse but didn't report it.\n\nAnother Southwest Key worker allegedly \"repeatedly sexually abused\" a 5-year-old girl, an 8-year-old girl, and an 11-year-old girl at Casa Franklin in El Paso, Texas, in 2022, the lawsuit said. The employee entered their rooms at night to touch their \"private area\" and threatened to kill their families if they spoke up, according to the lawsuit.\n\nAn employee at the nonprofit's Casa Kokopelli shelter in Arizona pleaded guilty to felony attempted sexual misconduct with a minor in 2022 in Maricopa County after absconding with a 15-year-old boy to a hotel for days where the Southwest Key staffer paid the teenager for sex acts, court documents said.\n\nThe misconduct came at the hands of staff at almost every level of Southwest operations, from teachers who inappropriately touched the children to medical staff who asked minors graphic questions about sex.\n\nSouthwest Key Chief Communications Officer Anais Biera Miracle disputed the findings of the lawsuit,\n\nThe lawsuit \"does not present the accurate picture of the care and commitment our employees provide to the youth and children,\" Miracle said in a statement. \"Southwest Key Programs' primary focus is the safety, health, and well-being of each one of the children and youth we care for.\"\n\nWho is Southwest Key Programs taking care of?\n\nSouthwest Key Programs has skyrocketed in its role as a federal partner in recent years as the number of unaccompanied minors crossing the border has grown tremendously.\n\nOver 90,000 unaccompanied minors crossed the border in fiscal year 2024, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. Over 137,000 crossed annually in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\nAfter being taken into custody by Border Patrol, the unaccompanied children are transferred to Health and Human Services which is then charged with finding them care until they can be reunited with family or until they turn 18.\n\nSouthwest Key Program shelters have become Health and Human Services' key partners for housing the children. The shelters house anywhere from 20 to 1,200 minors, according to the lawsuit. The children eat, sleep, and attend school at the facilities.\n\nAs many as 27,000 kids can cycle through Southwest Key Programs facilities in a year, according to a company report from 2021. The typical stay is 28 days.\n\nThe federal government has supported the nonprofit shelters with grants since at least 2003, according to Health and Human Services' published grants data.\n\nIt skyrocketed in prominence in 2018 after former President Donald Trump's policy of separating minors from parents came into effect. Federal funding for the nonprofit grew by nearly 120% that year to $626 million, according to a USA TODAY analysis of the data. Southwest Key received nearly $980 million in fiscal year 2024.\n\nOfficials, advocates react\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra fired back at the company for the abuses allegedly committed at the federal agency's leading housing provider for unaccompanied minors.\n\n\"HHS has a zero-tolerance policy for all forms of sexual abuse, sexual harassment, inappropriate sexual behavior, and discrimination,\" Becerra said. \"The U.S. Department of Justice's complaint against Southwest Key raises serious pattern or practice concerns. HHS will continue to work with the Justice Department and oversight agencies to hold its care-giving programs like Southwest Key accountable. And we will continue to closely evaluate our assignment of children into caregiving programs to ensure the safety and well-being of every child in HHS custody.\"\n\nImmigration rights activists seized on the lawsuit as an example of why shelters for migrant children need to be subject to further oversight.\n\nThe Acacia Center for Justice, a prominent immigrant rights advocacy group, said the allegations in the lawsuit were a clear example of the need to reform how the U.S. houses unaccompanied minors.\n\n\"Decades of evidence-based research into best practices in child welfare and child protection have clearly shown that any custodial system must have robust and accountable oversight mechanisms,\" Executive Director Shaina Aber told USA TODAY in a statement, adding the unaccompanied minors should have access to legal advocates and be swiftly reunited with family. \"When people talk about potential dangers children face in community, they often assume children are safer in custody of DHS or HHS. In reality, children thrive best when they are surrounded by family, receive legal and social work support and integrate into supportive communities as they navigate our complex immigration process.\"\n\nSexual extortion and intimidation: DOJ goes after unscrupulous landlords\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Southwest Key staff abused migrant children in their care:

At least two employees have been indicted on criminal charges related to the allegations since 2020.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many children are currently in Southwest Key's vast network of shelters across three states, which have room for more than 6,300 children. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment beyond the lawsuit announcement when asked whether the department recommended that children be removed from the shelters or that the the nonprofit's contracts be terminated.\n\n\"In some cases, Southwest Key employees threatened children to maintain their silence,\" the lawsuit states. \"In harassing these children, these Southwest Key employees exploited the children's vulnerabilities, language barriers, and distance from family and loved ones.\"\n\nIn a statement, Southwest Key said it was reviewing the complaint and disputed the portrayal of its care for children.\n\nThe nonprofit organization is the largest provider of housing for unaccompanied migrant children, operating under grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It has 29 child migrant shelters -- 17 in Texas, 10 in Arizona and two in California.

The eight-year-old girl said the employee threatened to kill their families if they disclosed the abuse, the complaint alleges.\n\nIn another case, from 2020, an employee took a 15-year-old boy from Casa Kokopelli in Arizona to a hotel room for several days and paid him for sex acts. In both cases, the abuse was documented in Southwest Key's own reports, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\"Sexual harassment of children in residential shelters, where a child should be safe and secure, is abusive, dehumanizing and unlawful,\" Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nSouthwest Key spokesperson Anais Biera Miracle said in a statement the complaint did \"not present the accurate picture of the care and commitment our employees provide to the youth and children.\" The shelter operator said it continues to partner with the U.S. government, as it has for the past two decades, to ensure the children it houses are safe.\n\nThere have been a record number of migrant crossings at the U.S. border with Mexico during the administration of President Joe Biden.

At least two employees have been charged since 2020.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe nonprofit organization is the largest provider of housing for unaccompanied migrant children, operating under grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It has 29 child migrant shelters -- 17 in Texas, 10 in Arizona and two in California -- with room for 6,350 children. The company's largest shelter in Brownsville is at a converted Walmart with a capacity for 1,200.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSouthwest Key disputed the accuracy of the claims in a written statement late Thursday.\n\nThe provider has been a major but somewhat low-profile player in the government's response to the arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrant children traveling alone in recent years and during the separation of thousands of families in 2017 and 2018 under President Donald Trump's administration. The government awarded the provider more than $3 billion in contracts from 2015 to 2023.\n\nThe Border Patrol must transfer custody of unaccompanied children within 72 hours of arrest to Health and Human Services, which releases most to parents or close relatives after short stays at Southwest Key or shelters operated by other contracted providers.\n\nHealth and Human Services reported 6,228 children at all of its facilities on June 17, according to the most recent data on its website, which does not break numbers down by shelter or provider. The department declined to say how many children are currently in Southwest Key's care or if the agency continues to assign children to its facilities.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Austin, where Southwest Key is based, provides extensive details, saying authorities received more than 100 reports of sexual abuse or harassment at the provider's shelters since 2015.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAmong the suit's allegations: An employee \"repeatedly sexually abused\" three girls ages 5, 8 and 11 at the Casa Franklin shelter in El Paso, Texas. The 8-year-old told investigators that the worker \"repeatedly entered their bedrooms in the middle of the night to touch their 'private area,' and he threatened to kill their families if they disclosed the abuse.\"\n\nThe suit also alleges that an employee of the provider's shelter in Tucson, Arizona, took an 11-year-old boy to a hotel and paid him to perform sexual acts for several days in 2020.\n\nChildren were threatened with violence against themselves or family if they reported abuse, according to the lawsuit. It added that testimony from the victims revealed staff in some instances knew about the ongoing abuse and failed to report it or concealed it.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said Thursday that the complaint \"raises serious pattern or practice concerns\" about Southwest Key. \"HHS has a zero-tolerance policy for all forms of sexual abuse, sexual harassment, inappropriate sexual behavior, and discrimination,\" he said in a statement.\n\nSouthwest spokesperson Anais Biera Miraclea said Thursday that the provider is still reviewing the complaint, which she said \"does not present the accurate picture of the care and commitment our employees provide to the youth and children.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTexas, like Florida, revoked licenses of facilities that house migrant children in 2021 in response to an extraordinary influx of people across its border from Mexico, creating what some critics said was an oversight void.\n\nThe lawsuit comes less than three weeks after a federal judge granted the Justice Department's request to lift special court oversight of HHS' care of unaccompanied migrant children. President Joe Biden's administration argued that new federal safeguards rendered special oversight unnecessary 27 years after it began.\n\nSpecial court oversight remains in place at the Department of Homeland Security, which includes the Border Patrol.\n\nLeecia Welch, an attorney for unaccompanied children in the case for court oversight, said the allegations against Southwest Key are \"absolutely disgusting\" and blamed Texas' revocation of licenses for \"a powder keg waiting to explode.\"\n\n\"While I applaud the efforts to right the grievous wrongs these children have experienced, I hope the federal government will also take some responsibility for the role it played,\" said Welch, deputy legal director of Children's Rights.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nNeha Desai, another attorney involved in court oversight, called the allegations \"profoundly disturbing and shocking.\"\n\n\"I hope that the government takes the most aggressive measures possible to ensure that children currently placed at Southwest Key facilities are not in harm's way,\" said Desai, senior director for immigration at the National Center for Youth Law.\n\nThe Associated Press left email messages Thursday with the offices of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and the attorneys general of Arizona and California.\n\nSouthwest grew as unaccompanied children began crossing the border in large numbers in 2014, overwhelming U.S. authorities.\n\nThe company has found itself in the middle of controversies over immigration and has steadfastly maintained that its mission was to provide quality care for children. It names its facilities \"casas,\" Spanish for home.\n\n\"A typical day for children in a Southwest Key Casa includes breakfast, school, lunch, dinner, homework, snacks, and bedtime,\" the Justice Department said in its complaint.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been edited to correct that the HHS numbers are for all children in migrant shelters, not Southwest Key specifically.\n\n___\n\nGonzalez reported from McAllen, Texas.

Prosecutors allege employees at the Texas-based organization knew about the host of abuses, including rape and coercing nude photos, and failed to protect the children it received billions from the federal government to support, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\"The sexual harassment alleged in the complaint would destroy any child's sense of safety, turning what was an American Dream into a nightmare,\" said U.S. Attorney Alamdar S. Hamdani for the Southern District of Texas in a statement.\n\nThe lawsuit comes as the nonprofit's federal funding has grown tremendously and as it has become the government's leading partner in providing housing for tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors crossing the border annually, according to the lawsuit. Southwest Key operates 29 shelters; houses 6,350 children across Texas, Arizona, and California; and has received over $3 billion from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services over the nine years covered by the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit aims to win a civil penalty for the alleged victims of abuse and a court order requiring Southwest to take steps to avoid future abuse, Justice Department officials said.\n\n\"Sexual harassment of children in residential shelters, where a child should be safe and secure, is abusive, dehumanizing, and unlawful,\" said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. \"Sexual abuse of children is a crisis that we can't ignore or turn a blind eye to. This lawsuit seeks relief for children who have been abused and harmed, and meaningful reforms to ensure no child in these shelters is ever subjected to sexual abuse again.\"\n\nThe lawsuit details a litany of allegations against unnamed Southwest Key employees, including everything from \"severe sexual abuse and rape\" to solicitation of sex acts and nude photos.\n\nIn Channelview, Texas, an employee \"repeatedly raped, abused, and threatened a teenage girl\" throughout her stay at the nonprofit's Casa Montezuma shelter in 2019, according to the lawsuit. He threatened to hospitalize her if she spoke about the abuse, court filings say. Prosecutors allege other employees knew about the abuse but didn't report it.\n\nAnother Southwest Key worker allegedly \"repeatedly sexually abused\" a 5-year-old girl, an 8-year-old girl, and an 11-year-old girl at Casa Franklin in El Paso, Texas, in 2022, the lawsuit said. The employee entered their rooms at night to touch their \"private area\" and threatened to kill their families if they spoke up, according to the lawsuit.\n\nAn employee at the nonprofit's Casa Kokopelli shelter in Arizona pleaded guilty to felony attempted sexual misconduct with a minor in 2022 in Maricopa County after absconding with a 15-year-old boy to a hotel for days where the Southwest Key staffer paid the teenager for sex acts, court documents said.\n\nThe misconduct came at the hands of staff at almost every level of Southwest operations, from teachers who inappropriately touched the children to medical staff who asked minors graphic questions about sex.\n\nSouthwest Key Chief Communications Officer Anais Biera Miracle disputed the findings of the lawsuit,\n\nThe lawsuit \"does not present the accurate picture of the care and commitment our employees provide to the youth and children,\" Miracle said in a statement. \"Southwest Key Programs' primary focus is the safety, health, and well-being of each one of the children and youth we care for.\"\n\nSouthwest Key Programs has skyrocketed in its role as a federal partner in recent years as the number of unaccompanied minors crossing the border has grown tremendously.\n\nOver 90,000 unaccompanied minors crossed the border in fiscal year 2024, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. Over 137,000 crossed annually in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\nAfter being taken into custody by Border Patrol, the unaccompanied children are transferred to Health and Human Services which is then charged with finding them care until they can be reunited with family or until they turn 18.\n\nSouthwest Key Program shelters have become Health and Human Services' key partners for housing the children. The shelters house anywhere from 20 to 1,200 minors, according to the lawsuit. The children eat, sleep, and attend school at the facilities.\n\nAs many as 27,000 kids can cycle through Southwest Key Programs facilities in a year, according to a company report from 2021. The typical stay is 28 days.\n\nThe federal government has supported the nonprofit shelters with grants since at least 2003, according to Health and Human Services' published grants data.\n\nIt skyrocketed in prominence in 2018 after former President Donald Trump's policy of separating minors from parents came into effect. Federal funding for the nonprofit grew by nearly 120% that year to $626 million, according to a USA TODAY analysis of the data. Southwest Key received nearly $980 million in fiscal year 2024.\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra fired back at the company for the abuses allegedly committed at the federal agency's leading housing provider for unaccompanied minors.\n\n\"HHS has a zero-tolerance policy for all forms of sexual abuse, sexual harassment, inappropriate sexual behavior, and discrimination,\" Becerra said. \"The U.S. Department of Justice's complaint against Southwest Key raises serious pattern or practice concerns. HHS will continue to work with the Justice Department and oversight agencies to hold its care-giving programs like Southwest Key accountable. And we will continue to closely evaluate our assignment of children into caregiving programs to ensure the safety and well-being of every child in HHS custody.\"\n\nImmigration rights activists seized on the lawsuit as an example of why shelters for migrant children need to be subject to further oversight.\n\nThe Acacia Center for Justice, a prominent immigrant rights advocacy group, said the allegations in the lawsuit were a clear example of the need to reform how the U.S. houses unaccompanied minors.\n\n\"Decades of evidence-based research into best practices in child welfare and child protection have clearly shown that any custodial system must have robust and accountable oversight mechanisms,\" Executive Director Shaina Aber told USA TODAY in a statement, adding the unaccompanied minors should have access to legal advocates and be swiftly reunited with family. \"When people talk about potential dangers children face in community, they often assume children are safer in custody of DHS or HHS. In reality, children thrive best when they are surrounded by family, receive legal and social work support and integrate into supportive communities as they navigate our complex immigration process.\"\n\nSexual extortion and intimidation: DOJ goes after unscrupulous landlords", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

It's alleged that employees and supervisors raped, fondled, and solicited sex and nude pictures from children in their care. At least two employees have been indicted on criminal charges in connection with the allegations since 2020.\n\nSouthwest Key Programs operates a vast network of shelters across three states. The 29 child migrant shelters -- 17 in Texas, 10 in Arizona, and two in California -- can accommodate 6,300 children. The company's largest shelter in Brownsville, Texas, is at a converted Walmart with a capacity of 1,200.\n\nThe company received $3 billion in government contracts from 2015-2023.\n\n\"In some cases, Southwest Key employees threatened children to maintain their silence,\" the lawsuit states. \"In harassing these children, these Southwest Key employees exploited the children's vulnerabilities, language barriers, and distance from family and loved ones.\"\n\nIn his desperation to make the unaccompanied children coming across the border disappear, the Biden administration placed the kids with unvetted sponsors. That's a scandal that's been unfolding with some of the sponsors determined to be selling the children into slavery.\n\nBut this is a government contractor that should be vetted thoroughly and closely monitored. That wasn't done, and the children are suffering because of it.\n\nAssociated Press:\n\nHealth and Human Services reported 6,228 children at all of its facilities on June 17, according to the most recent data on its website, which does not break numbers down by shelter or provider. The department declined to say how many children are currently in Southwest Key's care or if the agency continues to assign children to its facilities.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Austin, where Southwest Key is based, provides extensive details, saying authorities received more than 100 reports of sexual abuse or harassment at the provider's shelters since 2015.\n\nAmong the lawsuit's allegations: An employee \"repeatedly sexually abused\" three girls ages 5, 8 and 11 at the Casa Franklin shelter in El Paso, Texas. The 8-year-old told investigators that the worker \"repeatedly entered their bedrooms in the middle of the night to touch their 'private area,' and he threatened to kill their families if they disclosed the abuse.\"\n\nThe lawsuit comes less than three weeks after a federal judge lifted a special oversight order of HHS' care of unaccompanied migrant children. The Biden administration says it wasn't necessary because of all the extra \"safeguards\" it put in place.\n\nHow about now?\n\n\"While I applaud the efforts to right the grievous wrongs these children have experienced, I hope the federal government will also take some responsibility for the role it played,\" said Leecia Welch, deputy legal director of Children's Rights, an advocacy group.\n\nAnother attorney involved in court oversight, Neha Desai, called the allegations \"profoundly disturbing and shocking.\"\n\n\"I hope that the government takes the most aggressive measures possible to ensure that children currently placed at Southwest Key facilities are not in harm's way,\" said Desai, senior director for immigration at the National Center for Youth Law.\n\nAs long as the kids remain hidden from view, that's all Biden and HHS care about.", "source": {"uri": "pjmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PJ Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rick_moran@pjmedia.com",

Prosecutors allege employees at the Texas-based organization knew about the host of abuses, including rape and coercing nude photos, and failed to protect the children it received billions from the federal government to support, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\"The sexual harassment alleged in the complaint would destroy any child's sense of safety, turning what was an American Dream into a nightmare,\" said U.S. Attorney Alamdar S. Hamdani for the Southern District of Texas in a statement.\n\nThe lawsuit comes as the nonprofit's federal funding has grown tremendously and as it has become the government's leading partner in providing housing for tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors crossing the border annually, according to the lawsuit. Southwest Key operates 29 shelters; houses 6,350 children across Texas, Arizona, and California; and has received over $3 billion from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services over the nine years covered by the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit aims to win a civil penalty for the alleged victims of abuse and a court order requiring Southwest to take steps to avoid future abuse, Justice Department officials said.\n\n\"Sexual harassment of children in residential shelters, where a child should be safe and secure, is abusive, dehumanizing, and unlawful,\" said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. \"Sexual abuse of children is a crisis that we can't ignore or turn a blind eye to. This lawsuit seeks relief for children who have been abused and harmed, and meaningful reforms to ensure no child in these shelters is ever subjected to sexual abuse again.\"\n\n'Severe sexual abuse and rape'\n\nThe lawsuit details a litany of allegations against unnamed Southwest Key employees, including everything from \"severe sexual abuse and rape\" to solicitation of sex acts and nude photos.\n\nIn Channelview, Texas, an employee \"repeatedly raped, abused, and threatened a teenage girl\" throughout her stay at the nonprofit's Casa Montezuma shelter in 2019, according to the lawsuit. He threatened to hospitalize her if she spoke about the abuse, court filings say. Prosecutors allege other employees knew about the abuse but didn't report it.\n\nAnother Southwest Key worker allegedly \"repeatedly sexually abused\" a 5-year-old girl, an 8-year-old girl, and an 11-year-old girl at Casa Franklin in El Paso, Texas, in 2022, the lawsuit said. The employee entered their rooms at night to touch their \"private area\" and threatened to kill their families if they spoke up, according to the lawsuit.\n\nAn employee at the nonprofit's Casa Kokopelli shelter in Arizona pleaded guilty to felony attempted sexual misconduct with a minor in 2022 in Maricopa County after absconding with a 15-year-old boy to a hotel for days where the Southwest Key staffer paid the teenager for sex acts, court documents said.\n\nThe misconduct came at the hands of staff at almost every level of Southwest operations, from teachers who inappropriately touched the children to medical staff who asked minors graphic questions about sex.\n\nSouthwest Key Chief Communications Officer Anais Biera Miracle disputed the findings of the lawsuit,\n\nThe lawsuit \"does not present the accurate picture of the care and commitment our employees provide to the youth and children,\" Miracle said in a statement. \"Southwest Key Programs' primary focus is the safety, health, and well-being of each one of the children and youth we care for.\"\n\nWho is Southwest Key Programs taking care of?\n\nSouthwest Key Programs has skyrocketed in its role as a federal partner in recent years as the number of unaccompanied minors crossing the border has grown tremendously.\n\nOver 90,000 unaccompanied minors crossed the border in fiscal year 2024, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. Over 137,000 crossed annually in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\nAfter being taken into custody by Border Patrol, the unaccompanied children are transferred to Health and Human Services which is then charged with finding them care until they can be reunited with family or until they turn 18.\n\nSouthwest Key Program shelters have become Health and Human Services' key partners for housing the children. The shelters house anywhere from 20 to 1,200 minors, according to the lawsuit. The children eat, sleep, and attend school at the facilities.\n\nAs many as 27,000 kids can cycle through Southwest Key Programs facilities in a year, according to a company report from 2021. The typical stay is 28 days.\n\nThe federal government has supported the nonprofit shelters with grants since at least 2003, according to Health and Human Services' published grants data.\n\nIt skyrocketed in prominence in 2018 after former President Donald Trump's policy of separating minors from parents came into effect. Federal funding for the nonprofit grew by nearly 120% that year to $626 million, according to a USA TODAY analysis of the data. Southwest Key received nearly $980 million in fiscal year 2024.\n\nOfficials, advocates react\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra fired back at the company for the abuses allegedly committed at the federal agency's leading housing provider for unaccompanied minors.\n\n\"HHS has a zero-tolerance policy for all forms of sexual abuse, sexual harassment, inappropriate sexual behavior, and discrimination,\" Becerra said. \"The U.S. Department of Justice's complaint against Southwest Key raises serious pattern or practice concerns. HHS will continue to work with the Justice Department and oversight agencies to hold its care-giving programs like Southwest Key accountable. And we will continue to closely evaluate our assignment of children into caregiving programs to ensure the safety and well-being of every child in HHS custody.\"\n\nImmigration rights activists seized on the lawsuit as an example of why shelters for migrant children need to be subject to further oversight.\n\nThe Acacia Center for Justice, a prominent immigrant rights advocacy group, said the allegations in the lawsuit were a clear example of the need to reform how the U.S. houses unaccompanied minors.\n\n\"Decades of evidence-based research into best practices in child welfare and child protection have clearly shown that any custodial system must have robust and accountable oversight mechanisms,\" Executive Director Shaina Aber told USA TODAY in a statement, adding the unaccompanied minors should have access to legal advocates and be swiftly reunited with family. \"When people talk about potential dangers children face in community, they often assume children are safer in custody of DHS or HHS. In reality, children thrive best when they are surrounded by family, receive legal and social work support and integrate into supportive communities as they navigate our complex immigration process.\"", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Key", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

Alleged offenses include rape, touching and soliciting sex and nude photos.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that Southwest Key took \"insufficient action\" to prevent the sexual harassment, failed to report the abuse and didn't take appropriate action to protect the children.\n\nSouthwest Key, based in Austin, is the largest provider of housing to unaccompanied migrant children, operating under grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It has 29 child migrant shelters: 17 in Texas, 10 in Arizona and two in California.\n\n\"Sexual harassment of children in residential shelters, where a child should be safe and secure, is abusive, dehumanizing and unlawful,\" said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. \"Sexual abuse of children is a crisis that we can't ignore or turn a blind eye to. This lawsuit seeks relief for children who have been abused and harmed, and meaningful reforms to ensure no child in these shelters is ever subjected to sexual abuse again.\"\n\nSouthwest Key provides housing and other care for children at the shelters who come to the United States without parents. The children are kept in the shelters until they're reunited with their families or placed in the care of relatives while their immigration case proceeds.\n\nThe nonprofit sent the following statement to Arizona's Family:\n\nThe DOJ is seeking monetary damages to compensate the children and requiring Southwest Key to take appropriate steps to prevent the alleged harassment in the future.\n\nThose who believe they have been victims of sexual harassment at Southwest Key shelters or who have information, contact the Justice Department's housing discrimination tip line at 1-833-591-0291.

The eight-year-old girl said the employee threatened to kill their families if they disclosed the abuse, the complaint alleges.\n\nIn another case, from 2020, an employee took a 15-year-old boy from Casa Kokopelli in Arizona to a hotel room for several days and paid him for sex acts. In both cases, the abuse was documented in Southwest Key's own reports, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\"Sexual harassment of children in residential shelters, where a child should be safe and secure, is abusive, dehumanizing and unlawful,\" Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nSouthwest Key operates 29 shelters that provide temporary housing for unaccompanied children in Texas, Arizona and California, under grants from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nMigrant children who arrive at the border unaccompanied are housed by the U.S. government before being released to sponsors in the United States, usually parents or close relatives.\n\nThere have been a record number of migrant crossings during the administration of President Joe Biden, a Democrat running for re-election against Republican former President Donald Trump who has made criticisms of Biden's border policy a center of his campaign.

At least two employees have been charged since 2020.\n\nThe nonprofit organization is the largest provider of housing for unaccompanied migrant children, operating under grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It has 29 child migrant shelters -- 17 in Texas, 10 in Arizona and two in California -- with room for 6,350 children. The company's largest shelter in Brownsville is at a converted Walmart with a capacity for 1,200.\n\nSouthwest grew as unaccompanied children began crossing the border in large numbers in 2014, overwhelming U.S. authorities. The government awarded the provider more than $3 billion in contracts from 2015 to 2023.\n\nSouthwest Key disputed the accuracy of the claims in a written statement late Thursday.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Austin, where Southwest Key is based, provides extensive details, saying authorities received more than 100 reports of sexual abuse or harassment at the provider's shelters since 2015.\n\nAt a shelter in Channelview, according to the lawsuit, a girl was raped and abused by a shift leader who also solicited nude photos of her. The supervisor threatened to hurt her if she reported it but she eventually told a teacher when the leader was on vacation.\n\nAlso among the suit's allegations: An employee \"repeatedly sexually abused\" three girls ages 5, 8 and 11 at the Casa Franklin shelter in El Paso. The 8-year-old told investigators that the worker \"repeatedly entered their bedrooms in the middle of the night to touch their 'private area,' and he threatened to kill their families if they disclosed the abuse.\"\n\nThe suit also alleges that an employee of the provider's shelter in Tucson, Arizona, took an 11-year-old boy to a hotel and paid him to perform sexual acts for several days in 2020.\n\nIn 2018, then-Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner tried to stop Casa Sunzal, a Southwest Key facility at the corner of Emancipation Avenue and Prairie Street, from opening.\n\nRELATED: Southwest Key sues city of Houston over facility for immigrant children\n\n\"The best solution would be for Southwest Key not to move forward with their plans,\" Turner said at the time.\n\nAt the time, Casa Sunzal was set to become Southwest Key's fourth immigrant youth shelter in Houston.\n\nIn 2019, then-Democratic Presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke held a rally in front of Casa Sunzal calling for it to be shut down.\n\nRELATED: Beto O'Rourke holds protest at downtown Houston facility housing unaccompanied minors\n\nTexas, like Florida, revoked licenses of facilities that house migrant children in 2021 in response to an extraordinary influx of people across its border from Mexico, creating what some critics said was an oversight void.\n\nLeecia Welch, an attorney for unaccompanied children in the case for court oversight, said the allegations against Southwest Key are \"absolutely disgusting\" and blamed Texas' revocation of licenses for \"a powder keg waiting to explode.\"", "source": {"uri": "khou.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KHOU 11 Houston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Key", "type": "wiki", "score":

The Justice Department also accused Southwest Key employees of soliciting sex acts and nude photos from young migrants and of engaging in inappropriate relationships with them.\n\nThe Justice Department said there are more than 100 reports of \"unlawful sexual abuse or harrasment\" of children housed by Southwest Key. Some employees, the department added, have been criminally prosecuted.\n\n\"Since at least 2015, multiple Southwest Key employees -- including supervisory and non-supervisory employees -- have subjected children living at Southwest Key shelter care homes to severe, pervasive, and unwelcome sexual abuse and harassment,\" the Justice Department said in its 26-page lawsuit.\n\nThe Justice Department said Southwest Key failed to take adequate steps to protect children in its care from being victimized, and discouraged them from reporting sexual abuse or harrasment. The department asked a federal judge in Austin, Texas, to impose civil penalties on Southwest Key and to force the organization to pay reparations to victims. It also requested an order to require Southwest Key to take actions to stop sexual abuse in its facilities.\n\nIn a statement to CBS News, Southwest Key said its \"primary focus is the safety, health, and well-being of each one of the children and youth we care for.\"\n\n\"We continue to review the complaint, and it does not present the accurate picture of the care and commitment our employees provide to the youth and children,\" Southwest Key said.\n\n\"We are in constant communication and continue to closely partner with the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), as we have done so for the past two decades to ensure the children and youth entrusted to our care are safe with us during their short stay with Southwest Key,\" the organization added.\n\nAsked whether HHS would discontinue using Southwest Key as a shelter provider, an agency spokesperson said they could not comment due to pending litigation.\n\nIn a statement included in the Justice Department's announcement, HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said his agency would \"continue to closely evaluate our assignment of children into care-giving programs to ensure the safety and well-being of every child\" in its custody.\n\n\"The U.S. Department of Justice's complaint against Southwest Key raises serious pattern or practice concerns. HHS will continue to work with the Justice Department and oversight agencies to hold its care-giving programs like Southwest Key accountable,\" Becerra said.\n\nBetween fiscal years 2015 and 2023 -- the timespan that the lawsuit covered -- Southwest Key received more than $3 billion from HHS to house migrant children, the Justice Department said. Southwest Key has 29 shelters in Arizona, California and Texas with the capacity to house more than 6,000 children.\n\nUnaccompanied children who are not from Mexico are processed differently than other migrants by U.S. immigration officials at the southern border. A 2008 anti-trafficking law protects them from being deported quickly and allows them to stay in the U.S. while their immigration cases are reviewed.\n\nThat 2008 law, passed with bipartisan support, charges HHS with caring for unaccompanied migrant children until they turn 18 or are placed with U.S.-based sponsors, who are typically relatives.\n\nU.S. border officials first started encountering unaccompanied children in large numbers in 2014 and have recorded several spikes in migrant child arrivals since then. In 2021 and 2022, the Biden administration processed record numbers of unaccompanied migrant children, at times struggling to find facilities to house them all.\n\nIn the past year, arrivals of unaccompanied minors along the southern border have declined.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

According to the lawsuit, employees at the Austin-based organization \"subjected children in their care to severe or pervasive sexual harassment that has included, among other things, sexual contact and inappropriate touching, solicitation of sex acts, solicitation of nude photos, entreaties for inappropriate relationships and sexual comments.\"\n\nThe complaint, filed Wednesday in Austin, adds that Southwest Key \"took insufficient action to prevent sexual harassment of the children in its care,\" and concealed the facts once it became aware of their existence. The employees also threatened children to keep silent about the abuse. \"In harassing these children, these Southwest Key employees exploited the children's vulnerabilities, language barriers, and distance from family and loved ones,\" reads the lawsuit. The victims range in age from five to 17 years old, and the Department of Justice collected more than 100 complaints of sexual harassment or abuse.\n\nSouthwest Key operates 29 shelters that provide temporary housing to unaccompanied immigrant children, or minors who enter the country without parents or other legal guardians and without legal immigration status. The non-profit's reception centers are distributed among the States of Texas (17), Arizona (10) and California (2). In total, the shelters, which are the only home these children have while they wait to be reunited with a family member or other sponsor while their immigration cases are processed, have room for 6,350 children. The largest shelter, located in Brownsville, Texas, has 1,200 beds. The non-profit operates thanks to grants from the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nAmong the various accusations is the case of a worker who in 2022 repeatedly sexually abused a five-year-old girl, an eight-year-old girl, and an 11-year-old girl at a shelter in El Paso, Texas. The eight-year-old girl revealed that the accused repeatedly entered their rooms in the middle of the night to touch them in their \"intimate area\" and threatened to kill their families if they revealed the abuse. In another case, a worker at a Tucson, Arizona, center took an 11-year-old boy to a hotel for several days and paid the minor to perform sexual acts on him, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\"HHS has a zero-tolerance policy for all forms of sexual abuse, sexual harassment, inappropriate sexual behavior, and discrimination,\" said U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra on Thursday. \"The U.S. Department of Justice's complaint against Southwest Key raises serious pattern or practice concerns.\"\n\nAssistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, who worked on the lawsuit, said that \"sexual harassment of children in residential shelters, where a child should be safe and secure, is abusive, dehumanizing and unlawful.\" Clarke added that This lawsuit seeks relief for children who have been abused and harmed, and meaningful reforms to ensure no child in these shelters is ever subjected to sexual abuse again.\"\n\nThe lawsuit seeks monetary damages to compensate the children harmed by the alleged harassment, a civil penalty to vindicate the public interest and a court order barring future discrimination and requiring Southwest Key to take appropriate steps to prevent such harassment in the future.", "source": {"uri": "english.elpais.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EL PA\u00cdS"},

At least two employees have been charged since 2020, according to the lawsuit.\n\nBased in Austin, Southwest Key is the largest provider of housing to unaccompanied migrant children, operating under grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It has 29 child migrant shelters -- 17 in Texas, 10 in Arizona and two in California -- with room for 6,350 children. The company's largest shelter in Brownsville has a capacity of 1,200.\n\nHealth and Human Services reported 7,762 children in Southwest Key's care on May 31, according to the most recent data on its website, which does not break the numbers down by shelter.\n\nFormer St. Louis officials Lewis Reed, John Collins-Muhammad released from federal prison Cardinals closer Ryan Helsley elects not to pitch in All-Star Game, replaced on NL roster St. Charles teacher sexually abused teen girl for years, police say 'Steal of the draft': Cardinals pounce at No. 7 on collegiate infielder JJ Wetherholt New St. Louis Public Schools communications chief also lives in Texas Trump injured but 'fine' after attempted assassination at rally; shooter and one attendee are dead Cardinals TV analyst Jim Edmonds draws controversy with Cubs celebration gripe Frank Cusumano heads to KTRS for news-talk radio show with Wendy Wiese St. Luke's moves embryos to Texas.

Among the allegations is the repeated abuse of a 5-year-old in the care of a Southwest Key shelter in El Paso. In 2020, a youth care worker at the provider's Tucson, Arizona, shelter took an 11-year old boy to a hotel for several days and paid the minor to perform sexual acts on the employee, the Justice Department alleges.\n\nChildren were threatened with violence against themselves or family if they reported the abuse, according to the lawsuit. It added that testimony from the victims revealed staff in some instances knew about the ongoing abuse and failed to report it or concealed it.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said Thursday that the complaint \"raises serious pattern or practice concerns\" about Southwest Key. \"HHS has a zero-tolerance policy for all forms of sexual abuse, sexual harassment, inappropriate sexual behavior, and discrimination,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe lawsuit comes less than three weeks after a federal judge granted the Justice Department's request to lift special court oversight of Health and Human Services' care of unaccompanied migrant children. President Joe Biden's administration argued that new safeguards rendered special oversight unnecessary 27 years after it began.\n\nThe Associated Press left a message with the company seeking comment Thursday.\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@stltoday.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Key", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Key"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Health and Human Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talk radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownsville,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brownsville, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brownsville, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Collins-Muhammad", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Collins-Muhammad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Helsley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Helsley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wainwright_Building", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wainwright Building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTRS_(AM)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KTRS (AM)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Public_Schools", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Public Schools"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Edmonds", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Edmonds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Prisons", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Prisons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Sues Contractor Over Sexual Abuse of Migrant Children", "body": "The Justice Department has sued Southwest Key Programs, the nation's largest operator of shelters for unaccompanied migrant children, accusing its employees of repeatedly subjecting minors in its care to sexual abuse and harassment.\n\nEmployees at Southwest Key, a nonprofit based in Austin, \"exploited the children's vulnerabilities, language barriers and distance from family and loved ones,\" according to the lawsuit, filed in federal court in Texas on Wednesday. From 2015 to at least 2023, children and teenagers at its shelters faced threats of violence intended to prevent them from reporting rape, solicitations of sex and entreaties for nude photographs, among other inappropriate conduct and abuse.\n\nSouthwest Key has worked with the federal government for more than two decades, playing a critical role in the shelter system. It has been awarded nearly $6 billion in federal funds since 2007, operating 29 shelters in Texas, Arizona and California that can house more than 6,300 children. The majority are 13 to 17 and come from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. They receive meals and educational opportunities in such shelters until they can be placed with a parent, relative or other guardian.\n\nSouthwest Key documented dozens of incidents of abuse reported by children, but according to prosecutors, employees did not report abuse they had observed or knew of, or violations of policies designed to protect minors.\n\nAnais Biera Miracle, a spokeswoman for Southwest Key, said it continued to shelter children and remained focused on \"the safety, health and well-being\" of the children in its care.\n\n\"We continue to review the complaint, and it does not present the accurate picture of the care and commitment our employees provide to the youth and children,\" Ms. Miracle said in an email.\n\nBy one account, a worker who sexually abused three girls ages 5, 8 and 11 threatened to kill their families if they told. In another instance documented by Southwest Key, a supervisor deliberately changed shifts to be alone with a teenage girl he repeatedly raped, abused and threatened. At night, he would enter her bedroom and those of others in violation of Southwest Key's policies. The girl was transferred to a different shelter after she reported the abuse.\n\nIn yet another case, a Southwest Key clinician asked inappropriate questions about a girl's sexual experiences.\n\nSouthwest Key failed \"to act promptly to correct and end the sexual abuse and harassment,\" the Justice Department said in its complaint, which seeks compensation for the children who were abused.\n\nThe secretary of health and human services, Xavier Becerra, whose department contracts with Southwest Key, said in a statement on Thursday said that the lawsuit raised \"serious pattern-or-practice concerns.\"\n\n\"H.H.S. has a zero-tolerance policy for all forms of sexual abuse, sexual harassment, inappropriate sexual behavior, and discrimination,\" Mr. Becerra said.\n\nCaring for migrant children in federal custody is a lucrative, billion-dollar business with little transparency.\n\nBy law, children who arrive at the southern border with Mexico unaccompanied by parents or legal guardians are the responsibility of the federal government. The Department of Health and Human Services is then responsible for temporarily housing them, usually with a provider contracted to do so like Southwest Key.\n\nMost unaccompanied migrant children who arrive in the United States have already endured a traumatic and treacherous journey north. But increasingly, watchdog groups have reported dangerous conditions at shelters run by government contractors.\n\nIt is not the first time Southwest Key has come under fire.\n\nSouthwest Key drew particular scrutiny when President Donald J. Trump enacted a family separation policy, forcing more than 5,000 children into federal custody after they were removed from their parents or guardians at the southern border. The separations, which largely took place in 2017 and 2018, were a financial boon to contractors like Southwest Key. Federal award money for the nonprofit more than doubled in that time.\n\nIn 2018, The New York Times revealed that Southwest Key had funneled government money through a web of for-profit companies to convert public funds into private money for the organization and pay top executives millions of dollars. Shortly after, the Justice Department opened an investigation into possible financial improprieties. Southwest Key also began an internal inquiry and high-level executives, including its founder and chief financial officer, eventually resigned.\n\nAround the same time, Southwest Key also attracted attention over accounts of abuse at its shelters. In 2018, two of its workers were charged with sexually assaulting minors at Arizona facilities. That same year, videos emerged showing physical abuse at shelters in Arizona. Southwest Key paid a $73,000 fine and lost licenses for two shelters.\n\nThe health department at the time threatened to pull licenses for more shelters, underlining the complicated considerations at play by throwing into question the situation of thousands of migrant children. But the federal contracts continued to flow and the nonprofit remains the largest private provider of housing for unaccompanied migrant children arriving in the United States.", "source": {"uri":

The eight-year-old girl said the employee threatened to kill their families if they disclosed the abuse, the complaint alleges.\n\nIn another case, from 2020, an employee took a 15-year-old boy from Casa Kokopelli in Arizona to a hotel room for several days and paid him for sex acts. In both cases, the abuse was documented in Southwest Key's own reports, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\"Sexual harassment of children in residential shelters, where a child should be safe and secure, is abusive, dehumanizing and unlawful,\" Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nSouthwest Key operates 29 shelters that provide temporary housing for unaccompanied children in Texas, Arizona and California, under grants from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nMigrant children who arrive at the border unaccompanied are housed by the U.S. government before being released to sponsors in the United States, usually parents or close relatives.\n\nThere have been a record number of migrant crossings during the administration of President Joe Biden, a Democrat running for re-election against Republican former President Donald Trump who has made criticisms of Biden's border policy a center of his campaign. Since fiscal year 2021 through June of this year more than 500,000 unaccompanied minors have arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border according to U.S. government data.\n\nReporting by Kristina Cooke and

Migrant Children", "body": "The Justice Department has initiated legal action against Southwest Key Programs, the nation's largest operator of shelters for unaccompanied migrant children, accusing employees of subjecting minors to sexual abuse and harassment over several years.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in federal court in Texas on Wednesday, alleges that Southwest Key employees exploited the children's vulnerabilities, language barriers, and separation from their families.\n\nFrom 2015 to at least 2023, minors in the shelters reportedly faced threats of violence to silence them about incidents of rape, sexual solicitations, and requests for nude photographs, NY Times reported.\n\nSouthwest Key, a nonprofit based in Austin, TX, has partnered with the federal government for over two decades, managing 29 shelters in Texas, Arizona, and California with the capacity to house more than 6,300 children.\n\nThe shelters serve primarily teenagers from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, providing meals and educational opportunities until they can be placed with guardians.\n\nDespite documenting numerous abuse reports from children, Southwest Key failed to report incidents observed by employees or violations of policies meant to protect minors, according to prosecutors.\n\nAnais Biera Miracle, a spokesperson for Southwest Key, defended the organization, saying they continue to prioritize \"the safety, health, and well-being\" of the children in their care.\n\nMiracle said the lawsuit does not accurately represent the commitment of Southwest Key employees to the youth.\n\nDisturbing accounts detailed in the lawsuit include a worker threatening to kill the families of three young girls he sexually abused and a supervisor who repeatedly raped a teenage girl after manipulating his shifts to be alone with her.\n\nAnother case involved a clinician asking inappropriate questions about a girl's sexual experiences.\n\nThe Justice Department's complaint seeks compensation for the victims and criticizes Southwest Key for failing to promptly address and halt the sexual abuse and harassment.\n\nXavier Becerra, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), whose department contracts with Southwest Key, said HHS has a \"zero-tolerance policy for all forms of sexual abuse, sexual harassment, inappropriate sexual behavior, and discrimination.\"\n\nThe sheltering of migrant children in federal custody is a billion-dollar industry with minimal transparency.\n\nSouthwest Key has faced scrutiny before, particularly during President Donald Trump's family separation policy, which placed over 5,000 children into federal custody.\n\nThe policy significantly increased federal funding for Southwest Key, but also led to allegations of financial improprieties and internal investigations, resulting in the resignation of high-level executives.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

(Southwest Key), a Texas-based nonprofit that provides housing to unaccompanied children who are encountered at the southern land border of the United States. The lawsuit alleges that Southwest Key, through its employees, has engaged in a pattern or practice of sexual abuse and harassment of unaccompanied children in Southwest Key shelters in violation of the Fair Housing Act.\n\n\"Sexual harassment of children in residential shelters, where a child should be safe and secure, is abusive, dehumanizing and unlawful,\" said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. \"Sexual abuse of children is a crisis that we can't ignore or turn a blind eye to. This lawsuit seeks relief for children who have been abused and harmed, and meaningful reforms to ensure no child in these shelters is ever subjected to sexual abuse again.\"\n\n\"HHS has a zero-tolerance policy for all forms of sexual abuse, sexual harassment, inappropriate sexual behavior, and discrimination,\" said U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra. \"The U.S. Department of Justice's complaint against Southwest Key raises serious pattern or practice concerns. HHS will continue to work with the Justice Department and oversight agencies to hold its care-giving programs like Southwest Key accountable. And we will continue to closely evaluate our assignment of children into care-giving programs to ensure the safety and well-being of every child in HHS custody.\"\n\n\"Every child has the right to feel safe and secure in their dwelling, including in shelter care,\" said U.S. Attorney Jaime Esparza for the Western District of Texas. \"This lawsuit seeks to provide a pathway for justice and healing for these children, who are among the most vulnerable in our society.\"\n\n\"In search of the American Dream, children often endure perilous journeys on their migration north to the southern border,\" said U.S. Attorney Alamdar S. Hamdani for the Southern District of Texas. \"The sexual harassment alleged in the complaint would destroy any child's sense of safety, turning what was an American Dream into a nightmare. We look forward to working together with the Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Texas to provide justice for the victims who allegedly suffered harm in Southwest Key's shelters.\"\n\nSouthwest Key operates 29 shelters that provide temporary housing for unaccompanied children in Texas, Arizona and California, and is the largest housing provider for unaccompanied children in the United States. Southwest Key receives grants from the HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) to provide housing and other care for unaccompanied children at these shelters. Unaccompanied children are minors who enter the United States without parents or other legal guardians and without lawful immigration status in the United States. The shelters are the children's homes until they are reunited with their immediate families or placed with a relative or other vetted sponsor while their immigration cases proceed.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed yesterday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, alleges that, from 2015 through at least 2023, multiple Southwest Key employees subjected children in their care to severe or pervasive sexual harassment that has included, among other things, sexual contact and inappropriate touching, solicitation of sex acts, solicitation of nude photos, entreaties for inappropriate relationships and sexual comments. The complaint further alleges that Southwest Key took insufficient action to prevent sexual harassment of the children in its care, failed to consistently follow federal requirements for preventing, detecting and reporting abuse including sexual harassment, failed to take appropriate or sufficient action to protect the children in its care and discouraged children from disclosing sexual harassment in violation of federal requirements, despite ORR having issued multiple corrective actions to Southwest Key.\n\nThe department's lawsuit seeks monetary damages to compensate the children harmed by the alleged harassment, a civil penalty to vindicate the public interest and a court order barring future discrimination and requiring Southwest Key to take appropriate steps to prevent such harassment in the future.\n\nIndividuals who believe that they may have been victims of sexual harassment or abuse at Southwest Key shelters or who have other information that may be relevant to this case, may contact the Justice Department's housing discrimination tip line at 1-833-591-0291.

Individuals can also email the Justice Department at southwest.key@usdoj.gov or report through our online portal at civilrights.justice.gov/link/southwestkey.\n\nThe Justice Department's Sexual Harassment in Housing Initiative is led by the Civil Rights Division, in coordination with U.S. Attorneys' Offices across the country. The initiative seeks to address and raise awareness about sexual harassment by people who have control over housing. Since launching the initiative in October 2017, the department has filed 43 lawsuits alleging sexual harassment in housing and recovered over $17 million for victims of such harassment.\n\nThe Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability and familial status.

Perhaps equally as abhorrent, other staff members at the shelters allegedly knew about the attacks and failed to report them.\n\nSouthwest Key runs a total of 29 shelters for unaccompanied migrant minors, 17 in Texas, 10 in Arizona, and two in California. In all, Southwest Key can provide housing for 6,350 children.\n\nSince at least 2015, some of the nonprofit's employees have allegedly engaged in heinous acts of sexual abuse, including \"sexual contact and inappropriate touching, solicitation of sex acts, solicitation of nude photos, entreaties for inappropriate relationships and sexual comments,\" the DOJ press release claimed.\n\nThus far, at least two such employees have been criminally charged. A male working at the Casa Franklin shelter in El Paso, Texas, allegedly touched the \"private area\" of three girls between ages 5 and 11. Another employee from a Southwest Key facility in Tucson, Arizona, allegedly brought an 11-year-old boy to a hotel and paid him to perform sex acts for several days.\n\nBoth employees also reportedly threatened to harm or even kill the children or their families if they reported the abuse. Perhaps equally as abhorrent, other staff members at the shelters allegedly knew about the abuse and failed to report it.\n\n\"Southwest Key took insufficient action to prevent sexual harassment of the children in its care, failed to consistently follow federal requirements for preventing, detecting and reporting abuse including sexual harassment, failed to take appropriate or sufficient action to protect the children in its care and discouraged children from disclosing sexual harassment in violation of federal requirements,\" the press release stated.\n\nSouthwest Key receives funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. As of May 31, nearly 7,800 children are in the care of HHS-funded facilities, though how many of those children are in Southwest Key shelters is unclear.\n\nThe AP reached out to Southwest Key for comment, as did Blaze News.

Funded with grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, it has 29 child migrant shelters with 17 here in Texas.\n\nIn total they can accommodate more than 6,000 children.\n\n\"Unaccompanied minors have zero social network, or a safety net, call it.\" Austin Immigration and Federal Litigation Attorney George Lobb said. \"They've got no social base, no one in the United States to protect them, and the only one that is supposed to is the government, and they failed in doing that by allowing Southwest Key to watch over them.\"\n\nThe DOJ alleges some employees and supervisors have engaged in rape, unwanted touching and the solicitation of sex and nude images of those children since at least 2015, with some victims as young as five.\n\nIn one instance out of El Paso, an 8-year-old reported a Youth Care Worker \"repeatedly entered their bedrooms in the middle of the night to touch their 'private area,' and he threatened to kill their families if they disclosed the abuse.\"\n\nIf you properly train staff, screen them and do ratios, you will, you will eliminate a lot of these issues and reduce suffering,\" Lobb said. \"It's impossible to completely eliminate this, and we know this, but there is a pattern and practice of Southwest Keys putting profit before people, and this is a disgusting culmination of that policy.\"\n\nThe lawsuit says the children were threatened with violence against them and their families to ensure their silence, and in some cases, Southwest Key was even aware of the abuse but didn't report it. The lawsuit also describes employees acting as \"spotters\" while other employees committed the abuse.\n\nThe DOJ alleges Southwest Key failed to take appropriate actions to protect the children in their care, a violation of the Fair Housing Act.\n\nIf you have an FHA grant, or you're operating an FHA facility, you have to comply with all federal law, including you can't discriminate,\" Lobb said. \"And part of sex discrimination is sexual harassment, rape, child pornography, which is also listed in the lawsuit, among other things.\"\n\nIn a statement to KEYE on Thursday, Southwest Key said:\n\n\"Southwest Key Programs' primary focus is the safety, health, and well-being of each one of the children and youth we care for. We continue to review the complaint, and it does not present the accurate picture of the care and commitment our employees provide to the youth and children. We are in constant communication and continue to closely partner with the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), as we have done so for the past two decades to ensure the children and youth entrusted to our care are safe with us during their short stay with Southwest Key.\"\n\nThe DOJ is asking for an immediate stop to these discriminatory practices and action to prevent future abuse, reparations for the victims and civil penalties against Southwest Key.\n\n\"You take the most vulnerable people on the planet and stick them in a situation in which they are targets, ripe targets for abuse,\" Lobb said. \"We have the money to put people on busses and fly them around the country, but we're not spending money to protect kids.\"", "source": {"uri": "abc7amarillo.com", "dataType": "news",

(WSAU) - The Justice Department laid out a groundbreaking lawsuit on Thursday afternoon against the largest housing provider for unaccompanied migrant children in the United States, alleging years of \"severe\" sexual abuse against children at the facilities by employees of the taxpayer-funded organization.\n\nAccording to the New York Post, employees at Southwest Key, which includes supervisors, took part in \"severe sexual abuse and rape, solicitation of sex acts, solicitation of nude photos, entreaties for sexually inappropriate relationships, sexual comments and gestures, leering, and inappropriate touching,\" with children who range from five years old to 17 years old in their care since at least 2015.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra denounced the organization in a statement on Thursday, saying, \"HHS has a zero-tolerance policy for all forms of sexual abuse, sexual harassment, inappropriate sexual behavior, and discrimination,\" as the DOJ provided graphic details of abuse in their lawsuit that featured victims such as a 5-year-old girl, an 8-year-old girl, and an 11-year-old girl at their Casa Franklin facility located in El Paso.\n\nThe organization was founded by Dr. Juan Sanchez in Austin, Texas, in 1987 and is fully funded by taxpayer grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. As of May, the organization had just shy of 7,800 children in their care across 29 migrant shelters in Texas, Arizona, and California and has seen its annual revenue skyrocket in recent years to over $300 million as the number of illegal migrant children has grown dramatically over the last decade. According to InfluenceWatch.org, the most recent finance report from 2017 showed that Southwest Key received more than $626 million in federal grants that year alone.\n\nThis lawsuit is not the first time the organization has found itself in legal trouble after founder Dr. Juan Sanchez was forced to resign in 2019 due to a federal investigation into the organization's finances that alleged Southwest Key was engaging in \"profiteering\" while also seeing former employees charged with sexually abusing minors in their care in 2016, 2017, and 2018.\n\nSince 2021, an unprecedented number of minors traveling alone have entered the U.S. through the southern border. Up from 122,731 the year before, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services states that they received a record 128,904 unaccompanied minors in 2022 with most coming from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.", "source": {"uri": "wsau.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WSAU News/Talk 550 AM \u00b7 99.9 FM | Wausau, Stevens Point"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_schumacher@wsau.com", "name":

At least two employees have been charged since 2020, according to the lawsuit.\n\nSouthwest Key disputed the accuracy of the claims in a written statement late Thursday.\n\nBased in Austin, Texas, Southwest Key is the largest provider of housing for unaccompanied migrant children, operating under grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It has 29 child migrant shelters -- 17 in Texas, 10 in Arizona and two in California -- with room for 6,350 children, according to the complaint. The company's largest shelter in Brownsville, Texas has a capacity of 1,200.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nNo tornado, but powerful storm left swath of damage across Tucson Mountain lion that made Tucson hospital visit headed back to wild Tucson restaurant's signature dish makes us long to visit France Tucson coffee and candy shop Chocolate Iguana is back open at a new location \ud83c\udf6b U of A quietly drops unpopular 'UArizona' moniker Two Democrats vie in primary for Pima County treasurer nomination Dad says he left dead son in Picture Rocks home for two days, court filing shows Tornado touches down in Tucson, officials confirm Father of Marana girl who died in hot car faces murder, child abuse charges Tone down political rhetoric, Gov.

The child reported his discomfort with the worker's touching and said the worker \"kept going into my room like six times without knocking\" and without another employee present, in violation of Southwest Key's policies.\n\nAllegations of child sexual abuse at Southwest Key's Tucson residential facility were featured in a 2018 ProPublica investigation based on police reports from immigrant youth shelters.\n\nThe company's Arizona facilities also came under fire in 2018 after a series of allegations of physical abuse and inadequate staff vetting, prompting the Arizona Department of Health and Human Services to initially seek to revoke the licenses of all 13 of its locations, before a settlement agreement allowed the company to continue operating with conditions, the Arizona Mirror reported.\n\nThe settlement imposed $73,000 in civil penalties and compelled Southwest Key to hire a third-party consultant to oversee quality-management systems, as well as agree to unannounced inspections by ADHS personnel for two years, according to the Arizona Mirror.\n\nADHS, which licenses behavioral health residential facilities like Southwest Keys', did not immediately respond to the Arizona Daily Star's Thursday request for information on how Southwest Key sites were monitored after 2019.\n\nVulnerable migrant children placed in large congregate-care centers are too often the victims of abuse, said Roxana Avila-Cimpeanu, manager of the Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project's children's legal program. The Florence Project is the only nonprofit legal service provider in Arizona that provides pro-bono legal and social services to detained children, she said.\n\n\"We have seen this pattern of abuse and mistreatment and the lack of accountability for years,\" Avila-Cimpeanu told the Star on Thursday. \"We have seen the government rely on these massive congregate-care facilities, and we have seen there's not effective oversight on the federal side or on the state side.\"\n\nHealth and Human Services reported 7,762 children at all of its contracted facilities on May 31, according to the most recent data on its website, which does not break the numbers down by shelter or provider. The department declined to say how many children were currently in Southwest Key's care or if the agency continues to assign children to its care.\n\nThe lawsuit, which provided details of some of the alleged abuse, asserts that authorities received more than 100 reports of sexual abuse or harassment at the provider's shelters since 2015.\n\nAmong the suit's allegations: An employee \"repeatedly sexually abused\" three girls ages 5, 8 and 11 at the Casa Franklin shelter in El Paso, Texas. The 8-year-old told investigators that the worker \"repeatedly entered their bedrooms in the middle of the night to touch their 'private area,' and he threatened to kill their families if they disclosed the abuse.\"\n\nAt the company's \"Casa Kokopelli\" location in Mesa, an employee took an 11-year-old boy to a hotel and paid him to perform sexual acts for several days in 2020, the suit alleges. At the same location in 2019, a teenage girl reported that she felt uncomfortable with her clinician who asked her graphic questions about her sexual experiences, telling her to look him in the eyes when she answered, while \"looking her body up and down,\" the complaint said.\n\nThe Star left multiple messages at the company's Tucson location on Thursday, with no response.\n\nSouthwest spokesperson Anais Biera Miraclea said Thursday that the provider is still reviewing the complaint, which she said \"does not present the accurate picture of the care and commitment our employees provide to the youth and children.\"\n\nThe ADHS website shows that eight Southwest Key residential facilities in Arizona shut down in January 2022, including its Tucson residential facility. The counseling facility located at the same address, 1601 N. Oracle Road, is listed as active.\n\nTwo other Southwest Key residential facilities in Arizona closed in May 2022 and another in July 2023. Six Southwest Key counseling facilities remain active in Arizona, according to the ADHS website.\n\nChildren in Southwest Key's care were threatened with violence against themselves or family if they reported the abuse, according to the lawsuit. It added that testimony from the victims revealed staff in some instances knew about the ongoing abuse and failed to report it or concealed it.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said Thursday that the complaint \"raises serious pattern or practice concerns\" about Southwest Key. \"HHS has a zero-tolerance policy for all forms of sexual abuse, sexual harassment, inappropriate sexual behavior, and discrimination,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe lawsuit comes less than three weeks after a federal judge granted the Justice Department's request to lift special court oversight of Health and Human Services' care of unaccompanied migrant children. President Joe Biden's administration argued that new safeguards rendered special oversight unnecessary 27 years after it began.\n\nThat's another source of concern for Avila-Cimpeanu of the Florence Project. The Flores settlement was based on a case brought by a young child that resulted in protections for immigrant children, she said.\n\nThat \"critical\" protection has now been replaced by \"insufficient\" regulations governing the care of migrant minors in custody, she said.\n\nThe regulations \"actually lack things like oversight, transparency and licensing requirements,\" she said. \"Children in care today have even less oversight than when the incidents in the (DOJ) complaint happened, and so we're very concerned with that continuing lack of oversight and accountability.\"\n\nReporter Emily Bregel covers immigration and border issues for the Arizona Daily Star and Tucson.com.

Garland | https://www.justice.gov/agencies/chart/ma\n\nThe Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against Southwest Key Programs Inc. (Southwest Key), a Texas-based nonprofit that provides housing to unaccompanied children encountered at the southern U.S. border. The lawsuit alleges that Southwest Key, through its employees, engaged in a pattern or practice of sexual abuse and harassment of unaccompanied children in violation of the Fair Housing Act.\n\n\"Sexual harassment of children in residential shelters, where a child should be safe and secure, is abusive, dehumanizing and unlawful,\" said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. \"Sexual abuse of children is a crisis that we can't ignore or turn a blind eye to. This lawsuit seeks relief for children who have been abused and harmed, and meaningful reforms to ensure no child in these shelters is ever subjected to sexual abuse again.\"\n\n\"HHS has a zero-tolerance policy for all forms of sexual abuse, sexual harassment, inappropriate sexual behavior, and discrimination,\" said U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra. \"The U.S. Department of Justice's complaint against Southwest Key raises serious pattern or practice concerns. HHS will continue to work with the Justice Department and oversight agencies to hold its care-giving programs like Southwest Key accountable. And we will continue to closely evaluate our assignment of children into care-giving programs to ensure the safety and well-being of every child in HHS custody.\"\n\n\"Every child has the right to feel safe and secure in their dwelling, including in shelter care,\" said U.S. Attorney Jaime Esparza for the Western District of Texas. \"This lawsuit seeks to provide a pathway for justice and healing for these children, who are among the most vulnerable in our society.\"\n\n\"In search of the American Dream, children often endure perilous journeys on their migration north to the southern border,\" said U.S. Attorney Alamdar S. Hamdani for the Southern District of Texas. \"The sexual harassment alleged in the complaint would destroy any child's sense of safety, turning what was an American Dream into a nightmare. We look forward to working together with the Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Texas to provide justice for the victims who allegedly suffered harm in Southwest Key's shelters.\"\n\nSouthwest Key operates 29 shelters providing temporary housing for unaccompanied children in Texas, Arizona, and California, making it the largest housing provider for such minors in the United States. The organization receives grants from HHS's Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) to offer housing and other care services until these children are reunited with their families or placed with vetted sponsors while their immigration cases proceed.\n\nThe lawsuit filed yesterday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas alleges that from 2015 through at least 2023, multiple Southwest Key employees subjected children under their care to severe or pervasive sexual harassment including inappropriate touching, solicitation of sex acts and nude photos, entreaties for inappropriate relationships, and sexual comments. The complaint further asserts that Southwest Key failed to prevent such harassment adequately or follow federal requirements regarding preventing, detecting, reporting abuse including sexual harassment.\n\nThe department seeks monetary damages for affected children, civil penalties to uphold public interest standards, and court orders mandating measures preventing future incidents.\n\nIndividuals believing they may have been victims or possessing relevant information are encouraged to contact DOJ's housing discrimination tip line at 1-833-591-0291 or email southwest.key@usdoj.gov.\n\nSince launching its Sexual Harassment in Housing Initiative in October 2017 led by DOJ's Civil Rights Division alongside U.S Attorneys' Offices nationwide; 43 lawsuits have been filed recovering over $17 million for victims.\n\nThe Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability,and familial status.More information about DOJ's Civil Rights Division is available at www.justice.gov/crt.", "source": {"uri": "legalnewsline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Legal Newsline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "legal_newsline@legalnewsline.com", "name": "Legal Newsline", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Key", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Key"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Health and Human Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristen_Clarke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kristen Clarke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Assistant_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Assistant Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice_Civil_Rights_Division", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Western_District_of_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Western District of Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_tolerance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zero tolerance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human sexual activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alamdar_S._Hamdani", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alamdar S.

Federal law bars minors who cross the border illegally from being returned to their home country. Southwest Key holds more than 6,000 children in 29 shelters staffed by \"youth care workers.\"\n\nThe lawsuit says Southwest Key records show staff members repeatedly covered for each other as they preyed on children.\n\n\"A Southwest Key Youth Care Worker who in 2022 repeatedly sexually abused a five-year-old girl, an eight-year-old girl, and an eleven-year-old girl at Casa Franklin in El Paso, Texas,\" the lawsuit says. \"The eight-year-old girl disclosed that the Youth Care Worker repeatedly entered their bedrooms in the middle of the night to touch their 'private area,' and he threatened to kill their families if they disclosed the abuse.\"\n\nSouthwest Key has received $4 billion by the federal government since 2019. Payments have grown as illegal border crossings increased, rising from $391 million in 2020 to nearly $1 billion thus far in fiscal year 2024, according to federal spending data.\n\nThe lawsuit comes amid revelations that unaccompanied minors who come to the United States are frequently subject to unsafe conditions. Federal employees told Congress this month that migrant children are first turned over to contractors with limited training, and then sent to live with unvetted sponsors. Deborah White, an HHS whistleblower, recalled the \"horrifying\" realization that \"children were being trafficked with billions of taxpayer dollars by a contractor failing to vet sponsors and process children safely, with government officials complicit in it.\"\n\nWhite described the process as \"taxpayer-funded slavery and child trafficking.\"\n\nThe lawsuit describes \"over one hundred Reports of unlawful sexual abuse or harassment of children in Southwest Key's care since at least 2015.\n\n\"These instances are examples of Southwest Key's longstanding pattern or practice of illegal sexual abuse, harassment, and misconduct against children in Southwest Key's care. Southwest Key failed to consistently correct its practices and permitted the harassment to continue without adequate intervention,\" the suit reads.\n\nIn one case, a teenage girl at Casa Kokopelli in Mesa, Arizona told a \"clinician\" that she missed her mother, and \"the clinician turned the conversation to sex,\" and said in a discussion with another teenage girl that he \"can be more than your clinician if you would allow me to,\" the suit said.\n\n\"Another 2019 Southwest Key Report details how, at Casa Rio Grande in San Benito, Texas, a child reported a male Youth Care Worker told him he liked dating 'transexuals, transgenero, personas gay,' translated to 'transexuals, transgender, gay individuals.'\"\n\n\"The Youth Care Worker asked the child if he dressed as a woman and went to work at night; while asking this, the Youth Care Worker caressed his own groin. After the child complained, Southwest Key transferred the child to a shelter in another state. Southwest Key ultimately reinstated the Youth Care Worker,\" the lawsuit alleges.\n\nIn 2022 at Casa Norma Linda in Los Fresnos, Texas, two employees helped a third conduct and conceal a relationship with a 16-year old unaccompanied minor. In 2023 at Casa Las Palmas in Mesa, Arizona, a minor reported that a Youth Care Worker allegedly said he wanted to \"give it to her hard\" and asked, \"How are the women of Venezuela?\"\n\nThe same year, a boy said that a female Shift Leader \"touched the child while he was in a shower, and verbally harassed him, 'constantly' telling him that she wanted him to stay in the shelter and 'have children with her,\" the suit said. Despite Southwest Key's internal investigation finding that the employee committed misconduct, she \"continued employment with Southwest Key.\"\n\nThere was also a Shift Leader who in 2019 allegedly \"repeatedly raped, abused, and threatened a teenage girl throughout her shelter stay at Casa Montezuma in Channelview, Texas.\" The girl said other employees covered for him by changing shifts with him so he could target her.\n\nThe Justice Department alleges Southwest Key staff exploited the children's illegal status and lack of parents to threaten them into silence. \"A Southwest Key employee at Casa Franklin in El Paso, Texas, threatened an eight-year-old female child that if she reported his abuse to anyone, he would 'kill her family.'\"\n\n\"A Southwest Key manager at Casa Montezuma in Channelview, Texas, threatened the female child he was harassing that if she reported the sexual abuse, she would be hospitalized. A Southwest Key employee at Casa Nueva Esperanza in Brownsville, Texas, discouraged a child from pursuing a report of harassment by telling the child it would delay her reunification with her family or adversely affect her placement with a sponsor,\" it added.\n\nWhen a child reported sexual abuse by staff and was covered by hickeys, the employee she reported it to told her to \"cover up\" the hickeys and did not report it to anyone. The child reported it to a second employee, who notified a supervisor who allegedly ordered that employee not to write a report. That employee tried to report it directly to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement, which oversees the unaccompanied minors.\n\nSouthwest Key, which has received billions from ORR, claimed it did not have a phone number for the office.\n\nAnais Biera Miracle, the contractor's communications officer, told The Daily Wire in a statement that the suit \"does not present the accurate picture of the care and commitment our employees provide to the youth and children.\"\n\n\"We are in constant communication and continue to closely partner with the Office of Refugee Resettlement,\" Miracle said.\n\nThe Justice Department's suit asks for monetary damages \"to each person aggrieved by Southwest Key's discriminatory conduct,\" as well as \"civil penalties against Southwest Key to vindicate the public interest.\"\n\nThe Biden administration has relaxed the vetting of unaccompanied migrant \"sponsors,\" removing DNA testing and, in many cases, FBI background checks. In some cases, the Department of Health and Human Services knowingly sent children to live with gang members. A third of unaccompanied migrants -- some 85,000 children -- are currently missing.\n\nWhite, the HHS whistleblower, says she faced blowback when she attempted to check on a migrant child.\n\n\"When I checked on a child's welfare at another facility I was told, 'Do not do that again. Once these children leave here...they're gone and they are no longer your responsibility.'\"", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Wire"}, "authors": [],

And they said Southwest Key was aware of the abuse but failed to fix it.\n\nThe Justice Department said the abuse -- and Southwest Key's failures -- date at least back to 2015 and continued up through last year.\n\n\"Sexual abuse of children is a crisis that we can't ignore or turn a blind eye to,\" said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke. \"This lawsuit seeks relief for children who have been abused and harmed, and meaningful reforms to ensure no child in these shelters is ever subjected to sexual abuse again.\"\n\nProsecutors detailed instances of abuse in court documents, saying the company oversaw \"pervasive\" abuse.\n\nOne worker \"repeatedly sexually abused\" a 5-year-old girl, an 8-year-old girl and an 11-year-old girl, coming into their bedrooms at night to touch their \"private area.\" The employee threatened to kill the girls' families if they talked about it, prosecutors charged.\n\nA supervisor \"repeatedly raped\" a teenage girl at another facility. She finally told a teacher about it, saying she thought other Southwest Key employees were helping the man get away with it because they would juggle assignments to give the man time alone with her.\n\nThat man also demanded nude photos of her, she said.\n\nIn another case an employee ran off with a 15-year-old boy, putting him up in a hotel for days where the employee paid the teenager for sex.\n\nSouthwest Key said it was reviewing the case but said it \"does not present the accurate picture\" of the company.\n\n\"Southwest Key Programs' primary focus is the safety, health, and well-being of each one of the children and youth we care for,\" the firm said.\n\nThe migrants in question are Unaccompanied Alien Children, or UACs in government-speak, because they showed up at the border without parents.\n\nUnder U.S. policy they are required to be quickly released from Homeland Security to the federal Health and Human Services Department, which is supposed to hold them until sponsors can be found to take them.\n\nUACs used to be a tiny fraction of the border crossers but starting late in the Obama administration they began to surge. Under President Biden the flow became a tsunami, with Border Patrol agents regularly recording 10,000 a month and a few months topping 18,000.\n\nCaring for the children has become big business.\n\nSouthwest Key runs 29 shelters in Texas, Arizona and California, and has collected $3 billion in taxpayer money from 2015 to 2023.\n\nThe government's lawsuit was filed under the Fair Housing Act.\n\nProsecutors said the government has catalogued more than 100 reports of sexual abuse or harassment since 2015. The ones documented in the case files span a number of Southwest Key's facilities, and include a wide array of behavior.\n\nOne teenage girl said a medical worker kept leering at her while asking about her sexual history, including positions and types of sex. The man later admitted to it.\n\nA 16-year-old girl reported being convinced she was in a relationship with an employee, and she left him a love letter when she was discharged from the facility. Southwest Key discovered that other employees had known about the relationship and even facilitated communications.\n\nAnother worker, while groping his own groin, quizzed a a boy about whether he liked dressing like a woman. The child was transferred but Southwest Key kept the man on the job, prosecutors said.\n\nAnd a 16-year-old boy said a female supervisor would touch him while he was in the shower, and told him they should \"have children\" together. Southwest Key found she violated its policy by riding alone with the boy in a vehicle, but she was allowed to keep working.\n\nWhen one girl with visible hickeys on her body reported a sexual assault, a Southwest Key employee told her to \"cover up\" the marks and never wrote up a report nor send the child for a medical exam. After the child talked to another employee, that person went to a supervisor who instructed her not to write up a report.\n\nWhen the employee tried to report the incident directly to HHS, supervisors claimed not to have the hotline phone number.\n\n\"The conduct of multiple Southwest Key employees and supervisors toward children who reported sexual abuse or harassment, including the examples described above, caused many children to fear that reporting harassing incidents would negatively affect their reunification with family, as documented in multiple Reports,\" the lawsuit said.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_dinan@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Stephen Dinan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Key", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Key"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristen_Clarke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kristen Clarke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Assistant_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Assistant Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unaccompanied_Alien_Children", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unaccompanied Alien Children"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Border_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Border Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Health and Human Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_discrimination_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Housing discrimination in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Sexual_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Sexual Abuse", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2018/08/18/migrant_shelters_school_07896_c0-0-5203-3033_s1770x1032.jpg?d4fa873e2546d390613a5bab45ab0889a0b1e121", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744955", "eventUri": "eng-9744955", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.7176470588235294, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

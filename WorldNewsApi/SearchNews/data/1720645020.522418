Drew Carter III, 46, was taken into custody, records show. His sentencing is now set for July 17. He was found guilty of murder; kidnapping while armed with a deadly weapon, a Level 3 felony; criminal confinement while armed with a deadly weapon, a Level 3 felony; and criminal confinement with bodily injury, a Level 5 felony. He was also convicted after a short bench trial on firearms enhancements. At maximum, he would essentially face up to life in prison. Police believe Jessica Flores, 36, of South Chicago Heights, Illinois, died sometime on Feb. 24 or 25, 2019. A car she borrowed was later discovered torched with a pool of blood in the backseat. Flores\u2019s body was not found for more than a year until her skull and vertebrae were discovered in April 2020 in Gary\u2019s Brunswick Park. \u201cWe\u2019re so happy and thankful,\u201d her sister Genesis Flores said Saturday. \u201cNothing\u2019s going to bring her back. We\u2019re really thankful he\u2019s not going to be able to hurt anybody else, or take any more lives.\u201d Flores\u2019 mother Adela Flores said via phone she was \u201cecstatic,\u201d she said. \u201cWe asked God for signs and they were there yesterday.\u201d Carter\u2019s lawyer Mark Gruenhagen said Saturday that hadn\u2019t talked if Carter would appeal, but \u201cI can\u2019t imagine he wouldn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cObviously, we\u2019re very disappointed with the verdict,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestigators had zero corroboration from any source.\u201d They presented a witness who admitted she was addicted to crack cocaine, had a flawed memory and lied during the investigation, Gruenhagen said. On the stand Friday, Carter denied involvement in her death. He met Flores sometime in 2018. They got involved, then he claimed they split because she struggled with drugs, but remained close. He said he was headed to George \u201cSax\u201d Heath\u2019s house \u2014 a family friend \u2014 to drop off a plate of food after a death in the family. Flores and her friend showed up. The two women got into a \u201cfull-on fight\u201d before they were told to leave, Carter said. Flores wanted him to stay out and party, he said. He and Flores had a \u201cspecial bond,\u201d Carter said. Carter said he left after 1 a.m. and returned to his relative\u2019s house. He said he had to work the next day. He denied driving Flores\u2019 borrowed Nissan, shooting her, setting the car on fire, tackling Flores\u2019 friend after her death, or taking the witness to his relative\u2019s house while leaving Flores\u2019 body in the car parked outside. That witness \u2014 Flores\u2019 friend \u2014 admitted the women were smoking crack all night. Carter and Flores were arguing on-and-off. Prosecutors said there was \u201ctalk\u201d of the three having sex. \u201cCan I (have sex with) her,\u201d Carter asked Flores. As Flores said, no, Carter, driving, turned around wearing one glove and shot her dead, the witness testified. She thought Flores had been shot in the chest, because the witness didn\u2019t have any blood on her. At trial, the witness said she assumed it was the chest, but wasn\u2019t sure. Flores\u2019 skull was found with a bullet hole. Her family said Saturday they were grateful to the witness. Without her, there wouldn\u2019t have been a case, Flores\u2019 mother Adela said. She \u201cstood her ground,\u201d Genesis Flores said Saturday. \u201cShe was terrified on the stand. She did what she had to, did it for my sister and us. I\u2019m sure so she could move on herself.\u201d Jessica \u201clit up a room\u201d with her voice, smile and laugh, Genesis said. She was \u201cspunky, happy,\u201d adding she mothered her as a sister. \u201cWhen she loves you, she smothers you with love.\u201d \u201cI really do miss that,\u201d Genesis said. \u201cI would tell her to calm down.\u201d On Friday morning, Gary Police Det. Kris Adams, the lead investigator, testified. He said Carter was his \u201conly suspect\u201d after interviewing the friend and seeing a digital picture of him with Flores dated Feb. 25, 2019. Investigators went out on two different searches with police, drones, and cadaver dogs in Gary in 2019 without finding Flores\u2019 body. Later, Adams said investigators found pictures of Flores on Carter\u2019s cell phone and seven web searches from March 3 to 12, 2019 of a news article detailing the police missing person\u2019s search for the two women. Gruenhagen asked Adams if he found web searches of how to clean blood or hide a body in Brunswick Park. No, Adams responded. On the stand, the witness said Flores had hit her in the face at \u201cSax\u2019s\u201d house. Adams later admitted he learned that detail \u201chere in court.\u201d In closing arguments, Deputy Prosecutor Eric Randall said Carter \u201cexecuted\u201d Flores. \u201cWhat else could you call that,\u201d he asked. He alleged Flores and her friend \u201cruined\u201d his plans to kill Pamela Crider, 42, of Hammond, who the witness knew as \u201cLittle Debbie\u201d there at the house by \u201cmaking a scene\u201d and getting kicked out. The witness, he told jurors, was \u201ccredible,\u201d \u201cbelievable,\u201d and \u201ctold you the truth.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t fabricate that story,\u201d Randall said. \u201cYou don\u2019t make it up.\u201d Gruenhagen told jurors the entire case hinged on the witness, was characterized by an incomplete police investigation and lack of scientific evidence tying Carter to Flores\u2019 death. How could the woman be in the backseat and not have any blood on her, he asked. The \u201claws of physics\u201d didn\u2019t stop that day, he said. To convict, they would have to \u201cbelieve\u201d the Nissan drove around a block in Gary 20 times, but no one reported it. A car door that was just locked, unlocked before the woman bolted after the shooting. Or, that Carter parked at a relative\u2019s home on a residential street and left a woman\u2019s dead body inside a car and no one said anything. Investigators never looked for a fireman the woman said she found just afterward she escaped from Carter\u2019s relative\u2019s house, nor a NIPSCO worker that gave her a ride, Gruenhagen said. There was no weapon, DNA, or fingerprints tying Carter. When the woman later made it to a relative\u2019s apartment, that person was skeptical of her story. In a deposition, the relative called the witness a \u201cpathological liar\u201d and found no blood when they washed her hair in the bathroom. Chicago Police \u2014 who found the torched Nissan near 82nd and Ridgeland days after Flores disappeared \u2014 had no evidence tying Carter to it, the lawyer said. \u201cWe\u2019re here, because (the witness) said it happened,\u201d Gruenhagen said. Randall retorted that Carter was the only person who had a motivation to lie about what happened. Judge Natalie Bokota oversaw the trial. Deputy Prosecutor Infinity Westberg was assigned with Randall. Co-counsel David O\u2019Donnell assisted Gruenhagen. On Feb. 26, 2019, Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Department officers started to investigate the disappearance of two women from South Chicago Heights, according to the probable cause affidavit. One woman was found alive but Jessica Flores was reported missing on Feb. 24 when she was driving a white 2010 Nissan Altima, court records state. The Altima was found in Chicago, where it had been set on fire and a large amount of blood was found in the rear seat. Flores\u2019 family had received information that she was shot and killed in Gary before her body was dumped somewhere near Fifth Avenue, the affidavit states. On March 6, detectives traveled to a Chicago tow yard to take samples of blood in the Altima, court records state. The next day, a search started for Flores, including a Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Department drone, but she was not located. On March 8, police spoke to Flores\u2019 friend about the night Flores disappeared, the affidavit states, and she told police that she was hanging out with a friend in Gary for much of the day on Feb. 24 and leading into Feb. 25. The pair went to the Gary home of someone named \u201cStacks\u201d \u2014 a.k.a. \u201cSax\u201d \u2014 and encountered a man named \u201cTiny\u201d who drove them to the liquor store. When they returned, \u201cTiny\u201d became angry, so Flores and her friend left, court records state. \u201cTiny\u201d followed them out and convinced Flores to let him inside the vehicle and promised to get them drugs, the affidavit states, and he took them to a house near 10th Avenue and Clark Road. He drove them back to \u201cStacks\u201d residence and when no one answered the door, \u201cTiny\u201d made the pair get into the back seat, court records state. Flores and \u201cTiny\u201d started arguing again and he stopped the car multiple times to turn around, records state. The last time he stopped the car, he asked Flores if he could have sex with her friend and Flores said \u201cno,\u201d records state, so \u201cTiny\u201d turned around and shot Flores once, which caused her to immediately slump to her right and start bleeding. The second woman got out of the vehicle and her ears were ringing and she tried to run away but was tackled by \u201cTiny,\u201d records state, and he drove her back to his relative\u2019s residence and Flores\u2019 body remained inside the vehicle. Eventually \u201cTiny\u201d fell asleep and she escaped. She told police that she was afraid for her life, the affidavit states. The woman identified Carter as \u201cTiny\u201d from a photo lineup and detectives drove her to the 900 block of Morton Street in Gary, where she pointed to a particular residence as the one she escaped from and the last place she saw Flores\u2019 body. On April 9, 2020, Gary police were dispatched to the 700 block of Clark Road when a Gary Parks Department employee found a human skull in the woods of Brunswick Park. The top portion of the skull and lower jaw were collected, and the next day, another bone, which appeared to be a vertebra, was found in the same area, court records state. Flores is survived by six children, according to her obituary. Crider was found shot dead in the face in Gary on Feb. 27, 2019. Heath, 55, was found shot dead in March 2019, according to news reports.", "summary": "A jury convicted a Gary man late Friday on all counts in the murder of his former girlfriend in 2019, court records show.", "url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/06/08/gary-man-convicted-in-former-girlfriends-19-murder/", "image": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Post-Tribune.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:58:09", "author": "Meredith Colias-Pete", "authors": ["Meredith Colias-Pete"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.438}

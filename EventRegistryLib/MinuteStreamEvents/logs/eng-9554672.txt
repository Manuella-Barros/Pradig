And, yes, at six-foot-six and 248 pounds, he is big enough to be a monster. But it is the way Zadorov played that made a difference.\n\nHe led Vancouver defencemen with 24 hits, and left the mark of Z a couple of times on Nashville blue-line ace Roman Josi. The Canucks dominated at five-on-five when Zadorov was on the ice, generating 64 per cent of high-danger chances. He contributed two goals -- matching the Predators' team output against the 29-year-old over six games -- and averaged 20:20 of ice time, a workload he hadn't reached in any regular-season game since Jan. 4.\n\nZadorov was a healthy scratch just nine games before the Stanley Cup tournament began.\n\nHow is this possible?\n\n\"It's just everything,\" Zadorov explained. \"I like the environment, like the challenges. I like spending time with the guys more and more. Those playoff wins, those good emotions you get on the ice, they create memories for you. I think that's the biggest thing for me to say: you're just enjoying being around these guys every day and also playing super-competitive hockey. You're playing for something, right? That's why we play hockey. . . so when the Stanley Cup playoffs start, we can win something.\n\n\"You're getting all kinds of emotions every day you come to the rink -- memories and everything. It kind of makes you happy, you know.\"\n\nZadorov seems built for playoff hockey. And so does the Canucks' defence, which has become an underrated backbone for the team as it prepares to open a second-round matchup against Connor McDavid and the Edmonton Oilers on Wednesday that almost no one outside the West Coast thinks Vancouver can win.\n\nThe Canucks suffocated the Predators, allowing only 12 goals in six games while yielding just 25 shots per game and restricting Nashville to 40 high-danger chances at five-on-five.\n\nAnd what does any of this have to do with a fast and furiously good Oilers team whose formidable attack is fronted by McDavid and Leon Draisaitl, the best player in the world and another who is in the top-five?\n\nMaybe nothing. We're about to find out. But from the National Hockey League all-star break until the end of the regular season three weeks ago, the Predators actually were ahead of the Oilers in scoring (3.71 goals per game to 3.62), power-play percentage (27.2 to 25.5) and shots on goal (34.4 to 33.7).\n\nEdmonton is an elite, offensive team. So was Nashville heading into the playoffs.\n\n\"Those principles that we brought into the Nashville series are our principles and how we want to play,\" Canuck defenceman Ian Cole said after Tuesday's practice. \"Do we make adjustments and tweak little things here and there depending on who we're playing? Yeah, absolutely. We can't let McDavid pick up speed (and) dice through your neutral zone by himself and go one on-one-on against a defenceman who's standing still. That can't happen.\n\n\"But there are aspects of those tweaks against Nashville that will certainly apply to this series. I think there is some crossover. Nashville was a great team. We did a good job against them and hopefully we do the same (against Edmonton). But McDavid and Draisaitl, even (Zach) Hyman, I mean, they're a different animal, for sure.\"\n\nThe Canucks started the season as an offensive dynamo, too.\n\nThey led the NHL in scoring through the first half of the season, averaging 3.9 goals per game. But as their offence lost a full goal per game over the second half of the season due to several factors, including the Canucks' struggling power play and a market correction in their historic shooting percentage, the team was forced to embrace the defensive ideals pushed by coach Rick Tocchet and his staff as a means of winning.\n\nVancouver transformed in the second half of the season into one of the league's best defensive teams, even if their 10-best goals-against (2.80) didn't fully reflect this. They allowed just 26.1 shots against per game after the all-star break, while generating 56 per cent of scoring chances.\n\nThis defensive stoutness is the identity the Canucks carried into Nashville, where they won all three road playoff games.\n\n\"We're all on the same page,\" checking centre Teddy Blueger said. \"Obviously, we had the whole year to dial in the system and make some tweaks and adjustments. And playing together, building some chemistry that way... I think that stuff is a little more dialled in towards the end of the year. I think we executed well (against Nashville). But I also think part of it is the way that series developed. It just seemed like a very cagey, defensive series where we had to be patient.\"\n\nVancouver's defence was better than Nashville's. And the Canucks' defence, especially after the dynamic top-pairing of Quinn Hughes and Filip Hronek, is as big as anyone's.\n\nThe bottom four of Zadorov, Cole (6-1, 225 pounds), Tyler Myers (6-8, 229) and Carson Soucy (6-5, 208) average six-foot-five and 228 pounds. That's a lot of reach with which to defend, a lot of heft with which to protect the front of the Vancouver net, which the Canucks did as well against the Predators as they have all season.\n\n\"Yeah, it's fair to say,\" Tocchet said. \"I think all year the D has been somewhat of a fabric of our team -- the way we play defence. But I thought they did a great job with the interior. They did a really good job of protecting the high-danger, interior stuff. I thought that was probably their best.\"\n\nIt was apparent against the Predators why general manager Patrik Allvin rebuilt the Canuck defence the way he did, signing Cole and Soucy as free agents last summer and acquiring Zadorov in a November trade from Calgary.\n\nThe Vegas Golden Knights won last year's Stanley Cup with a defence nearly identical in size, although Zadorov noted Tuesday there are some fundamental differences, including the zone system Vegas employs compared to the Canucks' hybrid model in the defensive zone.\n\nBut one common denominator is how hard the defencemen battle to win pucks and protect the slot.\n\n\"Does size matter? Sure,\" Cole said. \"Longer limbs, longer legs, longer reach -- all these things are important for sure. But I think you need to pair that size with battle-level and desperation otherwise... I mean, there's plenty of big guys in the league. But are you able to win battles with your size? Are you able to go in hard and box out and do the things that help you capitalize on your size? And I think that's what we've done much better.\"", "source": {"uri": "sportsnet.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportsnet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "iain_macintyre@sportsnet.ca", "name": "Iain

The victory was a celebration for a long-suffering fan base and set up a western Canada grudge match that promises to be intense and filled with polite, cordial social media interaction.\n\nBefore the puck drops on an epic second-round series, we wanted to look back at how each Canucks player contributed to Vancouver's six-game victory over the Nashville Predators in the first round. We profiled the forwards on Monday, and today we'll get into each individual defender and goaltender who appeared in more than one game in the Predators series.\n\nQuinn Hughes: B+\n\n6 GP, 0 goals + 5 assists = 5 points\n\nThere were moments in the first round when Hughes looked to be battling through it.\n\nRun by the Predators repeatedly, with Nashville's physical fourth line making a point of finishing its checks in particular, Hughes' minutes were sharply reduced in the middle of Vancouver's first-round series. He appeared to be winded briefly in Game 4, and concerns mounted about Hughes' health and status, especially as Vancouver struggled to generate offence.\n\nThrough it all, Hughes just went about his business, controlling play ably and conducting the game from the back end. In Game 4, Hughes made an impossible play to keep the puck alive at the blue line and convert what should've been a clear into a key game-tying goal. In Games 5 and 6, Hughes was back to being the most impactful skater on the ice for either team.\n\nThe only meaningful blemish for Hughes in Round 1 was the frequency with which his shot attempts didn't end up on goal; only nine of Hughes' 36 attempts reached Juuse Saros for a shot on goal.\n\nHughes' work will be essential if Vancouver is going to upset the Oilers in Round 2. And he proved in Round 1 that he won't be dissuaded from taking over the game, no matter how frequently or how hard he gets hit in the process.\n\nNikita Zadorov: A\n\n6 GP, 2 goals + 1 assists = 3 points\n\nZadorov was a two-way monster and emerged as the Canucks' best defenceman besides Hughes in Round 1.\n\nThe hulking 6-foot-6 Russian defender contributed in nearly every facet of the game. He delivered bone-crushing hits, defended the interior well, ably moved pucks and was an ace on the penalty kill, using his long reach and competitiveness to win battles. The Canucks controlled a dominant 65 percent share of scoring chances during Zadorov's five-on-five shifts. He was on the ice for just nine high-danger chances against for the entire series at even strength. On top of that, he chipped in offensively with two goals and an assist.\n\nZadorov was rewarded for his strong performance with a significant uptick in his ice time. He averaged 20:20 in Round 1, which is substantially higher than the 16:30 he averaged from the All-Star break to the end of the regular season. This dream playoff start is making him a fan favourite in Vancouver, with many fans already clamouring for him to be an offseason extension priority.\n\nFilip Hronek: C+\n\n6 GP, 0 goals + 0 assists = 0 points\n\nHronek's minutes were down at five-on-five in Round 1. Zadorov played top-line minutes and Hronek was given second-pair deployment, despite mostly still skating on Hughes' right side.\n\nThe underlying numbers for the Hughes-Hronek pair were excellent against the Predators, as they typically are, but Hronek's impact felt muted in the series. The Predators seemed to win more than their share of 50/50 battles against Hronek on the wall, and offensively, Hronek was quiet. The Canucks' top right-handed defender only managed four shots on goal in the first round, didn't seem to be as dynamic a playmaker from the blue-line in and rarely transitioned the puck as the Vancouver offence stagnated.\n\nIn some ways, it was a continuation of a larger offensive slump Hronek appeared to hit in the second half of the season. Dating back 45 games now, including playoffs, Hronek has managed just two goals and 12 total points.\n\nEven as Hronek remains an exceptional fit on Hughes' right side and a solid two-way contributor, the Canucks will likely need him to find the level he hit early in the season if they're going to get by Edmonton (and, if they do, whichever of Dallas or Colorado await in the conference finals).\n\nIan Cole: B+\n\n6 GP, 0 goals + 1 assists = 1 points\n\nThere were times down the stretch when you wondered if age and fatigue were catching up to Cole. He was such a steady bottom-four presence in the first half of the season, but he looked just a tad slower and more mistake-prone in the second half. Heck, with Noah Juulsen's sturdy play, some wondered about a month ago if he should get a shot in the playoffs as the No. 6 defenceman over Cole.\n\nBut then Round 1 rolled around and Cole reminded everybody how valuable he is as a savvy, veteran blue-line presence.\n\nCole was a rock on the penalty kill, even paying the price with a shot block off his face. He did an excellent job clogging the middle defensively and disrupting backdoor passing lanes. He was calm and poised escaping pressure and making plays on the breakout, even though he still had the occasional giveaway. And, of course, playing alongside Zadorov, Cole's underlying numbers were sterling and included a 4-2 edge in five-on-five goals.\n\nCarson Soucy: C+\n\n5 GP, 0 goals + 1 assist = 1 point\n\nSoucy emerged as Vancouver's third most important defender for long stretches of this dream Canucks campaign, but found himself playing third-pair minutes and spending a lot of time hemmed in his own end in the first round.\n\nThe stalwart defender continued to impact the game with his smart defensive positioning and long reach. He remains the best friend of Canucks defenders for the way he minds the back door. But the Soucy-Tyler Myers pair really struggled in transition and the Canucks generated next to nothing in terms of shots or scoring chances when they were on the ice.\n\nUltimately, for all of the time spent defending, the Canucks didn't give up much with Soucy on at five-on-five. His defensive game held up in Round 1, even if it wasn't always pretty.\n\nAgainst a team with the level of finishing talent that Edmonton has, however, Vancouver's ostensible second pair has to start playing more frequently in the offensive end of the rink, or it's going to get burned.\n\nTyler Myers: B\n\n5 GP, 0 goals + 0 assists = 0 points\n\nRemember how Myers was a whipping boy for his mistake-filled game at the start of the season? Now he's a steady, indispensable part of the Canucks' blue line. Life moves quickly.\n\nMyers has all but eliminated the panicked, glaring giveaways on breakout attempts that used to haunt him -- he's making calmer, smarter decisions on defensive zone retrievals. He isn't chasing the play defensively, pulling himself out of position or making ill-timed pinches that leave him caught up ice. Myers is suddenly defensively reliable in a top-four role without these big, costly mistakes.\n\nMyers' pair got hemmed in the defensive zone for many shifts (it controlled just 37 percent of five-on-five shot attempts) in Round 1, but he was tagged for just one five-on-five goal against for the entire series. It was a bend-but-don't-break style where he defended the slot well and won net-front battles to limit Nashville's offensive damage significantly. Myers was also a standout on the penalty kill.\n\nJuulsen had to step in for Game 2 when Myers was ill. Filip Forsberg mercilessly torched Juulsen for a goal, which underscored just how important Myers has become.\n\nArturs Silovs: A+\n\n2-1-0 record, .931 save percentage\n\nImagine if you told somebody in October that Silovs would be the hero to clinch a Canucks playoff series win. These are the beautiful, completely unexpected storylines we all watch sports for.\n\nSilovs outdueled Juuse Saros from Games 4 to 6. He was steady and confident in Games 4 and 5 before delivering a sensational 28-save shutout in Game 6. Silovs' rebound control was on point; he flashed explosive athleticism and was surprisingly quick at reacting to broken plays in front of him. The Canucks deserve credit for defending cross-seam passes so he didn't have to make near-impossible backdoor saves, but he passed the test against virtually every other scoring chance type.\n\nBesides the physical tools, Silovs looks ready for the big moment mentally. It's as if his affable, happy-go-lucky personality rejects pressure and nerves. He's down to Earth but has swagger on and off the ice.\n\nConsidering how much the Canucks scuffled offensively, there's no way they would have advanced past Nashville without Silovs' heroics in net.\n\nCasey DeSmith: A\n\n1-1-0 record, .911 save percentage\n\nConsidering his shaky play down the stretch, it was fair to wonder what version of DeSmith was going to show up once Thatcher Demko went down with an injury.\n\nGame 2 was a tough outing, through little fault of his own, as the Predators opened the scoring with a laughably unlucky deflection just over a minute into the first period. You couldn't blame him for getting beat by a wicked play by Forsberg in tight or Colton Sissons' second-period goal after a Canucks turnover either. Yet at the end of the night, three goals on 15 shots wasn't a pretty stat line.\n\nDeSmith redeemed himself with an excellent Game 3 performance, stopping 29 of 30 shots to help the Canucks squeak out a 2-1 victory despite registering just 12 shots. He more than capably held down the fort when called upon until, of course, his injury forced Silovs into the crease.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

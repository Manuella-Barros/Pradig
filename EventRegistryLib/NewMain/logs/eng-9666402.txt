France won seven of the teams' last eight meetings including home and away victories in qualifying. This buildup has been overshadowed by speculation about whether France star Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 can play after breaking his nose in the opening win over Austria. Kickoff is at 9 p.m. local (1900 GMT) on Friday. Here's what to know about the match:\n\nMatch facts\n\n-- Mbapp\u00e9 broke his nose when his face collided with Austria defender Kevin Danso's shoulder on Monday. Blood stained his white France jersey. If he plays on Friday, he'll need to wear a mask. But it remains uncertain. Mbapp\u00e9 returned to light training on Wednesday.\n\n-- If he does play, the France captain will hope to finally score at a European Championship at the sixth attempt. Mbapp\u00e9 has 47 goals in 80 games for France, including 12 in qualifying for the Euros, but he's yet to score in five games at the tournament.\n\n-- France and the Netherlands are level on three points in Group D. The Dutch came from behind to beat Poland 2-1 and France needed an own goal to beat Austria 1-0.\n\n-- France defeated the Netherlands 4-0 at home and 2-1 away in qualifying. The Dutch were group runners-up.\n\n-- Dutch forward Xavi Simons will be back in Leipzig, where he played last season on loan from Paris Saint-Germain. The 21-year-old Xavi scored eight goals in 32 Bundesliga appearances to help Leipzig finish fourth. The German club hopes he'll be back next season. He has already played 15 games for the Netherlands.\n\n-- The Netherlands won Euro '88 with current coach Ronald Koeman in the team alongside the brilliant trio of Ruud Gullit, Marco van Basten and Frank Rijkaard, who played together for AC Milan.\n\n-- The Dutch won their three group games in the last edition, then lost to the Czech Republic in the round of 16.\n\n-- France won Euro '84 as host, then - with Didier Deschamps as captain - Euro 2000 after he captained the team to the World Cup title as host in 1998. Deschamps took over as France coach in 2012 and led France to another World Cup title in 2018.\n\n-- Other group memberrs Austria and Poland play earlier Friday in Berlin.\n\nTeam news\n\n-- France's biggest question mark is Mbapp\u00e9. Deschamps was due to give an injury update on Thursday.\n\n-- Netherlands midfielders Frenkie de Jong and Teun Koopmeiners were ruled out with injuries before the tournament.\n\nBy the numbers\n\n-- Altogether, France has won 15 of the teams' 30 previous meetings, with the Dutch winning 11. The Dutch have scored more goals in those games; 57 to 53.\n\n-- In the last four major tournaments -- World Cups and European Championships -- France has reached the final in three. The exception was the 2021 Euros, where Deschamps' team went out to Switzerland on penalties at the first knockout stage after squandering a two-goal lead with nine minutes remaining.\n\n-- France defeated Gibraltar 14-0 for a new European Championship qualifying record and the country's biggest win.\n\nWhat they're saying\n\n\"All the people walking the streets in orange, and of course, here in the stadium, fantastic, beautiful. I've always dreamed of this and so far, it definitely hasn't disappointed.\" -- Netherlands goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen.\n\n\"Our last meetings against the Netherlands go back a bit, but I remember our solidity, our ability to make the differences in attack. We knew how to be efficient, and we'll need to do that again on Friday. Above all, we'll have to have the same intensity as we did against Austria. It's an essential ingredient to go as far as possible in this competition.\" -- France midfielder Adrien Rabiot.\n\nAP Euro 2024: https://apnews.com/hub/euro-2024", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ciaran_fahey@eagletribune.com", "name": "Ciar\u00e1n Fahey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Danso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Danso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wout_Weghorst", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wout Weghorst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didier_Deschamps", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Didier Deschamps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi_Simons", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xavi Simons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruud_Gullit", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ruud Gullit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Rijkaard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frank Rijkaard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_van_Basten", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marco van Basten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xavi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

France won seven of the teams' last eight meetings including home and away victories in qualifying. This buildup has been overshadowed by speculation about whether France star Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 can play after breaking his nose in the opening win over Austria. Kickoff is at 9 p.m. local (1900 GMT) on Friday. Here's what to know about the match:\n\nMatch facts\n\n-- Mbapp\u00e9 broke his nose when his face collided with Austria defender Kevin Danso's shoulder on Monday. Blood stained his white France jersey. He'll need to wear a mask if he plays.\n\n-- If he does play, the France captain will hope to finally score at a European Championship at the sixth attempt. Mbapp\u00e9 has 47 goals in 80 games for France, including 12 in qualifying for the Euros, but he's yet to score in five games at the tournament.\n\n-- France and the Netherlands are level on three points in Group D. The Dutch came from behind to beat Poland 2-1 and France needed an own goal to beat Austria 1-0.\n\n-- France defeated the Netherlands 4-0 at home and 2-1 away in qualifying. The Dutch were group runners-up.\n\n-- Dutch forward Xavi Simons will be back in Leipzig, where he played last season on loan from Paris Saint-Germain. The 21-year-old Xavi scored eight goals in 32 Bundesliga appearances to help Leipzig finish fourth. The German club hopes he'll be back next season. He has already played 15 games for the Netherlands.\n\n-- The Netherlands won Euro '88 with current coach Ronald Koeman in the team alongside the brilliant trio of Ruud Gullit, Marco van Basten and Frank Rijkaard, who played together for AC Milan.\n\n-- The Dutch won their three group games in the last edition, then lost to the Czech Republic in the round of 16.\n\n-- France won Euro '84 as host, then -- with Didier Deschamps as captain -- Euro 2000 after he captained the team to the World Cup title as host in 1998. Deschamps took over as France coach in 2012 and led France to another World Cup title in 2018.\n\n-- Other group members Austria and Poland play earlier Friday in Berlin.\n\nTeam news\n\n-- Deschamps sounded optimistic on Thursday that Mbapp\u00e9 will be available. The France captain trained with the rest of his teammates on the eve of the match while wearing a blue, white and red face-mask. \"Everything is evolving in the right direction,\" Deschamps said. \"We'll do all we can to ensure that he'll be available tomorrow.\"\n\n-- Netherlands midfielders Frenkie de Jong and Teun Koopmeiners were ruled out with injuries before the tournament. Koeman had no new injury worries on the eve on the match.\n\nBy the numbers\n\n-- Altogether, France has won 15 of the teams' 30 previous meetings, with the Dutch winning 11. The Dutch have scored more goals in those games, 57 to 53.\n\n-- In the last four major tournaments -- World Cups and European Championships -- France has reached the final in three. The exception was at the pandemic-delayed Euros in 2021, where Deschamps' team went out to Switzerland on penalties at the first knockout stage after squandering a two-goal lead with nine minutes remaining.\n\n-- France defeated Gibraltar 14-0 for a new European Championship qualifying record and the country's biggest win.\n\nWhat they're saying\n\n\"All the people walking the streets in orange, and of course, here in the stadium, fantastic, beautiful. I've always dreamed of this and so far, it definitely hasn't disappointed.\" -- Netherlands goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen.\n\n\"I can't predict everything, but I have a good feeling. Our preparations have been good. We've got 26 players who are all in good shape. So, for us this much is a challenge. This (France) team has been playing together for a long time. They played more international matches than we have. The three points against Poland give us a bit of breathing space. We can be calm now.\" - Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman.\n\n\"Our last meetings against the Netherlands go back a bit, but I remember our solidity, our ability to make the differences in attack. We knew how to be efficient, and we'll need to do that again on Friday. Above all, we'll have to have the same intensity as we did against Austria.

Former champions France and the Netherlands clash in their second match at the European Championship. France won seven of the teams' last eight meetings including home and away victories in qualifying.\n\nLeipzig (Germany), Jun 20 (AP) Former champions France and the Netherlands clash in their second match at the European Championship. France won seven of the teams' last eight meetings including home and away victories in qualifying.\n\nThis buildup has been overshadowed by speculation about whether France star Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 can play after breaking his nose in the opening win over Austria. Kick-off is at 9 pm local (1900 GMT, 12.30 AM IST [Saturday]) on Friday. Here's what to know about the match:\n\nAlso Read | Slovenia vs Serbia, UEFA Euro 2024 Live Streaming and Match Time in IST: How to Watch Free Live Telecast of SVN vs SRB on TV and Online Stream Details of Football Match in India?.\n\nAlso Read | Hockey India Announces 27-Member Core Probable Group for National Men's Coaching Camp.\n\nMatch facts\n\n-- Mbapp\u00e9 broke his nose when his face collided with Austria defender Kevin Danso's shoulder on Monday. Blood stained his white France jersey. If he plays on Friday, he'll need to wear a mask. But, it remains uncertain. Mbapp\u00e9 returned to light training on Wednesday.\n\n-- If he plays, the France captain will hope to score at a European Championship at the sixth attempt. Mbapp\u00e9 has 47 goals in 80 games for France, including 12 in qualifying for the Euros, but he's yet to score in five games at the tournament.\n\n-- France and the Netherlands are level on three points in Group D. The Dutch came from behind to beat Poland 2-1 and France needed an own goal to beat Austria 1-0.\n\n-- France defeated the Netherlands 4-0 at home and 2-1 away in qualifying. The Dutch were group runners-up.\n\n-- Dutch forward Xavi Simons will be back in Leipzig, where he played last season on loan from Paris Saint-Germain. The 21-year-old Xavi scored eight goals in 32 Bundesliga appearances to help Leipzig finish fourth. The German club hopes he'll be back next season. He has already played 15 games for the Netherlands.\n\n-- The Netherlands won Euro '88 with current coach Ronald Koeman in the team alongside the brilliant trio of Ruud Gullit, Marco van Basten and Frank Rijkaard, who played for AC Milan.\n\n-- The Dutch won their three group games in the last edition, then lost to the Czech Republic in the round of 16.\n\n-- France won Euro '84 as host, then - with Didier Deschamps as captain - Euro 2000 after he captained the team to the World Cup title as host in 1998. Deschamps took over as France's coach in 2012, leading France to another World Cup title in 2018.\n\n-- Other group members Austria and Poland play earlier Friday in Berlin.\n\nTeam news\n\n-- France's biggest question mark is Mbapp\u00e9. Deschamps was due to give an injury update on Thursday.\n\n-- Netherlands midfielders Frenkie de Jong and Teun Koopmeiners were ruled out with injuries before the tournament.\n\nBy the numbers\n\n-- France has won 15 of the teams' 30 previous meetings, with the Dutch winning 11. The Dutch have scored more goals in those games; 57 to 53.\n\n-- In the last four major tournaments -- World Cups and European Championships -- France has reached the final in three. The exception was the 2021 Euros, where Deschamps' team went out to Switzerland on penalties in the first knockout stage after squandering a two-goal lead with nine minutes remaining.\n\n-- France defeated Gibraltar 14-0 for a new European Championship qualifying record and the country's biggest win.\n\nWhat they're saying\n\n\"All the people walking the streets in orange, and of course, here in the stadium, fantastic, beautiful. I've always dreamed of this and so far, it definitely hasn't disappointed.\" -- Netherlands goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen.\n\n\"Our last meetings against the Netherlands go back a bit, but I remember our solidity, our ability to make the differences in attack. We knew how to be efficient, and we'll need to do that again on Friday. Above all, we'll have to have the same intensity as we did against Austria.

France out to maintain dominance over Netherlands", "body": "LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) -- Former champions France and the Netherlands clash in their second match at the European Championship. France won seven of the teams' last eight meetings including home and away victories in qualifying. This buildup has been overshadowed by speculation about whether France star Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 can play after breaking his nose in the opening win over Austria. Kickoff is at 9 p.m. local (1900 GMT) on Friday. Here's what to know about the match:\n\nMatch facts\n\n-- Mbapp\u00e9 broke his nose when his face collided with Austria defender Kevin Danso's shoulder on Monday. Blood stained his white France jersey. If he plays on Friday, he'll need to wear a mask. But it remains uncertain. Mbapp\u00e9 returned to light training on Wednesday.\n\n-- If he does play, the France captain will hope to finally score at a European Championship at the sixth attempt. Mbapp\u00e9 has 47 goals in 80 games for France, including 12 in qualifying for the Euros, but he's yet to score in five games at the tournament.\n\n-- France and the Netherlands are level on three points in Group D. The Dutch came from behind to beat Poland 2-1 and France needed an own goal to beat Austria 1-0.\n\n-- France defeated the Netherlands 4-0 at home and 2-1 away in qualifying. The Dutch were group runners-up.\n\n-- Dutch forward Xavi Simons will be back in Leipzig, where he played last season on loan from Paris Saint-Germain. The 21-year-old Xavi scored eight goals in 32 Bundesliga appearances to help Leipzig finish fourth. The German club hopes he'll be back next season. He has already played 15 games for the Netherlands.\n\n-- The Netherlands won Euro '88 with current coach Ronald Koeman in the team alongside the brilliant trio of Ruud Gullit, Marco van Basten and Frank Rijkaard, who played together for AC Milan.\n\n-- The Dutch won their three group games in the last edition, then lost to the Czech Republic in the round of 16.\n\n-- France won Euro '84 as host, then - with Didier Deschamps as captain - Euro 2000 after he captained the team to the World Cup title as host in 1998. Deschamps took over as France coach in 2012 and led France to another World Cup title in 2018.\n\n-- Other group memberrs Austria and Poland play earlier Friday in Berlin.\n\nTeam news\n\n-- France's biggest question mark is Mbapp\u00e9. Deschamps was due to give an injury update on Thursday.\n\n-- Netherlands midfielders Frenkie de Jong and Teun Koopmeiners were ruled out with injuries before the tournament.\n\nBy the numbers\n\n-- Altogether, France has won 15 of the teams' 30 previous meetings, with the Dutch winning 11. The Dutch have scored more goals in those games; 57 to 53.\n\n-- In the last four major tournaments -- World Cups and European Championships -- France has reached the final in three. The exception was the 2021 Euros, where Deschamps' team went out to Switzerland on penalties at the first knockout stage after squandering a two-goal lead with nine minutes remaining.\n\n-- France defeated Gibraltar 14-0 for a new European Championship qualifying record and the country's biggest win.\n\nWhat they're saying\n\n\"All the people walking the streets in orange, and of course, here in the stadium, fantastic, beautiful. I've always dreamed of this and so far, it definitely hasn't disappointed.\" -- Netherlands goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen.\n\n\"Our last meetings against the Netherlands go back a bit, but I remember our solidity, our ability to make the differences in attack.

France out to maintain dominance over Netherlands - WTOP News", "body": "LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) -- Former champions France and the Netherlands clash in their second match at the European Championship. France won seven of the teams' last eight meetings including home and away victories in qualifying. This buildup has been overshadowed by speculation about whether France star Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 can play after breaking his nose in the opening win over Austria. Kickoff is at 9 p.m. local (1900 GMT) on Friday. Here's what to know about the match:\n\n-- Mbapp\u00e9 broke his nose when his face collided with Austria defender Kevin Danso's shoulder on Monday. Blood stained his white France jersey. If he plays on Friday, he'll need to wear a mask. But it remains uncertain. Mbapp\u00e9 returned to light training on Wednesday.\n\n-- If he does play, the France captain will hope to finally score at a European Championship at the sixth attempt. Mbapp\u00e9 has 47 goals in 80 games for France, including 12 in qualifying for the Euros, but he's yet to score in five games at the tournament.\n\n-- France and the Netherlands are level on three points in Group D. The Dutch came from behind to beat Poland 2-1 and France needed an own goal to beat Austria 1-0.\n\n-- France defeated the Netherlands 4-0 at home and 2-1 away in qualifying. The Dutch were group runners-up.\n\n-- Dutch forward Xavi Simons will be back in Leipzig, where he played last season on loan from Paris Saint-Germain. The 21-year-old Xavi scored eight goals in 32 Bundesliga appearances to help Leipzig finish fourth. The German club hopes he'll be back next season. He has already played 15 games for the Netherlands.\n\n-- The Netherlands won Euro '88 with current coach Ronald Koeman in the team alongside the brilliant trio of Ruud Gullit, Marco van Basten and Frank Rijkaard, who played together for AC Milan.\n\n-- The Dutch won their three group games in the last edition, then lost to the Czech Republic in the round of 16.\n\n-- France won Euro '84 as host, then - with Didier Deschamps as captain - Euro 2000 after he captained the team to the World Cup title as host in 1998. Deschamps took over as France coach in 2012 and led France to another World Cup title in 2018.\n\n-- Other group memberrs Austria and Poland play earlier Friday in Berlin.\n\n-- France's biggest question mark is Mbapp\u00e9. Deschamps was due to give an injury update on Thursday.\n\n-- Netherlands midfielders Frenkie de Jong and Teun Koopmeiners were ruled out with injuries before the tournament.\n\n-- Altogether, France has won 15 of the teams' 30 previous meetings, with the Dutch winning 11. The Dutch have scored more goals in those games; 57 to 53.\n\n-- In the last four major tournaments -- World Cups and European Championships -- France has reached the final in three. The exception was the 2021 Euros, where Deschamps' team went out to Switzerland on penalties at the first knockout stage after squandering a two-goal lead with nine minutes remaining.\n\n-- France defeated Gibraltar 14-0 for a new European Championship qualifying record and the country's biggest win.\n\n\"All the people walking the streets in orange, and of course, here in the stadium, fantastic, beautiful. I've always dreamed of this and so far, it definitely hasn't disappointed.\" -- Netherlands goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen.\n\n\"Our last meetings against the Netherlands go back a bit, but I remember our solidity, our ability to make the differences in attack. We knew how to be efficient, and we'll need to do that again on Friday. Above all, we'll have to have the same intensity as we did against Austria. It's an essential ingredient to go as far as possible in this competition.\" -- France midfielder Adrien Rabiot.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

All odds are provided by our best-reviewed football betting sites. Odds are subject to change.\n\nAs soon as the draw for the Euro 2024 group stage was made, this fixture stood out. The Netherlands and France both have ambitions of going all the way this summer, and Friday's contest gives us a chance to see the pair butt heads with three points on the line.\n\nBoth teams got off to winning starts on matchday one. The Netherlands came from a goal down to beat Poland 2-1, with Wout Weghorst coming off the bench to notch a late winner.\n\nFrance were also triumphant by a slender margin. A Max Wober own goal was the only one that was scored in their game against Austria, who gave les Bleus plenty to think about.\n\nThe biggest talking point after the match was not France's win but an injury suffered by Kylian Mbappe. After a collision in the Austrian penalty area, the superstar forward went down clutching his face. He had to be taken off and scans later confirmed that Mbappe had broken his nose.\n\nNeedless to say, that is bad news for France. The hope is that the attacker will still be fit to play a part in Germany, but it is hard to see him returning before the round of 16 at the absolute earliest. Mbappe will certainly not be available for this clash in Leipzig.\n\nMbappe was not at his very best last time out. He missed what was, by his standards, an easy one-on-one opportunity, extending his wait for a first goal at a European Championship.\n\nEven so, Mbappe was still the man who looked most likely to make an impact in the final third. Indeed, he was the author of a tricky piece of play down the right that led to Wober's own goal. France are a poorer outfit without him in it.\n\nCan the Netherlands take advantage of Mbappe's absence on Friday night, or will Didier Deschamps' side find a way to win? A victory would send either team through with a game to spare, a prize very much worth fighting for.\n\nThe Netherlands and France will go head-to-head in a top-of-the-table clash in Group D.\n\nIt would be wrong to describe France as a one-man team. They arguably have the strongest squad in the tournament, with a group of attackers that in addition to Mbappe includes Randal Kolo Muani, Ousmane Dembele, Marcus Thuram, Olivier Giroud, Kingsley Coman and more.\n\nYet France's system has been built to get the best out of Mbappe. Deschamps has a tendency towards caution. He has always ensured his team has a solid foundation to build from.\n\nIn the attacking part of the pitch, as is common in the international game, France do not have elaborate routines or patterns. It is instead a case of their star men (and usually Mbappe) being given the freedom to produce a moment of magic.\n\nWithout the 25-year-old, the Netherlands will be much more confident of keeping France's attack quiet. The centre-back partnership comprising Virgil van Dijk and Stefan de Vrij is a solid one anyway. The Dutch can avoid defeat by the joint-favourites.\n\n\u26bd Choose a Netherlands win or draw at 11/18 with VBET \u26bd\n\nA draw would not be a bad result for either team here and you have to wonder how much Deschamps and Ronald Koeman will be willing to go all-out for victory if the score is level midway through the second half.\n\nDeschamps is by nature a pragmatic tactician, but he will adopt even more of a defence-first mindset now that Mbapppe is out. France's priority will be to keep things tight at the back before hitting the Netherlands on the break.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, we will see just how adept this Dutch team is at prising open a top-class backline.\n\nThey created plenty of chances against Poland, but this is obviously a much tougher test of their attacking credentials.\n\nEverything suggests this will be an enjoyable game to watch, but that does not mean it will be full of goals.\n\n\u26bd Back under 2.5 goals at 6/7 with VBET \u26bd\n\nKoeman has a decision to make at the top of the pitch.\n\nMemphis Depay was disappointing as the line-leader against Poland. In the clash with France, his manager may be tempted to use him as a second striker or out wide in order to accommodate Weghorst.\n\nThe one-time Manchester United frontman is a pain to play against. He has a habit of changing games from the bench: many will remember his remarkable impact as a substitute against Argentina at the last World Cup.\n\nWeghorst is not the prettiest footballer, but he provides the Dutch with a focal point. That could be particularly useful given France's centre-backs are both strong and physical. Weghorst will be able to compete with Dayot Upamecano and William Saliba.\n\nEven if he does not start, we should see him get a fair few minutes off the bench.\n\n\u26bd Tip Wout Weghorst to score any time at 16/5 with Betfred \u26bd\n\nCommercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to talkSPORT. 18+.

We played very well but were not able to find the net.\n\n\"It was dangerous for us but we were lucky and we scored a second goal... I think the final result increased our confidence today.\"\n\nHe added: \"I've not been thinking of the next line-up, it's weird to think about that, we've just finished this match.\n\n\"I don't know the line-up for the next match. We had to play for about an hour, then we tried with Donyell and Jeremie, fast and pacy. We decided we wanted to have new players like Donyell and Jeremie.\n\n\"France have more qualities than Poland, they play with a different style, spaces will be different. That match of course we want to win as well, we want to beat them and that will be our focus.\"\n\nDeschamps was pleased enough with the opening win, even if he admitted they could have done better.\n\nHe said: \"It's always good to start off with a win against an opponent that is very good, with a lot of athletic qualities, who put a lot of pressure on us.\n\n\"We could have managed certain situations better, but overall I would assess the match as a positive.\n\n\"We had to fight. And this is important. We need to keep that up for the rest of the tournament.\n\n\"I'm satisfied with our first victory. We have 36 hours now to recuperate.\n\n\"I don't think the computer was very nice to us.\"\n\nFrance could find it difficult to find the back of the net without their talisman, though we expect that talent to still come to the fore.\n\nThat being said, the Dutch are no pushovers and will make a fair go of it, we just don't see them having enough to get a result.\n\nNetherlands 1-2 France\n\nYes,

France worked hard against Austria for their 1-0 win and although it wasn't perfect, Deschamps will be delighted with the performance N'Golo Kante put in as he rolled back the years in midfield. The defensive solidity a peak Kante provides is what Les Bleus need if they're going to win this competition.\n\nThis should be a very exciting game as both teams will go all-out for the win and try to entertain as they already have three points on the board.

We're here to share our 2024 Euros odds series, make a Netherlands-France prediction, and pick while showing you how to watch.\n\nThe Netherlands are coming off a 2-1 win over Poland. After trailing 1-0 early, Cody Gapko got his team on the board with an equalizer in the 29th minute. Then, the Dutch finished things off with a goal from Wout Weghorst. The Netherlands fired off 20 shots, including five that hit the target.\n\nThe French are coming off a 1-0 win over Austria. Miraculously, France's only score came on an own goal, as Maximilian Wober put the ball in his own net to give the French the 1-0 lead. France still had 14 shots, with three hitting the target. Yet, none of their own strikes went into the net.\n\nThe countries have had a storied history. Ultimately, France has won 16 matches while the Netherlands has won 11. The countries played to three draws. Recently, France defeated the Netherlands 2-1 in the 2023 Qualifiers.\n\nThe Dutch are routinely in the tournament and will be a contender to battle the French. Overall, this is their 10th appearance in the Euros and they will try and stay with France.\n\nManager Ronald Koeman wants his squad ready to play. Ultimately, that means ensuring they are ready on defense. Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen looks to keep things steady. Meanwhile, his defense hopes to help him out.\n\nVirgil van Dijk of Liverpool is the best defender, along with Nathan Ake of Manchester City. Then, there is Denzel Dumfries of Inter Milan. Daley Blind of Girona can also make a defense. Unfortunately, the Dutch will not have Jurrien Timber from Arsenal as he has a torn ACL.\n\nBut the player to watch is Frenkie de Jong of Barcelona. Yet, he is working back from an ankle injury. Jerdy Schouten thrived with four goals in 28 matches in the PSV.\n\nThe forwards have some question marks. Substantially, Xavi Simons had eight goals and 11 assists over 32 matches for RB Leipzig. Simons also added two goals and two assists over eight Champions League matchups. Unfortunately, he did not score in any of the qualifiers. But Gapko came through the opener and he will answer the call if the others fail.\n\nThe Netherlands will win if they can make good connections on their passes and avoid mistakes. Then, they must stop Mbappe and Giroud.\n\nWhy France Will Win\n\nThe French are the overwhelming favorites to win it all. But first, they must take care of the Group Stage and that includes the Netherlands. Manager Didier Deschamp believes he has the perfect squad to do it.\n\nGoalkeeper Mike Maignan of AC Milan is coming back from a thigh injury, and it might hinder his performance. Thus, he might need more help from his defense. Defender William Saliba will be key in this showdown, as will Ibrahima Konate. But there will also be eyes on Theo Hernandez and if he can make some good plays on the pitch.\n\nAdrien Rabiot leads the midfield. Likewise, there is Antoine Griezmann of Atletico Madrid, who can certainly make an impact. He had one goal in two matches.\n\nOlivier Giroud is 38 years old. Yet, he can still make an impact on the pitch. Mbappe is not expected to play in this battle after breaking his nose in the opener. Unfortunately, that is concerning because he scored the only two goals in the last battle so someone else will have to step up. While the squad is designing a custom mask for him, he may need to sit out a minimum period before he suits up again.\n\nFrance had its share of success despite not scoring a goal. The 88 percent passing accuracy was exceptional. However, France only had a 49 percent possession rate and a 47 percent tackle success rate. France also managed only two corner kicks.\n\nFrance will win this matchup if their midfielders and strikers can create plays and outrun the Netherlands. The possession rate must improve.\n\nFinal Netherlands-France Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Netherlands is the biggest challenge to the French in the Group Stage. However, the talent level is much larger on the French side. While the Dutch have the ability to stay with France, they will ultimately fall short. Expect France to trickle a goal or two thanks to the amazing talents of Mbappe and Giroud before they hold on for a big win in the second match of the Group Stage. France is the pick here and the one to hold off the Netherlands.\n\nClick here for more betting news & predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"},

All the pregame talk has been about Kylian Mbappe's fitness after suffering a broken nose in the narrow opening win over Austria while both sides secured maximum points in their opening games. Didier Deschamps' men edged a 1-0 success while Ronald Koeman's side came from behind to win 2-1 against Poland with those two meeting in the earlier game.\n\nCody Gakpo and Wout Weghorst's goals undid Adam Buksa's opener for Oranje while Maximilian Wober's own goal after some dazzling play from Mbappe was enough for the French. The Dutch have had injury issues of their own such as losing Frenkie de Jong and Teun Koopmeiners just before the tournament but there is still plenty of quality on both sides. A Netherlands win would guarantee a top two finish having scored more than France already.\n\nThese two met in qualifying with France winning 4-0 in Paris and 2-1 in Amsterdam thanks to Mbappe's brilliance. Les Bleus might be deprived of that and their skipper, though, after his broken nose makes him a doubt for Friday's encounter. How Deschamps handles that in attack will be critical but if any nation has the strength in depth and quality to cope it is the 2018 FIFA World Cup winners. Seven wins out of eight games vs. Netherlands s also a very good record to hold coming into this matchup.\n\nHere's our storylines, how you can watch the match and more:\n\nGolazo Starting XI Newsletter Get your Soccer Fix from Around the Globe Your ultimate guide to the Beautiful Game as our experts take you beyond the pitch and around the globe with news that matters.\n\nI agree to receive the \"Golazo Starting XI Newsletter\" and marketing communications, updates, special offers (including partner offers), and other information from CBS Sports and the Paramount family of companies.

A draw will not confirm that status here, but it will position both well to advance and would arguably suit both. A loss for either is not disastrous given their final games are winnable but both will be wary of how close Poland and Austria were capable of pushing their opponents in the opening games.\n\nTeamMPWDLGFGAPTSNetherlands\n\n1\n\n0\n\n13France\n\n1\n\n0\n\n03Austria\n\n0\n\n10Poland\n\n0\n\n1\n\n20\n\nJune 16\n\nNetherlands 2, Poland 1\n\nJune 17\n\nAustria 0, France 1\n\nJune 21\n\nPoland vs. Austria, 12 p.m. on FS1\n\nNetherlands vs. France, 3 p.m. on Fox\n\nJune 25\n\nNetherlands vs. Austria, 12 p.m. on FS1\n\nFrance vs. Poland, 12 p.m. on Fox\n\nTeam news\n\nNetherlands: Brian Brobbey is training so Koeman should have a full squad to pick from although Joey Veerman's yellow card means that a one-game ban could come into effect if he is booked again here. Weghorst could start but Memphis Depay is still the most likely to lead the line for the time being.\n\nPossible Netherlands XI: Verbruggen; Dumfries, De Vrij, Van Dijk, Ake; Schouten, Veerman; Simons, Reijnders, Gakpo; Depay.\n\nFrance: Mbappe's fitness is the big topic in the French camp with a protective mask required if the French superstar and captain is to play on in Germany. Deschamps is likely to go with Olivier Giroud who came on against Austria to make his seventh different international tournament appearance. Eduardo Camavinga and Aurelien Tchouameni could be passed fit but N'Golo Kante should keep his startying role after a superb showing in Dusseldorf.\n\nPossible France XI: Maignan; Kounde, Saliba, Upamecano, Hernandez; Kante, Rabiot; Dembele, Griezmann, Thuram; Giroud.\n\nPrediction\n\nThis one is likely to be tight with a draw highly possible but Les Bleus generally tend to specialize in grinding out results when needed in big tournaments and that could be the case again here.

Prediction, odds, favorites and expert tips for top goal scorer award\n\nThere are no major injury concerns for Ronald Koeman and the Netherlands.\n\nWout Weghorst made a strong case for being elevated to the starting lineup when he starred as the match-winner against Poland, but the former Wolfsburg and Manchester United target man is likely to be an impact sub once more as Memphis Depay leads the line. Memphis is just five goals behind Robin van Persie's all-time Netherlands record of 50 international goals.\n\nNetherlands projected starting lineup: (4-2-3-1, right to left): Verbruggen (GK) -- Dumfries, De Vrij, Van Dijk, Ake -- Veerman, Wijnaldum -- Simons, Reijnders, Gakpo, -- Depay\n\nThe big concerns for France are the fitness of star men Kylian Mbappe and Antoine Griezmann. Mbappe is unlikely to be risked with his broken nose.\n\nGriezmann feels like more of a 50/50 call, but if the attacking playmaker stands down it will give a reportedly disgruntled Warren Zaire-Emery some game time.\n\nDidier Deschamps is expected to give the nod to Randal Kolo Muani ahead of veteran striker Olivier Giroud if Mbappe misses out.\n\nFrance projected starting lineup: (4-3-3, right to left): Maignan (GK) -- Kounde, Upamecano, Saliba, Hernandez -- Rabiot, Kante, Zaire-Emery -- Dembele, Kolo Muani, Thuram.\n\nFrance will notably miss Mbappe's dynamic presence, which was crucial in their previous victory against Austria. This absence could impact their attacking prowess, potentially limiting their ability to break through the Dutch defence.\n\nOn the other hand, the Netherlands have shown strong offensive capabilities in recent matches. However, they face a formidable French back line led by coach Deschamps, known for their resilience and ability to stifle opponents.\n\nGiven Mbappe's absence and France's defensive strength, the match may likely be a tightly contested affair with both teams struggling to score. A goalless draw is a plausible outcome, reflecting the defensive solidity on display from both sides.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors":

They had lost four in a row before this run (3 games at EURO 2012, and the 2010 FIFA World Cup final).\n\nFrance are looking to win their opening two matches at a UEFA EURO tournament for a fourth time - on each of the previous three occasions they've done so, they have gone on to reach the final: in 1984, 2000 and 2016.\n\nCody Gakpo has scored in all four of his starts for the Netherlands in the group stages of major tournaments (World Cup/EUROs). In all competitions, the Liverpool forward has been involved in six goals in his last eight appearances for Oranje (4 goals, 2 assists).\n\nThree of Wout Weghorst's four goals at major tournaments (World Cup/EUROs) have come as a substitute, including his winner with his first touch against Poland in the opening game. It's the most sub goals a Netherlands player has ever scored in major tournament history.\n\nFrance manager Didier Deschamps won his seventh UEFA EURO match in 12 attempts (D4 L1) in their 1-0 win over Austria. In UEFA European Championship history, only Joachim L\u00f6w (12 wins in 21 games) has ever registered more victories as a manager than Deschamps.\n\nKylian Mbapp\u00e9 had four shots without scoring in their 1-0 win over Austria, taking his total to 18 attempts without scoring at the UEFA EURO, the most of any Frenchman since 1980. By contrast, at the World Cup he has scored 12 goals in 14 matches with a 31% shot conversion rate.\n\nThe Netherlands are Kylian Mbapp\u00e9's favourite opponent - he has scored six goals in five matches against the Dutch, more than against any other side in his international career with France.

They have won just two of seven matches (D4 L1) at the European Championship when scoring first (29%), the lowest win rate of any nation to have scored first in more than five game since Poland's first appearance at EURO 2008.\n\nAlthough Austria had more possession (52%), completed more passes (401 vs 390) and made more passes in the final third (137 vs 108) than France on MD1, they only managed five shots in total, their second lowest in a UEFA EURO game after they had four attempts in a 0-0 draw with Portugal in 2016.\n\nAdam Buksa is looking to become the first Poland player to score in each of his first two games at the European Championship. At major tournaments, the only Poles to do so previously are Grzegorz Lato and Andrzej Starmach at the 1974 World Cup against Argentina and Haiti.\n\nAfter a run in which he'd played the full match at each of Poland's 18 major tournament matches between EURO 2012 and the 2022 World Cup, Robert Lewandowski was missing on MD1 against the Netherlands.

The head coach may not make many changes from his opening game lineup, though Gini Wijnaldum may have done enough from the bench to give them control they'll require against France.\n\nFrance's big concern is of course Mbappe and there's no confirmation of how long he'll be out for as yet, though it looks improbable he'll be featuring against the Dutch. The options for Deschamps are varied, but he could either bring in another of several pacey wide men, or push Marcus Thuram wide and start Olivier Giroud up front.\n\nPredicted line-ups\n\nNED - Verbruggen, Dumfries, De Vrij, Van Dijk, Ake, Wijnaldum, Veerman, Simons, Reijnders, Gakpo, Depay\n\nFRA - Maignan, Kounde, Upamecano, Saliba, T Hernandez, Kante, Rabiot, Dembele, Griezmann, Thuram, Giroud\n\nFrance will certainly be troubled by the speed of the Dutch attack but they also have the depth in their own attack to keep going forward, again and again.

The 25-year-old returned to training on Wednesday with a plaster on his nose and will wear a protective mask when he returns to playing action.\n\nWhether that comes against the Dutch, who came from behind to beat Poland, 2-1, thanks to goals from Cody Gakpo and Wout Weghort, remains to be seen.\n\nMORE: Euro 2024 schedule and results, updated LIVE | Who will win Euro 2024? Latest odds and predictions\n\nThere are no major injury concerns for Ronald Koeman and the Netherlands.\n\nWout Weghorst made a strong case for being elevated to the starting lineup when he starred as the match-winner against Poland, but the former Wolfsburg and Manchester United target man is likely to be an impact sub once more as Memphis Depay leads the line. Memphis is just five goals behind Robin van Persie's all-time Netherlands record of 50 international goals\n\nNetherlands predicted:(4-2-3-1): Verbruggen (GK) -- Dumfries, de Vrij, van Dijk, Ake -- Veerman, Wijnaldum -- Simons, Reijnders, Gakpo, -- Depay\n\nInjured: None\n\nSuspended: None\n\nThe big concerns for France are the fitness of star men Kylian Mbappe and Antoine Griezmann. Mbappe is unlikely to be risked with his broken nose. The ideal scenario for Les Bleus would be a win over the Dutch in his absence and then the opportunity for further rest in an effective dead-rubber against Poland.\n\nGriezmann feels like more of a 50/50 call, but if the attacking playmaker stands down it will give a reportedly disgruntled Warren Zaire-Emery some game time.\n\nDidier Deschamps is expected to give the nod to Randal Kolo-Muani ahead of veteran striker Olivier Giroud if Mbappe misses out.\n\nFrance predicted (4-3-3): Maignan (GK) -- Kounde, Upamecano, Saliba, Hernandez -- Rabiot, Kante, Zaire Emery -- Dembele, Kolo Muani, Thuram.\n\nInjured: Mbappe, Griezmann\n\nSuspended: None\n\nHere's how to watch this Euro 2024 match across selected areas of the world's major regions:\n\nUSA: Netherlands vs. France from Red Bull Arena will be televised in the United States on FOX, with Spanish-language streaming via ViX. The game is also available to stream on Fubo, which is currently offering a FREE seven-day trial.\n\nRadio coverage of the match can be followed on SiriusXM FC.\n\nUK: This Netherlands vs. France Euro 2024 match will be broadcast in the UK on BBC One. Streaming can be found on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website.\n\nCanada: TSN and TVA (French) will be providing coverage of this match.

Despite the chaos, Mbappe's assist led to Wober's own goal, ensuring France's victory.\n\nFrance, now in second place, will secure a last-16 spot with a win on Friday. Deschamps's squad has shown defensive resilience, recording three consecutive clean sheets.\n\nFrance's double over the Dutch in qualifying follows the historical trend, having won seven of their last eight matches against the Netherlands.\n\nHowever, Oranje have won their last two encounters at the Euros, including a 4-1 thrashing in the 2008 group stage.\n\nThe Netherlands emerged from their tough win over Poland without any injury concerns.\n\nBrian Brobbey, who missed the match due to a hamstring issue, is back in training, giving Koeman a full squad to choose from.\n\nThe only slight concern for Koeman is in midfield, as Joey Veerman's yellow card on Sunday means he will face a one-game ban if booked again.\n\nHowever, Koeman is unlikely to let such hypotheticals affect his strategy for such an important match.\n\nWeghorst's late heroics over the weekend have not ruled out his starting chances, but Depay, just five goals shy of Robin van Persie's record 50 for the men's team, is expected to retain his starting position.\n\nOn the French side, fans are eagerly awaiting updates on Mbappe, who suffered a bloody nose and shirt after his collision with Danso.\n\nThough he might feature later in the tournament with a protective mask, French media reports indicate that Mbappe will miss Friday's crucial match.\n\nDeschamps is likely to rely on record goalscorer Olivier Giroud, who is dealing with some groin pain but should be available.\n\nEduardo Camavinga (ankle) and his Real Madrid teammate Aurelien Tchouameni (foot) are also expected to be fit to play, though neither is likely to replace N'Golo Kante, who delivered a vintage performance against Austria with his tireless midfield display.", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Yet Koeman knows France have enough quality in their squad to cause problems whether Mbappe, who tested out a protective mask on Thursday, starts or not.\n\n\"France are such a strong team, that's even if he's not playing,\" the Dutch coach told reporters on Thursday.\n\n\"The substitute will be a great player as well. I can't really focus on this. All we can do is try to influence our team and to prepare ourselves as best as we can.\n\n\"Not everything depends on whether Mbappe is there or not.

He had a big influence on the last two games.\"\n\nThose qualifying defeats ensured the Dutch finished second in their group behind France, with Didier Deschamps' side winning 4-0 in Paris and 2-1 in Amsterdam.\n\nKoeman, however, is confident his side have improved.\n\n\"We hope that we'll be able to prove tomorrow that we have improved,\" he said.\n\n\"It is different. Maybe because we've prepared well, we had the friendlies, we've had more time now to work on our tactics our systems and we'll be a better team tomorrow against France.\"\n\nThe Dutch began their Euro 2024 campaign with a 2-1 win over Poland in which they created numerous chances but lacked a clinical edge until Wout Weghorst came off the bench and grabbed a late winner.\n\nThey conceded an early goal when they switched off at a corner and Koeman is keen that they avoid silly mistakes against France.\n\n\"What the lesson learned against Poland is that you need to play the high level for 90 minutes not just 60 minutes,\" he said.\n\n\"Be careful about where you lose the ball and in which parts of the pitch you really need to dare to play. To think about where you are in defence what's your position and what will happen if I lose the ball here.

After the first pair of group matches, the Netherlands and France sit atop the group with three points each and a +1 goal differential. The Dutch beat Poland 2-1, while the French edged Austria 1-0. The top two teams from each group and the top four third-place teams from all groups will qualify for the knockout round.\n\nKickoff is set for 3 p.m. ET. Les Bleus are the +120 favorites (risk $100 to win $120) in the latest Netherlands vs. France odds, with the Oranje the +240 underdogs. A draw is priced at +230 and the over/under for total goals scored is 2.5.

The 33-year-old, who plays for Atletico Madrid, was one of the best players in La Liga this past season with 16 goals and six assists. He also scored six times in 10 appearances in this season's Champions League. For the French, Griezmann has scored 44 goals since his debut 10 years ago.\n\nIn addition, France have the experience of playing well in the most important tournaments. Les Bleus have made the final in three of the past four major tournaments. By contrast, the Netherlands' best result over that time was a quarterfinal appearance in the 2022 World Cup. See which team to pick here.\n\nWhy you should back Netherlands\n\nThe Oranje will face a French side that may be without arguably the best player in the world, Kylian Mbappe. The speedy and prolific winger suffered a broken nose in France's 1-0 victory over Austria, and his availability for Friday's match is in doubt. If he is unable to play, it would be a significant loss for Les Bleus. He has won six straight scoring titles in Ligue 1 and has scored 47 career goals for the French.\n\nThe Oranje have a plethora of world-class attackers. Memphis Depay, who has scored 45 goals in his international career, remains a quality threat despite battling injuries. Xavi Simons is a rising 21-year-old star who is coming off his best season. Cody Gakpo, Donyell Malen, Jeremie Frimpong, and Wout Weghorst also have the ability to give defenses headaches, and both Gakpo and Weghorst scored in the 2-1 win over Poland. See which team to pick here.\n\nHow to make Netherlands vs. France picks\n\nEimer has broken down France vs. Netherlands from every possible angle. He is leaning Under 2.5 goals, and he has three other best bets, all of which would pay plus-money, and a full breakdown of this match.

On Friday, they face off in a heavyweight clash at the Red Bull Arena in Leipzig that could determine who tops Group D. Ahead of the Netherlands vs France game, let us take a look at the predictions.\n\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding Kylian Mbapp\u00e9's availability due to a broken nose, France are favoured to secure their second win. The Opta supercomputer gives France a 52.3% chance of victory, compared to 24.4% for the Netherlands, with a 23.3% likelihood of a draw. Considering both teams' form and squad depth, we at Insidesport.IN predicts a 2-2 draw.\n\nFrance currently sits second in Group D and has started their campaign strongly. Ronald Koeman's Netherlands team had Cody Gakpo and Wout Weghorst to thank for their 2-1 comeback victory against Poland in their opening match. Mbapp\u00e9's status is uncertain, as he is set to be fitted with a protective mask ahead of a potential return.\n\nDidier Deschamps has a wealth of attacking options at his disposal. Randal Kolo Muani can play a similar role to Mbapp\u00e9, while Olivier Giroud could offer a more traditional focal point. France has a strong record with Giroud in the starting lineup, winning 71.9% of their games under Deschamps (64/89), compared to 57.3% without him (43/75).\n\nThe Netherlands, meanwhile, looked vulnerable to an upset in their opener before Gakpo and Weghorst secured their 2-1 victory. Weghorst's winner came with his first touch after being introduced as an 81st-minute substitute, marking his fourth goal at a major tournament (World Cup/Euros). Notably, three of these goals have come as a substitute, making him the Dutch player with the most goals off the bench in major tournaments.\n\nMemphis Depay started up front against Poland but struggled, failing to hit the target with any of his four shots. Despite this, he is expected to retain his place in Koeman's lineup on Friday. However, if Depay underperforms again, Weghorst is likely to be introduced earlier in the match.\n\nVerbruggen; Dumfries, De Vrij, Van Dijk, Ake; Schouten, Veerman; Simons, Reijnders, Gakpo;

The Dutch government actively promotes using \"the Netherlands\" to avoid confusion. The Netherlands began their Euro 2024 campaign with a 2-1 victory over Poland, with Ronald Koeman optimistic about their chances.\n\nAs the group stages of EURO 2024 continue to hurtle on, this summer's tournament has already educated a lot of people on common misconceptions about cultures and countries across Europe as the festival of football brings a melting pot of backgrounds together over the next few weeks.\n\nWith the Netherlands opening their account with a 2-1 victory from behind against Poland in their Group D opener, they were the latest to provoke cultural clarification.\n\nPeople often use the terms \"Holland\" and \"the Netherlands\" interchangeably when referring to Ronald Koeman's side, but they don't match up exactly. While Holland is a region, the Netherlands is the country's proper, formal name.\n\nRelated Why The Netherlands Play in Orange - Despite Colour Not Featuring in their Flag\n\nThe Orange kit has been made famous by the Netherlands, but why?\n\nHolland Refers to Two Regions of the Netherlands The Dutch government actively promoting the use of \"the Netherlands\"\n\nThe official name of the northwestern European land of tulips and windmills is \"Koninkrijk der Nederlanden,\" or Kingdom of the Netherlands. It was founded in 1579 as a union of various provinces and cities who resisted rule by the Spanish.\n\nOne of these provinces was the province of Holland (now divided into Noord [North] Holland and Zuid [South] Holland), which originated in the 12th century as a fief of the Holy Roman Empire. Even after the provinces of the Netherlands united, Holland was still the dominant region, with both Rotterdam and Amsterdam helping it to remain the economic powerhouse of the country. And because of this, it has often been the word on the tip of tongues across Europe, even though it isn't the nation's proper name.\n\nWhile Holland specifically denotes two provinces, North and South Holland, the Netherlands encompasses all 12 provinces, reflecting the country's broader identity.\n\nThe Dutch government has actively promoted the use of \"the Netherlands\" to enhance national branding and avoid unnecessary confusion. This move aligns with the country's efforts to present a unified and accurate representation on the international stage, ensuring that fans and media alike correctly refer to the nation during the prestigious tournament.\n\nThe Netherlands' EURO 2024 Chances Ronald Koeman sings the praises of his side after positive opening win\n\nThe Netherlands kickstarted their EURO 2024 campaign with a 2-1 come-from-behind victory against Poland in Group D. But while the consensus was that The Oranje made life difficult for themselves, with Wout Weghorst needed late on to secure all three points, Ronald Koeman chose to look at the positives. He said:\n\n\"It should have been 4-1 to us after an hour [against Poland]. We played very well but were not able to find the net. If we had taken our chances, you would have said we were at the same level as Germany.\"\n\nWith Germany among the favourites, Koeman's thoughts on his side's performance against Poland reflect the optimism around the country that the Netherlands can go far in this tournament. Although Opta's Supercomputer predicts that they are the sixth-best side in the competition, a deep reserve of talent all across the pitch will go a long way in their efforts.\n\nWith a perfect blend between old and new talent, experienced and excitable, they will be counting on the likes of Georginio Wijnaldum, Frenkie De Jong, captain Virgil Van Dijk, and Memphis Depay to pull them through the nitty-gritty ties, while dangerous youngsters such as Cody Gakpo, Xavi Simons, and Jeremie Frimpong bring an element of surprise to this summer's coveted competition as they prepare to face France

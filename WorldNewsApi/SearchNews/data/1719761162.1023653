Goyal made these remarks while addressing the media here. He had come to the city to campaign for BJP Chandigarh candidate Sanjay Tandon. Criticizing Tewari, Goyal said, \u201cManish Tewari, who has a vote in Ludhiana, neglected his democratic responsibility by not voting in 2019. Will he fulfil his duty and cast his vote this time in Ludhiana, or will he once again abstain? It is quite surprising that Tewari who is projecting himself as the guardian of the Constitution doesn\u2019t even bother to vote.\u201d Labelling Manish Tewari as a mediocre debater, Goyal criticized his tendency to rely on falsehoods for political gain. He highlighted Tewari\u2019s opposition to the removal of Article 370 in Parliament, alongside his misleading assertion about Article 371, suggesting it was a deliberate attempt to misguide the people of the North East. When asked why Tandon didn\u2019t want to debate with Tewari, Goyal emphasized, \u201cSanjay Tandon is a man of action, and the people of Chandigarh know him very well. There\u2019s no need to debate with Manish Tewari, and everyone knows what level of debating skills he has. I will not even send a councillor to debate with him.\u201d \u201cTandon served 70,000 meals in a day during COVID-19. Was Tewari seen during those critical times?\u201d Goyal posed this counter question to the media. Goyal further praised Tandon\u2019s commitment to social causes, highlighting his efforts in providing meals during the pandemic and empowering thousands with employable skills. Goyal criticized the Congress for not attending the Pran Pratishtha Samaroh in Ayodhya and asked Tewari to clarify his stand, \u201cwhy he and his party didn\u2019t attend the Pran Pratishtha of Ram Mandir.\u201d Highlighting the Modi government\u2019s achievements, Goyal underlined India\u2019s remarkable economic progress over the past decade, ascending from the 11th largest economy to the fifth largest globally, with expectations of becoming the third largest within the next three and a half years. He lauded the proliferation of start-ups, rapid infrastructure development including expressways and airports, the expansion of inland waterways, and the impending introduction of the bullet train. Goyal also underscored India\u2019s robust foreign reserves of $650 billion and the manageable inflation rate of 5 to 5.25 per cent. He added, \u201cUnder the Modi government\u2019s tenure, we\u2019ve fostered an investor-friendly environment, resulting in the creation of a substantial number of high-quality jobs. Additionally, our relentless focus on infrastructure development has not only upgraded the nation\u2019s framework but also provided a significant impetus to job creation.\u201d The lone Lok Sabha seat in Chandigarh will go to the polls on June 1. \u2013IANS vg/bg", "summary": "<p>Chandigarh, May 29 (IANS) Union Commerce and Industries Minister Piyush Goyal on Wednesday criticized Chandigarh Congress nominee Manish Tewari, stating that the latter, who calls himself a &#8220;champion of democracy&#8221;,&#8230; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://indianews.com.au/manish-tewari-failed-to-cast-vote-in-2019-piyush-goyal/\">Continue reading <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Manish Tewari failed to cast vote in 2019: Piyush Goyal</span></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://indianews.com.au/manish-tewari-failed-to-cast-vote-in-2019-piyush-goyal/\">Manish Tewari failed to cast vote in 2019: Piyush Goyal</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://indianews.com.au\">Australia India News</a>.</p>", "url": "https://indianews.com.au/manish-tewari-failed-to-cast-vote-in-2019-piyush-goyal/", "image": "https://iansportalimages.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/202405293168406.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 14:19:14", "author": "India News Newsdesk", "authors": ["India News Newsdesk"], "language": "en", "source_country": "AU", "sentiment": 0.071}

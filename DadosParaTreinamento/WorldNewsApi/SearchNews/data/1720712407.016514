This applies to short-term goals, such as building an emergency fund, and longer-term ones, such as retirement. The problem is, you have financial needs and wants now, too. The solution, says Chaffin, is to set your money to transfer automatically where you want it to go before it ever hits your checking account. \"Automation is an elimination of friction that can help people save and invest in ways they otherwise wouldn't,\" he says. \"A 401(k) is a great example. If I can automate my retirement saving, I'm not even having to make a decision about that money. It's not even part of my budget.\" Conversely, you may want make certain actions harder, like the ones that drag you down financially. If you want to cut out junk food, for instance, you'd probably avoid keeping Oreos in your pantry, Chaffin points out. You can apply the same method if you struggle with making too many purchases online. \"One of the best things to do if you're susceptible: Don't keep your credit card stored with Amazon or with any of these retailers,\" Chaffin says. \"It's too easy to overspend. Make it tougher.\" If you don't think that will work, you might even consider switching to an all-cash spending system. \"Cash is tangible. It's more real. So people feel like they're actually spending their money, whereas if you're tapping using your phone, it doesn't feel like a real transaction,\" Chaffin says.", "summary": "Here's how to curtail bad money habits and make it easier to keep good ones, says Charles Chaffin, co-founder of the Financial Psychology Institute.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/09/how-to-break-bad-money-habits-from-financial-psychologist.html", "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107425440-1717706795683-gettyimages-910138960-img_9165.jpeg?v=1717706839", "video": "https://pdl-iphone-cnbc-com.akamaized.net/VCPS/Y2024/M05D16/7000340477/1715871968997-240429-mi-10-MM-derek-thediek-dirty_1_SRT_L.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:28:34", "author": "Ryan Ermey", "authors": ["Ryan Ermey"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.311}

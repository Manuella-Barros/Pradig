Gomez and Matt Dixon and Jonathan Allen and Dasha Burns and Allan Smith and Alec Hern\u00e1ndez and Shaquille Brewster\n\nJune 5, 2024 at 6:52 PM\n\nDonald Trump's search for a running mate is intensifying, as the former president awaits sentencing on felony charges and prepares for next month's Republican National Convention.\n\nVice presidential contenders recently received vetting materials, five sources familiar with the process told NBC News.\n\nTrump's search, according to one source, is heavily concentrated on four top prospects: North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Tim Scott of South Carolina and JD Vance of Ohio. Another source described a three-way competition involving Burgum, Rubio and Vance.\n\nIt's unclear, though, who all has been asked to provide vetting details that could rule them in or out. Burgum, who has been spending more time with Trump in recent weeks, is among those who have received a request, said one source familiar with the ask. Advisers to Burgum and other would-be running mates declined or did not respond to requests for comment this week.\n\nSources plugged into conversations about the search cautioned that Trump is working from a fluid shortlist that at times includes more than a half-dozen names. Additions, subtractions and the emergence of dark-horse candidates remain possible.\n\nOthers who have been mentioned as prospective running mates include South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Reps. Elise Stefanik of New York and Byron Donalds of Florida and Ben Carson, who served as the Trump administration's Housing and Urban Development secretary.\n\nTrump and his advisers have kept a close hold on the search, which until recently had been relatively quiet, as Trump stood trial on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to an adult film actor. Trump has said in interviews that a decision on his running mate is not likely until closer to the convention, which opens July 15 in Milwaukee. In 2016, he announced then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate days before that year's nominating convention in Cleveland.\n\nLast month, NBC News reported that the Trump campaign had yet to move beyond initial deep dives on prospective running mates; at the time, no questionnaires that might have helped cull the field had been sent. That changed over the last week, as the case neared its finish, with a jury finding Trump guilty on all counts.\n\nThe trial became an unofficial audition stage for VP contenders. Both Burgum and Vance, as well as longer-shot prospects like Donalds, joined Trump at the courthouse and have defended him frequently on TV.\n\nAsked Friday in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer if he was interested in running on a ticket with a \"convicted felon,\" Vance pushed back.\n\n\"Well, Wolf, the entire purpose of this trial was to allow the media and the Democrats to say exactly that,\" Vance said. \"This was never about justice. This was about plastering 'convicted felon' all over the airwaves, when in reality the only thing Donald Trump is guilty of is being in the courtroom of a political sham trial.\"\n\nBurgum, who was with Trump at the courthouse the day of the verdict, quickly pivoted to flattery in an interview that night on Newsmax when asked if he was being vetted for vice president.\n\n\"There's a lot of buzz around that,\" Burgum replied. \"I just say President Trump is so strong right now, he could get elected without a vice president.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"},

Doug Burgum and Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Tim Scott of South Carolina, and JD Vance of Ohio, NBC News reported Wednesday, citing an unnamed source. Another unnamed source told the network it is a three-way competition involving Burgum, Rubio, and Vance.\n\nIt's unknown, though, who has been asked to provide vetting details that could rule them in or out. Burgum, who has been spending more time with Trump in recent weeks, is among those who have received a request, one source familiar with the situation told NBC News. Advisers to Burgum and other would-be running mates declined or did not respond to requests for comment this week.\n\nNBC News reported that sources cautioned that Trump is working from a fluid shortlist that at times includes more than six names. Others mentioned as prospective running mates include South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Reps. Elise Stefanik of New York and Byron Donalds of Florida, and Dr. Ben Carson, who was secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Trump administration.\n\nThe Washington Examiner reported May 30 that Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar of Florida also was a candidate.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, national press secretary for Trump's campaign, told Newsmax on May 24 that Trump likely will wait until the convention to name his running mate. The convention begins July 15 in Milwaukee, four days after Trump is set to be sentenced in New York after a jury found him guilty last week of falsifying business records to cover a payment made by disgraced former attorney Michael Cohen to porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\nThe trial acted as an unofficial audition stage for potential running mates, NBC News reported. Burgum, Vance, and Donalds joined Trump at the Manhattan courthouse during the trial and have defended him frequently on TV.\n\nBurgum was with Trump at the courthouse the day of the verdict.\n\n\"There's a lot of buzz around that,\" Burgum told Newsmax on May 30 about his potential candidacy as a running mate. \"I just say President Trump is so strong right now, he could get elected without a vice president.\"\n\nMichael Katz \u2709\n\nMichael Katz is a Newsmax reporter with more than 30 years of experience reporting and editing on news, culture, and politics.", "source":

Doug Burgum (R-ND). Once a primary opponent of Trump, he surprisingly made it to the debate stage and upon dropping out last December, endorsed Trump not long after in January. Like Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), another primary opponent turned Trump supporter who is likely on the short list, Burgum has been a fitting surrogate for the presumptive Republican nominee on the campaign trail. This especially includes in light of Trump being found \"guilty\" last Thursday on 34 counts.\n\nAs Madeline covered at the time, not long after the verdict came down, Burgum reposted Mark Levin in a quoted repost that denounced the issues with the trial, but also, on a more hopeful note, pointed out that \"The American people will have their say in November.\"\n\nBurgum also appeared on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, where he was asked by host Margaret Brennan about the trial. Right from the start, in addition to being referenced for being in contention, Burgum and Brennan discussed polling from CBS News/YouGov, which showed that views of respondents about the trial were \"unchanged\" after the verdict.\n\nAs Brennan reminded that a majority of respondents thought it was the \"right verdict\" and that Trump received a \"fair trial,\" she also claimed that \"a majority of Americans are unconvinced by this claim that it's all a sham,\" asking Burgum why he thought that was.\n\nBurgum tellingly pointed out that \"I think part of it, of course, polling is a point in time,\" while also reminding that more than a majority of respondents weren't paying close attention. Thirty-three percent said they were \"somewhat closely\" paying attention, while 23 percent were paying attention \"not very closely.\"\n\nOn that note, Burgum turned the question around. \"And I understand that they're not paying close attention to the trial, because most Americans out there, you know, they've got--working Americans don't have time to watch, you know, TV all day, read every report, because they're facing all the things, you know, putting food on the table, gas in the car...all the challenges that they're facing. And I think that, as this moment in time passes, when we have the election coming this fall, people are going to make a decision about, were they better--are they better off today than they were four years ago?\"\n\nHe also took the chance to remind about how, under Trump's record, Americans had the chance to \"prosper\" and experience no new wars. To that point, polling does also show, including from CBS News, that voters think more fondly of the Trump administration than the current Biden one when it comes to the economy, a top issue for voters in multiple polls.\n\n\"I think, while this is--it's interesting, and it's captivating right now to a lot of people... the election is not going to turn on this trial,\" Burgum added to drive the point home.\n\nAs they further discussed the hush money \"trial\" resulting in Trump being found \"guilty,\" where Burgum did bring it back to the American people was by pointing out \"I don't know if anybody American can explain how a--business transaction filing errors from seven years ago become federal election law, when federal election law is not a state.\"\n\nWith Burgum emphasizing \"most Americans cannot explain it,\" he got Brennan to acknowledge that \"it's complicated, sure.\"\n\n\"Many of the legal experts that stood on the curb outside the courthouse for... six weeks can't explain it. So Americans are going to come back to the issues that affect them, because this trial outcome doesn't affect them,\" Burgum went on to say, emphasizing how \"inflation affects them.\"\n\nPolling also shows that inflation is a top issue, if not the top issue ahead of the election, and that it's one where Biden struggles mightily. Per RealClearPolling, just 34.5 percent approve of how the president is handling inflation, while 63.3 percent disapprove.\n\nA particular part of the discussion gaining attention came after the commercial break, when Brennan asked Burgum about coverage from The Washington Post about how Trump reportedly met with oil executives and offered to reduce regulations if they raised money to help get him elected. Burgum cut Brennan off to remind he was there for the meeting.\n\n\"That did not happen. That is not what happened at that meeting. And that's been reported over and over and over again,\" he made clear. \"He didn't ask for a billion dollars in donations, and there was no quid pro quo.\"\n\nBurgum then expertly brought the conversation back to what Trump \"did last time for energy,\" with cutting regulations and bringing down gas prices, which meanwhile reached historic highs under Biden, as he also flounders on the issue by still releasing oil from the emergency reserves.\n\nThen, as Brennan tried to steer the discussion away from Trump's accomplishments and back towards the reports, Burgum that \"it drives me--when people went on--people went on hearsay that weren't at the meeting on hearsay report it like it's a fact, when it's not a fact.\" He continued to make clear that Trump is \"not targeting anybody\" as Brennan asked the question multiple times.\n\n\"He--he didn't make promises. He listened. He went around the room for two hours asking each of the people to tell me, what are your challenges, what are you facing, what are the--what are the things--he was there learning the whole night about the challenges that we're facing,\" Burgum offered. \"I think anybody he's met with--he'll be meeting with people in Silicon Valley. He's meeting people in--across every industry. He's not targeting anybody, he's doing what candidates do, which is, you go and listen to an industry. And this industry in particular, which is the fundamental to the entire economy.\"\n\nAgain, Burgum is considered a top running mate contender, perhaps one of the final candidates in consideration. His January 14 endorsement of Trump is still his pinned post to his X account.\n\nLast month, Burgum was among those who appeared at the New York City courthouse in support of Trump during his sham trial, not long after Trump had the governor at his rally in bright blue New Jersey.\n\nIt's not merely that Trump seems to like Burgum, but that the Democrats seem afraid of him. On May 25, when Burgum spoke at the NC GOP convention, the DNC War Room sent out a press release on \"Trump's MAGA Veepstakes,\" warning \"Doug Burgum Wants to Rip Away Freedoms and Rig the Economy for the Ultra-Wealthy with Trump.\"", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_downs@townhall.com", "name": "Rebecca Downs", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Brennan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Brennan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgum", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Burgum"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Burgum"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Face the Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Levin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Levin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouGov", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouGov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quid_pro_quo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quid pro quo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearsay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hearsay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/136/692915de-fa66-43fa-8fc5-94a310b3ebf5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627777", "eventUri": "eng-9627777", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-14", "textStart": 5942, "textEnd": 5952}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 6315, "textEnd": 6321}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Doug Burgum, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance.\n\nNBC News added South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott to that list, citing an unnamed source, though a second source told NBC that Trump was primarily focused on Burgum, Rubio and Vance -- at least for now.\n\nIn addition to those four, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik and former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson were also asked to provide some information to the campaign, though NBC said it was \"unclear\" whether those requests were as \"extensive\" as those sent to the other prospects.\n\nBurgum and Vance had no comment for ABC, but Rubio actually denied having received any paperwork request.\n\n\"I haven't talked to them about vice president,\" Rubio told ABC's Rachel Scott on Wednesday, the outlet reported.\n\nHowever, asked recently by NBC whether he'd be interested in the role, Rubio told the network, \"I'll do whatever the campaign asked me to do.\"\n\nTrump has previously said that he'd make his choice prior to the Republican National Convention, which kicks off in less than six weeks.\n\nRegular readers of The Western Journal may recall that in 2016, Trump announced then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate only days prior to the convention.\n\nPolitico speculated that Burgum was currently leading the pack because of his \"fundraising and donor outreach,\" but curiously cited \"some on the outside\" as its source for that speculation, rather than Trump insiders. (It's possible that there aren't any Trump insiders willing to leak to left-leaning Politico.)\n\nTrump's short list of prospects remains \"fluid\" and \"at times includes more than a half-dozen names,\" NBC reported.\n\n\"Anyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J. Trump,\" Trump campaign senior adviser Brian Hughes told NBC.\n\nAsked directly Tuesday night during a phone interview on Newsmax, Trump complimented all four of the top contenders, including Scott.\n\n\"I thought Tim Scott didn't run as good of a race as he's capable of running for himself, but as a surrogate for me, he's unbelievable. He's been incredible,\" Trump said, according to ABC.\n\n\"Gov. Burgum from North Dakota has been incredible. Marco Rubio has been great. J.D. Vance has been great,\" he added. \"We've had so many great people out there.\"\n\nHowever, NPR added a few names to the list based on their history of loyalty to the former president and their ability to \"help him win the race,\" primarily by appealing to \"voting blocs Trump is looking to tap into.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tim Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Donalds", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Byron Donalds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elise_Stefanik", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elise Stefanik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Housing_and_Urban_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Doug Burgum and Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Tim Scott of South Carolina and JD Vance of Ohio. Another source described a three-way competition involving Burgum, Rubio and Vance.\n\nIt's unclear, though, who all has been asked to provide vetting details that could rule them in or out. Burgum, who has been spending more time with Trump in recent weeks, is among those who have received a request, said one source familiar with the ask. Advisers to Burgum and other would-be running mates declined or did not respond to requests for comment this week.\n\nSources plugged into conversations about the search cautioned that Trump is working from a fluid shortlist that at times includes more than a half-dozen names. Additions, subtractions and the emergence of dark-horse candidates remain possible.\n\nOthers who have been mentioned as prospective running mates include South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Reps. Elise Stefanik of New York and Byron Donalds of Florida and Ben Carson, who served as the Trump administration's Housing and Urban Development secretary.\n\nTrump and his advisers have kept a close hold on the search, which until recently had been relatively quiet, as Trump stood trial on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to an adult film actor. Trump has said in interviews that a decision on his running mate is not likely until closer to the convention, which opens July 15 in Milwaukee. In 2016, he announced then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate days before that year's nominating convention in Cleveland.\n\nLast month, NBC News reported that the Trump campaign had yet to move beyond initial deep dives on prospective running mates; at the time, no questionnaires that might have helped cull the field had been sent. That changed over the last week, as the case neared its finish, with a jury finding Trump guilty on all counts.\n\nThe trial became an unofficial audition stage for VP contenders. Both Burgum and Vance, as well as longer-shot prospects like Donalds, joined Trump at the courthouse and have defended him frequently on TV.\n\nAsked Friday in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer if he was interested in running on a ticket with a \"convicted felon,\" Vance pushed back.\n\n\"Well, Wolf, the entire purpose of this trial was to allow the media and the Democrats to say exactly that,\" Vance said. \"This was never about justice. This was about plastering 'convicted felon' all over the airwaves, when in reality the only thing Donald Trump is guilty of is being in the courtroom of a political sham trial.\"\n\nBurgum, who was with Trump at the courthouse the day of the verdict, quickly pivoted to flattery in an interview that night on Newsmax when asked if he was being vetted for vice president.\n\n\"There's a lot of buzz around that,\" Burgum replied. \"I just say President Trump is so strong right now, he could get elected without a vice president.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Team Trump has zeroed in on three or four potential running mates to fill out some paperwork, maybe more.\n\nFull speed ahead. The Republican convention will be held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin from July 15-18, 2024 so it's time to get busy.\n\nTo be honest, I think Trump has made up his mind but he's going through the process to make sure there won't be any surprises down the road. Also, don't look for him to make his decision known until the convention, or just before it. The former president likes a little drama.\n\nTrump has said in the past that he doesn't place a lot of importance on a choice of running mate. He knows that voters vote for the presidential candidate and the vice president is usually an afterthought. However, this year may be a little different. We don't know what is going to happen to Trump and his legal challenges going forward.\n\nI would say, though, that Trump's choice will be less important than Kamala is for the Democrat ticket. Not only are Democrats stuck with Biden at this point, but they are stuck with Kamala. There is no way the Democrats would allow her to be replaced. It is hard to believe that anyone thinks Joe Biden can make it through another four years. That means President Kamala if he wins re-election.\n\nThe top four contenders being reported are North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, and Senators J.D. Vance, Marco Rubio, and Tim Scott. It's reported that they have been sent out vetting requests. Also reported to have been sent paperwork are Reps. Byron Donalds, and Elise Stefanik, and Dr. Ben Carson.\n\nI think Trump has been sending up trial balloons on some of them. He's being coy but he seems to be pushing Burgum and Scott forward when they show up at campaign rallies with him. Both men regularly do that. Trump places loyalty above everything else so those who showed up in Manhattan to support him during the hush money trial scored points. It seems to be that his push for Burgum is the strongest right now.\n\nThere's time before the convention next month for Trump to tease any of them as his choice. It's good to see what a deep bench there is on the Republican side.\n\nTrump has teased that he could reveal his running mate at the Republican convention, which will take place in Milwaukee, Wisconsin from July 15-18. The former president has praised the four frontrunners recently, telling Newsmax that all of them have been great when it comes to campaigning for him.\n\n\"I thought Tim Scott didn't run as good of a race as he's capable of running for himself, but as a surrogate for me, he's unbelievable. He's been incredible,\" Trump said. \"Gov. Burgum from North Dakota has been incredible. Marco Rubio has been great. J.D. Vance has been great. We've had so many great people out there.\"\n\nAlthough Rubio is considered a top tier choice for VP, he has denied hearing from the Trump campaign about being vice president, or receiving a request for vetting documents. But Rubio, along with Burgum and Vance, said he would do whatever Trump's campaign asked of him.\n\nRubio is usually asked about this in interviews when he appears on television. He denies that he has spoken to Trump about being his running mate. There is also the fact that both Trump and Rubio are residents of Florida.\n\nThe campaign is cautioning about speculation. \"Anyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J. Trump,\" said Brian Hughes, a senior adviser for the Trump campaign. But, c'mon. It's fun to speculate.\n\nDiscussions have taken place with the Rubio team about how to address the constitutional issue that may prevent residents from the same state from being on the same presidential ticket -- including the possibility of the Florida senator relocating for the role, sources said.\n\nI don't know but I find it hard to believe that Rubio would move in order to be Trump's running mate. YMMV.\n\nBen Carson isn't being considered, I think, but Trump is friends with him. I think he'll be in Trump's cabinet. I also think that if Burgum isn't Trump's running mate, he'll be offered a cabinet position.\n\nThat's my two cents for now. I'll continue to speculate along with everyone else because, as I said, it's fun.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "karen_townsend@hotair.com", "name": "Karen Townsend", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tim Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Doug Burgum, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance are among those who were sent the vetting materials, another source familiar with the process said.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Rubio said he hadn't talked to the Trump campaign about being vice president but added, \"I am sure once they make a decision, they will let everyone know.\"\n\nPeople familiar with the deliberations caution that Trump's search for a running mate is still in flux. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson have also been sent various levels of paperwork in the vetting process, according to two sources familiar with the process.\n\nSources insist that the vetting process would look different for each person. \"A number of prospective candidates have exchanged documents or have had conversations with the team,\" one senior Trump adviser told CNN, adding, \"The level of conversations and the level of documents have varied widely.\"\n\nThe campaign emphasized that only Trump would make the final decision.\n\n\"Anyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J. Trump,\" another senior Trump adviser, Brian Hughes, said.\n\nNBC News was first to report that the vetting materials had been sent out.\n\nTrump has floated a lengthy list of names in recent months and routinely asks allies, donors and members of his Mar-a-Lago resort for their opinion. He routinely praises many of these contenders publicly at his campaign rallies and in interviews.\n\nMany of the potential picks have spent recent weeks publicly demonstrating their loyalty to Trump, including appearing with him at court for his New York criminal hush money trial and defending him on television. Trump was ultimately found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records.\n\nIn an interview with Newsmax on Tuesday, Trump mentioned Scott, Burgum, Rubio, Vance and Carson when asked about his search for a potential running mate.\n\n\"We have some unbelievable people,\" the former president said as he rattled off the names. \"But I think I'm going to hold it.\"\n\nTrump said in an interview with TMJ4 News last month there was a \"pretty good chance\" he would announce his running mate at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, which is slated to take place from July 15 to 18.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Doug Burgum and Sens. Marco Rubio and J.D. Vance, sources tell ABC News. The quiet outreach by campaign officials intensified last month, while Trump was consumed with his criminal hush-money trial, the sources said.\n\nOthers are likely to be considered for the No. 2 job, but the initial asks reflect who tops Trump's list at this point. Campaign officials say the final decision will be Trump's.\n\n\"Anyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J. Trump,\" said Brian Hughes, a senior adviser for the Trump campaign.\n\nTrump campaign officials have also requested information from Sen. Tim Scott, Reps. Byron Donalds and Elise Stefanik and Ben Carson, sources said. But it's unclear how extensive the requests were.\n\nRepresentatives for Burgum and Vance did not respond to ABC's request for comment. Rubio denied that he had received any reach out from Trump campaign officials.\n\n\"I haven't talked to them about vice president,\" Rubio told ABC's Rachel Scott on Wednesday.\n\nWhile the former president hasn't yet indicated who he will pick to be his vice president, he has said he plans to make his announcement closer to the Republican National Convention, which is in July.\n\nOver the past few weeks, those under consideration as a possible vice president for Trump have increased their public profile by appearing on cable networks, defending the former president during his hush-money trial and with some even making an appearance at court with Trump.\n\nBurgum was the only known potential veepstakes contender to appear at the courthouse during jury deliberations for Trump's criminal trial, which happened only after Trump campaign representatives asked him to provide background information to be considered in the running-mate search.\n\nLast week, following television appearances outside the courthouse, Burgum joined Trump and his son, Donald Trump Jr., as the jury deliberated. Two hours later, Trump was convicted.\n\nBurgum's appearance signaled a sign of loyalty in the next initial steps and strength as a partner through tumultuous waters.\n\nVance also appeared as a surrogate at the courthouse in Manhattan on May 13.\n\nOften asked about the possibility of serving as vice president under Trump, Burgum, Rubio and Vance have often deflected answering the question head-on, but have said they would do what the Trump campaign asked of them, which has included being campaign surrogates and raising money for the former president's campaign.\n\nDiscussions have taken place with the Rubio team about how to address the constitutional issue that may prevent residents from the same state from being on the same presidential ticket -- including the possibility of the Florida senator relocating for the role, sources said.\n\nWhen recently asked on NBC if he wanted the job of vice president, Rubio said, \"I'll do whatever the campaign asked me to do.\"\n\nDuring a phone interview on Newsmax on Tuesday night, Trump was asked if he were close to making a decision on picking a running mate and complimented Vance, Rubio and Burgum.\n\n\"I thought Tim Scott didn't run as good of a race as he's capable of running for himself, but as a surrogate for me, he's unbelievable. He's been incredible,\" Trump said.\n\n\"Gov. Burgum from North Dakota has been incredible. Marco Rubio has been great. J.D. Vance has been great.

Elise Stefanik, and Trump's 2016 rival-turned cabinet member Ben Carson were also said to be on the list - a set of seven who will vetted after they fill out the forms, two others said.\n\nThe paperwork sent to each reportedly varies, one of the sources said, as reps for each of the rumored candidates did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAides, meanwhile, have cautioned that Trump's list is not concrete and ever-evolving - and that, at the end of the day, the decision will ultimately be up to him.\n\nEx-President Donald Trump 's campaign has begun requesting information from his potential vice presidential candidates, sources close to his campaign have reportedly revealed. The politician is seen speaking to reporters outside his hush money trial late last month\n\nAmong those being considered is New York Rep Elise Stefanik - one of the 10 Republicans who serve the state. She has become a top contender for the VP spot thanks to her status as chair of the Republican conference, and he being one of the most influential women in her party\n\nPoll\n\nWho do you think will be Trump's candidate for VP?\n\nMarco Rubio 161 votes Tim Scott 230 votes Elise Stefanik 296 votes Ben Carson 126 votes Doug Burgum 87 votes JD Vance 165 votes Byron Donalds 59 votes\n\n'Anyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying,' Trump campaign spokesperson Brian Hughes said in a statement.\n\nHe quickly added: '[U]nless the person is named Donald J. Trump.'\n\nThe news - first reported by NBC - comes a week after Trump was found guilty by a jury in Manhattan of 34 counts of falsifying business records in a criminal hush money trial, for which he will be sentenced next month.\n\nTrump, in recent months, has shown hesitance to announce a running mate, after his infamous falling out with former right hand Mike Pence following the insurrection on January 6.\n\nHe has said he may wait until the upcoming Republican National Convention to unveil the right person, which would be in July - just a few days after he is set to be sentence in his criminal case.\n\nIn the interim, the other spot on the GOP ticket remains largely unknown - further fueling speculation.\n\nIn an appearance on Newsmax the day before, Trump listed Scott, Burgum, Rubio, Vance and Carson as among those in contention.\n\nWhile NBC was the first to report the development, ABC was the one to initially report on the list, which bore additional names such as Stefanik and Burgum.\n\nOthers to reportedly receive requests were a few of Trump's former rivals, including Marco Rubio and Ben Carson. Both lost to Trump in 2016, but have since made amends. Carson, for instance, served on the then-president's cabinet, but has since kept his distance\n\nSen. Tim Scott is also reportedly being considered, after he too lost to Trump in the primary late last year\n\nAlso sent vetting forms was Stefanik and JD Vance, both of whom have been steadily rising though the GOP ranks for the past few years\n\nStefanik, along with figures like Vance and Donalds, have been steadily rising though the ranks of the GOP for years, each aligning themselves with the potential two-time president at some point in the process.\n\nVance, for instance, a military vet who grew up in a dysfunctional family in the exurbs of Cincinnati, represents the Rust Belt that carried Trump to an upset victory in 2016.\n\nHe earned national recognition upon defeating a competitive field of Republicans and a formidable Democrat in a 2022 midterm, becoming the U.S. Senator for Ohio as a result.\n\nStefanik, meanwhile, is one of the 10 Republicans who serve New York, and has become a top Trump VP contender thanks to her status as chair of the Republican conference, and one of the most influential women in her party.\n\nShe's also only 39, indicating a potential propensity toward a younger person filling the hole left behind by longtime conservative Pence.\n\nDonalds, 45, also fits that profile, following an unsuccessful quest to become one of the youngest house speakers in history.\n\nThat bid fell flat last year, as did an attempt from Burgum, 67, to beat out Trump for the GOP nomination.\n\nCarson and Rubio, aged 72 and 53, respectively, are also former Trump casualties, both bowing out against the then-political newcomer in 2016.\n\nRounding out the alleged list, first reported by ABC, is North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and Florida Rep. Byron Donalds. Burgum recently bowed out of the GOP race as well, while Donalds threw in the towel in his quest to be the next Speaker of the House late last year\n\nUnlike the others, Carson - seen here with Trump during the GOP debate in September 2015 - has somewhat distanced himself from the currently shrouded VP field, completely absent from Trump's campaign trail\n\nAlso absent has been fellow conservative Rubio, who Trump helped secure a third term as Florida's governor back in 2022. Rubio - who was famously was slammed as Little Marco - endorsed the ex-president for the first time ever this year\n\nBoth have seemed to have since made amends with the Republican, with Carson even serving on the then-president's cabinet for his first term.\n\nThe former surgeon, however, has somewhat distanced himself from the currently shrouded VP field, absent from Trump's campaign trail unlike some of the others.\n\nAlso absent has been fellow conservative Rubio, who Trump helped secure a third term as Florida's governor back in 2022.\n\nRubio - who was famously was slammed as Little Marco by Trump - endorsed the ex-president for the first time ever this year in return.\n\nRounding out Trump's seven was Scott, after he too lost to Trump in a primary - late last year.\n\nThe native South Carolinian has since surfaced as one of Trump's most vocal surrogates, repeatedly floating the idea of being his running mate.\n\nLast month, he gave the strongest indication he would appear on Trump's 2024 ticket yet, telling a Newsmax reporter 'We'll see' when asked.\n\nDonalds offered similar sentiments Wednesday in Philadelphia to Fox News, telling the station, 'I'm not going to comment on that. I'm going to leave that one alone.'\n\nRubio, meanwhile, told ABC's Rachel Scott on Wednesday, 'I haven't talked to [Trump's team] about vice president.'\n\nDuring a phone interview Tuesday night, Trump was asked if he were close to making a decision as to a running mate - leading him to compliment Vance, Rubio and Burgum in particular\n\nHe also hailed Scott, saying that while he 'thought [he] didn't run as good of a race as he's capable of running for himself... he's unbelievable. He's been incredible [as a a surrogate].' As of early Thursday morning, an official announcement has yet to be made\n\nThe others, including Trump, have yet to comment on the list obtained by ABC, first reported on around 4pm Wednesday.?\"\n\nDuring a phone interview Tuesday night, Trump was asked if he were close to making a decision as to a running mate - leading him to compliment Vance, Rubio and Burgum in particular.\n\nHe also hailed Scott, saying that while he 'thought [he] didn't run as good of a race as he's capable of running for himself... he's unbelievable. He's been incredible [as a a surrogate].'\n\n'Gov. Burgum from North Dakota has been incredible. Marco Rubio has been great. J.D. Vance has been great,' he concluded. 'We've had so many great people out there.'\n\nAn official announcement has yet to be made.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is still five points ahead of President Joe Biden in the key swing state of Georgia, according to the first survey of the state's voters after the ex-president's guilty verdict in the hush money case.\n\nQuinnipiac released new numbers Wednesday finding that 49 percent of Georgia registered voters supported Trump while 44 percent backed Biden in a two-person race.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is still five points ahead of President Joe Biden in the key swing state of Georgia, according to the first survey of the state's voters after the ex-president's guilty verdict in the hush money case\n\nWhen third-party candidates were factored in, the presumptive Republican nominee was still heading for a win.\n\nIn that scenario, 43 percent selected Trump, 37 percent said Biden and independent Robert F. Kennedy took 8 percent of the vote share.\n\nAdditionally, Libertarian Party candidate Chase Oliver - who was picked at the party convention last month - received 3 percent, independent Cornel West also received 3 percent and the Green Party's Jill Stein got the backing of 2 percent of the Georgia vote.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"},

Doug Burgum (R) and Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and JD Vance (R-Ohio) received vetting requests. All four are considered front-runners to join Trump on the GOP ticket in November.\n\n\"Anyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J. Trump,\" Brian Hughes, a senior Trump campaign adviser, said in a statement.\n\nNBC News first reported on the campaign sending vetting materials.\n\nABC News reported the campaign has also requested information from Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.), Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and Ben Carson, but it was unclear how extensive those asks were.\n\nThe former president has for months teased out his selection of a running mate for November's election, hinting at who was on his short list of contenders and signaling he may wait until the Republican National Convention in mid-July to make an announcement.\n\nBut Burgum, Vance, Rubio and Scott have each emerged in recent weeks as the likeliest choices. All four appeared on television in the days after Trump was found guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in New York to defend the former president.\n\nIn a phone interview with Newsmax on Tuesday, Trump offered praise for each of them when asked about when he might make a decision.\n\n\"I thought Tim Scott didn't run as good of a race as he's capable of running for himself, but as a surrogate for me, he's unbelievable.

Doug Burgum and his wife, Kathryn Burgum, were in Washington, D.C., for the occasion of President Joe Biden's inauguration.\n\nThat may seem an odd bit of news, given that Burgum is now flacking for Jan. 6 instigator Donald Trump on any cable news program that will give him a booking, but it's true. Burgum was there.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, it's not the least bit unusual for a state leader to go to Washington to witness the seating of a new national leader, even one from another party. The peaceful transition of power was once something we held sacred in this country. After all, our nascent nation once fought a revolution to move on from the often violent intrigues of monarchic succession.\n\nAcknowledging the will of the people and the sanctity of the electoral process is important, perhaps especially when it produces results that are not to our liking.\n\nBurgum wasn't there to celebrate Biden's election, a man with whom the governor has profound differences. The same day Burgum attended the inauguration, his office also sent out a statement critical of the incoming administration for suspending oil and gas leases.\n\n\"We're ready to work with the new administration on developing policies that support our state's priorities, and we will continue to oppose policies that harm North Dakotans, especially our energy and agricultural producers,\" he said in a statement released the morning of inauguration day.\n\nBut Burgum clearly thought it was important to be on hand to witness President-elect Biden become President Biden. The governor was outspoken in his condemnation of the Jan. 6 violence. \"We support the right to peacefully protest. The violence happening at our nation's Capitol is reprehensible and does not represent American values, and needs to stop immediately,\" he wrote that day on X.\n\nBurgum didn't just attend the inauguration. According to a release from his office, he also visited with members of the North Dakota National Guard . About 150 members of the 81st Civil Support Team and the 816th Military Police Company were on hand to help provide security around the inaugural ceremonies lest Trump supporters launch another attack on the proceedings.\n\nEven though the results of the 2020 election weren't to the liking of most North Dakotans, who cast their ballots for Trump, North Dakota's governor was on hand to acknowledge Biden as the legitimate winner, and some of North Dakota's sons and daughters were there to help keep everyone safe from the domestic enemies of American democracy.\n\nThe same enemies that Trump now honors as \"unbelievable patriots\" at his rallies.\n\nThat's something North Dakotans should be proud of.\n\nIt was right, proper and honorable that Burgum condemned the Jan. 6 attack and put aside his political differences to attend President Biden's inauguration.\n\nIt's hard to remember that version of Burgum, given his decision to join the mediocrities and grotesques engaged in a campaign of groveling to curry favor with Trump. Burgum has allowed his political ambition to supersede his more noble instincts, and it's a painful thing to watch.", "source": {"uri": "inforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "INFORUM"},

Among those in the running are North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Florida's Marco Rubio, Ohio Sen. JD Vance and South Carolina's Tim Scott , according to campaign sources cited by Fox News. Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, and Trump's 2016 rival-turned cabinet member Ben Carson were also said to be on the list - a set of seven who will vetted after they fill out the forms, two others said.\n\nThe paperwork sent to each reportedly varies, one of the sources said, as reps for each of the rumored candidates did not respond to requests for comment. Aides, meanwhile, have cautioned that Trump's list is not concrete and ever-evolving - and that, at the end of the day, the decision will ultimately be up to him. 'Anyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying,' Trump campaign spokesperson Brian Hughes said in a statement. He quickly added: '[U]nless the person is named Donald J. Trump.'\n\nThe news - first reported by NBC - comes a week after Trump was found guilty by a jury in Manhattan of 34 counts of falsifying business records in a criminal hush money trial , for which he will be sentenced next month. Trump, in recent months, has shown hesitance to announce a running mate, after his infamous falling out with former right hand Mike Pence following the insurrection on January 6. He has said he may wait until the upcoming Republican National Convention to unveil the right person, which would be in July - just a few days after he is set to be sentence in his criminal case.\n\nIn the interim, the other spot on the GOP ticket remains largely unknown - further fueling speculation. In an appearance on Newsmax the day before, Trump listed Scott (pictured), Burgum, Rubio, Vance and Carson as among those in contention. While NBC was the first to report the development, ABC was the one to initially report on the list, which bore additional names such as Stefanik and Burgum.\n\nStefanik, along with figures like Vance (pictured) and Donalds, have been steadily rising though the ranks of the GOP for years, each aligning themselves with the potential two-time president at some point in the process. Vance, for instance, a military vet who grew up in a dysfunctional family in the exurbs of Cincinnati, represents the Rust Belt that carried Trump to an upset victory in 2016. He earned national recognition upon defeating a competitive field of Republicans and a formidable Democrat in a 2022 midterm, becoming the U.S. Senator for Ohio as a result.\n\nStefanik (pictured), meanwhile, is one of the 10 Republicans who serve New York, and has become a top Trump VP contender thanks to her status as chair of the Republican conference, and one of the most influential women in her party. She's also only 39, indicating a potential propensity toward a younger person filling the hole left behind by longtime conservative Pence.\n\nDonalds, 45, also fits that profile, following an unsuccessful quest to become one of the youngest house speakers in history. That bid fell flat last year, as did an attempt from Burgum (pictured), 67, to beat out Trump for the GOP nomination.\n\nCarson (pictured) and Rubio, aged 72 and 53, respectively, are also former Trump casualties, both bowing out against the then-political newcomer in 2016. Both have seemed to have since made amends with the Republican, with Carson even serving on the then-president's cabinet for his first term.\n\nThe former surgeon, however, has somewhat distanced himself from the currently shrouded VP field, absent from Trump's campaign trail unlike some of the others. Also absent has been fellow conservative Rubio (pictured), who Trump helped secure a third term as Florida's governor back in 2022. Rubio - who was famously was slammed as Little Marco by Trump - endorsed the ex-president for the first time ever this year in return. Both have seemed to have since made amends with the Republican, with Carson even serving on the then-president's cabinet for his first term.\n\nRounding out Trump's seven was Scott (pictured), after he too lost to Trump in a primary - late last year. The native South Carolinian has since surfaced as one of Trump's most vocal surrogates, repeatedly floating the idea of being his running mate. Last month, he gave the strongest indication he would appear on Trump's 2024 ticket yet, telling a Newsmax reporter 'We'll see' when asked.\n\nDonalds (pictured) offered similar sentiments Wednesday in Philadelphia to Fox News, telling the station, 'I'm not going to comment on that. I'm going to leave that one alone.' Rubio, meanwhile, told ABC's Rachel Scott on Wednesday, 'I haven't talked to [Trump's team] about vice president.' The others, including Trump, have yet to comment on the list obtained by ABC, first reported on around 4pm Wednesday.?\"\n\nDuring a phone interview Tuesday night, Trump was asked if he were close to making a decision as to a running mate - leading him to compliment Vance (pictured), Rubio and Burgum in particular. He also hailed Scott, saying that while he 'thought [he] didn't run as good of a race as he's capable of running for himself... he's unbelievable. He's been incredible [as a a surrogate].' 'Gov. Burgum from North Dakota has been incredible. Marco Rubio has been great. J.D. Vance has been great,' he concluded. 'We've had so many great people out there.' An official announcement has yet to be made.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Doug Burgum and Sens. Marco Rubio and J.D. Vance, sources tell ABC News. The quiet outreach by campaign officials intensified last month, while Trump was consumed with his criminal hush-money trial, the sources said.\n\nOthers are likely to be considered for the No. 2 job, but the initial asks reflect who tops Trump's list at this point. Campaign officials say the final decision will be Trump's.\n\n\"Anyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J. Trump,\" said Brian Hughes, a senior adviser for the Trump campaign.\n\nTrump campaign officials have also requested information from Sen. Tim Scott, Reps. Byron Donalds and Elise Stefanik and Ben Carson, sources said. But it's unclear how extensive the requests were.\n\nRepresentatives for Burgum and Vance did not respond to ABC's request for comment. Sen. Rubio denied that he had received any reach out from Trump campaign officials.\n\n\"I haven't talked to them about vice president,\" Rubio told ABC's Rachel Scott on Wednesday.\n\nWhile the former president hasn't yet indicated who he will pick to be his vice president, he has said he plans to make his announcement closer to the Republican National Convention, which is in July.\n\nOver the past few weeks, those under consideration as a possible vice president for Trump have increased their public profile by appearing on cable networks, defending the former president during his hush-money trial and with some even making an appearance at court with Trump.\n\nBurgum was the only known potential veepstakes contender to appear at the courthouse during jury deliberations for Trump's criminal trial, which happened only after Trump campaign representatives asked him to provide background information to be considered in the running-mate search.\n\nLast week, following television appearances outside the courthouse, Burgum joined Trump and his son, Donald Trump Jr., as the jury deliberated. Two hours later, Trump was convicted.\n\nBurgum's appearance signaled a sign of loyalty in the next initial steps and strength as a partner through tumultuous waters.\n\nVance also appeared as a surrogate at the courthouse in Manhattan on May 13.\n\nOften asked about the possibility of serving as vice president under Trump, Burgum, Rubio and Vance have often deflected answering the question head-on, but have said they would do what the Trump campaign asked of them, which has included being campaign surrogates and raising money for the former president's campaign.\n\nDiscussions have taken place with the Rubio team about how to address the constitutional issue that may prevent residents from the same state from being on the same presidential ticket -- including the possibility of the Florida senator relocating for the role, sources said.\n\nWhen recently asked on NBC if he wanted the job of vice president, Rubio said, \"I'll do whatever the campaign asked me to do.\"\n\nDuring a phone interview on Newsmax on Tuesday night, Trump was asked if he were close to making a decision on picking a running mate and complemented Vance, Rubio and Burgum.\n\n\"I thought Tim Scott didn't run as good of a race as he's capable of running for himself, but as a surrogate for me, he's unbelievable. He's been incredible,\" Trump said.\n\n\"Gov. Burgum from North Dakota has been incredible. Marco Rubio has been great. J.D. Vance has been great. We've had so many great people out there.\"", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Donalds", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Byron Donalds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elise_Stefanik", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elise Stefanik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Reports came in on Wednesday night from multiple outlets, however, that a list of candidates have been sent vetting paperwork.\n\nAmong the picks are names we've all heard before, including some Republican primary opponents from 2024 and even 2016. The top four names include North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, JD Vance of Ohio, and Tim Scott of South Carolina.\n\nThere's also Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida on the list, though like Rubio, there could be constitutional concerns about Trump and his running mate being from the same state. Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York is also on the list, so there looks to at least be one woman under consideration. Former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson is also on the list.\n\nReporting from the Associated Press, which cited \"two people familiar with the effort\" mentioned the names above. However, it was also mentioned that \"[a]ides have cautioned that Trump's list is fluid and evolving and that the decision will be up to him.\"\n\nThere's a statement from the Trump campaign as well. \"Anyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J. Trump,\" Trump campaign spokesperson Brian Hughes is quoted as saying.\n\nNevertheless, people have certainly been speculating, with the conversation about who Trump will pick and the names mentioned above trending over social media.\n\nThe top four names have been particularly visible campaign surrogates, including and especially on the Sunday shows. Just earlier this week, Burgum was on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" where he defended Trump, as we highlighted with Tuesday's VIP piece.\n\nWhen it comes to the lower tier candidates, Stefanik certainly seems to be interested in the role. She's been particularly vocal in her outrage about the weaponized and politicized justice system being used to go after Trump, who was just found \"guilty\" of 34 counts last week. Stefanik has not merely put out statements, but also sent letters to Attorney General Merrick Garland and has filed complaints about the judge involved in the hush money trial, Acting Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan.\n\nTrump himself has been discussed names as well. While speaking to Newmax's Greg Kelly, he mentioned \"some unbelievable people,\" and listed Scott, Burgum, Rubio, Vance and Carson.\n\nWednesday's night's episode of Fox News \"Hannity\" also teased a conversation host Sean Hannity had with Trump about his potential running mates as part of his exclusive interview.

The verdict, which was reached on Saturday with a vote of 57-43 in favor of conviction, saw seven Republican senators joining Democrats in finding Trump guilty for inciting the January 6th Capitol riot.\n\nGovernor Burgum, who is also a Republican, expressed that he believes the impeachment trial was an important process for holding leaders accountable.\n\nHowever, he also stated that it should not be focused solely on one individual and instead should address broader issues such as political division and social media's role in spreading misinformation.\n\nBurgum emphasized that the outcome of the trial should not determine the direction of the country, saying \"The election is not gonna turn on this trial. It's important we remember that there are other things going on in this country - COVID-19, economic challenges, national security.\"\n\nHe further stated that citizens should focus on finding solutions rather than being consumed by political drama.\n\nDuring his interview, Governor Burgum also expressed concern about the deep divides within the Republican party and called for unity moving forward.\n\nHe highlighted the need for leaders to work together and find common ground in order to address pressing issues facing the nation.\n\nIn addition to sharing his thoughts on Trump's impeachment verdict, Governor Burgum also provided updates on North Dakota's handling of COVID-19. He stated that the state is making progress in vaccine distribution and urged citizens to continue following safety guidelines.\n\nAccording to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, North Dakota has administered over 165,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines, with almost 10% of the population fully vaccinated.\n\nThe governor encouraged residents to get vaccinated when it becomes available to them, saying \"We need to keep up our efforts so we can put this pandemic behind us.\"\n\nIn conclusion, Governor Burgum's reaction to Trump's impeachment verdict highlights the importance of addressing larger issues facing the country rather than dwelling on political drama. He also calls for unity and collaboration among leaders in order to effectively tackle challenges such as COVID-19.\n\nAs North Dakota continues its fight against the pandemic, the governor urges citizens to remain vigilant and get vaccinated when possible.", "source": {"uri": "velvetiere.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Velvetiere"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Impeachment trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_North_Dakota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of North Dakota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_impeachment_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First impeachment of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Disease Control and Prevention", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://www.velvetiere.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/North-Dakota-Governor-Doug-Burgum-Reacts-to-Trumps-Impeachment-Verdict.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627777", "eventUri": "eng-9627777", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 320, "textEnd": 331}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

JD Vance.\n\nIn addition to Vance, who lives in Cincinnati and grew up in Middletown, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and South Carolina Sen.

Tim Ryan for Ohio's open Senate seat. Before his entrance into politics, Vance was best known for his memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy.\"Vance won Trump's support in a messy GOP primary despite his past, critical comments of the former president. For example, he once opined whether Trump could be \"America's Hitler\" and compared him to an opioid in a 2016 column in for the Atlantic.Now, Vance is one of Trump's top allies in the Senate. He frequently defends Trump in cable news interviews, particularly in the wake of his New York conviction.Vance is also close with Republican Bernie Moreno, who is taking on Sen. Sherrod Brown this November. Trump endorsed Moreno in that race.\n\nWho else may be on the list?\n\nTrump and his aides have discussed a number of other possible running mates, including Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida, and former housing secretary Ben Carson.\n\nOne other name has been discouraged by Trump: Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a fierce primary rival of the former president.\n\nTrump said on Newsmax: \"As far as Nikki's concerned, I was very disappointed in her because she stayed too long.\"", "source": {"uri":

J.D. Vance, R-Ohio; Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.; Governor of North Dakota Doug Burgum.AP; Getty; CQ-Roll Call, Inc\n\nWelcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team's latest reporting and analysis from the campaign trail, the White House and Capitol Hill.\n\nIn today's edition, we report on Donald Trump's accelerated vice presidential selection process. Plus, chief political analyst Chuck Todd asks if Trump's guilty verdict would matter more if President Joe Biden was more popular.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\nDonald Trump's search for a running mate is intensifying, as the former president awaits sentencing on felony charges and prepares for next month's Republican National Convention.\n\nVice presidential contenders recently received vetting materials, five sources familiar with the process told NBC News.\n\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know\n\nTrump's search, according to one source, is heavily concentrated on four top prospects:\n\nAnother source described a three-way competition involving Burgum, Rubio and Vance.\n\nIt's unclear, though, who has been asked to provide vetting details that could rule them in or out. Burgum, who has been spending more time with Trump in recent weeks, is among those who have received a request, said one source familiar with the ask. Advisers to Burgum and other would-be running mates declined or did not respond to requests for comment this week.\n\nSources plugged into conversations about the search cautioned that Trump is working from a fluid shortlist that at times includes more than a half-dozen names. Additions, subtractions and the emergence of dark horse candidates remain possible.\n\nTrump and his advisers have kept a close hold on the search, which until recently had been relatively quiet, as the presumptive GOP nominee stood trial on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to an adult film actor.\n\nTrump has said in interviews that a decision on his running mate will likely come closer to the convention, which opens July 15 in Milwaukee. In 2016, he announced Mike Pence as his running mate days before that year's nominating convention in Cleveland.\n\nRead more on the veepstakes \u2192\n\nAfter the historic felony conviction of a former president who is also the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, the entire political community is trying to figure out what it means now and what it will mean in November.\n\nThere was a time when immoral and unethical behavior was a political death knell. But as big tech and social media have algorithmically accelerated our tribal instincts, it's never been easier for anyone, guilty or not, to claim victimhood with some segment of the public. The red and blue tribes have an amazing ability these days to compartmentalize the bad behavior of folks on their side, while crying foul about an opponent with similar or worse characteristics.\n\nTo me, the real question of whether the verdict will have an impact on voters lies in the hands of the two presidential campaigns. How much is the verdict front and center versus simply setting the atmospherics?\n\nThe question I keep asking myself is this: Would this verdict matter more to voters if President Joe Biden had a higher approval rating?\n\nIt's an impossible hypothetical to test at this point, but one can't help but wonder if some voters are overlooking Trump's moral and ethical failings simply because they don't think Biden is up to the current job. Of course, if Biden were in better political standing, the GOP might have gone in a different direction during the primaries.\n\nThe point is, politics is a zero-sum game, and this is a binary choice in which the public believes it has to elect someone who is flawed. That goes back to a question about the two types of undecided voters in this election: the aspirational and the transactional. Aspirational voters vote on what's in the best interests of the country, and transactional voters vote on what they believe is in their own best interests. I'm not sure there are many aspirational voters left in the undecided column, but I do believe there are quite a few transactional voters left.\n\nSo far, what limited polling I've seen (including private campaign polling) indicates that the verdict has barely moved the numbers in the last week. Of course, \"barely\" could still be decisive in a close election, so I don't want to dismiss the idea that even a movement of 1 to 2 points wouldn't matter.\n\nRead more from Chuck \u2192\n\nThat's all from The Politics Desk for now.

Byron Donalds, in an interview with Fox News Digital, declines to comment on whether he's being vetted by the Trump campaign for the GOP vice presidential nominee.\n\nWith the start of the Republican Party's presidential nominating convention less than six weeks away, former President Donald Trump's campaign is picking up the pace in vetting the potential running mates.\n\nThe process has started in earnest with documents being requested from several prospective contenders for the 2024 GOP vice presidential nomination, sources on Wednesday confirmed to Fox News. They add that paperwork is being exchanged and note that they are entering a different phase of the running mate search.\n\nThe sources say that among those being vetted by the Trump campaign are three names that often come up - North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and Sen. JD Vance of Ohio.\n\nTRUMP HEADS TO BLUE BASTION TO RAISE CAMPAIGN CASH IN HIS REMATCH WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN\n\nBut people close to the campaign and to the former president add that the list is longer than just those three names. They say that also being vetted are Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Tim Scott of South Carolina, Reps. Byron Donalds of Florida and Elise Stefanik of New York, and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who served as Housing and Urban Development secretary in the Trump administration.\n\nTHIS IS HOW MUCH A TOP PRO-TRUMP SUPER PAC HAULED IN LAST MONTH\n\nAsked if the Trump campaign had reached out to him regarding vetting, Donalds in an interview Tuesday night with Fox News Digital, said \"I'm not going to comment on that. I'm going to leave that one alone.\"\n\nHighly placed sources say the list of potential running mates will continue to winnow down, but it is fluid.\n\nAs for the timing of the Trump decision on his running mate, the sources say the former president likely won't announce his choice until just before or even during the convention, which starts on July 15 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThat's in line with a handful of interviews in which the former president has said there's \"probably a pretty good chance\" that he'll announce his running mate \"in Milwaukee.\"\n\nAsked to comment on the reporting from Fox News and other news organizations regarding the vetting process, Trump campaign senior adviser Brian Hughes said \"anyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J. Trump.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_steinhauser@foxnews.com", "name": "Paul Steinhauser", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Additions, subtractions and the emergence of dark-horse candidates remain possible.\n\nOthers who have been mentioned as prospective running mates include South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Reps. Elise Stefanik of New York and Byron Donalds of Florida and Ben Carson, who served as the Trump administration's Housing and Urban Development secretary.\n\nTrump and his advisers have kept a close hold on the search, which until recently had been relatively quiet, as Trump stood trial on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to an adult film actor. Trump has said in interviews that a decision on his running mate is not likely until closer to the convention, which opens July 15 in Milwaukee. In 2016, he announced then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate days before that year's nominating convention in Cleveland.\n\nLast month, NBC News reported that the Trump campaign had yet to move beyond initial deep dives on prospective running mates; at the time, no questionnaires that might have helped cull the field had been sent. That changed over the last week, as the case neared its finish, with a jury finding Trump guilty on all counts.\n\nThe trial became an unofficial audition stage for VP contenders. Both Burgum and Vance, as well as longer-shot prospects like Donalds, joined Trump at the courthouse and have defended him frequently on TV.\n\nAsked Friday in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer if he was interested in running on a ticket with a \"convicted felon,\" Vance pushed back.", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNBC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_allen@cnbc.com", "name": "Jonathan Allen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Vance, Marco Rubio, Doug Burgum and Tim Scott -- according to multiple reports, as Trump has repeatedly teased he will announce his pick the Republican National Convention in July.\n\nTrump has suggested on multiple occasions he will announce his VP pick at the Republican National Convention, July 15-18 in Milwaukee, telling Milwaukee TV station TMJ4 there's a \"pretty good chance\" he will announce at the convention. Trump would be the first nominee since former President George H.W. Bush to announce his vice presidential pick at the convention, rather than before, according to the American Presidency Project at the University of California Santa Barbara. Bush announced former Vice President Dan Quayle on the second-to-last day of the Republican National Convention in August 1988. Trump announced former Vice President Mike Pence as his running mate three days before the convention in 2016.\n\nSeveral early rumored contenders have reportedly been eliminated from the potential shortlist. Arizona Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake is no longer in the running, The Washington Post reported, citing five unnamed sources who said Trump has sought to distance himself from her, concerned that she will lose the Arizona Senate race and he'll be associated with her loss. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who Trump previously said was a \"solid\" potential pick, is widely viewed to have tanked her VP chances after admitting in her new book that she shot and killed her family's \"untrainable\" and \"dangerous\" 14-month-old puppy, then turned her gun on one of her \"nasty and mean\" goats. Trump denied a May report that his one-time challenger, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (who has not endorsed Trump since dropping out of the race, but recently said she would vote for him) was in the running, and instead told News 12 Thursday she would likely be \"on our team in some form\" if he's elected again. Trump has also ruled out his former GOP primary challenger, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and is instead considering him for a cabinet position, Bloomberg reported in March, citing sources. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis raised speculation he was in the VP running when he met with Trump in Miami in April, The Washington Post reported, but the meeting was reportedly about enlisting DeSantis' donor network to help Trump and burying the hatchet after their contentious primary battle.\n\n\"You could take people like Ben Carson, you could take people like Marco Rubio, J.D. Vance, I mean there are so many...Elise [Stefanik] is doing a fantastic job...but I could go on for quite a long time,\" Trump told News 12 last month, adding \"I think some time during the convention,\" when asked when he would make the announcement.\n\nThe 12th Amendment prohibits a state's electors from voting for a presidential and vice presidential candidate who are both from the same state, which could rule out DeSantis and Rubio. Trump changed his official residency from New York to Florida in 2019. But there are potential workarounds. Trump may not need Florida's 30 electors to clinch the 270-vote threshold needed to officially win the presidency if he wins by a wide enough margin, an unlikely scenario, according to polls. Rubio or DeSantis could also change their residency to another state, as former Vice President Dick Cheney did days before former President George W. Bush nominated him as his running mate. Cheney lived in Texas at the time and switched his residency to Wyoming. The switch may be harder for Rubio or DeSantis, however, since they hold elected office in the state, Florida Atlantic University political science professor Ken Wagner noted to the Miami Herald.\n\nSeveral of the candidates have clear downsides. Rubio and DeSantis would draw the same base of home-state voters as Trump, as they're all from Florida, something Rubio mentioned when asked by Fox News in January about the prospect of joining Trump's ticket. Stefanik represents a solidly blue state that Trump almost certainly can't win. And Scott broke with Trump's GOP allies in Congress and voted to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election. Trump has a thorny history with Pence, who dropped out of the GOP presidential race in October. Pence has publicly criticized Trump for urging him not to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, which he refused to do, claiming Trump asked him to \"choose between him and the Constitution.\" Trump has countered that Pence is \"delusional.\"\n\nTrump and President Joe Biden clinched their respective parties' nominations on March 12, making the 2024 primary season one of the shortest in decades. The Republican National Committee is set to formalize Trump's nomination at its convention, and the Democratic National Committee will hold its convention in Chicago in August. Trump has made no public indications of who he will select as vice president, but wants someone with experience and a measured demeanor, the New York Times reported Friday, citing sources who said Trump is tight-lipped about who he might be leaning toward behind closed doors. Trump senior adviser Brian Hughes told NBC this week \"anyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nBiden-Trump Debates: What To Know As CNN Reveals Moderators For Next Month's Faceoff (Forbes)\n\nBiden Vs.

Kristi Noem, who faced a firestorm after it emerged that she had written in a newly-published memoir that she had shot and killed her puppy. In the same book, she erroneously claimed she had met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.\n\nThe former president has said there is a \"good chance\" he will announce his vice president pick around the time of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in mid-July. During the 2016 campaign, Trump announced then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence just a few days before the start of the nominating convention.\n\n\"Anyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J. Trump,\" said Brian Hughes, a Trump campaign spokesperson.\n\nTrump's vice presidential contenders have been taking aggressive steps to distinguish themselves, such as doing interviews with national news outlets, fundraising for the former president and attending his hush money trial in New York.\n\nVance, a former venture capitalist, helped to organize a Silicon Valley fundraiser that Trump will be attending on Thursday evening. Scott, who is also trying to demonstrate his fundraising abilities, is scheduled to host a June 19 donor confab in Washington that is expected to draw major contributors.\n\nTrump has been closely monitoring what the potential picks have been doing to help his campaign, according to a person familiar with the selection process, and he has continued to ask people around him for their opinion.\n\nAfter Trump's guilty verdict was handed down by a Manhattan judge last week, he asked some of his wealthiest donors for their ideas on who he should pick as his running mate. According to grocery store magnate John Catsimatidis, a Republican donor who was at the fundraising dinner, the top picks batted around by attendees included Scott, Burgum, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Trump primary rival Nikki Haley because she \"might make the difference.\"\n\nTrump, however, has publicly said that Haley would not be his running mate.\n\nCORRECTION: This

Plus, chief political analyst Chuck Todd asks if Trump's guilty verdict would matter more if President Joe Biden was more popular.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\nDonald Trump's search for a running mate is intensifying, as the former president awaits sentencing on felony charges and prepares for next month's Republican National Convention.\n\nVice presidential contenders recently received vetting materials, five sources familiar with the process told NBC News.\n\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know\n\nTrump's search, according to one source, is heavily concentrated on four top prospects:\n\nAnother source described a three-way competition involving Burgum, Rubio and Vance.\n\nIt's unclear, though, who has been asked to provide vetting details that could rule them in or out. Burgum, who has been spending more time with Trump in recent weeks, is among those who have received a request, said one source familiar with the ask. Advisers to Burgum and other would-be running mates declined or did not respond to requests for comment this week.\n\nSources plugged into conversations about the search cautioned that Trump is working from a fluid shortlist that at times includes more than a half-dozen names. Additions, subtractions and the emergence of dark horse candidates remain possible.\n\nTrump and his advisers have kept a close hold on the search, which until recently had been relatively quiet, as the presumptive GOP nominee stood trial on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to an adult film actor.\n\nTrump has said in interviews that a decision on his running mate will likely come closer to the convention, which opens July 15 in Milwaukee. In 2016, he announced Mike Pence as his running mate days before that year's nominating convention in Cleveland.\n\nRead more on the veepstakes \u2192\n\nAfter the historic felony conviction of a former president who is also the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, the entire political community is trying to figure out what it means now and what it will mean in November.\n\nThere was a time when immoral and unethical behavior was a political death knell. But as big tech and social media have algorithmically accelerated our tribal instincts, it's never been easier for anyone, guilty or not, to claim victimhood with some segment of the public. The red and blue tribes have an amazing ability these days to compartmentalize the bad behavior of folks on their side, while crying foul about an opponent with similar or worse characteristics.\n\nTo me, the real question of whether the verdict will have an impact on voters lies in the hands of the two presidential campaigns. How much is the verdict front and center versus simply setting the atmospherics?\n\nThe question I keep asking myself is this: Would this verdict matter more to voters if President Joe Biden had a higher approval rating?\n\nIt's an impossible hypothetical to test at this point, but one can't help but wonder if some voters are overlooking Trump's moral and ethical failings simply because they don't think Biden is up to the current job. Of course, if Biden were in better political standing, the GOP might have gone in a different direction during the primaries.\n\nThe point is, politics is a zero-sum game, and this is a binary choice in which the public believes it has to elect someone who is flawed. That goes back to a question about the two types of undecided voters in this election: the aspirational and the transactional. Aspirational voters vote on what's in the best interests of the country, and transactional voters vote on what they believe is in their own best interests. I'm not sure there are many aspirational voters left in the undecided column, but I do believe there are quite a few transactional voters left.\n\nSo far, what limited polling I've seen (including private campaign polling) indicates that the verdict has barely moved the numbers in the last week. Of course, \"barely\" could still be decisive in a close election, so I don't want to dismiss the idea that even a movement of 1 to 2 points wouldn't matter.\n\nRead more from Chuck \u2192\n\nThat's all from The Politics Desk for now.

Still, one notable name is not on the list: South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem.\n\nMultiple news outlets reported Wednesday evening that the Trump campaign requested financial and biographical information on eight potential running mates as the start of a formal vetting process. The names included are not a surprise to anyone who has paid close attention to his surrogate's quick to appear on Fox News to say very pro-Trump things during his falsifying records-hush money trial over which he was convicted on 34 counts.\n\nIn no particular order, the names reported include Senators J.D. Vance, Marco Rubio, Tim Scott, and Tom Cotton, as well as Representatives Byron Donalds and Elise Stefanik. Governor Doug Burgum and former Trump cabinet member Ben Carson are also on the list.\n\nNoem was long considered a favorite to be included in this list of final candidates, but over the past month, the South Dakota Governor suffered several negative news cycles that focused on her bragging about killing a farm dog because it was \"less than worthless.\" She also claimed to have met North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, which later proved to be untrue.\n\nWhen the dog-killing controversy came to light, it reportedly hurt Noem's chances of being Trump's vice presidential running mate for the upcoming November election. Trump addressed it during a radio interview shortly after it broke.\n\n\"I think [Noem's] terrific. A couple of rough stories, there's no question about it,\" Trump said during a podcast interview with Clay Travis and Buck Sexton. \"And when explained -- the dog story, people hear that, and people from different parts of the country probably feel a bit differently, but that's a tough story.\"\n\n\"She had a bad week. We all have bad weeks,\" the Republican nominee added.\n\nIt appears that the \"bad weeks\" were part of why Noem is not considered for the role of Trump's vice president. Also missing from the list is Trump's most prominent primary rival, former UN Ambassador (under Trump) Nikki Haley, which is not much of a surprise given how bitter their primary campaign became.\n\nIt is notable that Trump seems to be considering only one woman as his running mate, when an appeal to the elusive \"Suburban Mom\" voting block appears a critical component to winning the election in November.", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_South_Dakota", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor of South Dakota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong_Un", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kim Jong Un"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Donalds", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Byron Donalds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elise_Stefanik", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elise Stefanik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

The newspaper found a slight shift in Biden's direction.\n\n* Speaking of polling, latest survey from Quinnipiac showed Trump leading Biden in Georgia by five points in a head-to-head race, and six points with third-party candidates added to the mix. The incumbent Democratic president narrowly carried Georgia four years ago.\n\n* CNN reported that President Joe Biden's re-election campaign has hired Austin Weatherford, former Rep.

It will run first in English and then in Spanish off of I-17.\"\n\n* And in his Newsmax interview this week, Trump suggested he was undefeated in this year's Republican primaries and caucuses.

Here are 10 Republicans Trump could pick to be his running mate", "body": "In a past life, former President Donald Trump hosted the reality competition, \"The Apprentice.\" Now, he's hiring for a new position: his running mate.\n\nWith Trump as the de facto GOP nominee for the 2024 general election, numerous Republicans have been vying to join forces with him and run together against the Democratic ticket, President Biden and Vice President Harris.\n\nAnd Trump has made his vice presidential nominee selection process much like a televised contest between rising stars and seasoned politicians alike who are trying to demonstrate their loyalty. Several contenders, including South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, have recently appeared on cable news shows singing Trump's praises.\n\n\"They're all out there campaigning,\" Trump said on Spectrum News 1 Wisconsin in May. \"It might actually be more effective this way because, you know, every one of them thinks they could be chosen, which I guess possibly is so.\"\n\nA lot hangs in the balance on who Trump chooses: His running mate could help shape the future of the MAGA movement. And, the vice president nominee could woo voters who lean moderate and are skeptical of Trump, along with other voting blocs Trump is looking to tap into.\n\nBut for Trump, who has said he'll announce his pick during the Republican National Convention that's being held from July 15-18, his criteria is straightforward: He wants a supporter loyal to his ways, and someone who can help him win the race.\n\nTim Scott loves Trump. He told Trump that himself this January, and ever since the South Carolina senator dropped out of the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, Scott's loyalty to Trump has only grown stronger.\n\nTea Party Republicans quickly identified Scott as a rising star in the GOP back in 2010, when he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives for South Carolina's 1st district. In 2013, he was appointed by former Gov. Nikki Haley to serve as the state's junior senator, making him the only Black Republican in the Senate.\n\nScott has advised Trump over the years regarding racial justice, particularly in the aftermath of white nationalist rallies that took place in Virginia in 2017.\n\nNoem, a small business owner helping run her family farm in South Dakota, moved into politics in 2006 when she was elected as a state House representative. Just four years later, she headed to Washington, D.C., when she won the state's At-Large seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. She is in her second term as South Dakota's governor.\n\nWhile Noem called for a state lockdown during the start of the pandemic, she moved to a looser stance on social distancing and quickly became a media darling for conservative outlets. She has also passed bills that restrict gender-affirming treatment and are seen as anti-LGBTQ, all of which garnered her praise from conservatives.\n\nOne of the leading conservatives of her generation, Elise Stefanik started off in politics as a newly minted Harvard grad working for President George W. Bush's administration. She was on Mitt Romney's presidential campaign team in 2012, and Paul Ryan mentored her at one point in her career -- all of which is to say: in one lifetime, she was a moderate conservative. She even criticized Trump when the leaked Access Hollywood tape came out in 2016, criticizing him for his \"inappropriate, offensive comments.\"\n\nThat makes how quickly she shed that identity and ascended into Trump's circle all the more remarkable. She spoke strongly in defense of Trump during the 2019 impeachment hearings against him. Two years later, Stefanik became chair of the House Republican Conference in 2021 after Liz Cheney was ousted from that post. She has since been at the forefront of Congressional hearings over antisemitism on college campuses, during which she grilled the presidents of University of Pennsylvania and Harvard last December.\n\nThe governor of North Dakota first made it big as the head of tech company Great Plains Software, which he later sold to Microsoft for $1.1 billion in stock in 2001. He continued to amass a large fortune through his real estate development firm and a software venture capital group, before winning the governor's race in 2016 on an anti-establishment message.\n\nHe made a short-lived bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, but since dropping out last December, he's been a top supporter for Trump.\n\nThe Florida Congressman may only be a two-term newcomer, but Trump is keenly aware of Donalds' starpower, as he has become a media regular advocating for Trump's cause. Donalds, who is a Black evangelical Christian, had been fighting for education reform early on, along with wife Erika Donalds, in the push to implement book bans and expand tax-funded charter schools.\n\nThe Ohio junior senator came to the scene nationally when his memoir Hillbilly Elegy recounting growing up in the Rust Belt came out in 2016. Since then, Vance, who in a past life was a venture capitalist, has offered his vision of anti-monopoly populist economics. He's also warmed up to Trump, after having called himself a Never Trumper. Vance has been seen lobbying top dogs in Silicon Valley on behalf of Trump, and is just one of many loyal supporters having made the trek to his hush money trial in New York.\n\nThe former TV news anchor with more than three decades of experience made the switch to politics in 2021 after becoming increasingly radicalized and disillusioned by the American media climate. She came out blazing as a supporter of Trump early on after the 2020 election, and became a known quantity among far-right circles that spread election conspiracy theories and were connected to the Jan. 6 insurrection. Lake narrowly lost against Democrat Katie Hobbs in the Arizona governor's race in 2022, but has continued to contest that result even as she's running for the Senate this year.\n\nSanders is no political novice: She began working for her dad's unsuccessful Senate race in 1992 as a nine-year-old stuffing envelopes for his campaign before catapulting into political consulting for high profile Republicans, including for Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton when he ran for that post. She was the third woman in U.S. history to serve as U.S. Press Secretary under Trump, a tenure which was marred by a rocky relationship with many reporters. But Trump speaks highly of Sanders, and endorsed her successful 2022 bid to the governor's seat for Arkansas.\n\nWhen Florida Sen. Marco Rubio first ran for his post in 2010, the son of Cuban immigrants was an underdog, making his win all the more exciting for the Republican base. He ran for president in 2016, during which he had heated exchanges with Trump on the debate stage. But the pair, once rivals, are now friends: Rubio has become an ally and the occasional adviser to Trump.\n\nThe former U.N. ambassador and former governor of South Carolina was Trump's strongest opponent in the primaries. During her presidential bid, she touted traditional conservatism as an alternative to some of Trump's MAGA policies, making her an enticing pick to independents and a sliver of Republicans who refuse to vote for Trump. But Haley dropped out of the race after a series of losses in the primaries, including in her home state. She did not endorse Trump or indicate if she would vote for him when she ended her run in early March, though Haley said late May that she would vote for him.", "source": {"uri": "gpb.org",

Tim Scott (R-SC) leading the pack of potential picks at odds just shy of 5-1. The South Carolina senator's status as the tepid favorite suggests the race is still wide open. And indeed, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum (R) is a strong second choice at 6-1. Sens. J.D. Vance (R-PA) and Marco Rubio (R-FL) are also both considered serious contenders in the betting market -- with odds of roughly 8-1 and 9-1, respectively.\n\nMultiple outlets reported this week that Trump's campaign has finalized its list of potential VP candidates. The list includes Vance, Rubio, Scott, Burgum, as well as Reps. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) and Byron Donalds (R-FL).\n\nBoth Stefanik and Donalds on Oddschecker's list, but both are regarded as longshots -- with the former getting 22-1 odds and the latter pulling 54-1 odds.\n\nSouth Dakota Gov.

Vance, a junior senator from Ohio, Marco Rubio, the senior U.S. senator from Florida, and Ben Carson, the former United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development from 2017 to 2021\n\nPreviously, there was speculation Trump might pick a woman for the role, with New York Representative Elise Stefanik emerging as one potential pick, for instance. But these new betting odds suggest differently.\n\nNewsweek contacted a representative for Trump by email to comment on this story.\n\nTrump responded: \"They are ... honestly all of those people are good. They're all good, they're all solid.\"\n\nHowever, Noem's fortunes declined following the publication of extracts from her book, in which she revealed how she shot her 14-month old puppy, Cricket because it was aggressive and \"untrainable.\"\n\nHe said: \"No ma'am. What we talked this weekend about how bad the economy is for single parents like the one that raised me. We had a lot of conversations around the room about the importance of eliminating 'Bidenomics' and getting inflation back under 2 percent. We had no conversations about the VP pick to be honest with you, to be clear.\"\n\nSpeaking to Newsweek, Christopher Phelps, a professor of modern American history at the University of Nottingham in the U.K, suggested reasons why high-profile female Republicans may not be selected for the role.\n\nHe said: \"The GOP women's candidate list has been shrinking. The most likely was Kristi Noem, but her memoir's revelations about killing her own dog made her a national joke and took her out of the running.\n\n\"The most Trumpian Congresswomen, Lauren Boebert and Marjorie Taylor Greene, have had recent erratic behavior that means they would be liabilities. Nikki Haley, the most competent Republican option, ran a fierce primary campaign that Trump will not have forgotten, though she still may have a shot at Secretary of State.\n\n\"That leaves only Elise Stefanik, a Representative from New York state, who may not have the name recognition Trump would crave in a running mate.\"\n\nHe added that he thought Vance would be picked and that Carson and Scott seem like outside bets.\n\n\"Although Ben Carson and Tim Scott would be willing to serve, and a Black candidate would help peel away Black male voters from the Democrats, they too seem like long shots,\" he said.\n\nHe continued: \"If I had to put money down, it would be on J.D.

Here are 10 Republicans Trump could pick to be his running mate", "body": "Former President Donald Trump arrives to speak at a news conference at Trump Tower, Friday, May 31, in New York. Julia Nikhinson/AP/AP hide caption\n\nIn a past life, former President Donald Trump hosted the reality competition, \"The Apprentice.\" Now, he's hiring for a new position: his running mate.\n\nWith Trump as the de facto GOP nominee for the 2024 general election, numerous Republicans have been vying to join forces with him and run together against the Democratic ticket, President Biden and Vice President Harris.\n\nAnd Trump has made his vice presidential nominee selection process much like a televised contest between rising stars and seasoned politicians alike who are trying to demonstrate their loyalty. Several contenders, including South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, have recently appeared on cable news shows singing Trump's praises.\n\n\"They're all out there campaigning,\" Trump said on Spectrum News 1 Wisconsin in May. \"It might actually be more effective this way because, you know, every one of them thinks they could be chosen, which I guess possibly is so.\"\n\nA lot hangs in the balance on who Trump chooses: His running mate could help shape the future of the MAGA movement. And, the vice president nominee could woo voters who lean moderate and are skeptical of Trump, along with other voting blocs Trump is looking to tap into.\n\nBut for Trump, who has said he'll announce his pick during the Republican National Convention that's being held from July 15-18, his criteria is straightforward: He wants a supporter loyal to his ways, and someone who can help him win the race.\n\nTim Scott loves Trump. He told Trump that himself this January, and ever since the South Carolina senator dropped out of the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, Scott's loyalty to Trump has only grown stronger.\n\nTea Party Republicans quickly identified Scott as a rising star in the GOP back in 2010, when he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives for South Carolina's 1st district. In 2013, he was appointed by former Gov. Nikki Haley to serve as the state's junior senator, making him the only Black Republican in the Senate.\n\nScott has advised Trump over the years regarding racial justice, particularly in the aftermath of white nationalist rallies that took place in Virginia in 2017.\n\nNoem, a small business owner helping run her family farm in South Dakota, moved into politics in 2006 when she was elected as a state House representative. Just four years later, she headed to Washington, D.C., when she won the state's At-Large seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. She is in her second term as South Dakota's governor.\n\nWhile Noem called for a state lockdown during the start of the pandemic, she moved to a looser stance on social distancing and quickly became a media darling for conservative outlets. She has also passed bills that restrict gender-affirming treatment and are seen as anti-LGBTQ, all of which garnered her praise from conservatives.\n\nOne of the leading conservatives of her generation, Elise Stefanik started off in politics as a newly minted Harvard grad working for President George W. Bush's administration. She was on Mitt Romney's presidential campaign team in 2012, and Paul Ryan mentored her at one point in her career -- all of which is to say: in one lifetime, she was a moderate conservative. She even criticized Trump when the leaked Access Hollywood tape came out in 2016, criticizing him for his \"inappropriate, offensive comments.\"\n\nThat makes how quickly she shed that identity and ascended into Trump's circle all the more remarkable. She spoke strongly in defense of Trump during the 2019 impeachment hearings against him. Two years later, Stefanik became chair of the House Republican Conference in 2021 after Liz Cheney was ousted from that post. She has since been at the forefront of Congressional hearings over antisemitism on college campuses, during which she grilled the presidents of University of Pennsylvania and Harvard last December.\n\nThe governor of North Dakota first made it big as the head of tech company Great Plains Software, which he later sold to Microsoft for $1.1 billion in stock in 2001. He continued to amass a large fortune through his real estate development firm and a software venture capital group, before winning the governor's race in 2016 on an anti-establishment message.\n\nHe made a short-lived bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, but since dropping out last December, he's been a top supporter for Trump.\n\nThe Florida Congressman may only be a two-term newcomer, but Trump is keenly aware of Donalds' starpower, as he has become a media regular advocating for Trump's cause. Donalds, who is a Black evangelical Christian, had been fighting for education reform early on, along with wife Erika Donalds, in the push to implement book bans and expand tax-funded charter schools.\n\nThe Ohio junior senator came to the scene nationally when his memoir Hillbilly Elegy recounting growing up in the Rust Belt came out in 2016. Since then, Vance, who in a past life was a venture capitalist, has offered his vision of anti-monopoly populist economics. He's also warmed up to Trump, after having called himself a Never Trumper. Vance has been seen lobbying top dogs in Silicon Valley on behalf of Trump, and is just one of many loyal supporters having made the trek to his hush money trial in New York.\n\nThe former TV news anchor with more than three decades of experience made the switch to politics in 2021 after becoming increasingly radicalized and disillusioned by the American media climate. She came out blazing as a supporter of Trump early on after the 2020 election, and became a known quantity among far-right circles that spread election conspiracy theories and were connected to the Jan. 6 insurrection. Lake narrowly lost against Democrat Katie Hobbs in the Arizona governor's race in 2022, but has continued to contest that result even as she's running for the Senate this year.\n\nSanders is no political novice: She began working for her dad's unsuccessful Senate race in 1992 as a nine-year-old stuffing envelopes for his campaign before catapulting into political consulting for high profile Republicans, including for Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton when he ran for that post. She was the third woman in U.S. history to serve as U.S. Press Secretary under Trump, a tenure which was marred by a rocky relationship with many reporters. But Trump speaks highly of Sanders, and endorsed her successful 2022 bid to the governor's seat for Arkansas.\n\nWhen Florida Sen. Marco Rubio first ran for his post in 2010, the son of Cuban immigrants was an underdog, making his win all the more exciting for the Republican base. He ran for president in 2016, during which he had heated exchanges with Trump on the debate stage. But the pair, once rivals, are now friends: Rubio has become an ally and the occasional adviser to Trump.\n\nThe former U.N. ambassador and former governor of South Carolina was Trump's strongest opponent in the primaries. During her presidential bid, she touted traditional conservatism as an alternative to some of Trump's MAGA policies, making her an enticing pick to independents and a sliver of Republicans who refuse to vote for Trump. But Haley dropped out of the race after a series of losses in the primaries, including in her home state. She did not endorse Trump or indicate if she would vote for him when she ended her run in early March, though Haley said late May that she would vote for him.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org",

Trump,\" Trump campaign spokesperson Brian Hughes said in a statement shared by the Associated Press.\n\nThe Republican National Convention in July could serve as one potential event to announce a running mate according to a report.\n\nSeveral of the candidates who have been vetted recently were among the key people who showed up at Trump's hush money trial to show support for the former president and in some cases to criticize the legal process and individuals involved as a way for Trump to get around a gag order.\n\nRelated Link: Trump Found Guilty On All 34 Counts In Hush Money Criminal Trial: Here's What Happens Next\n\nBetting Odds: With the recent list of candidates being vetted, the betting odds on prediction market Polymarket have changed.\n\nCalling itself the world's largest prediction market, Polymarket offers betting on items in categories such as politics, sports, cryptocurrency, pop culture and more.\n\nOn Polymarket, users deposit to Polygon (CRYPTO: MATIC) using USDC (CRYPTO: USDC) and can deposit with Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH). Winning wagers cash out at $1.\n\nOver $31 million has been bet on the site for the market of who Trump will choose for his vice president candidate, up from $17 million at the end of April.\n\nHere are the current odds for Trump's vice president on Polymarket, with odds from May 9 in parentheses:\n\nScott has jumped to the top of the leaderboard on Polymarket as the current betting favorite. In early May, the Other Man option was the favorite. With Burgum not listed individually, the North Dakota governor falls into this category.\n\nBurgum has been spending increased time with the former president and viewed by some political experts as a frontrunner.\n\nBack in January, Stefanik and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem were the betting favorites on Polymarket. Controversy may have sent Noem off the shortlist and Stefanik was the only female candidate on the reported list of seven candidates being vetted.\n\nTime will tell who Trump selects as his running mate. With a close election predicted for the head-to-head rematch against President Joe Biden, Trump's vice presidential candidate could prove increasingly important to win over certain demographics and independent voters.\n\nRead Next: Trump Vs.

Trump,\" Trump campaign spokesperson Brian Hughes said in a statement to outlets on Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kari_Lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kari Lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristi_Noem", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kristi Noem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper Money", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/03704ac9a3ed9ad56a4a2bc17f6b71fd", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627777", "eventUri": "eng-9627777", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 779, "textEnd": 786}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

Mel Stride, one of the Prime Minister\u2019s closest allies, said there is \u201cno question\u201d Mr Sunak will lead the Conservatives into polling day, following speculation he could quit in the wake of the D-Day debacle. Work and Pensions Secretary Mr Stride acknowledged the Prime Minister is feeling the backlash over his decision to leave events in Normandy early \u201cvery personally\u201d. In a sign of the febrile atmosphere, rumours about the Prime Minister\u2019s future spread after he decided to campaign without media on Sunday following accusations of \u201cdodging\u201d reporters\u2019 questions on Saturday. Former cabinet minister Nadine Dorries, a fierce critic of Mr Sunak, suggested in a late-night social media post on Saturday there were \u201crumours around tonight that Sunak\u2019s about to fall on his sword\u201d. But Mr Stride told Sky News Mr Sunak will \u201cabsolutely\u201d lead the party into the election.

He also denied that \u201call is lost\u201d for the party, despite an average 20-point poll deficit to Labour. He said \u201ctaxes are coming down\u201d and \u201cwe can continue that journey because of our stewardship of the economy and the fact we have got a plan\u201d. The alternative for voters, he said, is to \u201cgo to Labour, who have got no plan, who simply are going to this \u2018Ming vase strategy\u2019 where they\u2019ve got a poll lead, they don\u2019t want to say anything, tell you anything, no plan, no ideas, anything about the future\u201d. The Work and Pensions Secretary told Sky News that Labour hopes to \u201cdrift across the line almost without anybody noticing\u201d. He told Sky\u2019s Sir Trevor Phillips: \u201cTo your point about whether \u2018all is lost\u2019, we have four weeks, that\u2019s a long time in politics.\u201d He said Mr Sunak \u201cdeeply regrets\u201d his decision to leave D-Day 80th anniversary events in Normandy early. Mr Stride said Mr Sunak is \u201cdeeply patriotic\u201d and committed to supporting veterans. He added: \u201cThe Prime Minister has accepted that he made a mistake. He has apologised unequivocally for that. \u201cI think he will be feeling this personally, very deeply, because he\u2019s a deeply patriotic person. He will be deeply uncomfortable with what has happened.\u201d Mr Stride was seeking to highlight a Tory pledge to halt the rising costs of welfare by reforming the benefits system on the Sunday morning broadcast round. The party claims it would help save some \u00a312 billion a year by the end of the next Parliament, although the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said this \u201clooks difficult in the extreme\u201d as the measures have been previously announced and have therefore already been incorporated into the Budget forecasts. Meanwhile Labour sought to reassure voters with a cast-iron pledge in the manifesto not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT for five years. Sir Keir Starmer told reporters in Essex: \u201cWe will not be raising taxes on working people. That means we won\u2019t be raising income tax, national insurance or VAT. \u201cWe will launch our manifesto very soon and that will have no tax surprises in it because all of our plans are fully funded and fully costed and none of them require tax rises over and above the ones that we\u2019ve already announced.\u201d Sir Keir insisted \u201cwe are not returning to austerity\u201d despite ruling out personal tax rises to pay for public services, claiming he would deliver sustained economic growth. \u201cWhat we do need to do, just to take up the challenge that\u2019s been put to us, is, we do need to grow the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do need to make sure that the economy and living standards across the whole country are growing and that\u2019s why step one in government, if we get to serve our country, will be to stabilise and grow our economy.\u201d The Opposition also highlighted measures to combat anti-social behaviour, particularly the use of off-road bikes. Police will be given new powers to scrap noisy dirt and quad bikes within 48 hours, instead of having to keep them impounded for two weeks, if Labour wins the General Election. The party also promised to deliver 14,000 more prison places as it blamed Conservative inaction for the prison estate bursting at the seams. Shadow justice secretary Shabana Mahmood declined to say whether Labour would ending the Conservative Government\u2019s early release scheme for prisoners, saying her party would have to look at the details of the situation it inherits. She told the BBC: \u201cI think actually the Government needs to level with the public. We all know that prisons are running at either 98% capacity or 99%. It is a dereliction of duty that the Government hasn\u2019t actually released all of the figures about their early release scheme \u2013 they\u2019ve actually been doing that in secret. \u201cIt would be irresponsible for me from Opposition, without seeing the data about the number of offenders that have been released or having all of that information, to make those decisions now.\u201d She said an incoming Labour administration would have to \u201clift that bonnet and see what horrors await\u201d.", "summary": "Rumours about the Prime Minister\u2019s future spread after he decided to campaign without media on Sunday", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/top-tory-reacts-rumour-rishi-29321436", "image": "https://i2-prod.lancs.live/incoming/article29309212.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS335502840.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:24:34", "author": "Andrew Bardsley", "authors": ["Andrew Bardsley"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.038}

{"id": 225034710, "title": "The New Rebels: These Diverse Country Artists Are Embracing Their True Selves In Their Music", "text": "When independent country singer Chris Housman attended high school in a rural Kansas town of just 200 people, he bought a copy of the gay cowboy movie Brokeback Mountain, smuggled it to a friend\u2019s house under his shirt and viewed it at a later date. \u201cI just bawled watching that,\u201d he remembers over coffee in East Nashville. In April, Housman issued a video for his song \u201cGuilty As Sin\u201d that features him wrapped in shirtless passion with another man. He\u2019s no longer hiding, instead proclaiming his identity in his debut album \u2014 Blueneck, due May 31 \u2014 which features songs such as \u201cDrag Queen\u201d and \u201cBible Belt,\u201d owning his God-given traits with the same fervor that more traditional country artists might apply to their Southern roots or small-town heritage. It happens at a time when minority country artists are more frequently demanding a place at the table and increasingly embracing their differences in their music, not just their marketing. In addition to Housman, Tiera Kennedy \u2014 fresh off her appearance on \u201cBlackbiird,\u201d from the Beyonc\u00e8 album Carter Country \u2014 released \u201cI Ain\u2019t a Cowgirl,\u201d an aspirational ballad that lays out through thinly veiled Western metaphors her plan to succeed as a Black female country singer. And Stoney Creek artist Frank Ray released \u201cUh-Huh (Aj\u00e0),\u201d his first radio single to sonically feature his racial heritage, employing Spanish lyrics alongside the English phrases in a production that sounds a bit like \u201cDespacito\u201d without the hip-hop elements. \u201cI embrace it in every other sense of my artistry,\u201d Ray says. \u201cWhether it\u2019s on social media platforms, or whether it\u2019s in a live performance, or whether it\u2019s with merch, you see the Latin influence there. And then for some reason, when we\u2019re going to pick a new single, it\u2019s anything but the Latin vibe, and I was like, \u2018What are we doing? Why are we missing that?\u2019 \u201d These three assertive works all arrived in the last two months, around the same time that Beyonc\u00e8 became the first Black woman to rule both Top Country Albums and Hot Country Songs, followed at the summit on the latter chart by Shaboozey\u2019s \u201cA Bar Song (Tipsy).\u201d The tracks had already been completed \u2014 Kennedy penned \u201cCowgirl\u201d in late 2022 or 2023, and Housman authored \u201cGuilty As Sin\u201d in November 2020 \u2014 but the success of Beyonc\u00e8 and Shaboozey more strongly established that an audience exists for a brand of country with a progressive sound by artists with a nontraditional bio. \u201cBeyonc\u00e8 has sort of allowed the voiceless to have a voice through that one album and the publicity that surrounds it,\u201d says director-producer Francis Whately, whose independent movie Rebel Country will make its world premiere on June 10 during the Tribeca Festival in New York. \u201cShe\u2019s made it acceptable and given permission to all those artists who didn\u2019t really have a voice to now have a voice and say, \u2018I\u2019m country too.\u2019 \u201d Rebel Country examines the modern version of the genre\u2019s rabble rousers who are pushing against the established sounds and systems that have guided the format. \u201cThe rebels of the past were the hard-drinking, womanizing, drug-taking, prison-visiting rebel males,\u201d notes Whately. \u201cThe new rebels are people who are challenging the conservative system inherent within country music by dent of simply being gay, or bisexual, or African American, or Mexican, or whatever it is.\u201d There is, to be sure, a greater interest in promoting them among Nashville\u2019s music industry. Diversity programs have been enacted by the Country Music Association, the Academy of Country Music and CMT. Labels have actively sought Latin American voices and Black (though mostly male) artists, with Darius Rucker, Blanco Brown, Kane Brown and BRELAND among the handful who\u2019ve generated actual country hits. That difference seems to be enticing to many of the format\u2019s decision-makers, who recognize the demographic changes taking place in America, particularly among youth, who are traditionally the most active music consumers. But there\u2019s likewise a tendency to conform to what\u2019s already working \u2014 particularly at radio \u2014 and that has made for more caution when it comes to singles. Kennedy lost her deal with Valory after a pair of pop-country singles failed to light up the marketplace. After some initial hurt, she sees it as a lesson learned and intends to be more forceful in releasing music that reflects her creative spirit instead of letting the business culture dictate that. \u201cI\u2019ve listened to stories of Shania [Twain]and Dolly [Parton], and I think at some point every artist goes through that,\u201d Kennedy reasons. \u201cThey always come out on the other end of like, \u2018Man, I should have just listened to my heart from the very beginning.\u2019 And so I decided to do that.\u201d It is easy for nontraditional artists to let the market lead. They have, after all, been conditioned to believe that a large segment of the audience will reject them. Ray remembers a particular radio programmer who denigrated his Latin-flavored material, making him gun-shy about issuing it to broadcasters, even though it gives him an instant brand of his own. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how much that would hinder my creativity,\u201d says Ray. \u201cWhy am I going to take this one person\u2019s curmudgeon remark and shelve this whole Latin country idea that I\u2019ve been hoping for? And it wasn\u2019t until recently where I decided to say \u2014 pardon my French \u2014 \u2018Forget my fucking insecurity. Let\u2019s go all the way.\u2019 \u201d The advent of the internet, social media and digital platforms has made it easier for these artists to find their audiences. Housman, for example, anticipated he would be flooded with hate-filled public comments or \u2014 maybe worse \u2014 no reaction at all. Instead, he has discovered that with the rare exception, consumers have reacted positively. One YouTube respondent from his native Kansas wrote that Housman is \u201csaving lives with your music.\u201d Modern technology has made it easier for country fans who think of themselves as isolated to discover expansive artists and music. It has also made consumers in other genres more open to country. That, in turn, creates more possibility for artists who are outside the genre\u2019s historic box. \u201cThe way I\u2019ve been looking at it,\u201d Housman says, \u201cis a little like a house of country music as a foundation. It\u2019s already there, already established. I\u2019m not trying to knock that house down and start from scratch necessarily, but I think we can add a nice little back sunroom with a little tiki bar for the gays and a little pool. But I think you can build [upon] the foundation that\u2019s already there, and that just makes the value of the property go up.\u201d The artists remain aware of the potential hostilities. Country is stereotypically considered a conservative genre, and campaign efforts by the presumed Republican presidential nominee have referenced concentration camps, dictatorship, a \u201cunified Reich\u201d and revenge. Given the climate, their willingness to not just pursue their music, but to also proclaim their differences is an act of bravery. But also one of faith. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hate in this world, and there will always be hate in this world,\u201d Kennedy says. \u201cBut I think the best way to counteract that is to love other people. Love always wins \u2014 always wins \u2014 at the end of the day.\u201d Subscribe to Billboard Country Update, the industry\u2019s must-have source for news, charts, analysis and features.

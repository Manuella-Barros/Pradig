The under-fire party chief was forced to issue a denial after the Sunday Mail reported that expenses claims were hushed up for travel to his job as a football referee. A Tory Party whistleblower told the newspaper his team had identified 28 \u201cdodgy\u201d claims he made to Westminster after being confronted about possible rule-breaking. The source said the team discussed the travel claims when contacted by journalists back in 2021 but hoped nobody would pick them up. The reports came to light only after the outcry over the ousting of ex-Tory candidate David Duguid in Aberdeenshire North and Moray East because of health concerns. Mr Ross stepped in on Thursday and decided to take on the job himself \u2013 despite his promise to step down as Moray MP and focus on his MSP job and leadership role. The newspaper claims Mr Ross billed the taxpayer for flights between to London to Glasgow and Edinburgh, where they say he was working as an SFA linesman. He has denied knowing about his team\u2019s concerns around the story coming out. In November 2021, he was forced to refer himself to the Standards Commissioner for failing to declare more than \u00a328,000 in outside earnings from his role as an MSP and football linesman. But he avoided sanctions after the ruling found he did not intend to deliberately mislead the public by his omission. Ross denies any wrongdoing On Sunday, Mr Ross denied any wrongdoing and said he is happy for his expenses to be looked at again. In a statement, he said: \u201cI have only ever claimed expenses related to my role as a member of parliament and the costs of getting me to and from Westminster. \u201cThese have all been agreed by IPSA, the independent body that oversees MPs expenses, but I would have no issue with them being scrutinised again.\u201d Party insiders previously told the P&J the mood was \u201cmixed\u201d over the party leader\u2019s decision to stand in Mr Duguid\u2019s place. They warned it is \u201cnot tenable\u201d for Mr Ross to serve at both Holyrood and Westminster for another five years. The Scottish Tory leader said the \u201cvery unique circumstances\u201d and timings meant the party had just over 24 hours to get another candidate in place in the seat, so he decided to put himself forward. Mr Duguid, who is still in hospital in Glasgow, has been posting regular updates on social media and has rejected claims he is \u201cunable to stand\u201d as \u201csimply incorrect\u201d. In his most recent post on Saturday, he confirmed he visited the hospital shopping arcade using his wheelchair and bought some newspapers. \u201cI was a bit surprised to see so many of them describe me as \u2018seriously ill\u2019. \u201cThat was true when I was in intensive care in Aberdeen Royal Infirmary a month ago. But certainly not now. \u201cI continue to be fully focussed on my rehabilitation and making great progress daily.\u201d Read more: Election Spotlight: Is this the beginning of the end for North Sea oil and gas?

The popular Escape to the Country host had been open about his battle with terminal lung cancer over the past three years, touching many lives with his candid updates. His family announced his passing on February 2, praising his unwavering strength and courage throughout his fight against the disease. Jonnie was always honest about the harsh realities of his condition, regularly sharing updates with his followers on Instagram. His final video showed him filming the new windows he'd installed at his home, a post that hit hard for many following the news of his death. In the caption, Jonnie wrote: \"I was tempted to spray the remaining windows, but after interviewing someone that actually knows what they're talking about I changed my plans. This more than any other reno has been a fluid process! Check out the film we made on Morning Live on @bbciplayer, it's worth a watch. Look out for the episode on 13/11/23. Or go straight to Richard who's tagged.\" Following his death, fans reflected on this post, with one commenting: \"He must have known he had just a week left... life is outrageously cruel when so many shallow, inflated ego souls survive him\", reports the Mirror. Another added: \"Making changes to his family house as if to make them comfortable after. What a gentleman, loved him on the programmes.\" Despite facing a grim prognosis, Jonnie - father to son Rex and twins Rafa and Cormac with his wife Jess - remained determined to embrace life. A month before his passing, on the Conversations with Jane McLelland podcast, he shared: \"One of the reasons I think I'm still here is I'm not a cancer patient. It's always there at the back of your mind, but I'm living with cancer, not dying with cancer.\" In preparation for a future he wouldn't be part of, Jonnie purchased birthday presents for his children's 18th birthdays. Speaking to Hello! Magazine last year, he reflected on his legacy, stating: \"It pains me to think the twins probably won't remember me. You hear people say: 'I don't remember my dad. He died when I was so young.' I think about that and it breaks my heart because that's what I'm destined to be, really - a footnote in their life. So, I try to have monuments of my love for them.\" Jonnie also took steps to secure his family's financial future by purchasing the Newcastle house where his boys reside, ensuring they would not be burdened by a mortgage. In his poignant interview last year, he expressed his final wish: \"I had a tough upbringing and I've managed to do a lot in my life, despite that, but I don't want them to struggle.\" A spokesperson for the family announced the sad news of his passing on Instagram on February 2, stating: \"It is with heavy hearts that we share the news of Jonnie's passing. A truly remarkable soul, he fought bravely against cancer with unwavering strength and courage. Jonnie touched the lives of so many with his kindness, warmth, and infectious spirit.\" The statement continued, requesting privacy for the grieving family: \"At this time, we kindly ask for the privacy of Jonnie's family as they navigate through this profound loss. Their grief is immeasurable, and your thoughts, prayers, and support are deeply appreciated. \"As we remember the beautiful moments shared with Jonnie, let us celebrate a life well-lived and a legacy that will forever be etched in our hearts. Jonnie may be gone from our sight, but his love, laughter, and memories will live on. Rest in peace, dear Jonnie. You will be dearly missed, but never forgotten.\" In a poignant Instagram post, his wife Jess also paid tribute to her late husband: \"Good night my favourite. Thank you for everything. I will always love you. The hardest day has come, a day I prayed wouldn't come. It's with all the sadness in the world that I confirm Jonnie has passed away earlier today. His magical brain that continued to fight to the end has now gone to sleep. \"He has given me more than I could ever have wished for, eight bonkers years of love and adventure and three amazing boys. I will continue to make you proud but only with your love still finding me and guiding me for the rest of my life, me and the boys still need you. \"Jonnie you really were the most handsome man I ever knew and I am so sorry for this cruel end. It really wasn't fair and you didn't deserve any of this. You gave so much time to others and touched everyone you met, I have never experienced anything like the effect you had on people. I love you so much and forever proud of you xxx.\" Get the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

The jeans, at least, are tapered. Oh, and there are neck ties, in blue.\n\nFor the closing ceremony, the team will wear sharp white, moto-style denim jeans with matching jackets designed in, yes, patriotic red, white and blue.\n\nThe company gathered a few Paris-bound athletes to show off the parade uniforms for the Summer Games that begin next month in one of the world's fashion capitals.\n\nDaniela Moroz, 23, is competing in sailing at her first Olympics. She loved the racing details of the closing look she modeled, down to the shoes. The zip jackets have \"USA\" splashed across the front in huge letters, with \"Team USA\" in blue high on the outside seam of one pant leg. Team caps are duck bill: The visor is in white, with red and blue details.\n\n\"I'm a racer on the water so that really speaks to me,\" said Moroz, born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, of the moto touches. \"It's super comfortable.\"\n\nLauren called the closing ceremony looks \"more graphic, more fun, a little more exciting.\"\n\nThe company also designed Team USA gear available for sale starting Tuesday at RalphLauren.com, TeamUSAShop.com and company stores in the U.S. and France. Among the wares on offer are polo shirts made of 100% recycled cotton. It's the first time Ralph Lauren has achieved that level of sustainability in Olympic gear, David Lauren said.\n\nThe customizable polo shirt \"feels almost like a performance material that has better wicking, better breathability, better stretch,\" he said. \"And it's a test for us to see how we can evolve in the future. The Olympics has always been an amazing place to test newness, to try innovation, and to explore with our athletes what the future could look like.\"\n\nSome proceeds of retail sales go to help support U.S. athletes training for their Olympic moments. Lauren wouldn't be more specific on how much money the company sends their way.\n\nThe opening and closing ceremony uniforms, the same for the Olympics and subsequent Paralympics, were made in the U.S. The gear on sale to the public was made in both the U.S. and other countries.\n\nJamal Hill, a Paralympic swimmer who earned a bronze medal in Tokyo, is returning to compete in Paris at age 29. He thinks the uniforms will resonate with millennials and Gen Z.\n\n\"They have a really, really nice unique modern flair,\" said Hill, who grew up in Los Angeles.\n\nFencer Daryl Homer, 33, will be Paris as an alternate after he tore his Achilles tendon a month before qualification. It's his fourth trip to the Olympics. He earned a silver medal in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nOf the blue denim moment, Homer said: \"It's very modern, it's approachable. We're going to be walking in Paris in the heat. It's a lighter look with a bit more room to move around.\"\n\nKamren Larsen, a 24-year-old BMX racer from Bakersfield, California, is headed to his first Olympics. He thinks the crisp blazers with Oxford shirts balance out the more laid-back nature of the jeans.\n\n\"I think Ralph did a good job in diversifying,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nFor more coverage of the 2024

The jeans, at least, are tapered. Oh, and there are neck ties, in blue.\n\nFor the closing ceremony, the team will wear sharp white, moto-style denim jeans with matching jackets designed in, yes, patriotic red, white and blue.\n\nThe company gathered a few Paris-bound athletes to show off the parade uniforms for the Summer Games that begin next month in one of the world's fashion capitals.\n\nDaniela Moroz, 23, is competing in sailing at her first Olympics. She loved the racing details of the closing look she modeled, down to the shoes. The zip jackets have \"USA\" splashed across the front in huge letters, with \"Team USA\" in blue high on the outside seam of one pant leg. Team caps are duck bill: The visor is in white, with red and blue details.\n\n\"I'm a racer on the water so that really speaks to me,\" said Moroz, born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, of the moto touches. \"It's super comfortable.\"\n\nLauren called the closing ceremony looks \"more graphic, more fun, a little more exciting.\"\n\nThe company also designed Team USA gear available for sale starting Tuesday at RalphLauren.com, TeamUSAShop.com and company stores in the U.S. and France. Among the wares on offer are polo shirts made of 100% recycled cotton. It's the first time Ralph Lauren has achieved that level of sustainability in Olympic gear, David Lauren said.\n\nThe customizable polo shirt \"feels almost like a performance material that has better wicking, better breathability, better stretch,\" he said. \"And it's a test for us to see how we can evolve in the future. The Olympics has always been an amazing place to test newness, to try innovation, and to explore with our athletes what the future could look like.\"\n\nSome proceeds of retail sales go to help support U.S. athletes training for their Olympic moments. Lauren wouldn't be more specific on how much money the company sends their way.\n\nThe opening and closing ceremony uniforms, the same for the Olympics and subsequent Paralympics, were made in the U.S. The gear on sale to the public was made in both the U.S. and other countries.\n\nJamal Hill, a Paralympic swimmer who earned a bronze medal in Tokyo, is returning to compete in Paris at age 29. He thinks the uniforms will resonate with millennials and Gen Z.\n\n\"They have a really, really nice unique modern flair,\" said Hill, who grew up in Los Angeles.\n\nFencer Daryl Homer, 33, will be Paris as an alternate after he tore his Achilles tendon a month before qualification. It's his fourth trip to the Olympics. He earned a silver medal in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nOf the blue denim moment, Homer said: \"It's very modern, it's approachable. We're going to be walking in Paris in the heat. It's a lighter look with a bit more room to move around.\"\n\nKamren Larsen, a 24-year-old BMX racer from Bakersfield, California, is headed to his first Olympics. He thinks the crisp blazers with Oxford shirts balance out the more laid-back nature of the jeans.\n\n\"I think Ralph did a good job in diversifying,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nFor more coverage of the 2024

The jeans, at least, are tapered. Oh, and there are neck ties, in blue.\n\nFor the closing ceremony, the team will wear sharp white, moto-style denim jeans with matching jackets designed in, yes, patriotic red, white and blue.\n\nThe company gathered a few Paris-bound athletes to show off the parade uniforms for the Summer Games that begin next month in one of the world's fashion capitals.\n\nDaniela Moroz, 23, is competing in sailing at her first Olympics. She loved the racing details of the closing look she modeled, down to the shoes. The zip jackets have \"USA\" splashed across the front in huge letters, with \"Team USA\" in blue high on the outside seam of one pant leg. Team caps are duck bill: The visor is in white, with red and blue details.\n\n\"I'm a racer on the water so that really speaks to me,\" said Moroz, born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, of the moto touches. \"It's super comfortable.\"\n\nLauren called the closing ceremony looks \"more graphic, more fun, a little more exciting.\"\n\nThe company also designed Team USA gear available for sale starting Tuesday at RalphLauren.com, TeamUSAShop.com and company stores in the US and France. Among the wares on offer are polo shirts made of 100% recycled cotton. It's the first time Ralph Lauren has achieved that level of sustainability in Olympic gear, David Lauren said.\n\nThe customizable polo shirt \"feels almost like a performance material that has better wicking, better breathability, better stretch,\" he said. \"And it's a test for us to see how we can evolve in the future. The Olympics has always been an amazing place to test newness, to try innovation, and to explore with our athletes what the future could look like.\"\n\nSome proceeds of retail sales go to help support US athletes training for their Olympic moments. Lauren wouldn't be more specific on how much money the company sends their way.\n\nJamal Hill, a Paralympic swimmer who earned a bronze medal in Tokyo, is returning to compete in Paris at age 29. He thinks the uniforms will resonate with millennials and Gen Z.\n\n\"They have a really, really nice unique modern flair,\" said Hill, who grew up in Los Angeles.\n\nFencer Daryl Homer, 33, will be in Paris as an alternate after he tore his achilles tendon a month before qualification. It's his fourth trip to the Olympics. He earned a silver medal in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nOf the blue denim moment, Homer said: \"It's very modern, it's approachable. We're going to be walking in Paris in the heat. It's a lighter look with a bit more room to move around.\"\n\nKamren Larsen, a 24-year-old BMX racer from Bakersfield, California, is heading to his first Olympics. He thinks the crisp blazers with Oxford shirts balance out the more laid-back nature of the jeans.\n\n\"I think Ralph did a good job in diversifying,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com",

And it gives the athletes a chance to feel a sense of a culture but also feel like themselves and what is natural.\"\n\nTeam USA will wear wool blazers that are colored with red, white, and blue, and will couple that with a blue-and-white striped Oxford shirt and cream-colored suede shoes. The jeans are expected to be tapered, while the Americans will also sport blue neckties.\n\nThe American athletes who are serving as Team USA's flag bearers will receive different colorways to stand out during the opening ceremony.\n\nWhen Team USA participates in the closing ceremony, they will wear white, moto-style denim jeans that will include matching jackets consisting of red, white, and blue.

He thinks the uniforms will resonate with millennials and Gen Z.\n\n\"They have a really, really nice unique modern flair,\" said Hill, who grew up in Los Angeles.\n\nFencer Daryl Homer, 33, will be Paris as an alternate after he tore his Achilles tendon a month before qualification. It's his fourth trip to the Olympics. He earned a silver medal in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nOf the blue denim moment, Homer said: \"It's very modern, it's approachable.

Ralph Lauren the brand revealed the outfits on Tuesday, the Associated Press reported, and they combine the label's classic tailoring with workwear staples.\n\n\"We work very closely with Team USA to make the athletes feel at once dressed up, feel like a team, but at the same time comfortable and very distinctively American,\" said David Lauren, the chief branding and innovation officer at Ralph Lauren, according to the AP. \"Nothing says America like blue jeans, especially when we're in Paris . . . And it gives the athletes a chance to feel a sense of a culture but also feel like themselves and what is natural.\"\n\nDuring the opening ceremony, the American athletes will don tapered blue jeans and single-breasted navy wool blazers with red and white tipping. A white striped Oxford shirt will be paired with a blue necktie, and cream suede buck lace-up shoes will round out the look. As for the closing ceremony, Team USA will rock a more casual outfit: White moto-style jeans, which have \"Team USA\" written in blue on the outside seam of one leg; a matching zip jacket, with \"USA\" written similarly across the front; and a duckbill cap.\n\nIt sounds like the athletes are on board with what Ralph Lauren has dreamed up in its ninth time dressing Team USA for the Olympics. \"They have a really, really nice unique modern flair,\" the Paralympic swimmer Jamal Hill told the AP about the uniforms. \"I think Ralph did a good job in diversifying,\" agreed the BMX racer Kamren Larsen.\n\nWhile the Ralph Lauren garb is exclusive to the members of Team USA, the brand did also design merch for the public. Some of those proceeds will go toward athletes training for the Olympics, although David Lauren wouldn't specify how the funds are split up.\n\nMany viewers will be tuning in to see how Team USA performs when the Olympics kick off next month, but we'll have our eyes peeled for the outfits during the opening and closing parades, too.", "source": {"uri": "robbreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Robb Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tori_latham@robbreport.com", "name": "Tori Latham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Lauren", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ralph Lauren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workwear", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Workwear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denim", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-breasted", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-breasted"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lauren", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Lauren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blazer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dress shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suede", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suede"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wool", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necktie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Necktie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BMX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hispanic_whites", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-Hispanic whites"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paralympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://robbreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ralph-Lauren-Olympics.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661620", "eventUri": "eng-9661620", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Instead, the American team will join a group of 10,500 athletes who will travel 3.7 miles by boat down the River Seine before disembarking at the open-air, opening ceremony just outside the Eiffel Tower. It is the first year the opening ceremony will not be held in a stadium.\n\nThe U.S Olympic Team apparel that will be seen along the banks of the River Seine during the Games' kickoff party highlight a truly American sensibility, including blue blazers and tapered denim.\n\nYes, blue jeans. Blue jeans are distinctly American, and the denim pants date back to the 1800s as an American work product. In the 1950s, blue jeans became a casual fashion statement that still holds true today.\n\n\"Nothing says America like blue jeans, especially when we're in Paris,\" Lauren told the Associated Press. \"And it gives the athletes a chance to feel a sense of culture but also feel like themselves and what is natural.\n\n\"We work very closely with Team USA to make the athletes feel at once dressed up, feel like a team, but at the same time comfortable and very distinctively American.\"\n\nLauren, America's preeminent fashion maven, has designed Team USA apparel since 2008. In 2014, after a controversy concerning items that were made in China, Lauren began manufacturing the entire athlete parade clothing collection in the United States by forming partnerships with America's finest manufacturers.\n\nAnd again, for 2024, Lauren worked with many manufacturers across the U.S.\n\nTo produce Team USA uniforms for the traditional Games as well as the Paralympic Games, apparel manufacturers from Maine and New York to California and Oregon partnered with Lauren to achieve the distinctive American style.\n\nCompanies involved include Ferrera Manufacturing in New York, which made the blazer and woven shirt for the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony racing jacket and flagbearer jacket; Andari Fashion, Inc., in California, which assembled and manufactured the opening ceremony's knit tie and polo shirt and flagbearer shirt for the closing ceremony; Shaniko Wool Company in Oregon, which provided the wool for the opening ceremony blazer; Rancourt & Co in Maine, which assembled and manufactured the shoes the athletes will wear to the two ceremonies; Rogue Industries in Maine, which crafted the belt for the ceremonies; and Saitex USA in California, which assembled and manufactured blue jeans.\n\n\"For nearly 60 years, Ralph Lauren has been a pioneer at the intersection of style and sport\" said David Lauren, chief branding and innovation officer and the son of Ralph. \"The vibrancy, passion and self-expression in sport has been a central touchpoint of inspiration for our brand since the very beginning of the iconic Polo brand in 1967.\n\n\"This summer, Paris is the backdrop where fashion and sport will collide on the world's stage, with a global audience and that is an incredibly exciting proposition.\"\n\nFor the opening ceremonies, both men and women will wear single-breasted, wool navy blazers with a red-and-white ribbon trim. They will be worn over a blue-and-white striped Oxford shirt and paired with pre-washed denim jeans and suede white buck shoes. Men will sport a navy tie.\n\nFor the closing ceremonies, the look is more casual. Instead of the classic blazer that has become a staple of Ralph Lauren designed Olympic attire, Team USA will sport a white racing jacket to be worn with white jeans emblazoned with TEAM USA on the left leg and Lauren's classic Polo shirt. The jacket, which might be more at home at an auto racing event, is adorned with numerous patches and the American flag.\n\n\"Ralph Lauren has once again created designs that not only capture the essence of American style but also embody the spirit and pride of Team USA,\" said Sarah Hirshland, U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee CEO. \"As Team USA athletes prepare to represent the United States at the upcoming Olympic and Paralympic Games, this iconic apparel serves as a symbol of unity and inspiration for both our team and the millions of fans who will be cheering them on.\"\n\nThe Ralph Lauren designs include a more aggressive emphasis on sustainability than in years past. Team USA's opening and closing ceremony parade uniforms are crafted with recycled polyester and USA-grown Responsible Wool Standard (RWS) certified wool among other materials.\n\nThe Games of the XXXIII Olympiad officially begin with the opening ceremonies on Friday, July 26. Closing ceremonies will be held on Sunday, August 11 from Stade de France, the country's national stadium.\n\nThe Paris Paralympics 2024 begin on Wednesday, August 28 and will conclude on Sunday, September 8.\n\nAmerican-made Team USA apparel is now available for purchase online.

For the opening ceremony on the Seine, the designer has opted to outfit the Olympians in a classic navy Ralph Lauren blazer with red and white detailing, paired with a striped Oxford shirt, navy knit tie, and tapered light denim jeans.\n\nDavid Lauren, the company's chief branding and innovation officer, and its founder's son, was unbothered by the casualness of blue denim.\n\n\"We work very closely with Team USA to make the athletes feel at once dressed up, feel like a team, but at the same time comfortable and very distinctively American,\" he told The Associated Press on Monday during a media preview at the company's posh New York headquarters.\n\n\"Nothing says America like blue jeans,\" Lauren added.\n\nFencer Daryl Homer thinks denim was the more \"modern and approachable\" take on team uniforms.\n\n\"We're going to be walking in Paris in the heat. It's a lighter look with a bit more room to move around,\" he said.\n\nThe uniforms for the closing ceremony on 11 August will have a sportier feel. Athletes will wear a racing-style jacket emblazoned with various Team USA logos, together with the Ralph Lauren logo, against a colour-blocked backdrop of red, white and blue. The jacket is paired with a Team USA belt, a classic polo shirt, a baseball cap and white denim jeans with \"Team USA\" printed on one leg.\n\nDaniela Moroz, competing in sailing at her first Olympics, said she loved the racing details of the closing look she modelled for the launch, down to the shoes. Paralympic swimmer Jamal Hill was also a fan of the closing ceremony outfit. To him, it's a combination of \"cowboy tuxedo\" vibes and Formula 1 style.\n\n\"I'm a racer on the water so that really speaks to me,\" said Moroz, who was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, of the moto touches. \"It's super comfortable.\"\n\n\"I'll definitely be wearing it outside the Paralympic Village,\" Hill added.\n\nWhile Ralph Lauren has the opening and closing ceremonies covered, Nike is outfitting athletes for the medal ceremonies and Team USA medallists will sport blue zip-up jackets and stretchy tapered pants.", "source": {"uri": "insidethegames.biz", "dataType":

For the opening ceremony, which takes place in the French capital on July 26, the fashion brand has dressed US athletes in a classic tailored ensemble. The look features a navy blue, single-breasted wool blazer with red and white tipping and a striped oxford shirt, paired with denim jeans and a suede buck shoe.\n\nMeanwhile, the uniforms for the closing ceremony features a more sporty style - a white moto jacket emblazoned with \"USA\" across it, along with white denim jeans and a Polo shirt underneath.\n\n\"Ralph Lauren has once again created designs that not only capture the essence of American style but also embody the spirit and pride of Team USA,\" said Sarah Hirshland, US Olympic and Paralympic committee CEO, in a press release. \"As Team USA athletes prepare to represent the United States at the upcoming Olympic and Paralympic Games, this iconic apparel serves as a symbol of unity and inspiration for both our team and the millions of fans who will be cheering them on.\"\n\nWhile Team USA's uniforms have been known to receive some divided reactions in years past, as Ralph Lauren unveiled the patriotic looks on Tuesday, it seemed that everyone was pretty much in agreement this time around - that the closing ceremony uniforms appear more fitting for a Nascar race than for the fashion capital of the world.\n\n\"Nascar is an Olympic sport now?\" one critic wrote on X, formerly Twitter, in response to Team USA's uniforms.\n\n\"Top looks great, but why did they go full Nascar on the bottom?\" said someone else, referring to the white moto-style jacket. \"Gonna be hot as hell.\"\n\nMeanwhile on Instagram, one person compared the Ralph Lauren uniforms to Will Ferrell's outlandish Nascar-driving character, Ricky Bobby, in the 2006 comedy film Talladega Nights.\n\n\"The bottom jacket looks like Ricky Bobby's racing attire in Talladega Nights,\" they said, as another user agreed: \"That's EXACTLY what I was thinking.\"\n\nHowever, not everyone believed the uniforms resembled something of a racecar driver. Instead, some people offered up other comparisons, like a Nasa astronaut.\n\n\"When you've got a business lunch at noon but you're going to space at three,\" one person joked on X.\n\n\"Is the plan to go to the moon after the closing ceremony?\" another user quipped.\n\nAt a preview of the Team USA 2024 collection on Monday, David Lauren - the company's chief branding and innovation officer and its founder's son - spoke to The Associated Press about the fashion brand's \"unexpected\" yet classic Team USA uniforms.\n\n\"We work very closely with Team USA to make the athletes feel at once dressed up, feel like a team, but at the same time comfortable and very distinctively American,\" he told the AP. \"Nothing says America like blue jeans, especially when we're in Paris. And it gives the athletes a chance to feel a sense of a culture but also feel like themselves and what is natural.\"\n\nLauren also called the closing ceremony looks \"more graphic, more fun, a little more exciting.\"\n\nTeam USA's polo shirts are made of 100 percent recycled cotton - the first time Ralph Lauren has achieved that level of sustainability in Olympic gear, Lauren said. Both the opening and closing ceremony uniforms were made and manufactured in the US.\n\nRalph Lauren's Team USA opening and closing ceremony uniform apparel, as well as a collection of Team USA apparel and accessories, are available to purchase online. Along with the navy blue blazer ensemble and the white moto-style look, the fashion brand also released a Team USA color-blocked baseball jacket, a Team USA graphic cotton sweater, and several other clothing items.\n\nThe 2024 Olympics Games kicks off in Paris on July 26 with an opening ceremony, this time taking place along the river Seine instead of a stadium. Boats for each nation will cross through the center of Paris and finish at the Trocadero - the gardens across from the Eiffel Tower - where the final Olympic traditions will take place. The closing ceremony will be held at the Stade de France.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "meredith_clark@yahoo.com", "name": "Meredith

I think that Ralph Lauren is able to understand that ethos and bring it to life,\" Lauren continued.\n\n\"And that's the dream -- that is the American dream for us at Ralph Lauren and for everybody watching.\"\n\nFlying the flag for American fashion\n\nAt the opening ceremony, which will see Olympians traveling down the River Seine on boats towards the city's famed Trocad\u00e9ro, Team USA athletes will wear a classic navy Ralph Lauren blazer with red and white detailing, paired with a striped Oxford shirt, navy knit tie, and tapered light denim jeans.\n\nDenim is also a prominent feature in the closing ceremony ensembles. For this occasion, Ralph Lauren designed a racecar-style jacket with USA patch detailing, a a classic striped polo and crisp white jeans.\n\n\"I think this collection in its entirety does a really good job of combining classic American style with a little bit more of that contemporary feel,\" Paralympic swimmer Jamal Hill, a bronze medal-winner at the 2020 Tokyo Games, told CNN. \"I'm wearing this to the all-white party,\" he noted, with a laugh, of the closing ceremony look in particular, adding, \"my only regret is that when I come home, the season for all-white will be almost over.\"\n\nThe athletes honored as Team USA's flag bearers at the opening and closing ceremonies will receive versions of these looks in different colorways to help them stand out in the crowds. Beyond this, athletes will also receive pieces from a special, commemorative \"Villagewear\" collection. Named in reference to the Athletes' Village, the clothing line (which will be available to purchase) will feature version of classic Ralph Lauren pieces -- jackets and sweaters, rugby shirts, knits, joggers, color-blocked tees and much more. In a first for the brand, this year there is also a \"100% recycled\" polo shirt in the mix.\n\n\"Ralph Lauren has once again created designs that not only capture the essence of American style but also embody the spirit and pride of Team USA,\" Sarah Hirshland, CEO of the US Olympic & Paralympic Committee, said in a statement. \"This iconic apparel serves as a symbol of unity and inspiration for both our team and the millions of fans who will be cheering them on.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

To him, it's a combination of \"cowboy tuxedo\" vibes and Formula 1 style.\n\nThe entire Paris 2024 collection is appealing, he said.\n\n\"A really great infusion of modern style along with that classic American energy,\" he said. \"I'll definitely be wearing it outside the Paralympic Village.\"\n\nRalph Lauren works closely with Team USA and the goal, as always, is to \"do something graphic and uniquely American,\" chief brand and innovation officer David Lauren said.\n\n\"This is definitely the most exciting Olympics we've been a part of,\" Lauren told USA TODAY. \"The opportunity to go to Paris, to be in the center of Europe, it feels like you're in the center of the world for this one.\"\n\nEverything produced by Ralph Lauren borrows from the style the company has developed since it began in 1967. The closing ceremony race jacket \"is already one of the most-coveted pieces we've created,\" Lauren said.\n\nThe opening ceremony uniform is a modern take on a tailored look. On top, a tailored single-breasted wool blazer with red and white tipping is worn over a striped oxford shirt. The bottom is a more casual tapered jean and classic suede buck shoe fit.\n\n\"I really enjoy this opening ceremony (jacket),\" BMX rider Kamren Larsen told USA TODAY. \"It makes me feel dapper. It's cliche, but look good, feel good, and hopefully you can be good, too.\"\n\nTo account for the heat, the company constantly looks at different fabrics and layering systems to keep the athlete's body temperature in check, Lauren said. All items in both the opening and closing ceremony outfits are manufactured in the United States.\n\nAnother piece of the collection that received universal praise from the athletes was a retro bomber jacket.\n\n\"It has a really nice 80s vibe to it,\" para-track athlete Roderick Townsend said.\n\nTownsend also liked the racing jacket from the closing ceremony, but as someone who calls Phoenix, Arizona home, he may not have much need for it in the future.\n\nThe village-wear collection features the brand's first-ever 100% recycled cotton Polo shirt. Other village-wear items include sporty varsity jackets, vintage-style rugby shirts and the classic American flag sweater with a twist.\n\n\"They just hit the nail on the head with everything,\" Moroz said.\n\nThe gear is available at Ralph Lauren stores, RalphLauren.com, TeamUSA.com and other select stores in the U.S. and France.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Ralph Lauren, US

The uniforms and Villagewear will be available for sale beginning Tuesday on both the Ralph Lauren stores and website as well as at the Team USA Shop. Proceeds from the sale of the products will benefit the team.\n\n\"America is one of maybe one or two teams that are not funded by government,\" David Lauren, chief branding and innovation officer for Ralph Lauren Corp., told WWD at a preview on Monday. \"So the sale of these products helped make it possible for the athletes to compete. We were very committed to picking products that are saleable. So we based the collection on products that we know will be popular and easy to wear.\"\n\nLauren said the money raised by the sale of the merchandise makes it possible for the athletes to travel to the Games, hire trainers and pay for other essentials that allow them to compete at the highest level. \"Everything that goes into training is paid for by the partnerships,\" he said.\n\nThe uniforms this year, which were made in the U.S., draw inspiration from the host city of blended with American patriotism. They feature a palette of red, white and blue with the opening ceremony uniform featuring a classic, tailored single-breasted navy wool blazer with red and white tipping that will be worn over a striped oxford shirt and paired with a tapered jean and classic suede buck shoe. The flagbearer's blazer for the opening ceremony is a reverse of the uniforms -- a white blazer with piping.\n\n\"We tried to do a look that felt distinctively American -- where the athletes look like ambassadors on a global stage,\" Lauren said. \"It's very important that they look comfortable but that there's also a certain level of formality. So the combination of the jeans and the jacket is at once very American and very Ralph Lauren.\"\n\nThe closing ceremony uniform is more casual and sporty and features a moto-style jacket with a variety of patches paired with a white denim jean with ribbing on the knee, and a Polo shirt from the brand's Create Your Own program, built with flat-knot technology to minimize waste from excess fabric. \"We had a lot of fun because we wanted something that felt sporty, a little more racy, something that's clearly memorable,\" Lauren said.\n\nThe outfits also have to look good on all body types, he added, from wrestlers and basketball players to gymnasts. \"They could be 5 foot, 2 [inches] or 6 foot, 8 [inches] -- we want something that will work for each athlete,\" he added.\n\nThe Villagewear collection will include the brand's first 100 percent recycled cotton polo shirt, which uses NFW Clarus technology. The other pieces in the collection include varsity jackets, Polo shirts, vintage-style rugbys and an American flag sweater, all of which feature graphics, custom prints, colorblocking or classic stripes. They are also made from recycled polyester and USA-grown wool certified under the Responsible Wool Standard program.\n\nOverall, Lauren said: \"Our feeling is when an athlete walks into a room, you know it's an athlete. The American team will keep these forever, it's part of their history. But we want everybody that goes to the Olympics or even watches it on TV to feel the same spirit.\"\n\nIn the preview of the collection at Ralph Lauren's Madison Avenue offices, several Olympic and Paralympic athletes were on hand wearing the merchandise.\n\nRoderick Townsend, a Paralympic track and field athlete, said he was eagerly awaiting the Games. \"This is the first time my wife will be able to see me compete,\" he said. \"And it will be my son's first international trip. I'm just happy to be supported by Ralph Lauren at this pivotal point in my career.\"\n\nDaryl Homer, a fencer who has competed at the last three Games, said that due to an injury, he'll be an alternate and coach at this year's Games. Even though he probably won't be fencing this time around, he said he's looking forward to enjoying the Olympic experience without the pressure of competing. \"And I'm excited to see the collection come to life,\" he said.\n\nDaniela Moroz, who will be on the U.S. sailing team, will be spending the next month training for her competition in Marseilles, France, where the race will take place. \"Summering in the south of France isn't too bad,\" she said with a laugh. \"We'll be focusing on delivering the best possible performance and hopefully be in the top slot.\"\n\nMoroz said she's known she would be competing for Team USA since last August, but many other athletes such as swimmers and track and field competitors, are just now racing to find out if they'll make the team. Jamal Hill, a Paralympic swimmer, said his finals are still to come. But by selecting the teams a short time before the Games begin allows the U.S. to \"have the most competitive athletes on the most competitive teams,\" he said. \"We always rise to the occasion.\"", "source": {"uri": "wwd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WWD"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jean_e_palmieri@wwd.com", "name": "Jean E.

Ralph Lauren, which unveiled Tuesday its ninth turn creating Olympic parade looks for the Americans, is billing the pairing as \"unexpected\" yet classic.\n\nDavid Lauren, the company's chief branding and innovation off cer and its founder's son, was unbothered by the casualness of blue denim.\n\n\"We work very closely with Team USA to make the athletes feel at once dressed up feel like a team, but at the same time comfortable and very distinctively American,\" he told The Associated Press on Monday during a media preview at the company's posh New York headquarters.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nOwner of Starbeck's Smokehouse opening burger restaurant in Cedar Falls in July College Football: Cedar Falls native, grandson of former Panther basketball assistant coach commits to UNI Car trapped under semitruck in collision on North Elk Run Road Cedar Falls man arrested for alleged theft of electric bikes Two women charged in counterfeiting operation at Evansdale home Angel Reese says Caitlin Clark gets 'special whistle.'

The jeans, at least, are tapered. Oh, and there are neck ties, in blue.\n\nFor the closing ceremony, the team will wear sharp white, moto-style denim jeans with matching jackets designed in, yes, patriotic red, white and blue.\n\nThe company gathered a few Paris-bound athletes to show off the parade uniforms for the Summer Games that begin next month in one of the world's fashion capitals.\n\nDaniela Moroz, 23, is competing in sailing at her first Olympics. She loved the racing details of the closing look she modeled, down to the shoes. The zip jackets have \"USA\" splashed across the front in huge letters, with \"Team USA\" in blue high on the outside seam of one pant leg. Team caps are duck bill: The visor is in white, with red and blue details.\n\n\"I'm a racer on the water so that really speaks to me,\" said Moroz, born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, of the moto touches. \"It's super comfortable.\"\n\nLauren called the closing ceremony looks \"more graphic, more fun, a little more exciting.\"\n\nThe company also designed Team USA gear available for sale at RalphLauren.com, TeamUSAShop.com and company stores in the U.S. and France. Among the wares on off er are polo shirts made of 100% recycled cotton. It's the first time Ralph Lauren has achieved that level of sustainability in Olympic gear, David Lauren said.\n\nThe customizable polo shirt \"feels almost like a performance material that has better wicking, better breathability, better stretch,\" he said. \"And it's a test for us to see how we can evolve in the future. The Olympics has always been an amazing place to test newness, to try innovation, and to explore with our athletes what the future could look like.\"\n\nSome proceeds of retail sales go to help support U.S. athletes training for their Olympic moments. Lauren wouldn't be more specific on how much money the company sends their way.\n\nThe opening and closing ceremony uniforms, the same for the Olympics and subsequent Paralympics, were made in the U.S. The gear on sale to the public was made in both the U.S. and other countries.\n\nJamal Hill, a Paralympic swimmer who earned a bronze medal in Tokyo, is returning to compete in Paris at age 29. He thinks the uniforms will resonate with millennials and Gen Z.\n\n\"They have a really, really nice unique modern fl air,\" said

(Scripps News)\n\nRed, white and blue ... jeans?\n\nThat's what this year's theme for Team USA's 2024 Olympic ceremony uniforms entails, with Ralph Lauren at the helm -- or should we say hem -- for the ninth time.\n\nThe brand unveiled the Opening and Closing Ceremony uniforms Tuesday for the upcoming Olympic and Paralympic Summer Games. And although the athletes will be heading to Paris for the event and won't be the only ones sporting red, white and blue, as the French flag boasts the same colors, their looks will still give off all-American.\n\nFor the Opening Ceremony, the base of the outfit features a blue-and-white-striped Oxford shirt, with the men adding a navy tie. On top, the Olympians will wear a red, white and navy blue wool blazer fixed with Ralph Lauren's logo, and on bottom, the crew will don a pair of suede buck shoes and tapered, light denim jeans -- a choice the brand acknowledged was \"unexpectedly paired\" with the rest of the outfit.\n\nFor the Closing Ceremony, Olympians will sport a white moto-style jacket with USA adornments and colors along with white denim jeans that have \"TEAM USA\" in text on the leg. The uniform is complete with a USA belt and baseball cap.\n\nRalph Lauren said this Team USA collection was inspired by the \"dynamic and vibrant\" fashion of the Games' host city, the \"rich heritage\" of Olympic sports and the \"patriotic spirit\" of the American flag color palette.\n\n\"Ralph Lauren has once again created designs that not only capture the essence of American style but also embody the spirit and pride of Team USA,\" said Sarah Hirshland, U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee CEO. \"As Team USA athletes prepare to represent the United States at the upcoming Olympic and Paralympic Games, this iconic apparel serves as a symbol of unity and inspiration for both our team and the millions of fans who will be cheering them on.\"\n\nThe line also includes the brand's first-ever 100% recycled cotton polo shirt, and styles throughout the Opening and Closing Ceremony Parade uniforms -- which were all manufactured in the USA -- were crafted in part with recycled polyester and USA-grown Responsible Wool Standard certified wool.\n\nFans and fashionistas alike can shop the Team USA ceremony uniforms and the rest of the collection on RalphLauren.com/Olympics or TeamUSAShop.com.\n\nThe Summer Olympic Games will kick off in Paris on July 26 and will end on Aug. 11, 2024.\n\nRelated Stories: Nike US women's Olympic uniforms slammed for being revealing, sexistNew 'Dream Team'?

The ornate wood detailing, heritage carpeting and other grand decor spread around the space are enough to fulfill the dreams of even the most die-hard 'Lo lover (it's quite literally a physical manifestation of the brand's time-honored \"world\") but today the ante has been upped: the company is unveiling its latest Olympic collection for Team USA ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.\n\nRalph Lauren has been the official outfitter of Team USA since the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing (past outfits can be seen in the gallery above). Since then, the brand has established a signature visual language for America's finest athletes -- one that imbues the inherent timelessness of RL goods with just enough sporting flair. Think crisp navy blazers with clever flag embellishments, white trousers, striped oxfords, and, in the winter, boldly-branded red, white and blue coats.\n\nNow, for 2024, the brand is saluting Olympics past, but also looking to encapsulate American culture today -- and nod to what it may be in the future. The opening ceremony uniforms may be the most dressed-down Ralph Lauren has created yet, combining its signature blazers with wide-striped oxford shirts and swapping out chinos for denim, a true American staple. On the other end, the motorsport-inspired closing ceremony collection is borderline logomania, with big, bold embellishments that directly nod to motorsport, and, perhaps more indirectly, salute Polo Sport and Ralph Lauren's long-standing ties to hip-hop. In between these poles sit the pieces that Ralph Lauren created for athletes to wear in the Olympic Village, a wide array of casual styles that includes bomber jackets, chore coats, satin baseball jackets, hoodies, tees and even a chore coat. Of course, Polo's famed flag sweater can be spotted as well, complete with an Olympic ring detail.\n\n\"Both the opening and closing ceremony are a piece of history, so these products will be kept by the athletes for the rest of their lives,\" says Lauren. \"That's important to us, so we want to ensure that each piece conveys great emotion and storytelling.\"\n\nThe opening collection presents a more formal look with its blazers and sharp cuts, while the closing collection offers a louder and more logo-driven look. What prompted that difference between the two?\n\nOur job for the opening ceremony is to make Team USA feel like ambassadors on a global stage. The idea of a blazer, its sense of formality, makes the team look unified, strong and ready for business. But we also mixed it with jeans because that's how modern Americans dress: more casually than they did in the past.\n\nLike you said, the closing ceremony collection is distinctly sporty and graphic. But just like the opening ceremony collection, everything about it says it's a piece of Olympic history. Any product in either collection can be recognized as very Ralph Lauren and very American.\n\n\"The product has to be at once timeless and future-oriented.\"\n\nHow do you blend the tradition of the Olympics with the timelessness of Ralph Lauren, and how does that translate onto the final product?\n\nWe have to tell a story about what America is about today. The product has to be at once timeless and future-oriented. At once graphic and understated. At once red, white and blue [smiles]. It has to tell a story about athletes from multiple sports, from basketball to gymnastics. It has to tell a story about the diversity of America today. That's why we've got everything from denim jackets to cargo pants here.\n\nTo your point, it seems like the scope of the Olympics is wider than ever too -- you've got \"traditional\" Olympic sports like track and field or swimming, but they're joined by other sports like breakdancing or skateboarding. It feels like a wider cross-section of American culture is on display.\n\nWe've got surfers, swimmers, gymnasts, fencers and more in our campaign this time around. It's amazing to see all the different sections and what they like, what they're comfortable with: the gear a breaker might want, what a BMXer is wearing when they're mid-backflip. We tried to take inspiration from all of those cultures, make something for everyone.\n\n\"It's not so much about what label it is as it is the story we're telling.\"\n\nWell before Ralph Lauren started making official gear for the US Olympic teams, patriotic embellishments, from USA script logos to American flags, were commonplace on the brand's lifestyle wear and Polo Sport goods. Does the design language established on those pieces inform the official team gear in any way?\n\nOver our 57 years, Ralph Lauren has told a variety of stories. No matter if it's Polo, Polo Sport or RLX, we're coming from the same DNA, so when it's appropriate we can be more graphic, use more performance materials, do whatever we need to do.\n\nWe're constantly dipping into the well, but we have a responsibility to move forward too. With this collection it's not so much about what label it is as it is the story we're telling, the athlete who's wearing the clothes and how we make sure they feel like our offerings are part of their DNA. We want to salute what America looks like today, but imagine what it could look like in the future as well.\n\nOn the subject of the future, the Olympics is every four years, meaning there will always be a \"next\" installment. How do you balance creating items that feel \"of the moment\" with making designs that will stand the test of time and not feel \"dated\" by the time the next Olympics comes around?\n\nI think Ralph Lauren has a core DNA and a core understanding of what our American icons are about, but we also understand that's something that has to be constantly reinvented to ensure that it stays fresh and exciting.\n\n\"We're not just reflecting [Olympic] culture, but helping to define what it's about today.\"\n\nApart from the immense visibility a collection like this brings the brand, why are the Olympic goods so important to the Ralph Lauren lineage?\n\nThe Olympics are the single greatest cultural milestone. More people watch the Olympics than any singular sporting event. Billions of people across the world will be tuned in to see the stories of the Games, and that includes the stories of American athletes. When they're wearing Ralph Lauren, that makes us part of what Olympic culture is about. We're not just reflecting that culture, but helping to define what it's about today.\n\nWhat about the collection makes you the proudest?\n\nI'd say it's not so much a specific design or product as it is the collection's overall look, spirit and attitude. There's nothing like a product coming to life on an athlete. A piece becomes so much more exciting when it's worn by the greatest swimmer in the world who just won a gold medal -- and now they're standing there, beaming, wearing a Ralph Lauren piece. That's what it's all about for us, and we're focused on creating something that both speaks to American culture and makes our athletes feel confident, strong and smart. That's our job: to be a part of what they need to win.\n\nWhat's your favorite Olympic event -- and what's your dad's favorite Olympic event?\n\nWe love all the events -- and I swear I'm not dodging the question! [laughs]. You always go into the Olympics really anticipating some events, and you're always blown away by at least one you weren't anticipating. It's an amazing opportunity to learn and to be inspired, so we mostly just go in searching for inspiration and seeking heroes.", "source": {"uri": "hypebeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HYPEBEAST"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ross_dwyer@hypebeast.com", "name": "Ross Dwyer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Lauren_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ralph Lauren Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blazer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Lauren", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ralph Lauren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chino_cloth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chino cloth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_shoe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oxford shoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lauren", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Lauren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dress shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denim", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trousers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trousers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Culture of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorsport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motorsport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakdancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breakdancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_pants", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cargo pants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_jacket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight jacket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweater", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hoodie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skateboarding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skateboarding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T-shirt"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://image-cdn.hypb.st/https%3A%2F%2Fhypebeast.com%2Fimage%2F2024%2F06%2F17%2Fralph-lauren-team-usa-olympic-collection-2024-tw.jpg?w=960&cbr=1&q=90&fit=max", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661620", "eventUri": "eng-9661620", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

This summer, Paris is the backdrop where fashion and sport will collide on the world's stage with a global audience and that is an incredibly exciting proposition.\"\n\nNotably, the Opening Ceremony uniform for Team USA features a single-breasted wool blazer with red and white tipping, a striped oxford shirt, and a tapered jean paired with classic suede buck shoes. For the Closing Ceremony, athletes will don a sporty moto-style jacket with white denim and a Polo shirt from the brand's custom Create Your Own program. Each item in the uniform is manufactured in the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, the villagewear collection boasts a range of pieces from varsity jackets and Polo shirts to vintage-style rugby shirts and the iconic American flag sweater, all designed with bold graphics, vibrant color-blocking, and classic stripes.\n\nThe uniforms and the villagewear collection feature materials like recycled polyester and USA-grown Responsible Wool Standard (RWS) certified wool. The 2024 collection also includes Ralph Lauren's first-ever 100% Recycled Cotton Polo Shirt, utilizing NFW Clarus technology.\n\n\"Ralph Lauren has once again created designs that not only capture the essence of American style but also embody the spirit and pride of Team USA,\" said Sarah Hirshland, U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee CEO.\n\n\"As Team USA athletes prepare to represent the United States at the upcoming Olympic and Paralympic Games, this iconic apparel serves as a symbol of unity and inspiration for both our team and the millions of fans who will be cheering them on.\"\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved.\n\nTags : Fashion Ready-to-wear Accessories Collection", "source": {"uri": "si.fashionnetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Ralph Lauren, which unveiled Tuesday its ninth turn creating Olympic parade looks for the Americans, is billing the pairing as \"unexpected\" yet classic.\n\nDavid Lauren, the company's chief branding and innovation officer and its founder's son, was unbothered by the casualness of blue denim.\n\n\"We work very closely with Team USA to make the athletes feel at once dressed up, feel like a team, but at the same time comfortable and very distinctively American,\" he told The Associated Press on Monday during a media preview at the company's posh New York headquarters.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nCHP: Angwin woman dies after car strikes her on driveway Suspect named in fatal Napa County hit-and-run crash Napa Valley College's new student housing: How much will it cost?

The jeans, at least, are tapered. Oh, and there are neck ties, in blue.\n\nFor the closing ceremony, the team will wear sharp white, moto-style denim jeans with matching jackets designed in, yes, patriotic red, white and blue.\n\nThe company gathered a few Paris-bound athletes to show off the parade uniforms for the Summer Games that begin next month in one of the world's fashion capitals.\n\nDaniela Moroz, 23, is competing in sailing at her first Olympics. She loved the racing details of the closing look she modeled, down to the shoes. The zip jackets have \"USA\" splashed across the front in huge letters, with \"Team USA\" in blue high on the outside seam of one pant leg. Team caps are duck bill: The visor is in white, with red and blue details.\n\n\"I'm a racer on the water so that really speaks to me,\" said Moroz, born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, of the moto touches. \"It's super comfortable.\"\n\nLauren called the closing ceremony looks \"more graphic, more fun, a little more exciting.\"\n\nThe company also designed Team USA gear available for sale at RalphLauren.com, TeamUSAShop.com and company stores in the U.S. and France. Among the wares on offer are polo shirts made of 100% recycled cotton. It's the first time Ralph Lauren has achieved that level of sustainability in Olympic gear, David Lauren said.\n\nThe customizable polo shirt \"feels almost like a performance material that has better wicking, better breathability, better stretch,\" he said. \"And it's a test for us to see how we can evolve in the future. The Olympics has always been an amazing place to test newness, to try innovation, and to explore with our athletes what the future could look like.\"\n\nSome proceeds of retail sales go to help support U.S. athletes training for their Olympic moments. Lauren wouldn't be more specific on how much money the company sends their way.\n\nThe opening and closing ceremony uniforms, the same for the Olympics and subsequent Paralympics, were made in the U.S. The gear on sale to the public was made in both the U.S. and other countries.\n\nJamal Hill, a Paralympic swimmer who earned a bronze medal in Tokyo, is returning to compete in Paris at age 29. He thinks the uniforms will resonate with millennials and Gen Z.\n\n\"They have a really, really nice unique modern flair,\" said Hill.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your

Plus, an updated version of the brand's iconic flag sweater.\n\nHeading to Ralph Lauren's New York City headquarters to preview Team USA's Opening and Closing Ceremony uniforms for the 2024 Olympics, I expected to see a room full of red, white, and blue. It's tradition: Ralph Lauren has designed Team USA's Opening and Closing Ceremony outfits for the past eight Olympic Games, beginning with Beijing in 2008. Each time, the uniforms had plenty of stars, stripes, and Americana insignias to go around. The palette is a prerequisite for around 600 U.S. athletes to represent their country at the biggest international competition in sports, after all.\n\nWhat I didn't expect in the mahogany-paneled room full of Team USA athletes and their new uniforms was a crossover with the heart of fashion's biggest trends. Returning for a ninth time, Ralph Lauren is still dressing athletes for the Olympics in their star-spangled best -- but they're emphasizing the crossover between the world of sport and the world of fashion in fresh ways. And, it's all available for anyone to shop before the Olympic torch is even lit.\n\nTo open the Olympics, athletes including gymnastics phenomenon Simone Biles and swimming legend Katie Ledecky will wear refreshes of Ralph Lauren classics: a navy blazer with white and red trim, a striped Oxford button-down, and tapered jeans. As far as first impressions on the Olympic stage go, it's a neat summary of the classic codes defining American fashion (and Ralph Lauren's take on it), all that are being reinvented in a prep revival at brands both at home and abroad.\n\nThings get more experimental with the Closing Ceremony uniforms. Ralph Lauren nodded to the motorsport frenzy ruling fashion and sport with white racing jackets fit for the pit of a Formula 1 Grand Prix. (Never mind that motorsport isn't Olympics-verified -- yet.) Athletes (and by that point in the festivities, medalists) will pair these with white jeans and polo shirts made from a knitting technology that reduces fabric waste. I could as easily imagine these jackets in a Hailey Bieber or Emily Ratajkowski paparazzi shot as I could at the Olympics -- they're a reflection of the sporty-chic outerwear that's all over street style.\n\nAll these pieces are online for purchase now. With an Olympics to be held in one of the world's great fashion capitals, it follows that the uniforms feel extra-wearable beyond the tentpole ceremonies. \"This summer, Paris is the backdrop where fashion and sport will collide on the world's stage with a global audience and that is an incredibly exciting proposition,\" David Lauren, Chief Branding and Innovation Officer, Ralph Lauren Corporation, said in a statement. \"For nearly 60 years, Ralph Lauren has been a pioneer at the intersection of style and sport -- the vibrancy, passion, and self-expression in sport has been a central touch point of inspiration for our brand since the very beginning of the iconic Polo brand in 1967.\"\n\nIn addition to the Opening and Closing Ceremony uniforms, Ralph Lauren also brought \"villagewear\" -- a.k.a. pieces for athletes to wear in their downtime -- to its ninth Olympic collaboration. Here, the crossovers between trending style-meets-sport pieces are even more obvious. There are pleated tennis skorts and dresses for both actual tennis players and Challengers obsessives; chore jackets and satin bombers that are street style's light layers du jour; and lace-up rugby jerseys that wouldn't look out of place in Chlo\u00eb Sevigny's closet. Prices range from $69.50 for a jersey tee to $398 for field jackets.\n\nThere's also a sign the Olympic designer is paying close attention to the viral chatter around its heritage pieces. Daniela Moroz, who will sail for Team USA, directed my attention at the preview to an item I thought I recognized among the uniforms on display at Ralph Lauren HQ: the American flag sweater \"everyone knows\" (in Moroz's words), updated with Olympic rings stitched below the flag.\n\nFor some athletes, bringing fashion into conversation with sport is about more than making a great first impression at the Opening Ceremony. Competing in a male-dominated field like sailing made Moroz hold herself back, style-wise. But, \"over the years I've been more and more comfortable with expressing my feminine side a bit more. Fashion has to do with some of that,\" she told me, \"and it's cool to now get to partner with such an iconic American brand and represent that on the world stage.\"\n\nMoroz can't wait to wear her Ralph Lauren uniform in Paris, but she says the pieces will have a life in her closet before, during, and after the Games. (In fact, she was already wearing the Closing Ceremony uniform when we met.) \"It's a cool combination of special to the Olympics, but they're totally timeless,\" she says of the designs. \"Like you're going to be able to wear this forever and pass on to your kids. It feels really special.\"", "source": {"uri": "marieclaire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Marie Claire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "halie_lesavage@marieclaire.com", "name": "Halie LeSavage", "type":

To him, it's a combination of \"cowboy tuxedo\" vibes and Formula 1 style.\n\nThe entire Paris 2024 collection is appealing, he said.\n\n\"A really great infusion of modern style along with that classic American energy,\" he said. \"I'll definitely be wearing it outside the Paralympic Village.\"\n\nRalph Lauren works closely with Team USA and the goal, as always, is to \"do something graphic and uniquely American,\" chief brand and innovation officer David Lauren said.\n\n\"This is definitely the most exciting Olympics we've been a part of,\" Lauren told USA TODAY. \"The opportunity to go to Paris, to be in the center of Europe, it feels like you're in the center of the world for this one.\"\n\nEverything produced by Ralph Lauren borrows from the style the company has developed since it began in 1967. The closing ceremony race jacket \"is already one of the most-coveted pieces we've created,\" Lauren said.\n\nThe opening ceremony uniform is a modern take on a tailored look. On top, a tailored single-breasted wool blazer with red and white tipping is worn over a striped oxford shirt. The bottom is a more casual tapered jean and classic suede buck shoe fit.\n\n\"I really enjoy this opening ceremony (jacket),\" BMX rider Kamren Larsen told USA TODAY. \"It makes me feel dapper. It's cliche, but look good, feel good, and hopefully you can be good, too.\"\n\nTo account for the heat, the company constantly looks at different fabrics and layering systems to keep the athlete's body temperature in check, Lauren said. All items in both the opening and closing ceremony outfits are manufactured in the United States.\n\nAnother piece of the collection that received universal praise from the athletes was a retro bomber jacket.\n\n\"It has a really nice 80s vibe to it,\" para-track athlete Roderick Townsend said.\n\nTownsend also liked the racing jacket from the closing ceremony, but as someone who calls Phoenix, Arizona home, he may not have much need for it in the future.\n\nThe village-wear collection features the brand's first-ever 100% recycled cotton Polo shirt. Other village-wear items include sporty varsity jackets, vintage-style rugby shirts and the classic American flag sweater with a twist.\n\n\"They just hit the nail on the head with everything,\" Moroz said.\n\nThe gear is available at Ralph Lauren stores, RalphLauren.com, TeamUSA.com and other select stores in the U.S. and France.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

The launch features plenty of red, white and blue, which happen to represent both the French and United States flag colors.\n\n\"Ralph Lauren is profoundly honored to define the look of the American delegation as they represent our country in one of the world's most celebrated and storied events,\" David Lauren, Ralph Lauren's chief branding and innovation officer, shared in a statement. \"This summer, Paris is the backdrop where fashion and sport will collide on the world's stage with a global audience and that is an incredibly exciting proposition.\"\n\nThe Opening Ceremony pieces reflect Polo Ralph Lauren's tailored yet contemporary aesthetic, embodied in details and unexpected pairings like denim jeans with a bold red-and-white-trimmed suit jacket. The wool blazer is worn over a blue-and-white-striped Oxford button-down, a trademark of preppy style. One photograph from the campaign features Olympian cyclist Kamren Larsen, outfitted in the Ralph Lauren Opening Ceremony uniform while riding a bike, giving the uniform an authentic, athletic feel. The careful footwear selection is similarly admirable; the athletes will wear classic but formal buck shoes, which have the capacity to dress up the uniform while remaining comfortable and timeless.\n\nThe Closing Ceremony campaign has more of an emphasis on athleisure, but holds true to that red, white and blue. Showcasing more functional elements, the windbreaker-inspired jacket is paired with white denim pants, the latter of which are an integral part of the sporty look, as they are under the guise of post-game sweats, featuring the namesake \"Team USA\" in a vertical fashion. A baseball-style cap, with various patches and the famous trifecta of colors, completed the ensemble.\n\nAlong with the uniforms, Ralph Lauren is also releasing a \"Villagewear\" collection including outerwear, tees, accessories and more, which the athletes can wear when they aren't competing. It's composed of more casual, less technical garments for off-duty style, ranging from a cable-knit vest and fleece baseball jacket to rugby tees and USA-emblazoned sweatshirts.\n\nThe collections also have a sustainable component: not only are the uniforms made in the USA, but they are also manufactured with eco-conscious materials. The Opening and Closing Ceremonies uniforms are made of recycled polyester and RWS certified wool, and shirts from the Villagewear collection are made of 100 percent recycled cotton.\n\nAll pieces from the Olympics collection, which ranges in price from $22 to $998, are now available on RalphLauren.com and in stores across the United States and France, so you can dress just like your favorite athletes this summer and beyond.

Count on seeing red, white, and blue, and almost certainly the letters USA. And since 2008, Ralph Lauren has designed the Opening and Closing Ceremonies looks, as well as the outfits athletes wear in the Olympic Village when they're not competing.\n\nThe American fashion house unveiled the 2024 uniforms today, which include tried and true silhouettes as well as more modern ones that some athletes say they are excited to wear.\n\nFor Opening Ceremonies, Team USA will wear navy blazers trimmed with red and white ribbon over a blue and white striped oxford shirt paired with an American staple -- jeans. The outfit is finished off with a light taupe suede buck shoe for a classic look that honors the formal and ceremonial nature of the event while celebrating a distinctly American casual flair.\n\n\"We've really tried to tell a story about the American spirit,\" says David Lauren, chief branding and innovation officer at Ralph Lauren, of the company's aesthetic. \"We work closely with the athletes to understand what makes them feel comfortable but also want them to feel like ambassadors [of the country] on the global stage, so having a certain level of formality and yet a spirit of sportsmanship and ease that they feel comfortable with.\"\n\nFor Closing Ceremonies, which are more relaxed, the athletes will don an auto racing-inspired jacket color blocked in red, white, and blue, as well as white denim pants. Both the Opening and Closing uniforms were manufactured in the United States.\n\n\"Representing the United States is a big confidence booster in general,\" says Kamren Larsen, a BMX racer and one of the athletes Ralph Lauren sponsors, who modeled the Opening Ceremonies uniform. \"But wearing nice outfits and feeling comfortable and confident will only help us perform better.\"\n\nA running theme of this year's collection is sustainability, and pieces in the Opening and Closing Ceremonies uniforms were made with recycled polyester and U.S. wool grown to the Responsible Wool Standard certification, which includes adhering to requirements on animal and social welfare and proper land management. All Team USA athletes are also provided with a full kit of apparel to wear outside of their competitions, including a polo shirt made from innovative recycled cotton fibers that have been welded together. Ralph Lauren partnered with Natural Fiber Welding to develop the material manufactured with no plastics or toxic chemicals and in a low-carbon process. \"It creates a cotton that has a performance attribute that no one has ever seen before, and it's a quality that could become the future of the way we see clothing in America,\" says Lauren. \"A lot of the ingenuity and technology that we test at the Olympics, we'll use as a prototype to see how well it performs with the athletes, and we'll get their feedback. And if it's positive, we'll begin to incorporate it into all parts of our products.\"\n\nAs much as Ralph Lauren represents American style, however, the company's designs have been criticized for promoting an elitist version of that style -- one that's more typical of prep schools and vacation homes than what appeals to most Americans. \"Our job is to understand what American culture is about and to reflect that,\" says Lauren, who says that the company solicits feedback from athletes on what they would like to see in their uniforms. Consistently, they think blazers or jackets are appropriate for Opening Ceremonies to convey a formal dignity, while a more relaxed look, including more popular bombers and racing jackets, are appropriate for Closing Ceremonies and the Olympic Village. \"We're looking at the future of America, and what American represents far beyond sports,\" he says. \"And to outfit this team in Ralph Lauren reflects what America is about today.\"", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alice_park@time.com", "name": "Alice Park", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Lauren", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ralph Lauren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lauren", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Lauren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silhouette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dress shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suede", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suede"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BMX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blazer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Welding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denim", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyester", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polyester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wool", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aesthetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cotton recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toxicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Clothing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Clothing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Uniforms", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Uniforms", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Apparel", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Apparel", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Polo-Ralph-Lauren-Team-USA-Opening-Ceremony-Parade-Uniforms.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661620", "eventUri": "eng-9661620", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Beyond this, athletes will also receive pieces from a special, commemorative \"Villagewear\" collection.

For nearly 60 years, Ralph Lauren has been a pioneer at the intersection of style and sport -- the vibrancy, passion and self-expression in sport has been a central touchpoint of inspiration for our brand since the very beginning of the iconic Polo brand in 1967. This summer, Paris is the backdrop where fashion and sport will collide on the world's stage with a global audience and that is an incredibly exciting proposition,\" said David Lauren, Chief Branding and Innovation Officer, Ralph Lauren Corporation.\n\nRalph Lauren's Team USA collection draws inspiration from the dynamic and vibrant host city of Paris and the rich heritage of Olympic and Paralympic sport and embraces a patriotic spirit reflected in a signature palette of red, white and blue.

And so, as a Canadian, it is with routine horror that I gaze upon the newly unveiled Team USA outfits for this summer's Paris Olympics.\n\nYou know what comes to mind when I think \"American Olympic team\"? Blazers. And that's precisely what Ralph Lauren is serving with the new team uniforms: The opening ceremony's fit is a striped oxford shirt, a navy blazer with red and white stripes, and light-wash denim jeans. A sea of this country's finest athletes, dressed like they have private school at 3 p.m. but are subbing in for Springsteen at 9. For the closing ceremony, it gets worse, with a Ballad of Ricky Bobby-ass denim moto jacket paired with matching white jeans. Splashed across the front of this affront to our eyeballs? The letters \"USA,\" emblazoned in good old red, white, and blue.\n\nSince the advent of the Ralph Lauren polo shirt in 1972, Ralph Lauren has been viewed as a quintessentially American brand -- at least, for a particular type of American. Affluent, white, probably on a boat somewhere with Ted Kennedy (they call him Teddy), the Ralph Lauren dresser seems synonymous with a specific slice of Americana. Growing up in Canada, I viewed the brand as all-American, and didn't see much of it -- on my peers, on my parents' friends, in advertising -- until I moved to the U.S. Is anything more American than putting a bear in an American flag sweater on a sweater? Nothing, unless that bear also has $20,000 in medical debt.\n\nAnd so it makes sense that, since 2008, Ralph has been the designer for all Team USA outfits. It also explains why they're so ugly. Backlash against this current spate of outfits has been swift, and is reminiscent of almost every other time the designer has made outfits for the Olympics. In 2014, Ralph debuted Olympics cardigans and hats, with the Olympic rings on one breast, \"USA\" on the other, flags on both arms, and a cartoonish number of stars. Get it? Because America? Because flag red, white, blue? Flag have stars. Flag have stripes! Me love flag. Rock, flag, and eagle.\n\nOf course, the Olympics are all about nationalistic pride. \"Doesn't every country positively drape their athletes in patriotic flags?\" you might ask. But it doesn't have to be that way, and in fact, it seems that other countries routinely have better, less visually offensive outfits for the Olympics. France's uniforms are also a play on their flag -- same red, white, and blue, too, but I'm still calling them \"freedom fries\"! -- and yet are more creatively refreshing than Team USA's stuffy threads. Everything in Team France's design suite looks like a melted Bomb Pop: sprightly, fun, poppy, wearable. Do you know how ugly your shit has to be for it to get one-upped by Canada's aggressively red Lululemon Olympics uniform? The design concept seems to be \"blood everywhere,\" but at least it's not a three-button red blazer with a maple leaf on it, which is something we definitely never did.\n\nTeam USA outfits are determined to look less like clothes that use elements of the flag so much as they're flags cut into the shape of outfits. Even for such a patriotic occasion, it feels like overkill. For some reason, the only representation of American exceptionalism you all can come up with is stars and stripes and three colors that have to be shared with the French. Are the Ralph Lauren jackets worse than the godawful unitards Nike made for the track and field teams? No, but only because at least the Ralph Lauren outfits fully cover your mons pubis; the women's cut of the unitard runs so high along the groin, you'd be able to give birth on live television without undressing.\n\nIt wasn't always like this; America used to be a proper country. In 1968, the figure skating team wore these futuristic outfits complete with an American seal. Compare that with the double-breasted jackets and berets that Team USA got in 2012 after Ralph Lauren took over, and there's little to do besides weep. In a few years, I'll be eligible for citizenship here in America. I haven't yet decided if it's an opportunity I'll take, but I know I'm going to need a better Members Only jacket.", "source": {"uri": "slate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slate Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Lauren", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ralph Lauren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeans", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jeans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blazer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dress shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweater", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denim", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo_shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polo shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americana_(culture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Americana (culture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affluence_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Affluence in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eagle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ted Kennedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardigan_(sweater)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cardigan (sweater)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_symbols", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic symbols"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Flags_and_Banners", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Flags and Banners", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Six_Flags", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Six Flags", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://compote.slate.com/images/42a27c51-f0d6-44b1-bfe7-71156fbcbd05.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661620", "eventUri": "eng-9661620", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

The Opening Ceremony uniform includes a tailored blazer with red and white accents, and a striped oxford shirt.

Other parts of the uniforms are made from recycled polyester and wool grown in the U.S.\n\nLast year, Kim Kardashian's Skims apparel company joined Ralph Lauren in dressing athletes - providing them underwear, loungewear and pajamas.\n\nEarlier this year, Nike unveiled its designs for athletes - including basketball, soccer and running event uniforms. But the company was criticized for what some felt were sexist women's track and field uniforms. The uniforms, first posted by digital media company Citius Mag, have a high-cut leg that that barely covers a display mannequin's groin area, while the men's version provides significantly more coverage.\n\nNike, which has designed athlete's competition uniforms for several years, defended the design, saying that ahead of the Olympics it asked for input from both women and men athletes for its uniforms.\n\nFans can buy Team USA apparel and accessories from Ralph Lauren online and in stores in both the U.S. and France.\n\nThe Olympics will kick off with the Opening Ceremony on July 26. The five iconic Olympic rings were mounted on the Eiffel Tower last week, marking 50 days until the start of the games.\n\nA temporary Eiffel Tower stadium, which will be used for men's and women's volley ball matches, will provide an iconic backdrop for the games -

They featured shorts and joggers, t-shirts, hats, and short-sleeved button-up jackets. It looked like something you might actually wear in the summer.\n\nHere's what they looked like in 2008, Lauren's first year as Team USA designer. The vibe is decidedly un-summer, with long white slacks, a white hat, a white button-down oxford shirt, Polo's signature navy blue blazer, and an ascot.\n\nNothing screams summer like wearing an ascot and a blazer to the boardwalk, right?\n\nThe next Summer Olympics in 2028 will take place in Los Angeles, and will mark Lauren's 20th year as Olympics designer.

This year's opening uniforms include a slim, single-breasted blazer in navy wool, crisp oxford sheet, and relaxed light-wash denim, paired with cream oxford shoes crafted from suede nubuck. The closing uniforms are no less polished, with cotton polos and tapered race jeans.\n\nWhen the athletes aren't competing, they'll be able to unwind in the more relaxed, yet still tailored villagewear collection. The 31-piece set features a color-blocked lace-up rugby polo, an embroidered knit vest, and track pants, as well as a recyclable version of Ralph Lauren's iconic cotton polo shirt, which the brand is releasing for the first time.\n\nKiteboarder and sailor Daniela Moroz, who will compete in Paris, told Bazaar the racing jacket and cotton flag crewneck are among her favorites of the new releases. \"Everyone knows the classic American flag Ralph Lauren sweater -- it's like an Olympic twist on that, with the rings on the bottom,\" the Californian says. \"So I love that.\"\n\nRalph Lauren's brand identity is firmly rooted in its American legacy -- from cable knit sweaters and piqu\u00e9 polos rendered quintessential to the country's elite institutions, to streamlined workwear rolled out under the Double RL label -- and it is that bold legacy that makes for exceptionally good fashion.\n\nShop our select pieces from the 2024 Team USA collection below.

It's safe to say people had strong reactions to them.\n\nFor the opening ceremony, the Americans will be in jeans and single-breasted blue wool blazers with red and white striping, and a striped oxford shirt. The men will wear ties. The opening ceremony will feature athletes from each country parading down the River Seine on boats, rather than the traditional march.\n\nAt the closing ceremony, the Americans will wear a white racing-style jacket with patches related to Team USA and each athlete's sport. It's definitely a 1980s-inspired look that brings memories of a NASCAR driver's outfit.\n\nPeople were decidedly mixed on the outfits.\n\nThere were far too many great reactions to include them all, but that's a sampling.\n\nMy only reaction to the outfits is to say I've been in Europe in late July and August, and whichever athletes are wearing those will be just this side of melting. Unless the good people at Ralph Lauren included internal air conditioners in those jackets, it could be a rough night for everyone involved.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blazer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Lauren", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ralph Lauren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wool", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_at_the_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States at the Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dress shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Apparel", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Apparel", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Ethnic_and_Regional", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Ethnic and Regional", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Organizations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_8640,h_4860,x_0,y_552/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j0pt2cz9wp8vcmh7mk.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661620", "eventUri": "eng-9661620", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission.\n\nRalph Lauren has come a long way from its lithe Felix Catton, Chuck Bass roots. Gone (thankfully) are the days of popped collars, sweeping fringes and criminally low-cut jeans, and Ralph Lauren's collections have been liberated from their nostalgic constraints, now updated for the modern era. The headline is; Ralph Lauren is back, and its huge summer sale is the time to buy into it.\n\nKnown for its colourful output of polos and intarsia knits, Ralph Lauren was the irrefutable monarch of the Noughties-era fuckboy. Well, the 2000s are coming back and, with it, Ralph Lauren fever is burning bright. If you're looking to dip your toe into the SS24 trend, we've put together an editor's pick of what's on offer across a few key categories. Scroll on (and on and on), and enjoy.\n\nRalph Lauren is to polo shirts what butter is to bread, and their infamy is well-deserved. Whether you're more on board with the wallflower subtlety of an embroidered style or you find yourself drawn to the maximalist all-out colour blocking, there's something for all tastes. Get involved.\n\nChoosing the right knitwear for summer can, at times, be easier said than done. The secret? Light weaves, fine fabrics, and vivid, sun-reflecting colour schemes. Luckily for you we've done the legwork for you and picked out a handful of banging options:\n\nYou can hardly go wrong with a high-quality shirt. Well-constructed and sharp, Ralph Lauren's shirt selection spans everything from the uber-casual to the hyper-formal. Desk dwellers and weekend shirt-lovers, unite.\n\nNo-one has made us appreciate a good T-shirt more in the last year than Jeremy Allen White, and the humble wardrobe staple is more of a must-cop than ever. It just so happens that Ralph Lauren has a stunning collection of tees; graphic and plain. Dealer's choice.\n\nEverything from jeans, suit trousers, chinos and tailored options - Ralph Lauren's got a little something-something for every demand in your calendar. Every one.\n\nIf it works for Paul Mescal, it works for you... and shorts always work for Mescal. 'Tis the season to bare your pins, and the Ralph Lauren sale has a mass of options for your perusal. Chinos shorts, linen shorts, jorts, suit shorts - they're all here.\n\nThere's nothing like the purchase of a new pair of kicks ahead of a new summer, and Ralph Lauren has a bulging selection of trainers for your perusal. From a classic pair of Wimbledon-esque white tennis trainers to something a little bit more streetwise, there's a Polo-stitched pair for every shoe trunk.\n\nThe best finds from the men's fashion sales this week\n\nThe Percival sale is offering up to 50% off: run, don't walk", "source": {"uri": "gq-magazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "British GQ"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@gq-magazine.co.uk", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Lauren", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ralph Lauren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intarsia_(knitting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intarsia (knitting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polos", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knitting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knitting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knitted_fabric", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knitted fabric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo_shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polo shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T-shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shorts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embroidery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Embroidery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mescal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Mescal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chino_cloth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chino cloth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Allen_White", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Allen White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trousers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trousers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Casual", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Casual", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Men's", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Men's", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Polo", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Polo", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Artists", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://media.gq-magazine.co.uk/photos/6671a6aa3d16587144936140/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Ralph-Lauren-HP.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661620", "eventUri": "eng-9661620", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

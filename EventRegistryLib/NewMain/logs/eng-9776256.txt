Please visit bucadibeppo.com to find your nearest location. Thank you.\"\n\nThe Spring Township restaurant was Buca di Beppo's last remaining location in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe closure comes just a few weeks after Buca di Beppo also shuttered its Pittsburgh-area restaurant.\n\nUnfortunately, Pennsylvania isn't the only state left without a Buca di Beppo location.\n\nThe chain also closed down two of its remaining Michigan locations, in Livonia and Utica earlier this summer, according to the Detroit Free Press.\n\nFor more on restaurant closings, check out The U.S. Sun's coverage of fast-food chain and casual dining restaurant closures, including past

However, the Facebook page for the location, updated on Sunday, indicates it is permanently closed.

It's one of several nationwide to be shuttered over the weekend.\n\nThe final night of service was unclear on Tuesday morning. Mentions on social media say it was Saturday, but an employee who answered the phone on Sunday afternoon said the restaurant, at 44 Wolf Road, was open for business. By Tuesday morning, the location's page on the chain's website and voicemail greeting said it was permanently closed.\n\nIt opened in February 2000, taking over property that for 29 years had been Platt's Place, a deli, ice cream store and catering operation.\n\nKnown for large platters of pasta, pizza and Italian entrees sized to feed three to five people, Buca di Beppo was a popular destination for events, meetings, birthdays and other celebrations in themed rooms, including a Pope Room common to all Buca restaurants. The name roughly translates to \"Joe's small place,\" with \"beppo\" a nickname for Giuseppe. It was founded in 1993 in Florida, where three locations remain open, and since 2008 has been a subsidiary of the Planet Hollywood chain.\n\nAccording to the company website, there are about 40 Buca di Beppos in the United States and one in the Philippines after multiple recent closures. A TV station in Sacramento reported Monday that a Buca di Beppo in the California city closed abruptly over the weekend, with employees given no notice, and similar reports were published Monday about a Phoenix-area Buca di Beppo. Locations also closed in Maryland and Florida last month, according to local news reports. Other news reports say that Buca di Beppo closed its only restaurant in Hawaii and one of four in Ohio in the past few months, both after more than 20 years, with the latter being razed to make way for a Chick-fil-A location.\n\nAs part of pandemic-era adaptations, when large groups were not dining out, Buca di Beppo used many of restaurants including on Wolf Road as the site of ghost kitchens for delivery-only brands including Guy Fieri's Flavortown Kitchen, established by the eponymous Food Network personality, and MrBeast Burger, named after the YouTube star. It was not immediately clear when those arrangements ended. Times Union dining critic Susie Davidson Powell tried burgers from both in March 2021 and was not impressed.", "source": {"uri": "timesunion.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Times Union"},

Marvin Heemeyer \u2014 convinced he\u2019d been wronged by town leaders \u2014 plotted for more than a year, crafting and installing a 40,000-pound steel and concrete enclosure atop a bulldozer. He then smashed his makeshift tank into 13 buildings in a one-man act of revenge and retribution. Tread marks are still engraved in the pavement in front of the Sky-Hi News building, which Heemeyer collapsed with his 85-ton armored Komatsu bulldozer on June 4, 2004, during a 2 1/4-hour slog from one end of town to the other. He and his dozer damaged or toppled Granby\u2019s town hall, an electric utility building and a concrete plant as police fired high-caliber rounds repeatedly \u2014 but to no effect \u2014 at the slow-rolling behemoth. At Thompson & Sons Excavating, what is likely the only remaining intact piece of Heemeyer\u2019s fearsome machine \u2014 a trunnion that secured the blade to the dozer \u2014 now serves as a peculiarly heavy bookend on a shelf in the Thompson brothers\u2019 shop. Back on that day, the chunk of iron fell off the bulldozer as it rammed through the front wall of their home. Heemeyer, 52, fatally shot himself in the head after part of his bulldozer fell through the floor of a hardware store he was demolishing. His body wasn\u2019t retrieved until the next day, when SWAT teams used explosives and a cutting torch to breach the nearly impregnable compartment he had built. He was the only person to die in the rampage. The Grand County town of 2,100 has largely moved past the destruction wrought by Heemeyer 20 years ago this Tuesday. But the man who caused the damage lives on through music, on merchandise and inside the minds of those who see him as someone pushed to the edge by a heartless government \u2014 and forced to take matters into his own hands. What struck a chord with some, especially those on America\u2019s political fringes, is that the South Dakota native and Air Force veteran was acting out against government leaders who he felt had targeted him with unfair land use and zoning decisions. In some cases, he targeted their family members. But two decades later, the sheer spectacle that put Granby on the map still befuddles many locals. Granby has made little attempt to commemorate the incident. \u201cThe town made a big mistake scrapping that tractor,\u201d Larry Thompson, the older of the two Thompson brothers, whose father was a former Granby mayor, told The Denver Post recently. \u201cThey could have made a killing off that tractor.\u201d But Casey Farrell, who owned the Gambles hardware store where Heemeyer\u2019s attack on Granby ended, vehemently disagrees with those who think the menacing machine should have been preserved. \u201cIf we had kept that thing around, it was going to be a shrine-type scenario,\u201d he said. \u201cThat thing radiated evil.\u201d Online, a \u201ckilldozer\u201d cottage industry thrives, commemorating a man whose well-publicized phrase from notes he left behind \u2014 \u201cI was always willing to be reasonable until I had to be unreasonable\u201d \u2014 has become a meme encapsulating an anti-government ethos. Ten dollars at Amazon will get you a sticker of Heemeyer\u2019s dozer with the phrase: \u201cI\u2019d rather be secretly modifying a bulldozer for a year and a half in Granby, CO.\u201d Thirty-five bucks will fetch you a Heemeyer action figure from Straight to Hell Toy Co., which states that its offering is \u201cnot an endorsement or celebration of violence of any kind.\u201d You can even luxuriate with a balsam- and cedar-scented bar of soap carved into the shape of the bulldozer, armor and all, that\u2019s called \u201cUnreasonable Things.\u201d The product description from the MW Soap Co. states that the scent is \u201calmost like a calm afternoon in a small Colorado town.\u201d Incident\u2019s appeal lies in its \u201coutlandishness\u201d But commemorations of Heemeyer\u2019s deed have migrated to darker places on the internet. On the social media platform Telegram, several chapters of the Proud Boys, a far-right group that the Southern Poverty Law Center designates as a hate group, have held him up as a hero. The center\u2019s deputy director for data analytics, Megan Squire, has been tracking extremist organizations\u2019 embrace of Heemeyer and his dozer for years. She shared a 2023 Telegram post with The Post from last June 4 in which the president of the Indiana Proud Boys declared, \u201cHAPPY KILLDOZER DAY.\u201d \u201cToday, we celebrate Killdozer Day and Marvin Heemeyer, the last great American folk hero,\u201d the post reads. \u201cA man driven to the brink who chose to fight back against an indifferent system.\u201d A big part of the Killdozer story\u2019s appeal, Squire said, lies in its pure \u201coutlandishness\u201d and its ability to \u201cprovoke folks to stand up to a tyrannical government.\u201d Four years ago, a man ambushed and killed law enforcement officers in California. He was reported to have been sympathetic to the anti-government Boogaloo movement. Before his arrest, according to the Mercury News in San Jose, he scrawled \u201cI became unreasonable\u201d in blood on the hood of a car before his arrest. \u201cIn 2024, in the internet subculture, a lot of the community is about people plucking out portions of that event to make an anti-government and conspiratorial story,\u201d Squire said. Patrick Brower, the publisher of the Sky-Hi News newspaper at the time of the attack, says what lights up many people online is an often-romanticized David vs. Goliath rendition of what unfolded in Granby in the years leading up to June 4, 2004. \u201cI think people see Marv as an anti-hero and cultural hero because he struck out against the government that he thought had wronged him,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s mostly people who don\u2019t know the story.\u201d Brower, who documented the attack in his 2017 book \u201cKilldozer: The True Story of the Colorado Bulldozer Rampage,\u201d said Heemeyer became increasingly disgruntled by what he perceived as heavy-handedness by officials in town government and the water and sanitation district regarding a lot he bought in Granby in the early 1990s. Heemeyer, Brower said, wasn\u2019t happy about the cost of having to hook up his muffler shop to the town\u2019s sewer system. A few years later, when a local businessman wanted to build a concrete batch plant next to his muffler shop, Heemeyer went into overdrive in his attempt to stop it. He hired a lawyer, Brower said, and sued the town over the proposed plant. But he lost in court. \u201cTread,\u201d a documentary that first appeared on Netflix in 2019 and is now available on YouTube, incorporated many of Heemeyer\u2019s ruminations and reasonings in his own voice on tapes he recorded before putting his plot into motion. On one audio recording, Heemeyer sounded defeated \u2014 but determined to seek vengeance. \u201cYou took advantage of my good nature,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no way to make this right. You picked on the wrong man.\u201d But Brower, a consulting producer on \u201cTread,\u201d said the town had simply followed its land-use rules in approving the concrete plant. Heemeyer, he said, was convinced he had been wronged, and there was no going back. On the tapes, Heemeyer spoke of a peace coming over him when he realized that \u201cGod wanted me to do it.\u201d His father died in March 2004, three months before he launched his attack. The Post contacted Heemeyer\u2019s brother, Ken, for comment on the 20th anniversary but did not hear back. \u201cHe created his own conspiracy\u201d Heemeyer moved to Grand Lake, which is down the road from Granby, in the fall of 1991. Brower said Heemeyer bought his property for a good price in Granby and the area provided many places for him to pursue his love of snowmobiling. He regularly went out in the company of fellow snowmobiling enthusiasts. Heemeyer never married or had children, a fact he attributed on his recorded tapes to God\u2019s will. He spent 18 months collecting the steel for his dozer. He then poured concrete and cut and welded the metal sheets in secret, night after night, in a shed next to his muffler shop. Heemeyer expressed disbelief that no one ever caught him building the armored bulldozer, including an inspector who came in one day to look over his shop. With his project hidden beneath a tarp just feet away, Heemeyer concluded in one recording: \u201cI wasn\u2019t supposed to get caught.\u201d \u201cHe looked at himself as a vigilante who was ordained by God to avenge the imagined wrongs he had experienced,\u201d said Brower, 68. \u201cHe created his own conspiracy and he lived it out.\u201d George Davis, the owner of Maple Street Builders in Granby, was initially perplexed about how he ended up on Heemeyer\u2019s hit list. \u201cPrior to all of this, he came across as a good guy,\u201d said Davis, who had hired the welder to fix a couple of mufflers. \u201cHe was talented.\u201d He theorizes that Heemeyer was set off after Davis, who had signed Heemeyer\u2019s first petition against the concrete plant, declined to sign a second one. \u201cWe argued,\u201d Davis said. \u201cHe got angry, we had a few words and then he stormed out.\u201d On June 4, Heemeyer used his Komatsu to push Davis\u2019 one-ton flatbed truck through the front of his business. \u201cWho in the hell would do that?\u201d Davis said. \u201cTo have that much hatred and do something like that \u2026\u201d Farrell, the former owner of Gambles hardware, was one of the town council members who approved the concrete plant that Heemeyer so vociferously opposed. He also liked the man well enough. \u201cHe was the greatest welder I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cHe was a little quirky \u2014 but hell, I\u2019m a little quirky.\u201d But Heemeyer also could have a mean streak, he said. In Farrell\u2019s estimation, Heemeyer got ensnared in what became a self-created grudge match with the town \u2014 a place he was convinced was rigged by a good old boys\u2019 network that never accepted him as a true member of the community. Town leaders, Farrell said, made concessions to Heemeyer to reduce the concrete plant\u2019s impacts on his muffler shop, but they weren\u2019t enough. \u201cHe could not live with the fact that with all the fight he put up, the batch plant got approved,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cHe just went nuts.\u201d However Heemeyer might have justified his actions to himself as worthy, the damage he wrought was real and painful for those he targeted, including Farrell and his wife, Rhonda. Farrell had to liquidate thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of appliances and tools damaged by Heemeyer at a fire sale a few weeks after the rampage. A quarter of a million dollars of value evaporated from his business. He had to let five employees go. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep for two months. I was trying to figure out how to support my family,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cWhat about my employees? Should we rebuild?\u201d He doesn\u2019t buy into the admiration for Heemeyer that some people express. On the attack\u2019s fifth anniversary, Farrell said, someone erected a cross and a sign reading \u201cRest in Peace, Marv\u201d at the site of his former business. As he drove by, he couldn\u2019t contain his anger. \u201cI got out and kicked it down,\u201d Farrell said. Rhonda Farrell said the destruction wasn\u2019t limited to what Heemeyer and his dozer did to the Gambles building. \u201cWe were a family, and the loss of that family was devastating,\u201d she said. \u201cI understand the frustration\u201d Despite being victims of Heemeyer\u2019s rage, Larry and Gary Thompson said they can appreciate the difficulty of dealing with government rules and directives. Their family has run an excavating business in Granby since 1949. \u201cI can understand where he was coming from. We deal with it, too,\u201d said Gary Thompson, 64. \u201cWe have too much government. He just snapped.\u201d He quickly added: \u201cI understand the frustration, but that\u2019s not the right way to do it.\u201d The Thompsons believe they made Heemeyer\u2019s target list because their father, Dick Thompson, was a well-connected Granby mayor for years. And their brother Ron Thompson served on the water and sanitation board that Heemeyer despised. Both men died before Heemeyer carried out his dozer rampage, which destroyed three buildings owned by the Thompsons. One of those buildings was leased to Xcel Energy, and the incident produced an iconic image of a utility truck folded in half by the ferocity of Heemeyer\u2019s Komatsu. The picture went viral before viral was a thing. \u201cIt looked like Beirut \u2014 with helicopters and everything,\u201d Larry Thompson said of the scene that day. Across the country, the Granby bulldozer attack caught the imagination of a 5-year-old Cody Detwiler. Twenty years later, he is re-creating Heemeyer\u2019s armored dozer, down to the cameras and internal monitors he used to guide himself on his path of destruction through town. Detwiler is better known as the face of the WhistlinDiesel YouTube channel, where he creatively destroys all manner of vehicles, including vintage and luxury models. The channel has posted videos of the YouTube star buying an abandoned Komatsu D355A bulldozer, the same model as Heemeyer\u2019s, in Montana earlier this year, and transporting it to Tennessee \u2014 via Granby. \u201cIt\u2019s so intriguing to us,\u201d Detwiler told The Post in an interview from Nashville. \u201cWe can definitely appreciate the work ethic that went into this.\u201d WhistlinDiesel has more than 7.3 million YouTube subscribers. Detwiler\u2019s Killdozer videos have garnered nearly 20 million views. Despite Heemeyer\u2019s attack now being two decades gone, Detwiler said, it still stirs up fascination \u2014 and even sympathy \u2014 from his audience. \u201cThis has been a large talking point in the last several years,\u201d said Detwiler, now 25. \u201cWith men and blue-collar workers in the Midwest, it seems to resonate a lot. Marv had a voice and a way to stand up to people, whether it was justified or not. (People) can understand why someone could be pushed to that point.\u201d Music\u2019s extreme metal community has also found common ground with Heemeyer, according to Pat Jarrett, a 41-year-old bass player for the Virginia sludge metal band named \u2014 wait for it \u2014 Heemeyer. While Jarrett says he and his bandmates lean to the left on the political spectrum, they understand the alienation and frustration that fueled Heemeyer\u2019s actions 20 years ago. \u201cMarv Heemeyer is a kind of folk hero in the extreme metal community,\u201d Jarrett said. \u201cCertainly, his rampage was unreasonable, but he was pushed to the point of pushing back. And there\u2019s catharsis in that. \u201cI understand that feeling of wanting to hole up in a garage and build something I could bulldoze with.\u201d A Swiss thrash metal band named Xonor has a song called \u201cKilldozer,\u201d as does Canadian doom metal band Dopethrone. North Carolina metal band Lords and Liars released its own \u201cKilldozer\u201d track. \u201cFocused. Deliberate,\u201d the lyrics go in Lords and Liars\u2019 version. \u201cNothing will stop him but his equipment. Rage born. Revenge machine. He\u2019s going down a way that\u2019s been never seen.\u201d \u201cMarv is part of the lore of heavy metal,\u201d Heemeyer\u2019s Jarrett said. Brower, the journalist and book author, has doubts that Granby will ever fully escape the legacy of Marvin Heemeyer, even if he himself barely did 20 years ago \u2014 running out of his newsroom as the ceilings and walls came crashing down. The internet, in particular, will remain a repository for those who think a 52-year-old welder and muffler repairman did what he had to do. \u201cHe represents a cynicism about government,\u201d Brower said. \u201cAnd because Marv did what he did in such a fantastic and gargantuan way, it has taken on this hyper-mythological status.\u201d Get more Colorado news by signing up for our daily Your Morning Dozen email newsletter.", "summary": "\"He represents a cynicism about government.

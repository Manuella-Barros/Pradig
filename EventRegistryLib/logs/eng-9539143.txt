Source: Facebook of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine\n\nDuring April, the Russian occupation forces lost about 900 Russian invaders every day, approximately the same average daily losses that have been recorded almost since the beginning of this year. However, in May and June, the invaders' losses in manpower are likely to increase.\n\nThis will be an inevitable consequence of the resumption of offensive operations by the Russians after a certain decline in activity after the capture of Avdiivka. This forecast was made by the UK Ministry of Defense, citing the findings of British intelligence.\n\nThus, in April, Russia lost an average of 899 occupants killed and wounded daily. These figures have been relatively stable in recent months. However, the situation may soon change in an unfavorable direction for the invaders.\n\n\"It is likely that Russia's casualties will increase over the next two months again as they resume special offensive operations in eastern Ukraine. This follows a slight decline in the pace of operations over the past two months following the fall of Avdiivka,\" the British Defense Ministry said in a statement.\n\nIn total, since the beginning of the full-scale aggression against Ukraine, Russia has lost more than 465,000 of its military killed and wounded on the battlefield. And, as the British Ministry of Defense has to admit, the value of human life in Russia is perceived in a completely different way than in the civilized world. Therefore, in more than two years of full-scale war, the aggressor state has adapted to a grueling war and achieved success on the battlefield not by the quality of the troops but by the human mass, which is usually preferred over quality.\n\n\"This dependence on mass will almost certainly continue throughout the war in Ukraine and will have long-term consequences for the future of the Russian army,\" the British Ministry of Defense summarized.\n\nEarlier, British intelligence said that the FSB had interrogated another Shoigu deputy as part of a high-profile corruption case.

That's the assessment of Leo Docherty, the British minister for the armed forces, who estimated that \"approximately 450,000 Russian military personnel have been killed or wounded, and tens of thousands more have already deserted since the start of the conflict.\"\n\nMr. Docherty added that \"over 10,000 Russian armored vehicles, including nearly 3,000 main battle tanks, 109 fixed-wing aircraft, 136 helicopters, 346 unmanned aerial vehicles, 23 naval vessels of all classes, and over 1,500 artillery systems of all types have been destroyed, abandoned, or captured by Ukraine since the start of the conflict.\"\n\nMoscow's losses in Ukraine this year also appear to be on course to outstrip those from last year. In 2023, Russian forces sustained 252,570 casualties, according to statistics from the Ukrainian armed forces and a report from Newsweek security and defense reporter Ellie Cook. And from January to April 1, the Kremlin has already sustained 82,870 losses.\n\n\"If Moscow continues to lose the same number of troops each day for the rest of the year, Russian forces would be on track to sustain 331,480 casualties by the end of the year, by Kyiv's count. This far exceeds the number of purported Russian casualties for 2023,\" Ms. Cook writes.\n\nThe U.K. Defense Ministry has also reported that the daily average for Russian casualties continues to rise each year of the war. In 2022, an estimated 400 Russian troops were killed or wounded per day. In 2023, that number rose to 693, and so far in 2024, the number has escalated to 913. On May 2, the New Voice of Ukraine reported that more than 1,000 Russian troops were killed in a 24-hour period, and 20 tanks and 20 artillery systems were destroyed.\n\nIt is telling that Ukraine still managed to inflict this level of damage against the Russian invaders with scarce ammunition even after U.S. aid was halted in the wake of Kevin McCarthy's removal as House speaker by the self-destructive, isolationist faction of the GOP.\n\nAmmunition was so scarce at the time that Ukrainian military commanders told CNN in February that they had to order their troops to fire only at priority targets such as tanks and rocket systems, despite having Russian infantry in their line of fire, placing the small country in an even more untenable position than when it was first invaded.\n\nBut thanks to strong Republican leaders such as House Speaker Mike Johnson, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who helped pass the Ukraine Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, Kyiv's ammunition rationing is at an end. Just before the bill passed, Frederik Mertens, an analyst at the Hague Centre for Strategic Studies, told Newsweek, \"Everything will depend on whether Ukraine will get sufficient artillery ammunition to counter the Russian attacks and inflict sufficient attrition to blunt their offensive.\"\n\nNow, $60.8 billion in aid to protect Ukraine's 38 million population will be disbursed, with $23.2 billion to replenish U.S. weapons, stocks and facilities and $11.3 billion for current U.S. military operations in the region. While the U.S. does not have any troops fighting in Ukraine, it is training Ukrainian soldiers to defend their homeland.\n\nNone of this is good news for Mr. Putin, whose self-destructive path should come as no surprise since he has styled himself as the living embodiment of the failed Soviet Union.\n\nOn Christmas Eve 1979, then-Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev made the irreparable error of ordering Moscow's forces to invade Afghanistan. Nearly a decade later, after 15,000 Russian soldiers were killed and 35,000 were wounded, Moscow was forced to withdraw, suffering a humiliating defeat on the world stage for the second most powerful nation on Earth. Two years later, the Communist Party collapsed, along with the entire Soviet infrastructure.\n\nMr. Putin has called the collapse of the Soviet Union \"the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.\" His illegal invasion of Ukraine is a transparent attempt to rebuild the USSR from the ashes of a once-feared military empire that wreaked havoc and violence throughout the world. But three years into his reckless, senseless war with Ukraine, Mr. Putin's incompetent leadership has led Russia to suffer nearly 10 times the number of casualties the Soviet army did in Afghanistan in just one-third of the time.\n\nIn an almost predictable fait accompli, Mr. Putin's mercilessness will lead him to the same fate of the Soviet empire he reveres, buried in the ashes of history in humiliating defeat.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Russia has made some gains in recent days, but has also suffered heavy human losses and seen the destruction of military equipment and weapons systems.\n\nFigures said to show Russian losses -- of its personnel, tanks, aircraft, and more -- are released each day by Ukraine's Ministry of Defense. The stats are fed into interactive graphs on the department's website, which allows users a broad view of the battles across the entire time scale of the war.\n\nKyiv also shares a tally of Russian losses each day on social media site X, formerly Twitter, although the figures provided on X are occasionally slightly different to the final statistics uploaded to the website, which is done after a full assessment has been conducted.\n\nOn the Ministry of Defense website's graph for Russian losses of artillery systems, the data provided by Kyiv for Friday, May 3, says that there were 89 unit losses. The figures were reported on May 4, the ministry said.\n\nNewsweek has been unable to independently confirm these figures and has reached out to both Russia's Foreign Ministry and Ukraine's Ministry of Defense for comment.\n\nFriday's number dwarfs the counts for other artillery losses during the war. The next highest loss was 66 Russian artillery units lost on February 13 this year. And there was another significant hit last month, when 43 Russian artillery systems were taken out.\n\nThe reported 89 losses topped a successful week for Ukrainian military, according to the country's officials, with the previous six days' count bringing the week's total artillery losses for Russia to 264 units.\n\nOn Monday, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense shared the latest \"losses of the Russian occupiers\" on X. The numbers provided are drawn from February 24, 2022, until May 6, this year. The May 6 losses are shown as an additional number in orange, and state that 38 artillery units were lost by Russia that day, according to Kyiv. It brings the total to 12,250 artillery losses throughout the entire war.\n\nThe chart was uploaded with a somber quote attributed to the late American war journalist Ernie Pyle: \"I love the infantry because they are the underdogs. They are the mud-rain-frost-and-wind boys. They have no comforts, and they even learn to live without the necessities. And in the end they are the guys that wars can't be won without.\"\n\nThe chart also shows that 7,380 Russian tanks have been destroyed and 9,683 UAV drones taken out, according to Kyiv, which says it has also \"eliminated\" 475,300 Russian soldiers during the war.\n\nUkraine has not given an update of its own losses since President Volodymyr Zelensky said in February that 31,000 of his troops had been killed. However, Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu puts the figure far higher and said this month that Kyiv's troop losses had surpassed 111,000.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is said to be displeased with Shoigu and recently made a public gesture intended to punish him for his inability to achieve the Kremlin's military goals in Ukraine, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW).", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chloe_mayer@newsweek.com", "name": "Chloe Mayer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Russia)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attrition_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attrition warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howitzer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Howitzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Russia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Shoigu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Shoigu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infantry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_the_Study_of_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Institute for the Study of War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Weight_Loss", "label": "dmoz/Health/Weight Loss", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Weight_Loss", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Weight Loss", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2388429/ukraine-soldiers-march-2023.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=9df4b16a3a371c0b5ccad9dfb94fb006", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539143", "eventUri": "eng-9539143", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 1659, "textEnd": 1664}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 1732, "textEnd": 1737}, {"amb": false, "date": "-02-13", "textStart": 2063, "textEnd": 2074}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 2560, "textEnd": 2565, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 223668454, "title": "MUTV forced into apology after interview with Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag", "text": "Erik ten Hag's foul mouth forced an MUTV presenter to jump in and apologise as the Dutchman hailed the club's fans. Those from the red half of the city saw Manchester United claim a surprise FA Cup victory, seeing off hot favourites Manchester City in the process. Goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo ensured the Red Devils finished a difficult year on a high. The club's fanbase have seen them finish eighth, their worst ever Premier League position, but have stuck by the players during that time. Ten Hag referenced the loyalty they showed after the recent drubbing at Crystal Palace - dropping in an explicative for good measure. The United boss said: \u201cI am proud as well. The players and the staff, they did an incredible job. And the fans, the whole season\u2026 I remember Crystal Palace a couple of weeks ago when we played s*** and they (the fans) backed us.\u201d MUTV presenter Mark Sullivan had to quickly jump in and say: \u201cExcuse the language there, it\u2019s okay! Erik\u2019s not speaking in his native tongue.\u201d Ten Hag went on to add: \u201cThey are incredible. I said it last week after Newcastle, they are the best fans in the world. So I am really grateful.\u201d The Dutchman himself faces an uncertain future despite partying into the night as he delivered another trophy. Ten Hag's position has come under fire due to a succession of poor performances but he's won two pieces of silverware in his two years with the club. United are set to conduct a review into their season, which will determine whether or not they stick by their current manager. There is already talk of who could replace him with Thomas Tuchel and Kieran McKenna reportedly on the club's radar. Ten Hag though has issued a defiant response to the sack reports: \"I'm in the project and we're exactly where we want to be. We're constructing a team. When I took over, it was a mess at United. The team is developing and winning trophies, and playing to an identity, but you need the players to be available. If they don't want me anymore, I'll go somewhere else and win trophies because that's what I've done my whole career.\" Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

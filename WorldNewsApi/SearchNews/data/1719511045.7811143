With the mission \"to change the law and culture of the nation,\" the publication reports, \"by helping do away with the separation of church and state,\" the far-right group has become \"the go-to firm\" for GOP officials. Rollin Stone reports: According to public records produced at Rolling Stone\u2019s request, Idaho has partnered with ADF on at least four separate lawsuits recently: U.S. v. State of Idaho (concerning whether the state\u2019s abortion ban violates the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act), Poe v. Labrador (the gender-affirming care case), State of Washington et al. v. United States Food & Drug Administration et al. (concerning the FDA approval of mifepristone) and Roe v. Critchfield (over a ban on trans students using the bathroom that matches their gender identity). It\u2019s not just Idaho \u2014 an alarming number of Republican officials are outsourcing their most controversial lawsuits to the legal advocacy group. Rolling Stoneobtained contracts that ADF entered into with Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach to help him defend a law that forces abortion providers to give inaccurate information to their patients, and Yavapai County Attorney Dennis McGrane as he sought to intervene in a case challenging Arizona\u2019s pre-Civil War abortion ban. Records show Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds previously recruited ADF to represent the State of Iowa and the Iowa Board of Medicine as they defended a 24-hour waiting period for in-state abortions passed in 2020, and a 2018 ban on abortions after cardiac activity. (Both lawsuits were brought against the state by Planned Parenthood.)

It\u2019s a terrifying outcome for democracy and law.\" While \"It\u2019s not unusual for attorneys general to bring on outside counsel when they\u2019re going to the Supreme Court. Historically, however, experts say, it has not been common for attorneys general to outsource their litigation efforts to private, agenda-driven interest groups,\" the publication notes. \"It\u2019s no great shock that attorneys general, over the last decade, have increasingly become frontline soldiers in our legal cultural wars,\" University of Texas law professor Steve Vladeck told Rolling Stone. \"But part of why that\u2019s been possible is because of the special abilities, and the special privileges that states and other government actors have as litigants.\" READ MORE: Senate Republican slams 'criminal' Texas attorney general for 'pushing Russian propaganda' He added, \"These attorneys general were elected to represent the people of their state, not the Alliance Defending Freedom.

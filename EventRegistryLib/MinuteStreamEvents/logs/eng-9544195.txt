In exchange, Israel will release the agreed number of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons, according to the lists that will be provided by Hamas.\n\n- Israel partially withdraws troops from Gaza and allows the free movement of Palestinians from south to north Gaza. - Cessation of military flights over the Gaza Strip will take place for 10 hours per day and 12 hours on the day of releasing the hostages and prisoners.\n\n- On the third day after releasing the first Palestinian prisoners, the Israeli forces will completely withdraw from al-Rashid street in northern Gaza, and all military sites will be dismantled. - On the 22nd day of the first phase, Israeli forces will withdraw from the centre of the strip, east of Salah al-Din road to an area near the Israeli border.\n\nPHASE TWO - Another 42-day period that features an agreement to restore a \"sustainable calm\" to Gaza, language that an official briefed on the talks said Hamas and Israel had agreed in order to take discussion of a \"permanent ceasefire\" off the table.\n\n- The complete withdrawal of most Israeli troops from Gaza. - Hamas releases Israeli reservists and some soldiers in return for Israel releasing Palestinians from jail.\n\nPHASE THREE - The completion of exchanging bodies and starting the implementation of reconstruction according to the plan overseen by Qatar, Egypt and the United Nations. - Ending the complete blockade on the Gaza Strip.\n\n- Start of the implementation of a 3-5 year plan for reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, including homes, civilian facilities and infrastructure, and compensation for all those affected, under the supervision of a number of countries and organisations including Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_prisoners_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian prisoners of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blockade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reservist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saladin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saladin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_05_2019_11_52_07_9391333.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544195", "eventUri": "eng-9544195", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

would yield an end to the war, whereas Israel has said repeatedly that it will not accept a deal that involves ending the war and will resume its campaign to destroy Hamas once any deal has been carried out.\n\nThe United States, which alongside Qatar and Egypt has played a mediation role in the talks, said it was studying the Hamas response and would discuss it with Middle East allies.\n\nThe specifics set out by Hamas on Monday differ to some extent from the reported terms of what the US hailed a week ago as an \"extremely generous\" Israeli offer.\n\nBased on details announced so far by Hamas officials and an official briefed on the talks, the deal that the terrorist group said it had agreed to includes the following:\n\n- Hamas's release of 33 Israeli hostages in

will resume its military campaign after any truce-for-hostages deal, in order to complete its two declared war goals: returning the hostages and destroying Hamas's military and governance capabilities.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also said that Israel will ensure there can be no future terrorist threat to Israel from Gaza.\n\nNetanyahu's office said late Monday that the Hamas offer was far from meeting Israel's essential demands, but that it would send negotiators to continue talks with the US, Egyptian, and Qatari mediators.", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com",

In exchange, Israel will release the agreed number of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons, according to the lists that will be provided by Hamas.\n\n- Israel partially withdraws troops from Gaza and allows the free movement of Palestinians from south to north Gaza.\n\n- Cessation of military flights over the Gaza Strip will take place for 10 hours per day and 12 hours on the day of releasing the hostages and prisoners.\n\n- On the third day after releasing the first Palestinian prisoners, the Israeli forces will completely withdraw from al-Rashid street in northern Gaza, and all military sites will be dismantled.\n\n- On the 22nd day of the first phase, Israeli forces will withdraw from the centre of the strip, east of Salah al-Din road to an area near the Israeli border.\n\n- Another 42-day period that features an agreement to restore a \"sustainable calm\" to Gaza, language that an official briefed on the talks said Hamas and Israel had agreed in order to take discussion of a \"permanent ceasefire\" off the table.\n\n- The complete withdrawal of most Israeli troops from Gaza.\n\n- Hamas releases Israeli reservists and some soldiers in return for Israel releasing Palestinians from jail.\n\n- The completion of exchanging bodies and starting the implementation of reconstruction according to the plan overseen by Qatar, Egypt and the United Nations.\n\n- Ending the complete blockade on the Gaza Strip.\n\n- Start of the implementation of a 3-5 year plan for reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, including homes, civilian facilities and infrastructure, and compensation for all those affected, under the supervision of a number of countries and organisations including Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations.\n\nThe deal strikes me as laughably one-sided. It gives Israel the hostages criminally abducted by Hamas back very slowly in exchange for massive numbers of prisoners of war, a very long respite, and gobs of assistance. It essentially gives Hamas everything it wants -- rewarding its crimes -- while Israel eventually gets back its hostages, quite possibly dead. It does nothing to dismantle Hamas. Why on earth would Israel agree to that?\n\nFrankly, any deal that doesn't return all of the hostages on Day 1 is a non-starter.\n\nSteven Erlanger details the domestic politics of this for the NYT (\"With a Gaza Cease-Fire in the Balance, Netanyahu Maneuvers to Keep Power\"):\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, is known as a man who likes to play for time and postpone big decisions. But he may not be able to do that much longer.\n\nDomestically, his coalition partners on the far right threaten to break up the government if he agrees to a cease-fire and does not try to clear Hamas out of Rafah, in southern Gaza.\n\nMilitarily, the strategic logic is to complete the dismantling of Hamas by taking Rafah and controlling the border with Egypt. But diplomatically, his allies, especially the United States, are pushing him to agree on a cease-fire, and skip Rafah and the potential civilian casualties a large-scale operation would cause.\n\nSo Mr. Netanyahu is now negotiating and maneuvering on several fronts at once, all of which have a significant effect on the conduct of the war and his own future as prime minister.\n\nHis recent warnings to Palestinians in parts of Rafah to move to areas Israel has designated as safe, followed late Monday night by the Israeli military's seizure of the Gazan side of the Egyptian border, signaled to his far-right government coalition, to Hamas and to the Biden administration that he would continue to prioritize Israel's security interests. More important, Israel's more narrow war cabinet, which includes senior opposition figures, backed those decisions.\n\nThe seizure of the Rafah crossing to Egypt, to try to complete Israel's security control of Gaza's borders, has, for now, avoided a large-scale and contentious military operation in Rafah itself, which is filled with displaced civilians. It may signal that Israel is preparing at long last to agree to at least a temporary cease-fire in Gaza, even as the outcome of those negotiations remains uncertain.\n\nAside from the hostage families, there is essentially no Jewish group in Israel pushing for an end to the war short of the utter annihilation of Hamas. Even the left-most parties share that goal -- however unrealistic it may be.\n\nIsraeli military officials and analysts emphasize that cutting off the smuggling of arms and equipment from Egypt through the tunnels under Rafah is strategically more important to Israel than the Hamas fighters left in Rafah.\n\nDespite Egyptian denials of extensive smuggling into Gaza, Israeli officials believe that much of the extraordinary arsenal and the building supplies that Hamas accumulated in Gaza came through tunnels from Egypt.\n\n\"If we end the war without blocking the tunnels, we would enable Hamas or any other terrorist organization in the Strip to rebuild their military capacities,\" said Kobi Michael of the Institute for National Security Studies, a research group in Tel Aviv.\n\nNitzan Nuriel, a reserve brigadier general and former director of the counterterrorism bureau of the Israeli National Security Council, worked with Mr. Netanyahu for several years. \"Rafah is important not because of the four Hamas battalions that are still there,\" he said. \"Rafah is important because the message to the Palestinians who live in Gaza is that Hamas will not be able to control Gaza for good.\"\n\nOtherwise, he said, Gazans would \"stay afraid of Hamas and therefore will cooperate with Hamas.\"\n\nEven a modest operation in Rafah \"fits several of Netanyahu's goals simultaneously,\" said Natan Sachs, director of the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution.\n\nLike many Israeli officials, including those who want a cease-fire deal now, Mr. Sachs said, \"Netanyahu genuinely believes an operation in Rafah is central to Israel's overall goals -- not merely in going after the remaining Hamas forces, but in cutting off their ability to resupply via smuggling through the Egyptian border.\"\n\nThe military operation \"also puts pressure on Hamas to relent on some of its more expansive demands in the cease-fire negotiations,\" Mr. Sachs said.\n\nPretty much across the board, October 7 was seen as an existential crisis. A return to the status quo ante, in which Hamas is capable of murdering Israelis whenever they choose, is not an acceptable outcome.\n\nThe external pressures, while understandable, are just unrealistic given that reality.\n\nMr. Netanyahu is under enormous pressure diplomatically -- from allies like Washington and Berlin, from the United Nations, from the European Union and from regional Sunni Arab states -- to avoid a major operation in Rafah.\n\nThey want him to allow in much more humanitarian aid to Gaza and agree to a deal with Hamas that could, at least, promise what the current draft text calls a \"sustainable calm,\" rather than a permanent cease-fire.\n\nBut such a deal still would not resolve the fundamental divide between Israel and Hamas over how to conclude the conflict.\n\nHamas wants the war to end now, with the withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Gaza and the release of all hostages in exchange for a large number of Palestinians held in Israeli jails.\n\nSuch an outcome would essentially reward Hamas for October 7. It's just not going to happen.\n\nThe problem remains what it has been from the outset: there's no obvious endstate that leads to a better state of the peace. Even if it were somehow possible to kill every single Hamas operative, it wouldn't necessarily end the terrorist threat. And the killing of tens of thousands of Palestinian noncombatants will almost surely create another generation of volunteers.\n\nNor is there a plausible diplomatic solution that yields a \"sustainable calm.\" A two-state solution is a fantasy. Not only do the Israelis and Palestinians want the same capital city and historic landmarks but there just isn't a large enough parcel of land available to sustain the entire Palestinian diaspora. And, even if there were and we could convince the political leadership of the Palestinians and the Jews alike to come to an agreement that resettles people in their respective new states, the extremists will continue to have a veto power by killing innocents and restarting the war.", "source": {"uri": "outsidethebeltway.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Outside the Beltway"}, "authors":

( Image Source :Getty )\n\nAfter a glimmer of hope emerged in the form of a three-phased ceasefire deal, in what seemed like a possible end to the seven-month-old war that has caused large-scale destruction and killed around 1,200 people, Israel on Monday denied having accepted the truce proposal, hours after Hamas said it accepted it.\n\nThe Palestinian Islamist group Hamas stated on May 6 that it had agreed on the deal extended by mediators from Qatar and Egypt which included a three-phased deal on ceasefire and hostages-for-prisoners swap. However, an Israeli official said that the deal was not acceptable to Israel as its terms had been \"softened\" and included \"far-reaching\" conclusions that were unacceptable, news agency Reuters reported.\n\nIn a bid to put an end to the war, the United States along with Qatar and Egypt has played a crucial role in the mediation talks. Following Hamas' response the US said it was analysing the response Hamas and would further discuss it with the Middle East allies.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Hamas stated that its chief Ismail Haniyeh had told Qatar Prime Minister and Egypt's intelligence chief that it was accepting their truce proposal.\n\nLast week,CIA Director Bill Burns travelled to Cairo and Doha to work with the Qataris on the language of the deal, to turn it into a workable basis for discussions with Israel.\n\nBased on that draft, Israel will reportedly be sending a team of experts to join more talks in Cairo on Tuesday, CNN reported.\n\nAccording to the details announced by the Hamas officials, the deal that the Palestinian group agreed to, included the following:\n\nPhase One\n\nThe phase one of the proposed truce deal is a 42-day ceasefire period. During this period, Hamas agreed to release 33 Israeli hostages, specifically women, elderly, children, and sick, in return for Israel releasing its citizens that have been held hostage in the Israeli jails.\n\nFor every Israeli hostage released by Hamas, 30 Palestinian women and children will be released, and for every Israeli hostage over the age of 50, 30 Palestinian prisoners over the age of 50, CNN reported.\n\nDuring the first phase, female Israeli Defence Forces soldiers are to be released. For every IDF women soldier released, Israel was to release 50 Palestinian prisoners, including 30 serving life sentences.\n\nThe agreement also stated that Hamas could include bodies of dead hostages to complete the 33 number.\n\nAlso, Israel would partially withdraw its troops from Gaza and permit free movement of Palestinians to north Gaza from south.\n\nPhase Two\n\nIn the next phase of the deal there is another 42-day period featuring an agreement in order to restore a \"sustainable calm\" in Gaza, release the remaining hostages, including IDF male soldiers and civilian men.\n\nThe Reuters report stated that Israel and Hamas had agreed to take the \"permanent ceasefire\" discussion off the table. Hamas is also to release Israeli reservists and some soldiers in return for Israel releasing Palestinians from jail.\n\nThe second phase includes complete withdrawal of most of the Israeli troops from Gaza strip.\n\nPhase Three\n\nAccording to CNN, the third phase includes a three to five year rebuilding plan in Gaza. The blockade on the Gaza strip will also be ended completely.\n\nThere will also be a complete exchange of the remaining bodies and the implementation of reconstruction will be done according to the plan laid down by Qatar, Egypt and the United Nations.\n\nALSO READ: UN Says Post-War Reconstruction In Gaza Could Cost Around $40 Billion -- Biggest Since World War 2\n\nMeanwhile, an IDF spokesperson told the Guardian that it would continue to act in Gaza in an \"operational manner\" despite Hamas agreeing to the ceasefire deal.\n\nCommenting on the ceasefire announcement, rear Admiral Daniel Hagari stated: \"We are exploring every single thing that we hear and we are exhausting the potential about negotiations and bringing back the hostages and that is our main mission, to bring them home as quickly as possible, but in parallel, we are continuing to act in an operational manner in the Gaza strip and we will continue to do so.\"\n\nHamas' acceptance to the three-phase deal came in hours after Israel issued orders to evacuate some 1,00,000 Palestianians from eastern Rafah as part of its 90-day plan to invade Rafah, where around 1.4 million Palestinians are taking refuge.\n\nAmidst this, the threat of an-out Israeli assault on Rafah still looms as the United States has pledged its commitment to stop Israel from proceeding with its plan.", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William J.

Here's why that won't bring an immediate end to the war in Gaza - Egypt Independent", "body": "When Hamas declared on Monday evening that it has \"agreed\" to a ceasefire deal, it caught many off guard. Israel was evidently not expecting it, and it was not even immediately clear what Hamas had agreed to.\n\nHamas' announcement was initially met with jubilation in Gaza and cautious optimism by regional leaders after it was presented as an acceptance of an Israeli proposal. But Israel issued what looked like a holding position, saying that Hamas' position was \"far from\" meeting its demands.\n\nAnd it pressed on with a controversial military operation in Rafah, southern Gaza, conducting air strikes on Monday and seizing control of the Palestinian side of a border crossing with Egypt on Tuesday morning amid intense pressure from his hardline coalition go all-in.\n\nAt the same time, Israel said that it would send a delegation to Cairo to assess Hamas' position. The CIA director, Bill Burns, traveled to Cairo on Tuesday and was expected to hold a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv on Wednesday.\n\nSo what's going on?\n\nHamas said on Monday that it has accepted an Egyptian-Qatari proposal for a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza, which includes a ceasefire, a complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, an exchange of captives, reconstruction of the territory, and the lifting of Israel's blockade of the enclave.\n\nThe offer by Hamas would start with the release of 33 hostages from Israel in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners over a 42-day period, and end with the rebuilding of Gaza during \"a period of sustainable calm,\" according to a document shared with CNN by a regional source familiar with negotiations.\n\nA diplomatic source familiar with the talks told CNN earlier that the reference to sustainable calm was \"a way to agree to a permanent ceasefire without calling it that.\"\n\nThe deal would be divided into three-phases, each lasting 42 days. It would include an eventual Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in the second phase, according to the document seen by CNN.\n\nUS officials have pushed back on Hamas' claim that it had \"agreed\" to a ceasefire deal, instead characterizing the response as a counterproposal with changes. That counterproposal will need further negotiation, they said, and is being treated as a communication tactic to publicly demonstrate that Hamas is willing to make an agreement.\n\nStill, the White House said Tuesday that a close reading of Israel and Hamas' separate negotiating positions indicates the two sides should be able to strike an agreement.\n\nIsrael says the deal offered by Hamas isn't what Israel helped craft with Egypt last week, with war cabinet member Benny Gantz saying Monday that Hamas' version \"does not correspond to the dialogue that has taken place so far with the mediators and has significant gaps.\" Netanyahu said the war cabinet \"unanimously determined\" that Hamas' offer was \"very far from Israel's core demands.\"\n\nIsrael did however send a working-level delegation to Cairo to better understand the Hamas offer and determine whether a deal can be forged.\n\nThe biggest sticking point is the question of a permanent ceasefire and how to address it in the deal. The Hamas proposal calls for an end to the war, which is a red line for Netanyahu, a senior American official told CNN.\n\nFrank Lowenstein, who worked as Special Envoy for Israeli-Palestinian Negotiations under US President Barack Obama during the 2014 Israel-Gaza war, told CNN that this may be \"the moment of truth for the blame-game both sides have been playing with the ceasefire negotiations.\"\n\n\"Hamas has apparently accepted the constructive ambiguity about duration that the mediators have been proposing, along with 'guarantees' of a permanent ceasefire that are obviously not enforceable,\" Lowenstein said, adding that it is now up to Netanyahu -- \"he would much rather invade Rafah for his extremist coalition politics than have a ceasefire that could end the war and likely bring elections.\"\n\nIsrael argues that Rafah is Hamas last bastion in Gaza, and last week Netanyahu vowed to launch a ground operation there irrespective of a deal with Hamas and in defiance of US pressure not to go ahead.\n\nOn Monday evening, the Israeli military conducted air strikes against what it said were Hamas targets in eastern Rafah. By Tuesday morning, it had seized control of the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, replacing Palestinian flags there with Israeli ones in a show of control. The move followed an order by the Israeli military to about 100,000 residents of northern Rafah to evacuate immediately.\n\nThe Hamas ceasefire offer was designed to \"torpedo\" the Rafah operation, Netanyahu said, and \"that did not happen.\"\n\nThe Rafah crossing is a \"strategic site\" for Hamas, Barak Ravid, CNN political and global affairs analyst, told CNN's Anderson Cooper, adding that it is seen as a symbol of Hamas's continued control of Gaza.\n\nIsrael's seizure of the crossing may have damaged Hamas' image before the Palestinian people in Gaza, and it acts as leverage to make Hamas \"more flexible in hostage talks,\" he said.\n\nThe Rafah operation wasn't on the scale of a major ground incursion the Biden administration had been warning Israel against, but it may have been designed to appease some of the extremist ministers in Netanyahu's cabinet who have been pressuring him to press on with an invasion of the city and threatening to collapse his coalition if he doesn't comply.\n\nUS officials told CNN Tuesday that the Biden administration doesn't believe Israeli military activity in Rafah is the beginning of a major operation into southern Gaza and a source familiar with Israeli plans said that a limited incursion into Rafah was intended to keep pressure on Hamas to agree a deal that would bring about a ceasefire and a hostage release.\n\nA military operation in Rafah may be in the interest of both Israel and Hamas, said Lowenstein, the former US negotiator.\n\n\"Bibi (Netanyahu) wants to show how tough he is by standing up to us (the US) and the world to defend Israel. And Hamas thinks he's walking into a trap in Rafah that will leave Israel even more isolated, including from the US, and subject to even greater international condemnation.\"\n\nHamas and Israel have accused each other of obstructing an agreement and prolonging the war.\n\nExperts say both sides are pushing for maximalist demands because their political survival depends on it.\n\nNetanyahu finds himself in a tough spot. He faces intense pressure from his closest international allies and the families of Israeli hostages to agree to a ceasefire deal and avoid a full-scale invasion of Rafah, as well as the need to oblige hardliners in his fragile coalition who don't want him to stop until Hamas is eliminated.\n\nHamas may also be wary of its fate if the war ends without a guarantee of a permanent ceasefire.\n\nSince the short ceasefire deal in November, Hamas has not been interested in a deal with Israel that doesn't include a permanent end to hostilities, Lowenstein said, as the group believes that is the only scenario that ensures its survival.\n\n\"Both sides only want a ceasefire deal that ensures their political survival,\" Lowenstein said. \"For Hamas, that's a permanent ceasefire that allows them to retain some military capabilities. For Bibi, it's only a temporary pause on the path to 'total victory'.\"\n\nHussein Ibish, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, DC, says that even though both Hamas and Netanyahu believe they have benefited politically from the continuation of the conflict, pressure has been mounting domestically for both to end hostilities.\n\n\"Hamas is under tremendous pressure, including to some extent from its own leaders living outside of Gaza, to accept cease-fire proposals from Egypt and Qatar in order to gain some respite for the organization\" and relief for the Palestinians in Gaza, Ibish told CNN.\n\nBut Hamas may be aware that it has better chances of survival than Netanyahu, even if the group re-emerges in a different form, he says.\n\n\"Hamas will survive. It is a political organization and a brand-name. It is not a list of individuals who can be killed or infrastructure and equipment that can be destroyed,\" Ibish said. \"Netanyahu, on the other hand, both personally and politically will not survive forever.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN's Abeer Salman, Becky Anderson and Jeremy Diamond, Christian Edwards, Mostafa Salem, Nic Robertson, Lauren Izso, Michael

However, the group informed negotiators that not all hostages who would be freed in the first phase are still living.\n\nAs per the proposed three-phase ceasefire deal, Hamas will free 33 Israeli hostages, alive or dead, in return for Israel releasing 30 children and women for each released Israeli hostage, based on lists provided by Hamas according to the earliest date of detention.\n\nHamas on Monday said it accepts a proposal for a truce in the seven-month-old war in Gaza.

In exchange, Israel will release the agreed number of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons, according to the lists that will be provided by Hamas.\n\nOn the third day after releasing the first Palestinian prisoners, the Israeli forces will completely withdraw from al-Rashid street in northern Gaza, and all military sites will be dismantled.\n\nOn the 22nd day of the first phase, Israeli forces will withdraw from the centre of the strip, east of Salah al-Din road to an area near the Israeli border.\n\nIn phase two, the group has proposed to release Israeli reservists and some soldiers in return for Israel releasing Palestinians from jail.\n\nPhase three would see the completion of exchanging bodies and starting the implementation of reconstruction according to the plan overseen by Qatar, Egypt and the United Nations.\n\nAn Israeli official, meanwhile, has said the deal was not acceptable to Israel because terms had been \"softened\", reported Reuters.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the proposal \"is far from Israel's essential demands\", but the government will send negotiators for talks \"to exhaust the potential for arriving at an agreement\".\n\nHamas member Khalil al-Hayya told the Qatar-based Al Jazeera channel the proposal also includes a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza with the goal of a \"permanent ceasefire\".\n\nNetanyahu has vowed to send ground troops into Rafah regardless of any truce, defying international concerns.\n\nIn the statement responding to Hamas's announcement, Netanyahu's office also said the Rafah offensive will go ahead \"to exert military pressure on Hamas in order to advance the release of our hostages\".\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nNetanyahu has rejected Hamas demands for an end to the Gaza war in exchange for the freeing of hostages, saying that would keep the Palestinian Islamist group in power and pose a threat to Israel.\n\nThe war began after an assault by Hamas on southern Israel on October 7 in which 1,200 people were killed and 252 hostages taken, according to Israeli tallies.", "source": {"uri":

It released details of the proposal, a three-phase agreement that would lead to a period of \"sustained calm,\" a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and a reconstruction plan established for the war-torn enclave.\n\nDuring the first phase of that deal, Hamas would release 33 Israeli hostages, both alive or dead, including women (civilians and soldiers), children (under the age of 19, other than soldiers), those over the age of 50, and sick and wounded civilians, in exchange for numbers of detainees in Israeli prisons.\n\nThe main focus of the negotiations was the \"slow and gradual\" rate at which Hamas wanted to release the 130 hostages it has, to which Israel is objecting.\n\nHamas wants to stagger the release over a long period to use them as bargaining chips until its key demands - full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, a permanent ceasefire and the unconditional return home of Palestinians displaced by the war - are met by Israel.\n\nThe militant group fears that without strong guarantees from Qatar, the US and Egypt, Israel would resume military operations in Gaza if the hostages were freed too soon.\n\nIn the Wednesday talks, attended by Defence Minister Gallant, Mossad chief David Barnea and Shin Bet head Ronen Bar, the CIA chief said Israel should see an end to the war as a \"comma\" and \"not a full stop,\" Israel's Channel 12 reported.\n\nIsraeli officials claimed the Hamas proposal, received Monday night, crossed \"every red line,\" it added.\n\nHowever, sources speaking to The National suggest some progress has been made - with Israel agreeing to release prisoners serving life sentences in Israeli jail.\n\nThe specific prisoners to be released are yet to be negotiated, they added.\n\nThe White House has also expressed optimism a deal can be reached.\n\n\"They should be able to close the remaining gaps and we're going to do everything we can to support that process and achieve that,\" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller also said the US is working \"very hard\" to get a deal over the line, but denied Hamas' claim to have accepted a deal.\n\n\"Hamas did not accept the ceasefire proposal. Hamas responded, and in their response made several suggestions.

The Israeli delegation departed later on Thursday, with sources telling Kan news agency that \"irreconcilable gaps\" emerged in recent days between the parties during the talks. The Israeli cabinet is scheduled to meet on Thursday night.\n\nThe departures come as another indication that a deal is not close.

Israel would free 30 Palestinian prisoners for each female civilian hostage released.\n\nIsrael rejected those terms, including Hamas' insistence that it choose which Palestinian prisoners are released from Israeli jails without an Israeli veto.

Here are the key sticking points.\n\nEnd of war\n\nHamas has rejected previous drafts of a ceasefire deal as it offered only a limited ceasefire in Gaza, where more than 34,000 Palestinians have died since October.\n\nIsrael blocked attempts to add caveats allowing for a lasting truce, as the Israeli leadership insisted that the IDF's operation in Gaza should continue until a \"total victory\" over Hamas has been achieved.\n\nAs the prospects of such a victory became elusive, Israel last month agreed to a draft deal that would allow a six-week ceasefire, accompanied by a partial withdrawal of its troops. The second stage of the ceasefire then talks about creating \"conditions for a sustainable calm\".\n\nThe vague phrasing left room for interpretation and could have potentially allowed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to get it past his hard-Right allies in the government.\n\nBut the proposal that Hamas signed on to on Monday described a permanent end to hostilities and the IDF's complete withdrawal from Gaza, to which no one in the Israeli government is prepared to agree.\n\nHostage release\n\nIsrael has blocked previous ceasefire deals while it demanded that Hamas provide a full list of hostages, some of whom they suspected were already dead.\n\nHamas insisted it needed a ceasefire in place first in order to locate and identify each hostage. Several Israelis appear to have been abducted by mobs that followed Hamas fighters from Gaza in the chaos of the Oct 7 attack.\n\nIsrael most recently agreed to lower the number of vulnerable hostages to be released in the first stage of a ceasefire, from 40 to 33 after Hamas claimed it did not have that many female, underage, elderly or wounded hostages to set free.\n\nUnder the proposal approved by Hamas on Monday the dead bodies of some of the women and children could be included in the first hostage release.\n\nPalestinian prisoners\n\nUnder the first and only hostage deal that came through in November, Israel released some 150 women and children from Israeli prisons, none of whom were jailed for violent crimes.\n\nThe latest proposal put forward by Israel offers a gradual release of more Palestinian prisoners depending on the release of the Israeli hostages.\n\nIsrael committed to free 20 prisoners aged over 50 serving short sentences for every vulnerable hostage and 20 prisoners serving life for every female soldier released.\n\nHamas, however, is seeking higher-profile prisoners including those convicted of terrorism. Hamas demanded that at least 30 of 400 in total would be serving life sentences for terrorism charges.\n\nThe deal put forward by the Israelis provided for a veto on the identities of the Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe possibility of a veto was removed by Hamas from the draft it adopted on Monday.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nataliya_vasilyeva@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Nataliya Vasilyeva", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/world-news/2024/05/08/TELEMMGLPICT000376826791_17151785928870_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf-TmYAsNfctFq3zdF7iCMV8.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544195", "eventUri": "eng-9544195", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1849, "textEnd": 1854}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Some 128 hostages remain in Gaza and 36 have been declared dead, according to the latest Israeli figures.\n\nBiden, who says Israel has not produced a convincing plan to safeguard civilians in Rafah, issued his starkest warning yet against a full ground invasion.\n\n\"I made it clear that if they go into Rafah,...I'm not supplying the weapons,\" Biden told CNN in an interview on Wednesday.\n\nThe Israeli military has the munitions it requires for operations in Rafah and other planned operations, chief armed forces spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said.\n\nIn Cairo, delegations from Hamas, Israel, the U.S., Egypt and Qatar had been meeting since Tuesday. The talks in Egypt's capital made some headway but no deal was reached, according to two Egyptian security sources.\n\nIzzat El-Risheq, a member of Hamas' political office in Qatar, said the Hamas delegation had left Cairo, having reaffirmed its approval of the mediators' ceasefire proposal. The plan entails the release of Israeli hostages held captive in Gaza and a number of Palestinians jailed by Israel.\n\nHamas blamed Israel for the lack of agreement so far.\n\nIsrael has said it is open to a truce, but has rejected demands for an end to the war.\n\nU.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said\n\nWashington continued to engage with Israel on amendments to a ceasefire proposal, adding work to finalize the text of an agreement was \"incredibly difficult\".\n\nOn Tuesday, Israeli tanks seized the Gaza side of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, cutting off a vital aid route and forcing 80,000 people to flee the city this week, according to the United Nations.\n\nIsrael kept up tank and aerial strikes across Gaza and tanks advanced in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City in the north, forcing hundreds of families to flee, residents said. The Israeli military said it was securing Zeitoun, starting with a series of intelligence-based aerial strikes on approximately 25 militant targets.\n\nDeir Al-Balah in central Gaza was heaving with people who had fled Rafah in recent days. Palestinian medics said two people, including a woman, were killed when a drone fired a missile at a group of people there.\n\nThe closure of the Rafah crossing with Egypt has prevented the evacuation of the wounded and sick and the entry of medical supplies, food trucks and fuel needed to operate hospitals, the Gaza health ministry said on Thursday.\n\nThe only kidney dialysis centre in the Rafah area had stopped operating due to the shelling.\n\n\"There used to be medical aid coming in, and now there is no medical aid,\" said Ali Abu Khurma, a Jordanian surgeon volunteering at Al Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah.\n\n(Additional reporting by Maytaal Angel in JERUSALEM, Ahmed Mohamed Hassan in CAIRO, Doaa Rouqa in GAZA and other Reuters bureaux; Writing by Ros Russell, Alexandra

This operation resulted in closing the only operating border crossings of Rafah and Karam Abu Salem and, consequently, suspended the entry of humanitarian aid to the besieged Palestinians.\n\nOn May 6, the Hamas movement informed the Egyptian and Qatari mediators of the movement's approval of the Egyptian proposal on a ceasefire agreement in the besieged Gaza Strip.\n\nThe movement's approval came after intensified efforts made by Egypt and other international parties to contain the situation and prevent escalation when the Israeli army called on residents east of Rafah city in the Gaza Strip to evacuate the area immediately ahead of the ground offensive against the city.\n\nFirst phase of Egypt's proposal on Gaza ceasefire\n\nThe Egyptian proposal will be carried out on three phases; the first phase, spanning 42 days, involves the temporary cessation of mutual military operations between the two parties. This entails the withdrawal of Israeli forces from densely populated areas to a designated zone along the Gaza Strip border, encompassing regions such as the Gaza Valley, the Netzarim axis, and the Kuwaiti roundabout. Additionally, military aviation and reconnaissance activities in Gaza will cease for 10 hours daily, extended to 12 hours on days of detainee and prisoner releases. The phase also includes facilitating the return of displaced individuals to their areas of residence and the withdrawal from the Gaza Valley.\n\nThe first phase also stipulates that on the third day, following the release of three Israeli detainees, Israeli forces will fully withdraw from Al-Rashid Street, extending eastward to Salah Al-Din Street. They will also dismantle all military sites and installations within this area.\n\nSimultaneously, the return of displaced Palestinians to their residences will commence, with a stipulation that they do not carry weapons during their return. Also, residents will enjoy unrestricted freedom of movement throughout the strip, and humanitarian aid will enter Al-Rashid Street unhindered from the first day.\n\nOn the 22nd day following the release of half of the detainees, including female soldiers, Israeli forces will withdraw from the central region of the strip, notably the Netzarim Martyrs axis and the Kuwaiti roundabout east of Salah al-Din Road. They will relocate to a nearby area along the border, dismantling all military sites and installations. Concurrently, displaced individuals will continue returning to their residences in the northern Gaza Strip, while freedom of movement for the population will be ensured across all areas of the Gaza Strip.\n\nFrom the onset, a robust influx of humanitarian aid, relief materials, and fuel will be initiated. This will consist of 600 trucks per day, 500 of which will contain fuel supply, including 300 for the northern parts of the strip. Fuel provision will encompass requirements for electricity generation, commercial operations, as well as equipment necessary for rubble removal, hospital and health center rehabilitation, and bakery operations across all areas of the Gaza Strip. This continuous support will persist throughout all phases of the agreement.\n\nThe stage includes the exchange of detainees and prisoners between the two sides. Hamas will release 33 Israeli detainees - alive or dead - civilian women, female soldiers, children under the age of 19, the elderly over the age of 50, and the sick and wounded civilians, in exchange for numbers of Palestinian prisoners. So, Hamas will release all living Israeli detainees, including civilian women and children under the age of 19, other than soldiers, and Israel will release 30 children and women for every released Israeli detainee, from the lists that include the oldest arrests provided by Hamas.\n\nThe first phase additionally stipulates that Hamas would release all elderly Israeli detainees over the age of 50 as well as the sick and wounded civilians. In return, Israel will release 30 elderly and sick Palestinian prisoners over the age of 50 for every Israeli, based on lists of the oldest arrests provided by Hamas. Hamas would also release all the living female Israeli soldiers, and Israel will release 50 prisoners (including 30 sentenced to life terms, and 20 handed down 20 years in jail) for every Israeli female soldier released.\n\nBy the seventh day of this phase, Hamas would provide information on the numbers of Israeli detainees who will be released at this stage, while on the 22nd day, the Israeli side would release all the prisoners of the 2011 Prisoner Swap of \"Shalit\" deal who were re-arrested. In case that the number of living Israeli detainees intended to be released does not reach 33, the number of bodies of the same categories will be completed for this stage. In return, Israel will release all those who were arrested from the Gaza Strip after October 7, 2023, including women and children under the age of 19 years, provided that this is done during the fifth week of this stage.\n\nThe prisoner swap process depends upon the adherence to the terms outlined in the agreement. This includes the cessation of mutual military operations, the withdrawal of Israeli forces, the successful return of displaced Palestinians to their homes, and the unhindered entry of humanitarian aid. Additionally, it necessitates the completion of requisite legal procedures to ensure that released Palestinian prisoners are not re-arrested on the same charges they were previously detained for. Also, the terms include lifting the measures and penalties off prisoners and detainees taken in Israeli prisons and detention camps after October 7, 2023, and improving their conditions, including those who were arrested after this date, not later than the 16th day of the first phase.\n\nIndirect discussions between the two parties on the details of the agreement's second phase regarding the exchange of prisoners and detainees from both parties (soldiers and remaining men) shall be completed and agreed upon before the end of the fifth week of this phase.\n\nAs for humanitarian aid, the first phase stipulates that the United Nations and its agencies, including UNRWA and other international organizations, would provide humanitarian services in all areas of the Gaza Strip throughout the stages of the agreement. This is in addition to starting the rehabilitation of the infrastructure of electricity, water, sanitation, communications, and roads in all areas of the Gaza Strip. Also, equipment necessary for civil defense and the removal of rubble shall continue throughout the stages of the agreement, and the accommodation of the displaced who lost their homes during the war must be facilitated (at least 60,000 temporary homes - caravans - and 200,000 tents).\n\nSince day one of this phase, an agreed-upon number - not less than 50 injured military personnel - will be allowed to travel through the Rafah crossing to receive medical treatment, while the number of the sick and wounded Palestinians passing through the Rafah crossing will increase. Additionally, restrictions on travelers will be lifted, and the movement of goods and trade will return without restrictions, allowing for the necessary arrangements and plans for the process of comprehensive reconstruction of homes, civilian facilities, and civilian infrastructure that were destroyed due to the war. Those affected by the war shall be compensated under the supervision of a number of countries and organizations, including Egypt, Qatar, and the United Nations.\n\nAll measures at this stage include the temporary cessation of mutual military operations, while relief and shelter, and withdrawal of forces will continue in the second phase until a sustainable calm is declared.\n\nThe second phase will span over 42 days. It includes the announcement of the return of sustainable calm - the cessation of military and hostile operations.\n\nThis ceasefire will come into effect prior to the initiation of the exchange of detainees and prisoners between the two parties. It entails the release of all remaining Israeli men -- both civilians and soldiers -- in exchange for a mutually agreed-upon number of prisoners held in Israeli prisons and detainees in Israeli detention camps.\n\nIt also involves the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe third phase, spanning over 42 days, involves the exchange of bodies and remains of the dead following their identification.\n\nSimultaneously, the reconstruction plan for the Gaza Strip, slated for a period of 3 to 5 years, will be implemented. This comprehensive plan encompasses the rebuilding of homes, civilian facilities, and infrastructure, along with compensating all affected parties.\n\nThe execution of this plan will be supervised by several countries and organizations, including Egypt, Qatar, and the United Nations.\n\nAdditionally, the stage entails the cessation of the complete siege on the Gaza Strip, with oversight from

US mediators also reportedly left.\n\nOn Monday, Hamas said it accepted a proposal that was made up of three six-week stages and would lead to a permanent ceasefire, the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip, and an end to the siege.\n\nThe proposal, which MEE has published here, also included the release of all Israeli captives held in Gaza in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners to be agreed upon at a later stage.\n\nQatar, Egypt, the United States, and the United Nations were all listed as guarantors of the agreement.\n\nSources told MEE earlier this week that CIA director Bill Burns had followed the Hamas delegation from Cairo to Qatar ahead of Monday's announcement.\n\nAnother source said that after Burns shuttled between Cairo and Doha, the agreement that emerged \"was not a counter-response\" but \"the Egyptian-Qatari paper, with the understanding that the US supported it with the personal presence of Burns\".\n\nAccording to the Associated Press news agency, an Egyptian official and a western diplomat said that the draft Hamas accepted contained only \"minor changes in wording\" from a version the US had earlier pushed for with Israeli approval, and that the changes were made in consultation with Burns, who embraced the draft before sending it to the Palestinian group.\n\nBut within hours of Hamas saying they accepted the terms of the agreement, Israel began pummelling eastern parts of Rafah, despite warnings from the US and the UN about the dire humanitarian consequences of a military assault on such a densely populated area.\n\nThe Israeli military said it was carrying out targeted air strikes on Rafah, which it considers to be Hamas's last stronghold, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would continue an offensive on the southern area with or without a hostage deal.\n\nNetanyahu, under pressure from far-right members of his ruling coalition, has repeatedly rejected Hamas's demands.\n\nOn Monday, his far-right coalition ally, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, said on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, that Israel should reject Hamas's latest move.\n\n\"Hamas's tricks and games have only one answer: an immediate order to occupy Rafah, increasing military pressure, and continuing the complete pounding of Hamas, until its full defeat,\" he added.\n\nSince then, Israel has carpet-bombed parts of Rafah, with the Palestinian death toll in the embattled enclave rising on Thursday to nearly 35,000.\n\nOn Wednesday, US President Joe Biden said he would suspend offensive weapons transfers to Israel if it launched a full-scale invasion of Rafah.\n\n\"I made it clear that if they go into Rafah... I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities - that deal with that problem,\" Biden said in an interview with CNN's Erin Burnett.\n\nHe also expressed frustration with the planned assault on Rafah, noting that it had caused deep issues with Egypt.\n\n\"It's causing problems with, right now, in terms of - with Egypt, which I've worked very hard to make sure we have a relationship and help,\" Biden said.\n\n\"I've made it clear to Bibi and the war cabinet: they're not going to get our support, if in fact, they go on these population centres,\" he added.\n\nIn response to Biden's remarks on Thursday, Ben Gvir tweeted that \"Hamas \u2665 Biden\".", "source": {"uri": "middleeasteye.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Middle East

However, an examination of the version of the agreement accepted by Hamas reveals that the movement made fundamental changes to the agreement's goals and to its content, modifying the conditions of the deal in favor of Hamas and against Israel.\n\nThe Lebanese Al-Akhbar daily, which is affiliated with Hizbullah which has been fighting alongside Hamas against Israel, published on May 1 the full text of the Egyptian ceasefire proposal, and on May 6 it published the text of the agreement that Hamas claimed to have accepted. A comparison of the two texts exposes the fundamental changes made by Hamas.\n\nIn Hamas's version of the text, Israel must in the first phase release all the Palestinian prisoners that Hamas views as key figures, while Hamas will hand over only 33 Israeli hostages - which it terms \"detainees\" - regardless of whether they are dead or alive. This is meant to limit Israel's negotiating power in future phases of the deal and allows Hamas to hold on to its own trump cards.\n\nIn Hamas' version of the text, the movement is not required to provide full and clear details about the identity or status of any of the Israeli hostages, and can release fewer living hostages than specified in the original proposal while receiving in exchange a greater number of Palestinian prisoners (including prisoners who are serving prolonged sentences). It can also determine the identity of the Palestinian prisoners to be released, while Israel is not entitled to veto them.\n\nIn addition, the Hamas text dictates an end to the war, as Hamas has demanded since the beginning of the negotiations. It also designates Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the reconstruction of the Strip as goals of the agreement, alongside the goals outlined in the Egyptian proposal, namely the release of Israeli civilians and soldiers captured \"at any period of time\" and the attainment of \"sustainable calm.\" Furthermore, the Hamas text demands full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip before the second phase of the prisoner exchange, which will include Israeli men - both civilians and soldiers - who are still alive.\n\nFurthermore, the text of the agreement to which Hamas agreed omitted all limitations and qualifications that were in the Egyptian proposal aimed at preventing Hamas from resurging militarily. Hamas deleted that agreement's ban on rebuilding its military infrastructure along with the ban on bringing military equipment into the Gaza Strip. Likewise, in its text, Hamas seeks unlimited freedom of movement and a return to homes that is not limited to civilians only as was stated in the Egyptian text.\n\nMoreover, the Hamas text omitted all the restrictions and reservations included in the Egyptian proposal that were meant to prevent Hamas from rebuilding its military capabilities. It removed language specifying that only \"unarmed civilians\" would be allowed to return to their homes in Gaza, as well as language restricting freedom of movement for armed operatives and banning Hamas from rebuilding its military infrastructure or bringing military equipment into the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn its version of the text, Hamas aims to increase the involvement of the UN, and particularly of UNRWA, in the implementation of the agreement. It lists the UN as a guarantor of the agreement alongside Egypt, Qatar, and the U.S., and specifically names UNRWA - which is in fact the only agency explicitly mentioned in the text - as one of the organizations that will distribute aid \"in all areas of the Gaza Strip [...] throughout all stages of the agreement.\" This condition comes on the backdrop of efforts to minimize UNRWA operations due to the accusations that UNRWA employees have been involved in terrorist activities.\n\nFurthermore, Hamas added a demand for compensation for all individuals harmed by the war, which did not exist in the Egyptian proposal.\n\nThis report reviews the fundamental differences between the Egyptian ceasefire proposal and the modified text that Hamas announced it has accepted.\n\nHamas Will Release \"Living [Hostages] Or Dead Bodies\" In Exchange For A Greater Number Of Palestinian Prisoners\n\nAs mentioned, contrary to the Egyptian ceasefire proposal, which requires Hamas to release 33 living Israeli hostages in the first phase of the agreement, the Hamas version of the text states that the movement will release 33 hostages, \"living [ones] or dead bodies.\"\n\nThe Egyptian text required Hamas to release \"at least 33 male or female detainees, including all the Israeli detainees who are alive from among the women (civilians and soldiers), the children (under the age of 19), the elderly (over the age of 50), the ill and the wounded.\" By contrast, the fourth clause of the deal proposed by Hamas omits the words \"all\" and \"at least,\" and adds in parentheses the words \"living [hostages] or dead bodies\" when referring to the 33 Israeli \"detainees.\" The Hamas text also specifically defines as \"children\" only individuals under 19 \"who are not soldiers,\" and promised to release only \"ill and wounded civilians.\"\n\nThe number of Palestinian prisoners Israel is required to release in exchange for its hostages is also larger in the Hamas text, compared to the Egyptian proposal. The Egyptian deal stated that in exchange for every child or civilian woman released by Hamas, Israel would release \"20 children and women,\" but the fourth clause of the Hamas version instead states that Israel must release 30 such prisoners. Both Egypt's and Hamas's versions state that the prisoners will be released based on lists provided by Hamas and based on the amount of time the prisoners have served.\n\nSimilarly, Hamas increased the number of Palestinians released in exchange for every \"living Israeli detainees among the elderly detainees (over the age of 50), the ill and the wounded civilians\" from 20 to 30, in accordance with a list provided by Hamas and on the basis of time served in prison. The word \"civilians\" was also added by Hamas, in order to remove from this category the ill and wounded men under 50 (all of whom Hamas defines as soldiers).\n\nIsrael Will Release More High-Profile Prisoners, Will Have No Veto Privileges, And Will Even Release Them Into The West Bank\n\nAnother way in which Hamas changed the proposal to Israel's detriment is evident in the section about releasing Israeli female soldiers. The Egyptian proposal states that in exchange for every female soldier released by Hamas, Israel will release \"20 [Palestinian prisoners serving] life terms and 20 [prisoners] who have no longer than 10 years left on their sentence, based on lists provided by Hamas, with Israel [retaining] veto privileges (for no more than 200 names).\" By contrast, the Hamas text increased the number of Palestinian prisoners released for each female Israeli soldier and removed the reference to Israel's veto privileges. The end of the fourth clause of the Hamas text states that Israel will release \"50 prisoners for every Israeli female soldier released (30 [serving] life terms and 20 [serving] varying sentences), based on lists provided by Hamas.\" That is, Hamas has increased the number of prisoners to be released, and specifically the number of high-profile prisoners serving lengthy terms. It has also completely removed the sentence granting Israel veto privileges.\n\nHamas removed yet another important sentence from the Egyptian proposal, which stated that \"every prisoner serving a life sentence whose release will be decided upon will be released either abroad or to the Gaza Strip\" - i.e., not to the West Bank. The omission of this sentence enables Hamas to demand the release of high-profile prisoners into the West Bank, thereby strengthening its terrorist infrastructure there.\n\nPrisoner Exchange Timeline Modified To Israel's Detriment\n\nAccording to the original Egyptian proposal, Hamas was to release \"three Israeli detainees on the first day of the agreement, and then three more detainees every three days, starting with all the women (civilians and female soldiers), until the 33 day.\" By contrast, the fifth clause of the Hamas version changed this sentence to read: \"Hamas will release three Israeli detainees on the agreement's third day, and subsequently three more detainees every seven days, starting with women (civilians and female soldiers) whenever possible.\" That is, the Hamas text significantly extends the prisoner exchange period, thus making it easier for the movement to evade fully implementing the deal.\n\nLater in the fifth clause of the Hamas text, another sentence appears which was not present in the Egyptian proposal. It reads: \"In the sixth week, Hamas shall release all remaining civilian detainees included in this phase,\" i.e., from the group of 33 hostages.\n\nThe text Hamas added to the clause also grants it the exclusive right to determine the identity of the prisoners released by Israel. Where the Egyptian proposal stated that Israel will release \"an appropriate and agreed-upon number of Palestinian prisoners from the Israeli prisons, in accordance with agreed-upon lists,\" the Hamas text states: \"Israel [will release] the agreed-upon number of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli prisons according to the lists that Hamas will submit.\" In other words, according to the Hamas proposal, while Israel has no say about the identity of the hostages released by Hamas, Hamas can fully dictate the identities of the prisoners released by Israel.\n\nHamas Demands Release Of Additional High-Profile Prisoners, Including Those Who Fought In Gaza, In Exchange For Israeli Hostages' Bodies, Not Only Living Hostages\n\nThe agreement's lowered obligations for Hamas and increased obligations for Israel were also reflected in an additional proposal by Hamas stressing that \"in the event\" that no living hostages remain in the categories of those to be released in the first phase, it will release the bodies of dead hostages instead.\n\nThe Egyptian proposal stated: \"By Day 7 [of the implementation of the agreement] at the latest, Hamas will provide a list of all the rest of the detainees in the abovementioned groups (beyond the [afore]mentioned 33), so that they will be released beginning on Day 34, along with an extension of the cessation of military activity for a number of days in accordance with the number of remaining detainees (an additional day for each additional detainee released).\" In exchange, \"the Israeli side will release an appropriate and agreed-upon number of Palestinian prisoners from the Israeli prisons, in accordance with agreed-upon lists.\"\n\nHowever, the Hamas proposal says something completely different, in Section 5: \"By Day 7 [of the implementation of the agreement) (to the extent possible), Hamas will provide information on the number of Israeli detainees to be released in this [first] phase. On Day 22, the Israeli side will release all prisoners from the Shalit exchange deal who were rearrested. In the event that the number of living Israeli detainees slated for release is less than 33, this number will be made up with dead bodies of hostages from those categories for this phase. In exchange, Israel will release all women and children (under age 19) arrested in the Gaza Strip since October 7, 2023, and this will take place in Week 5 of this phase.\"\n\nIn other words, Hamas is demanding the right to keep mum about which of the hostages are still alive, and is not obligated to release 33 live hostages in the first phase. In exchange for this, it is demanding the release of additional high-profile prisoners along with the release of all prisoners freed in the Shalit deal who have since been rearrested - a demand that never appeared in the Egyptian proposal - as well as terrorists arrested during the current war in Gaza.\n\nIn addition, it should be noted that Hamas has made fundamental changes also to the clause covering the exchange of bodies and human remains in the third phase of the deal. While the Egyptian proposal mentioned an exchange of \"all the bodies and remains of the deceased held by both sides,\" the Hamas text omits the word \"all\", enabling Hamas to hold on to the bodies and remains of Israelis.\n\nGuarantees Of No Rearrests Of Released Terrorists And Demands For Improved Conditions For Prisoners In Israeli Prisons\n\nThe text of the new agreement presented by Hamas includes legal demands for Israel in all things related to the prisoners to be released, as well as for the prisoners that will remain in Israeli incarceration. Under the Egyptian proposal, Israel was meant to commit only to \"not rearrest the released Palestinian prisoners on the same charges on which they were previously arrested.\" In contrast, Section 6 of the text to which Hamas agreed states: \"All the demanded legal steps guaranteeing that the released Palestinian prisoners will not be rearrested on the same charges on which they were previously arrested must be completed.\" Likewise, an added sentence (Section 8) states: \"All measures and all sanctions leveled against the prisoners and detainees in Israeli prisons and detention facilities since October 7, 2023 will be cancelled, and their conditions will be improved, including for those arrested after this date.\"\n\nHamas' Demands On The Military Level: Accelerating Israel's Withdrawal From The Gaza Strip While Reducing The Number Of Israeli Hostages Released In Return; Granting Militants Freedom Of Movement; No Ban On Rebuilding Military Infrastructure\n\nAlso prominent in the changes introduced by Hamas are its efforts to accelerate Israel's withdrawal from Gaza while at the same time reducing the number of hostages Hamas will release in return. For example, according to the Egyptian proposal, the first phase of the agreement will involve a temporary cessation of military action by both sides, and a withdrawal of the Israeli forces eastward, away from the densely populated areas \"to an area near the Israeli border\" in all parts of the Strip \"except for the Gaza Valley.\" However, Hamas amended this passage to state that the Israeli forces will withdraw \"to an area along the Israeli border in all parts of the Strip including the Gaza Valley,\" and clarified that this means the Netzarim axis and Kuwait roundabout.\n\nFurthermore, this paragraph in the original proposal submitted to Hamas states that the Israeli withdrawal from Al-Rashid Street (in the West of the Strip, on the coast) eastward to Salah Al-Din Street (the road bisecting the Strip from north to south) will occur on the seventh day of the agreement, after the release of all the women, whereas Hamas' altered version of this passage states that this withdrawal will occur already on the third day, after the release of only three hostages. Unlike the Egyptian proposal, it also stipulates that the Israeli withdrawal to Salah Al-Din Street must be \"complete\" and must include \"the complete dismantlement of [Israel's] military positions throughout this area.\"\n\nThe Egyptian proposal states that the next step of the Israeli forces' withdrawal, from the center of the Gaza Strip (especially from the Netzarim axis and the Kuwait roundabout), east of Salah Al-Din Road, to an area near the border will occur on the 22 day, after the release of two thirds of the 33 hostages to be released in the first phase of the deal, whereas Hamas' version states that this withdrawal will take place after the release of only half of the living hostages slated for release during the first phase. Here too Hamas added a demand that that Israel's withdrawal include the complete dismantlement of its military positions throughout the area from which it withdraws, and in the passage that speaks of \"the continued return of the displaced civilians to their places of residence in the north of the Gaza Strip,\" it again deleted the word \"civilians.\"\n\nHamas' proposal seeks to make it difficult for Israel to gather intelligence on the regrouping of Hamas' military wing during the temporary cessation of military operations. The Egyptian proposal called for the suspension of Israeli reconnaissance flights over Gaza Strip for eight hours a day, and for 10 hours on the days of prisoner exchange. In Hamas' proposal, these time-periods have been extended to 10 hours and 12 hours, respectively.\n\nHamas' version also seeks to guarantee the presence of the movement's militants among the displaced persons allowed to return to their homes. In the Egyptian proposal, the section on the first phase of the agreement states that the residents permitted to return will be \"unarmed civilians.\" Hamas deleted this phrase, and instead added in parentheses that the displaced will begin to return \"without carrying weapons during their return\" - which implies that militants will later be able to rearm. Moreover, while the original proposal spoke of \"freedom of movement for civilian residents in all areas of the Strip,\" Hamas' version omits the word \"civilian,\" thus demanding freedom of movement for its military operatives as well.\n\nFurthermore, according to Hamas' proposal, the second phase of the deal is conditional upon a full withdrawal of the Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip. It states that this phase will begin with \"announcing the return of sustainable calm (cessation of military and hostile action)\" before commencing the second round of prisoner exchange. It also speaks of releasing \"all the male Israeli [hostages] still living (civilians and soldiers) in exchange for an agreed-upon number of [Palestinian] prisoners and detainees... and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip.\" The word \"complete\" was not part of the original proposal and was added by Hamas.\n\nIn should be stressed that in the section dealing with the agreement's third phase, Hamas deleted from the Egyptian version a passage aimed at preventing it from rebuilding its military infrastructures and facilities and regaining its military strength. The deleted sentence stated that \"the Palestinian side will refrain from rebuilding the military infrastructures and facilities and from importing any military gear, raw material or other components used for military purposes.\"\n\nHamas introduced changes that would allow its military operatives to exit the strip through the Rafah crossing to receive medical treatment from the first day of the first phase of the deal, whereas the original proposal allows this only \"from the 14 day\" of the deal.\" Hamas's version also stipulates that the number of militants allowed to leave for medical treatment will be \"no less than 50,\" and adds that \"restrictions on movement [through the Rafah crossing] will be lifted and the movement of goods and commerce will [also] resume without restrictions.\"\n\nHamas Makes The Reconstruction Of The Gaza Strip One Of The Objectives of The Agreement, Demands That Arrangements For This Will Commence In The First Phase, Before The Release Of All The Hostages, And Also Demands Compensation For All Those Affected By The War\n\nThe changes introduced by Hamas also concern the involvement of international organizations in the implementation of the agreement, in the provision of humanitarian aid and in the rebuilding of the Strip. Hamas added a reference to the UN as one of the guarantors of the agreement, alongside Egypt, Qatar and the U.S., as well as an explicit reference to UNRWA as one of the elements that will be responsible for aid. This is as a countermeasure to the attempts to minimize UNRWA's role, due to the accusations that its members aided Hamas and even participated in the October 7 terror attack. The tenth clause of the section dealing with the first phase of the deal states that \" The U.N. and its agencies, including UNRWA, and other international organizations will work to provide humanitarian aid throughout the Gaza Strip and will continue to do so in all phases of the agreement.\"\n\nWhile the Egyptian proposal stated that, in the agreement's first phase, the entry of humanitarian aid, relief materials and fuel will be facilitated - \"500 trucks, including 50 fuel trucks, 250 of which will be for the north [of the Strip],\" the third clause of Hamas' proposal states that \"from the first day... 600 trucks per day, of which 50 are fuel trucks, including 300 for the north\" will enter the Strip.\n\nIn the beginning of the document, Hamas inserted a passage designating the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip as one of the goals of the agreement. While the original proposal stated that the aim of the framework agreement, in addition to the exchange of prisoners, is to attain \"sustainable calm, including the implementation of what is needed to achieve a ceasefire,\" Hamas' version states that the aim is to attain \"a return to sustainable calm, so that a permanent ceasefire will be achieved, as well as the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and reconstruction.\"\n\nAs for the timeline for the reconstruction, Hamas' version stipulates that plans and preparations for it will begin already in the first phrase of the agreement, rather than in the second phase, as per the Egyptian proposal. In Hamas' version, the 14 clause of the section on the first phase speaks of \"initiating the necessary arrangements and plans for the comprehensive reconstruction of homes, civilian facilities and civilian infrastructure destroyed in the war.\" In this section Hamas also added a demand to \"compensate those affected, under the supervision of several countries and organizations, including Egypt, Qatar, and the U.N.,\" but not the U.S., although the latter is designated as one of the guarantors of the agreement.\n\nIn the section on the third phase of the agreement, Hamas' version states that the reconstruction plan will be completed within 3-5 years, while the Egyptian version spoke of five years. In this section Hamas' version again mentions the rebuilding of homes, civilian facilities, and infrastructure, whereas the Egyptian proposal spoke of \"civilian infrastructure.\" Here too Hamas added a sentence demanding \"the compensation of all those affected, under the supervision of several countries and organizations, including Egypt, Qatar, and the United Nations,\" without mentioning the U.S.", "source": {"uri": "memri.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "MEMRI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng":

group Hamas announced its acceptance of a ceasefire proposal presented by Egypt and Qatar following talks over the weekend in Cairo and Monday in Doha, where CIA director Bill Burns was present, according to informed sources.\n\nAxios cited three Israeli officials as saying that the Israeli government was surprised by Hamas' announcement and received the text of the movement's response from mediators an hour after its public statement.\n\nThey claimed that Hamas' response contained \"many new elements\" that were not part of the previous proposal that the Israeli leadership agreed on and that was presented to the Palestinian group by mediators the US, Egypt, and Qatar 10 days ago.\n\n\"It looked like a whole new proposal,\" one official was quoted as saying.\n\nEgypt presented Hamas with a new proposal without coordinating with \"Israel\", two Israeli officials indicated.\n\nIsraeli officials said that CIA Director Bill Burns and Biden administration officials knew about the new proposal but didn't inform \"Israel\" about it, adding that the proposal's final touches were made in Doha with the Biden administration's knowledge.\n\nAccording to two Israeli officials, the Israeli side believes it \"got played\" by the United States, Egypt, and Qatar who weren't transparent about a new deal.\n\nAnother two Israeli officials pointed out that \"Israel\" suspects that the United States, through Egypt and Qatar, gave assurances to Hamas that a prisoner exchange deal would bring an end to the war on Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli occupation government has previously made it clear that ensuring a prisoner swap deal with the Palestinian group would not mean an end to the war, insisting on its plan to \"eliminate Hamas\".\n\nA senior Israeli official mentioned that \"Israel\" believes the US \"conveyed the message to Hamas that it will be okay when it comes to ending the war.\"\n\nHowever, the US official clarified that, during the negotiations, the Biden administration aimed to \"ensure that an initial six-week ceasefire would be built into something more enduring,\" denying the US presented guarantees to Hamas.\n\nElsewhere, Axios cited Israeli officials as saying that the Biden administration conveyed to Israeli officials on Monday that Hamas' response is open to negotiation, but the Israeli leadership remains skeptical about the matter.", "source": {"uri":

We woke up on Monday morning to the news that Israel was warning Palestinians residing in the eastern sector of Rafah, the last remaining Hamas stronghold in the Gaza Strip, to evacuate ahead of an imminent invasion. Several hours later, it was widely reported that Hamas leaders had agreed to a hostage swap/ceasefire proposal hammered out by negotiators in Egypt and Qatar over the weekend. Yet, by midafternoon, IDF troops had commenced their invasion. By Tuesday morning, they had taken control of the Rafah crossing into Egypt.\n\nSo what the heck happened? It turns out that, unbeknownst to the Israelis, rather than agreeing to the conditions they had previously signed off on, Hamas had instead submitted a counterproposal. Worse still, sources told Axios that U.S. officials, including CIA Director William Burns, who was involved in the negotiations, were aware of the changes but failed to inform the Israelis. The outlet reported that Israeli officials received a copy of the new terms an hour after Hamas had made their formal -- and disingenuous -- announcement to the media. The sources said \"the feeling is that 'Israel got played' by the U.S. and the mediators who drafted the new deal.\"\n\nAsked for comment on the situation, a senior U.S. official denied the allegations, telling Axios, \"American diplomats have been engaged with Israeli counterparts. There have been no surprises.\" The official did concede, however, that \"the Biden administration sees Hamas's response as a counterproposal and not as a new proposal.\"\n\nAn Israeli source told the Times of Israel that one area of disagreement lies in \"Hamas's insistence that any ceasefire must lead to an end to the war.\" Additionally, the terrorist group demanded a complete IDF withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Obviously, Israeli leaders, who do not want to see a repeat of the Oct. 7 massacre, refuse to end hostilities until Hamas has been decisively defeated and expelled from Gaza.\n\nBut the most egregious modification to the deal was revealed on Tuesday. The Times of Israel reported that \"Israel had initially demanded that 40 living hostages of the 132 still in Gaza be released in the first phase of the three-phase plan -- all of them in the so-called 'humanitarian' category: women, children, elderly and sick people.\" When Hamas informed negotiators they did not have enough living hostages to comply, the Israelis lowered their requirement to 33.\n\nRather than admit they were unable to produce even 33 living hostages within the humanitarian category, Hamas amended the proposal to read, \"During the first phase, Hamas releases 33 Israeli detainees (alive or corpses).\" Needless to say, the change was unacceptable to the Israelis.\n\nAccording to details from Hamas's announcement on Monday and the Times of Israel's conversation with an individual briefed on the negotiations, Hamas in its counterproposal had reportedly agreed to the following terms:\n\nPresident Joe Biden spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday morning prior to Hamas's announcement about the deal to the media. A White House readout of the call said only that the president had updated Netanyahu on the progress of the negotiations, which were still ongoing at the time, and \"reiterated his clear position\" that Israel stay out of Rafah.\n\nBut unless and until Israel can eliminate Hamas's four remaining battalions and the group's leaders who are believed to be hiding in Rafah, they cannot defeat Hamas. Biden's vehement opposition to the one action Israel must take to win the war has created a serious rift with Israeli leaders and has prolonged the war.\n\nIt is no doubt Biden's determination to appease Muslim American voters in the crucial states of Michigan and Minnesota that has clouded his judgment and led directly to his betrayal of our closest ally in the Middle East -- a fact that few Democrats are willing to acknowledge.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM RESTORING AMERICA\n\nSince Biden's initial display of support for Netanyahu in the immediate aftermath of the deadly Oct. 7 attacks, his actions, including his administration's alleged slow-walking of arms sales to Israel, leave many of us wondering just whose side he's really on.\n\nWhile it might be unfair to say that Biden wants Hamas to win the war, I have to ask: Is he actually hoping for a stalemate, at least until Election Day? It sure looks like it.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elizabeth_stauffer@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Elizabeth Stauffer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Times of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William J.

To receive these Editor's Notes as they're released, join the ToI Community here.\n\nOn Tuesday night, more than a day after Hamas claimed to have approved what it said was the Egyptian and Qatari mediators' proposal \"regarding a ceasefire agreement,\" the US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller finally declared publicly, \"That is not what they did.\"\n\nRather, said Miller, \"They responded with amendments or a counterproposal.\" The US, he said, was \"working through the details of that now.\"\n\nIn fact, close examination of the Hamas document, as issued (Arabic) by the terror group itself, shows that far from containing \"amendments\" or a remotely viable counterproposal, it is constructed with incendiary sophistication to ensure that Hamas survives the war and regains control over the entire Gaza Strip. (Quotations from the Hamas text in this piece are from a translation by the Qatari-owned Al Jazeera website.)\n\nBut that's far from all, however.\n\nIt is also calculated to ensure that Hamas secures further key, immensely far-reaching goals without having to meet the prime Israeli requirement for a deal: the release of all the hostages. In fact, Hamas can abrogate the deal, with all of its key goals achieved and then some, while continuing to hold almost all of the hostages.\n\nAmong those goals is one of the most central Hamas objectives since it invaded Israel on October 7 -- seeing its declared war of destruction against the Jewish state expand to the West Bank.\n\nA stream of ominous changes\n\nMuch has been made of the fact that, whereas Israel has repeatedly insisted it will not end the war as a condition for the release of the hostages, Hamas, in the opening paragraphs of its own sinister alternate proposal, specifies that one \"aim\" of the deal is \"a return to a sustainable calm that leads to a permanent ceasefire.\" But relatively speaking, that's splitting hairs: The proposal conveyed by the mediators to Hamas late last month, and described by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken as an \"extraordinarily generous\" Israeli offer, reportedly provides for an \"arrangement to restore sustainable calm\" -- which sounds like a near-euphemism for a permanent ceasefire.\n\nMuch has correctly been made of the fact, however, that, in the Hamas document, Israel is to cease military operations in the first six-week stage of the three-stage deal, in which 33 hostages are to be freed, and that the IDF must \"withdraw completely\" from Gaza and a \"permanent cessation of military operations\" must take effect before any more hostages are freed in the second stage.\n\nLess widely appreciated is that the Hamas proposal states that, in the first stage, \"internally displaced people in Gaza shall return to their areas of residence\" and that \"all residents of Gaza shall be allowed freedom of movement in all parts of the Strip,\" with all Israeli \"aviation (military and reconnaissance)\" in Gaza to cease for much of each day.\n\nCombined with a partial withdrawal of IDF troops as further specified for this first stage, the effect of these demands would be to enable Hamas's gunmen and officials to retake control of the entire Gaza Strip. The Hamas proposal does use the word \"unarmed\" in one clause to describe the displaced persons who would be allowed to return to their areas of residence, but the accompanying demands and provisions mean that Israel would have no right and no means under the proposal to impose any such limitation.\n\nEven more significant, and largely unrecognized, is the radical reconfiguration in the Hamas document of the terms and process for the release of Israeli hostages. Many of the relatives of the 128 Israelis still held in Gaza since October 7, alive and dead, have pleaded, desperately and understandably, for a deal at any or almost any price, including an end to the war, in return for the release of all, most, or even many of the hostages.\n\nThe Hamas proposal, however, is structured to enable it to release very few of the hostages in return not only for an end to the IDF's campaign in Gaza and its survival and return to full power there, but also for a planned surge in support for Hamas in the West Bank, the further neutering of the Palestinian Authority, and the potential major escalation of violence against Israel in and from the West Bank.\n\nThe Hamas proposal remakes the previous document under which Hamas was to release at least 33 living hostages in the first stage of the deal, at a rate of three hostages every three days from the first day that the deal takes effect.\n\nIn the Hamas proposal, as has been widely noted, it no longer commits to freeing 33 living hostages in the first stage -- itself a concession by Israel, which had sought 40 living hostages in the first stage -- but now says the 33 hostages may be \"alive or dead.\"\n\nMoreover, Hamas would release the first three hostages on only the third day of the deal taking effect, and thence \"three other detainees every seven days.\" This means that whereas, in the Israel-backed proposal, all 33 hostages would go free in the course of the first month of the deal, the Hamas schedule means fewer than half of the 33 would be released in the first month.\n\nFurthermore, the Hamas proposal specifies that the first hostages to be released will be \"women as much as possible (civilians and female soldiers).\" It raises the number of Palestinian security prisoners to be released in exchange for each of the (believed five) living female Israeli soldiers held hostage from 40 to 50 -- including 30 who are serving life terms, where the Israeli offer specified 20 life-termers. And it removes a key clause in the Israel-backed proposal, under which Hamas would be allowed to choose only 20 of the security prisoners to go free in stage one, and Israel would have the right to veto those choices. Rather, it states, the Palestinian security prisoners will be released \"based on lists provided by Hamas.\"\n\nThe accumulated consequence of all those changes is that, in the very first days of the deal, Hamas would be able to secure the release of hundreds of the most dangerous and iconic terror chiefs and murderers, including at least 150 serving life terms, in return for the release of very few of the hostages.\n\nThe Hamas proposal also features a clause requiring the release, on the 22nd day of the deal, of \"all prisoners from the Shalit deal who have been rearrested.\"\n\nFor Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas chief in Gaza who was himself among the 1,027 Palestinian security prisoners freed by Israel to secure the release of kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011, this would plainly constitute the closing of a certain circle -- the freeing of the many of his colleagues who returned to terrorism after their spectacularly contentious release 13 years ago but who, unlike him, were recaptured.\n\nFinally, in this regard, a widely reported Israeli demand for the right to veto the return of some West Bank-based Palestinian security prisoners to the West Bank, but rather to have them instead sent to Gaza or into exile, is absent from the Hamas proposal.\n\nThe nightly release during November's weeklong hostage deal of dozens of Palestinian security prisoners prompted scenes of jubilation in the West Bank. As The Times of Israel reported at the time, \"Night after night, dozens of green Hamas banners were waved in front of cameras, and freed prisoners wore them as headbands - even in the streets of Ramallah, the bastion of the Fatah-controlled Palestinian Authority.\"\n\nAnd the security prisoners who were being freed then were women and minors.\n\nBy contrast, under the Hamas terms now, dozens upon dozens of prisoners serving lengthy terms and life terms, murderers and mass murderers and terror chiefs -- including Marwan Barghouti, the most popular of all Palestinian security prisoners, who is serving five life terms for orchestrating deadly terror attacks during the Second Intifada, and Ahmad Saadat, serving a 30-year term for organizing the assassination of tourism minister Rehavam Ze'evi in 2001 -- would be coming out of jail. And they would be returning to the West Bank.\n\nTheir release, as calculated by Sinwar, would be expected to be perceived by West Bank Palestinians as an astounding humiliation for Israel, an indictment of the Palestinian Authority, which had failed to set them free, and a stunning victory for Hamas.\n\nAmid what would be regarded as a vindication of Hamas's implacable determination to destroy Israel, and as proof of the success of its tactics and its strategy toward that goal, Sinwar would reliably expect the euphoria accompanying the return of the prisoners to cement Hamas as the peerless champion of the Palestinian cause, fueling soaring support for Hamas in the West Bank and the unification of West Bank Palestinians behind it, the marginalizing of the already failing PA, and the dawn of a new era of escalated violence and terrorism against Israel.\n\nAbrogating the deal\n\nAt this early stage of the ostensible three-stage, 18-week deal, Hamas would have very little incentive to proceed with the process. It would have precious little left to extract from Israel.\n\nAnd Israel, crucially, would have very little if any remaining leverage over Hamas.\n\nIt would be Hamas's delighted pleasure to calculate how far to proceed with the deal before abrogating it -- with the stated \"interconnected\" stages of its proposal providing it with numerous opportunities to do so. Hamas would be able to calculate the right moment to halt the hostage releases, and to do so in a way designed to fool as many people as possible into thinking that it was the Israelis who were the rejectionist guilty party -- as it did successfully on Monday night when falsely claiming to have accepted a ceasefire agreement.\n\nAnd Hamas would do so knowing that the US wants the war to stop and stay stopped. The Biden administration has been publicly fuming for months at the high civilian death toll in Gaza, and is desperate to secure and maintain a ceasefire amid an election campaign and with huge tensions on and beyond university campuses. Already withholding weaponry from Israel in order to prevent the IDF from tackling Hamas in its last remaining stronghold in Rafah, deeply mistrustful of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his core far-right coalition, the administration will be immensely reluctant to provide diplomatic support and weaponry for a resumed Israeli military campaign.\n\nIn summary\n\nUnder the terms that it has set out, therefore, Hamas expects to survive, rearm and reassert full control in Gaza, and establish primacy in the West Bank. Israel will be under attack on multiple fronts. The ambitious, improbable American vision of an Israel integrated into the region, at peace with Saudi Arabia, with a reformed PA ruling in the West Bank Gaza, will be shattered. Most of the hostages will still be held in Gaza, with no prospect of release. And Israel will be more torn and vulnerable than ever.\n\nOn Monday night, soon after the office of Hamas's overall chief Ismail Haniyeh issued its ostensible acceptance of a ceasefire, Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said he had spoken with Haniyeh, who had assured him that \"the ball is in the opposite court. We are honest in our intentions.\"\n\nIndeed, the Hamas proposal leaves no doubt about Hamas's intentions.

mostly stepped away from the negotiating table following the IDF's advancements in Rafah, southern Gaza's most populous city, sources familiar with the talks told Politico.\n\nHamas is allegedly still willing to continue the talks, with US mediators in Qatar working to keep the negotiations going with the Jewish State.\n\nThe terror group's stance comes as Israel's own negotiation team departed from Cairo without setting a date for their return, The Times of Israel reports.\n\nWhile the US and world leaders have stressed the importance of keeping the negotiation channels open between Hamas and Israel, the hope for a cease-fire deal has taken a hit following Israel's incursion into Rafah, which houses more than a million refugees.\n\nThe Jewish State announced the start of its operation in Rafah after Hamas rejected its latest cease-fire deal and proposed its own on Monday, which Israeli leaders slammed as \"deception\" for including non-starters like calling for a permanent end to the war.\n\nThe Hamas deal also sought to include dead bodies in the proposed hostage exchange that asked for the release of 33 hostages.\n\nNews of the deal had led to pre-emptive celebrations in the streets of Gaza as civilians believed the fighting would stop.\n\nThe Hamas proposal came after the Israeli military sent out evacuation warnings to thousands of Palestinians in Rafah.\n\nIsraeli tanks seized control of the Rafah Crossing on Tuesday, with armored vehicles and troops engaging in skirmishes with Hamas gunmen in the city outskirts as thousands of Palestinians attempted to flee the city.\n\nDespite facing opposition from the US over the fear that more civilians would be caught up in the fighting, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has maintained that military pressure is the best way to free the more than 130 hostages in Gaza.\n\nNetanyahu is allegedly ready to reject any hostage deal that would stop the operation in Rafah from proceeding, former and current US officials told NBC News.\n\nThe prime minister has reiterated that the IDF will not withdraw from Gaza until all of Hamas is eradicated, with the Israeli military believing that four terror battalions

Israeli military launched an operation in Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah crowded with more than 1 million internally displaced Palestinians and took control of the Palestinian side of the key Rafah crossing.\n\nAlso on Thursday, an Israeli source told Xinhua that the Israeli army will continue its operation in Rafah \"as planned\" since the truce talks have collapsed.\n\nCairo, Doha and

The area, lying around two kilometers from the boundary fence that separates Gaza from Israel, had been under the control of the Israeli military since it was invaded five months earlier. Hamas claimed that nine soldiers were killed in the attack; Israel admitted to four dead and several injured.\n\nHamas later released an eight-minute video documenting its fighters planning the attack, setting up the ambush, and carrying out the elaborate, multistage operation. A day after the attack, the Israeli army withdrew from Khan Younis, having destroyed much of the city but not, it seems, Hamas's ability to fight there.\n\nOn May 6, Hamas announced that it had accepted a cease-fire proposal drafted by Egyptian and Qatari mediators with the involvement of President Joe Biden's personal envoy to the cease-fire talks, CIA Director William Burns. That night, Israel responded by beginning its long-threatened invasion of Rafah. As of today, at least 100,000 people have already fled the city. (The United States has indicated that it does not consider an invasion to have officially begun, and Biden told CNN on Wednesday that he is prepared to pause weapons transfers to Israel if the situation escalates.)\n\nThe Zanna operation, Hamas's approval of the cease-fire proposal, and Israel's attack on Rafah together explain the dynamics prolonging this war -- one that, no matter what Israel says, it has comprehensively failed to win.\n\nThere is a myth, propagated by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies, that a \"total victory\" against Hamas is only one invasion of Rafah away. In this story, the bombardment of the Gaza Strip and the destruction of its civilian life is conflated with the destruction of Hamas itself. There are doubtless many people who do not see a contradiction there. For them, Rafah, whose pre-war population of 250,000 has quintupled with refugees from other parts of Gaza, needs to suffer the same fate as Gaza's other cities.\n\nBut the Zanna operation, among others, tells a different story: Despite Israel's causing so much devastation that the UN estimates it may take decades to rebuild Gaza, Hamas and its allied groups have continued to function across the ruined Strip.\n\nFollowing its withdrawal from Khan Younis, the Israeli army carried out an incursion into the Nuseirat refugee camp and neighboring Mughraqa. But resistance on the ground was stiff. After several Israeli soldiers were killed in an ambush in Mughraqa that reportedly utilized an unexploded US-made Israeli missile, the Israelis withdrew. Meanwhile, the east-west corridor that the Israeli army has set up to bisect the entire Gaza Strip has been under frequent mortar, rocket, and sniper attacks. And on Sunday, rocket fire from southern Gaza killed four Israeli soldiers at a staging area in the Kerem Shalom military base. Palestinians are not just continuing to fight in Gaza; there is clear coordination, command, and control -- and, with many of the attacks filmed, a coherent media strategy.\n\nIn retrospect, it seems obvious that, despite Israel's bluster, Hamas has been confident for months in its ability to survive. One key piece of evidence for this is its handling of the cease-fire negotiations.\n\nThe group has insisted on several conditions for a potential cease-fire: that Gaza's displaced population be allowed to return unfettered to the north, that Israeli forces withdraw from Gaza, that any cease-fire lead to a formal end to the war, and that the Israelis in Hamas custody be released only in exchange for Palestinians in Israeli prisons. Back in February, for instance, Netanyahu called the group's cease-fire conditions \"delusional.\" In the following weeks, the Israeli army raided Shifa and Nasser hospitals. The army's chief of staff, Herzi Halevi, told soldiers the raids were meant to put pressure on Hamas during negotiations. By the time Israel pulled out, Gaza's two largest hospitals had been reduced to burned-out husks, their courtyards the site of mass graves. But the pressure did not appear to work -- Hamas did not budge from its demands.\n\nIn fact, if anyone appears to be rattled, it's Israel. With negotiations underway in Cairo last week, and reports indicating that an agreement might be in the works, Netanyahu announced that he would order an attack on Rafah \"with or without a deal\" to free the Israelis held by Hamas. A cynic could be forgiven for thinking the Israeli leader prefers to prolong the war over securing the freedom of his citizens. Other Israeli officials kept pounding the drum for a Rafah invasion. Shimon Boker, a deputy mayor of Beersheba who is tied to Netanyahu's party, went on Israeli TV to say, \"I think we should have gone into Rafah yesterday.

I won't leave,' he says.\n\n'Everyone wants to die from our side. We love death the way you love life.'\n\n'I want you and your children to live in peace,' pleads the soldier, whose name is Ramy.\n\nHamas triumphantly announced it had informed Qatari and Egyptian mediators that it has accepted their proposal for a ceasefire. Videos spread online of Palestinians wildly celebrating the news\n\n'God forbid, you want to become a martyr. Is that it?'\n\n'We don't want the peace that comes from you,' retorts the Palestinian, Abu Younes.\n\nThe film fits in with the IDF's warning to civilians to leave eastern parts of Rafah and make their way to safety in an unoccupied sector of the strip that is not under IDF control.\n\nThis is standard Israeli procedure: broadcasting warning messages from loudhailers and dropping leaflets from planes, in a concerted effort to avoid innocent casualties.\n\nYet the prevailing narrative, both in Arab countries and in the West, is that Israel is unleashing indiscriminate death and destruction on Gaza.\n\nOf course, everyone wants to see a lasting peace between the Israelis and Palestinians. For a brief moment on Monday, there was a glimmer of hope.\n\nHamas triumphantly announced it had informed Qatari and Egyptian mediators that it has accepted their proposal for a ceasefire. Videos spread online of Palestinians wildly celebrating the news.\n\nBut an unnamed Israeli official swiftly clarified that this was a 'softened' version of an Egyptian proposal that included 'far-reaching' conclusions which Israel could not accept. This included a clause which stated Hamas would release all those who were kidnapped during their bloody onslaught on October 7 -- or 'their bodies'.\n\nThe inclusion of this sinister phrase suggests that the majority are dead -- some intelligence suggests that of the 132 people unaccounted for, barely 30 are still alive. Israel has every right to refuse to accept a ceasefire without knowing how many of its own hostages Hamas has slaughtered.\n\nYet Monday's debacle was a propaganda masterstroke for the terrorists, meticulously crafted to convince Western onlookers that Hamas wants peace while Israel is bent on wholesale slaughter.\n\nToo many people here, understandably deeply worried about the suffering of Palestinian civilians, take this propaganda at face value. Hamas is aware of the desperation of the Palestinian people squeezed into Rafah in southern Gaza.\n\nTheir subjects' premature celebrations of the 'ceasefire' was evidence of their desperate desire for peace -- but fear of Hamas' gunmen and their snitches has until now kept Gazans from openly expressing it.\n\nThese terrorists know they are losing the war, but by painting it as a sadistic anti-civilian campaign by Israel, Hamas has conned well-intentioned people into backing a ceasefire, which would only give it time to regroup and fight back stronger and harder. It's a case of 'loser takes all' in the propaganda war.\n\nThat is why a ceasefire would not be right -- and why Israel must finish the task it has set itself. It has been clear in its objectives from the start.\n\nA ceasefire would not be right -- and why Israel must finish the task it has set itself\n\nAs a government spokesman, Avi Hyman, told Radio 4's World At One on Tuesday: 'The objective of our war is to destroy Hamas and bring home the hostages, and to ensure that Gaza doesn't pose a threat to Israel again.'\n\nThe Rafah offensive is a key part of this: despite its own losses -- falsely presented as civilian deaths in many cases -- Hamas boasts organised units and key commanders in the region and underneath it in tunnels.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu's coalition war cabinet includes key political rivals: they too are united in rejecting any compromise with Hamas.\n\nThey know that if a ceasefire is agreed now, it will not be a genuine peace. There is a sharp contrast with the situation between Israel and Egypt in the late 1970s. Then it was clear that Cairo would not renew hostilities as long as Israel returned its lost Sinai territory.\n\nThere has been no real peace between Gaza and Israel for 17 years since Hamas took control. Instead, we have seen an endless carousel of rocket attacks, reprisals, ceasefires and more attacks.\n\nREAD MORE: How Israel's Eurovision contestant has faced death threats and fears of a terror attack\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost Israelis now say: enough is enough. But will this commendable single-mindedness last in the increasingly hysterical climate in the West?\n\nBoth Joe Biden and Keir Starmer have dropped their total support for Israel as Muslim voters and student activists have threatened their voter base over Gaza. Meanwhile, Joe Biden's administration is devoting more effort to urging Israel to make concessions than putting pressure on Hamas or its rich Arab backers such as Qatar.\n\nPausing the supply of American precision munitions to Israel, as Biden has done, lets the ailing U.S. president pose as a 'concerned' peace-bringer. The truth is, he is putting more Palestinian civilians at risk of becoming collateral damage to less advanced weaponry.\n\nWorse still, Admiral John Kirby, Biden's National Security spokesman, seemed on Monday to have given up on the objective of the total erasure of Hamas.\n\n'You're not going to eliminate an ideology by military operations,' he said.\n\nHe could not be more wrong. Just think of the Nazis. What put paid to their hate-filled, murderous ideas was utter defeat. Imagine if Hitler had been allowed to surface from his bunker after a ceasefire in March 1945.\n\nIt's only natural that people in Britain and the U.S. want to see peace in Gaza.\n\nThe prospect of Rafah being pounded to dust, as Gaza City already has been, is unsettling. But a comprehensive Israeli victory is the best and quickest guarantee of long-term salvation for innocent civilians.\n\nDebris at a school belonging to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Nuseirat Camp in Deir Al Balah\n\nHamas is no Palestinian nationalist movement -- it doesn't truly care about Gazan lives. It is the self-declared vanguard of a globalist radical Islamist movement. The luckless Palestinians are merely pawns to their wider ambitions of targeting the Middle East and even the West.\n\nThat means until the skulking warlords of Hamas are captured or eliminated, there can be no lasting peace for Palestine, Israel or the world. Israel must deploy its soldiers to flush them out as soon as possible.\n\nA ceasefire without their surrender would not end the horrific bloodshed. It would let Hamas decide when to start it flowing all over again.\n\nMark Almond is director of the Crisis Research Institute, Oxford.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

Their softening on some issues, such as the duration and permanency of any ceasefire, demonstrates the profound pressure the Palestinian Islamist group is feeling - representing a major opening for the West, Arab countries and Israel.\n\nIn the view of the Gaza-based Hamas leadership, the war itself is going well. When insurgent groups engage in spectacular overkill, they are typically hoping to goad the more powerful opponent into a self-defeating overreaction. Hamas knew Israel would react harshly to the Oct. 7 attacks, having experienced the IDF's tradition of disproportionate retaliation over the years. The purpose of Oct. 7, then, was to lure the Israelis into not merely a direct conflict, but a protracted military presence on the ground to serve as a lightning rod for a long-term insurgency, launching a new phase in the organization's efforts to seize full control of the Palestinian national movement from secular nationalists. And Hamas got what it wanted, when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed a \"mighty vengeance\" after the attacks.\n\nThe bloody shirt is the most potent political banner that any national community can produce. Hamas seeks to show itself fighting daily against Israeli occupation forces over control of Palestinian land. If Israel obliges by remaining in any part of Gaza, Hamas may get its protracted insurgency.\n\nHowever, that strategy is extremely risky. Hamas did not consult, warn or prepare to protect the innocent Palestinians of Gaza. Hamas boasts that they restored the Palestinian issue to international attention, and that \"we are called a nation of martyrs,\" but in recent months, the devastated Palestinians of Gaza have been assaulted by Israel more brutally and thoroughly than any civilian population in the 21st century, especially on a per capita basis. At least 35 per cent of standing structures in Gaza and more than 70 per cent of homes have been badly damaged or destroyed, and at least 35,000 of 2.2 million Palestinians there, mostly civilians and especially children, have been killed; an unknown number are still buried under rubble. Virtually the entire population is displaced. A serious man-made famine is spreading.\n\nThis devastation has invited Palestinians to ask: What did Hamas think it was doing? What happened to my family, my home, my job, my food, my drinking water? What is to become of us? What have you done? These questions were delayed as Palestinians rallied around the flag and focused their rage on Israel's cruelty. But they are emerging.\n\nPalestinians celebrated, especially in Gaza, when they'd heard initial reports that Hamas had accepted an Egyptian-Qatari ceasefire proposal backed by the United States. Their ecstasy faded quickly when Israel rejected it. Yet it's noteworthy that Gazans celebrated Hamas abandoning its demand for a total end to the war.\n\nThis major capitulation reflects a new level of political weakness, reflected by reports of deep concerns about the progress of the war among Hamas leaders earlier this year; at the time, Yahya Sinwar, Hamas's leader in Gaza, insisted everything was going according to plan. Hamas was also in a political crisis before the war: One poll conducted at the time found Hamas's popularity in Gaza at a mere 27 per cent, with 67 per cent saying they had no or not a lot of trust in Hamas. Support initially spiked after Oct. 7, but increasingly, voices of anger have been growing louder despite Hamas's intolerance of dissent. In late April, the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research found that the group's popularity had fallen to roughly where it was before the war.\n\nThis weakness offers a crucial opening. Fatah leaders such as Mahmoud Abbas have sensed it, lambasting Hamas for unilaterally plunging Palestinians into a catastrophe \"worse than 1948.\" The group's enemies must now seize on its incipient crisis through a rapid and thoroughgoing Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and urgently strengthening the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization and their continuing commitment to counterterrorism and a negotiated peace agreement with Israel. Mr. Netanyahu and his government, however, appear dead-set against any such policy transformation. That's utter folly.\n\nHamas was hoping for a big political win despite incurring a huge military defeat in the initial part of the \"permanent war\" with Israel. Yet support for their rivals could take potent advantage of Hamas's political vulnerability because of the calamity they foisted on Gazans. Persisting in disregarding Palestinian politics while treating all Palestinians as essentially the same would be unforgivable political malpractice.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Insurgency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_states_of_the_Persian_Gulf", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arab states of the Persian Gulf"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arab world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli-occupied territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterterrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Counterterrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Abbas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mahmoud Abbas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestine Liberation Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fatah"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/QZ22NE47HJEVFDBV2MZ6Z46FHE.jpg?auth=e7a946a04e1d83b36392a245b03b60d74c8a99cd04c36d38aaca18650e4617d2&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544195", "eventUri": "eng-9544195", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 730, "textEnd": 736, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

In practical terms, this resolution, in accordance with international law, is legally binding on all UN member states, including Israel and Palestine, the latter holding observer status.\n\nThe Palestinian National Authority and Hamas have expressed support for the ceasefire resolution. However, Israel expressed dissatisfaction with the US abstention from the vote, suggesting that the wording of the resolution favours Hamas.\n\nIn practice, the resolution is unlikely to significantly improve the situation for the millions of Palestinians in Gaza, as the Security Council lacks effective means of enforcing its resolutions. Israel has previously even disregarded directives from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to facilitate the urgent provision of basic services and humanitarian aid.\n\nAlthough military intervention to enforce the resolution against Israel is improbable, other states could resort to economic and diplomatic measures to pressure Israel into compliance. These actions might involve imposing sanctions, suspending arms sales, or withdrawing diplomatic missions and support. Furthermore, the resolution primarily stresses the need to increase humanitarian aid flow to Gaza. However, this wording provides Israel with leeway to continue denying access to aid convoys at border crossings like Rafah and Kerem Shalom, citing security concerns.\n\nEven before the conflict had commenced, and particularly following the Hamas attack on 7 October, Israel had been creating hindrances for humanitarian aid to enter Gaza, often rejecting supplies such as oxygen cylinders, ventilators, sleeping bags, dates, and maternity kits.\n\nThe decision by the US to abstain from the vote signifies a significant departure in its diplomatic backing for its primary ally in the Middle East. This resolution serves a clear signal to the Israeli government that the US has drawn a boundary in terms of what it is and is not willing to endorse and support. Moreover, the Security Council resolution is likely to intensify pressure on both parties to reach a consensus through negotiations facilitated by Qatar and Egypt.\n\nHamas' recent proposal comprises four key points- implementation of a comprehensive ceasefire, withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip, repatriation of forcibly displaced Palestinians, exchange of Palestinian prisoners for Israeli hostages. As per media reports, Israeli government has agreed to an American-mediated compromise regarding the number of Palestinian prisoners to be released in exchange for Israeli hostages. But it appears that Israel is currently hesitant to commit to a permanent ceasefire.\n\nShould this agreement materialise, it is expected to entail detailed arrangements for its implementation, like the temporary truce negotiated in November. This prior agreement involved a coordinated exchange of Israeli hostages for palestinian prisoners, alongside the delivery of humanitarian aid. The number of prisoners sought by Hamas in exchange for hostages has been a point of contention. In 2011, Israel agreed to release over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for one Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit. In anticipation of a similar scenario, Israel has detained thousands of Palestinians in both Gaza and the occupied West Bank for minor offenses in recent months. Currently, Hamas retains approximately 100 hostages, primarily men, including many reservists in the Israeli military.\n\nThe Security Council's resolution passed, although characterised by vague terms and limited incentives for compliance, currently presents at least an option for encouraging a cessation of violence and facilitating aid delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Efforts toward achieving a potentially more meaningful and practical ceasefire should and will persist. With the recent developments, heightened attention should now be directed towards the people of Gaza, who are the worst victims.", "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member states of the United Nations"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ramadan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_prisoners_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian prisoners of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_occupation_of_the_West_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli occupation of the West Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repatriation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Repatriation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilad_Shalit", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gilad Shalit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://tds-images.thedailystar.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2024/05/10/gaza.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544195", "eventUri": "eng-9544195", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1704, "textEnd": 1713}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Thus, as Prime Minister Netanyahu put it:\n\nIsrael cannot accept a situation in which Hamas' battalions leave their tunnels, reestablish control over the Gaza Strip, rebuild their military industries and go back to threatening the citizens of Israel in the communities of the Western Negev, the cities of the south and throughout the country.\n\nIndeed, Hamas has every reason not to have a resolution that doesn't encompass their maximalist demands. It surely could not be concerned with alleviating the plight of Gazans. Not when they are regularly employed as human shields and ostensibly civilian hospitals are routinely used by Hamas as military installations.\n\nMoreover, as a general matter, Hamas leaders are plainly basking in the glow of the daily spectacle of the leaders of the western world pleading with them to make a deal. They have to be relishing the obvious contrast with the moribund Palestinian Authority and its feckless president Mahmoud Abbas. So, the longer the process drags on, the more they continue as stars of the Arab world.\n\nNor have they been made to believe that their recalcitrance will result in any loss of opportunity. To the contrary, it has led to a continuing erosion of the Biden administration's support for Israel and a steady stream of unreciprocated Israeli concessions engineered by it.\n\nHamas has to be encouraged by the fierce Biden opposition to an Israeli invasion of Rafah, on the grounds that it would result in unacceptable numbers of civilian deaths, and the leaked report this past weekend that there has been a halt to U.S. shipments of munitions to Israel in response to Israel's announced plans to move forward in Rafah notwithstanding U.S. objections. By any measure this could end up providing a sanctuary for Hamas and a ticket to survival.\n\nPerhaps the time has come for President Biden to join in telling the Sinwars and Haniyehs of the world that we're on to them and they should surrender, lay down their arms and release the people they kidnapped.

Hamas is a terrorist force dedicated to the proposition that \"no Jew will remain\" in Israel. After Hamas launched the worst terrorist violence in modern times -- and promised to do it again until Israel was destroyed -- the Israeli government on a broad war coalition basis decided to launch a campaign to destroy Hamas.\n\nHamas has always hidden behind civilians and placed its military assets under hospitals, schools, and apartment buildings. It has also routinely stolen humanitarian aid to build and maintain its underground tunnel system, which is the size of the London subway.\n\nAny effort to destroy Hamas would inherently involve threatening civilians and creating scenes which look horrible to people whose lives and families are not threatened with extermination. This is by Hamas's design.\n\nThe choice is simple.\n\nYou are either for Israel defeating its terrorist enemies even with risk to innocent persons behind whom Hamas is hiding -- or you are for the survival of Hamas even with its mortal threat to every Israeli and the existence of Israel.\n\nThe Biden administration was initially for the defeat of Hamas. President Biden's first instinct, in the immediate aftermath of the horrors of October 7, were to back Israel.\n\nGradually, the inevitable human cost of an anti-Hamas campaign began to build. The power of the worldwide pro-terrorist propaganda network swelled. The natural appeasement psychology of American elites wore Mr. Biden down. He moved away from supporting the defeat of Hamas and toward defending Hamas' survival, even demanding that Rafah should be a sanctuary city for terrorists.\n\nThe American -- and most Western -- elite's bias toward appeasing terrorism and avoiding harsh realities was captured in a recent column by Thomas Friedman. Mr. Friedman argued that Israel can have an alliance with Saudi Arabia, or it can destroy Hamas -- but it can't have both.\n\nThe columnist then asserted that the alliance with Saudi Arabia is more important. In effect Mr. Friedman would have Israel rely on Arab governments to police Gaza and somehow provide security despite the continued existence of four battalions of Hamas terrorists at Rafah.\n\nFrom an Israeli perspective, this just doesn't work. The Israelis have learned that, for instance, relying on the United Nations to police Hezbollah in Lebanon is useless. Hezbollah breaks every agreement, and nothing is done. Hezbollah gets stronger, and northern Israel suffers the consequence of the international failure.\n\nAdditionally, Israelis see that at least 10 percent of UN Relief personnel at Gaza are active supporters of Hamas. This further discourages the Israeli government from relying on others for Israel's protection.\n\nThe elites don't understand the most important lesson about Israeli survival. It was at war with all its neighbors as soon as it became a country in 1948. Israelis know Israel must be prepared to defend itself and do what is best for its own safety and security.\n\nThe tension between the appeasement wing of the American establishment and the pro-Israel wing of American politics goes back to the beginning. When Israel was established on May 14, 1948, President Truman immediately recognized the country.\n\nTruman acted despite the active opposition of the State Department -- the bureaucracy opposed the creation of a new Jewish state for fear it might increase Soviet influence in the Middle East. Senior State Department officials, including Secretary of State Marshall, so opposed Israel that they actively tried to block President Truman's recognition and undermine his efforts at the United Nations.\n\nIt is clear the road to Israeli survival runs through the occupation of Rafah and the destruction of Hamas. A strong Israel is a better ally for Saudi Arabia against Iran than a weak, appeasement-oriented, intimidated Israel that allows Hamas to survive.\n\nFurther, giving the political leadership of Hamas a moral victory and breathing space to plot new anti-Israeli attacks and massacres will only lead to more violence. Israel should complete the destruction of Hamas and then seek alliances that are a lot more reliable than the Biden administration. Mr. Friedman has it exactly backwards.

United States would withhold weapons from Israel if its forces mount a major invasion of the southern Gaza city.\n\nA senior Israeli official said that the latest round of indirect negotiations in Cairo to halt hostilities had ended and Israel would proceed with its operation in Rafah and other parts of the Gaza Strip as planned.\n\nIsrael has submitted to mediators its reservations about a Hamas proposal for a hostage release deal and the Israeli delegation was returning from the Egyptian capital, the official added.\n\nIn Gaza, Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad said their fighters fired anti-tank rockets and mortars at Israeli tanks massed on the eastern outskirts of the city.\n\nResidents and medics in Rafah, the biggest urban area in Gaza not yet overrun by Israeli ground forces, said an Israeli attack by a mosque killed at least three people and wounded others in the eastern Brazil neighbourhood.\n\nVideo footage from the scene showed the minaret lying in the rubble, two bodies wrapped in blankets and a wounded man being carried away.\n\nOn the city's eastern edge, residents said a helicopter opened fire, while drones hovered above houses in several areas, some close to rooftops.\n\nIsrael says Hamas militants are hiding in Rafah, where the population has been swelled by hundreds of thousands of Gazans seeking refuge from bombardments elsewhere in the coastal enclave, and it needs to eliminate them for its own security.\n\nOne of the displaced, Mohammad Abder-Rahman, said he feared the Israeli bombardments presaged an invasion of the city.\n\n\"It reminds me of what happened before Israeli tanks stormed our residential areas in Gaza City, heavy bombardment usually allows tanks to roll towards places they intend to invade,\" the 42-year-old told Reuters via a messaging app.\n\nCeasefire talks in Egypt's capital made some headway but no deal was reached, according to two Egyptian security sources.\n\nThe Hamas delegation left for Doha for consultations, blaming Israel for the lack of agreement so far.", "source": {"uri": "deccanherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deccan Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Read their demands and manifestos. Collate the confusion after October 7 from the Biden administration.\n\nHere are ten of their most common untruths about October 7 and the war that followed.\n\n\"Progressive Hamas\": Gay and transgendered student protestors in America would be in mortal danger in Gaza under a fascistic Hamas that has banned homosexual acts and lifestyles. Anyone protesting publicly against Hamas or its allies would be arrested and severely punished.\n\nWomen are segregated in most Hamas-run educational institutions. Under the Hamas charter, women are valued mostly as child-bearers. By design, there are almost no women in high positions in business or in government under Hamas.\n\n\"Colonists and Settlers\": Students scream that Israelis are \"settlers\" and \"colonists\" and sometimes yell at Jewish students to \"go back to Poland.\"\n\nBut the Jewish presence in present-day Israel is deeply rooted in ancient tradition. Dating back at least three millennia, the concept of \"Israel\" as a distinct Jewish state, situated roughly in its current location, is ingrained in history.\n\nBy contrast, the much later Arab invasions of the Byzantine-controlled Levant and their arrival in Palestine occurred about 1800 years after the establishment of a Jewish Israel.\n\n\"Two-state Solution\": When student protestors scream \"from the river to the sea,\" that is not advocacy for a two-state solution. It is a call to eliminate the state of Israel -- lying in between the Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea -- and its 10 million Jewish and Arab citizens. The Hamas charter is a one-state/no-Israel agenda, which we saw attempted on October 7.\n\n\"Occupied Gaza\": Gaza was autonomous. The Israeli border is closed, but so is the Egyptian border. There have not been any Jews in Gaza for nearly two decades.\n\nSo on October 7, Gaza was not occupied by Israel. It was under the control of Hamas, designated by the U.S. government as a terrorist organization. After being elected to power in 2006, Hamas cancelled all subsequent elections and ruled as a dictatorship. Gaza forbids Jews from entering Gaza and has driven out most Christians. Israel hosts two million Arabs, both as Israeli citizens and residents.\n\n\"Netanyahu is the Problem\": The U.S. and Europe claim that the conservative government of Benjamin Netanyahu is alone behind the Israeli tough response in Gaza. Thus, both the EU and the U.S. are doing their best to undermine or even overthrow the elected Netanyahu administration.\n\nYet, most Israelis support Netanyahu's coalition government's agenda of destroying Hamas in Gaza. There is no evidence that any other alternative Israeli government would do anything differently from the present policies toward Hamas.\n\n\"Targeting Civilians\": After murdering nearly 1,200 Israelis on October 7, Hamas scurried back to Gaza and hid in tunnels and bases beneath hospitals, schools, and mosques. Its preplanned strategy was to survive by ensuring Gaza civilians would be killed. Hamas has indiscriminately launched more than 7,000 rockets at Israel, all designed to kill Jewish civilians.\n\nOutside assessors have concluded that Israel has not inadvertently killed a greater ratio of civilians to terrorists compared to most other urban fighting conflicts elsewhere, and perhaps even fewer than American engagements in Mosul and Fallujah.\n\n\"Protestors Are Pro-Palestine\": Increasingly, protestors make no distinction between supporting \"Palestine\" and Hamas. Their chants often echo the original Hamas eliminationist charter and recent genocidal ravings of its leadership. Some protestors wear Hamas logos and wave its flag. Many cheered the Hamas massacre of October 7.\n\n\"Anti-Israel Is Not Anti-Semitic\": When protestors scream to Jewish students to \"go back to Poland\" or call for the \"Final Solution,\" or assault them or bar them from campus facilities, they do not ask whether they are pro-Israeli. For protestors, anyone identifiable as Jewish becomes a target of their anti-Semitic invective and violence.\n\n\"Genocide\": Israel has not tried to wipe out the Palestinian people in the fashion of Hamas's one-state solution plan for Jews. Before October 7, some 20,000 Gazans a day requested to work in Israel -- on the correct expectation of much higher wages and humane treatment.\n\nIf Hamas had come out of its tunnels, separated from its impressed civilian shields, released its surviving Israeli hostages, and either openly fought the Israeli Defense Forces or surrendered the organizers of the October 7 massacre, no Gaza civilians would have died.\n\nAccording to Hamas's questionable \"genocide\" figures, roughly 4 percent of the Gazan population died during the Israeli response to October 7. At least a third to almost half of those deaths, according to various international observers, were Hamas terrorists.\n\n\"Disproportionate Response\": Iran tried to send 320 missiles and rockets into Israel. Israel replied with three. Hamas launched 7,000 rockets into Israel and slaughtered 1,200 Israelis before the IDF responded in Gaza, often dropping leaflets and sending texts to forewarn citizens.\n\nIsrael has been disproportionate only in the effectiveness of its response. Hamas and its Iranian benefactor intended disproportionately to hurt Israel but utterly failed.\n\nSo Israel proved to be competent, and Hamas incompetent in their similar efforts to use disproportionate force.", "source": {"uri": "amgreatness.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Greatness"}, "authors": [{"uri": "victor_davis_hanson@amgreatness.com", "name": "Victor Davis

A senior U.S. administration official, speaking to the Associated Press, confirmed the temporary suspension, citing worries over Israel's potential military actions.\n\nIn addition to the arms shipment delay, Israeli officials have alleged that the Biden administration was aware of modifications made to a ceasefire-prisoner swap deal proposed by Egypt and Qatar to Hamas.\n\nHowever, they claim that the U.S. failed to inform Israel of these changes before Hamas publicly announced its acceptance of the ceasefire terms.\n\nThese claims have been refuted by a senior U.S. official, who asserted that American diplomats have maintained active engagement with Israeli counterparts throughout the negotiation process.\n\nDespite the strained relations, the U.S. remains committed to facilitating a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

Significant portions of its military capabilities have been destroyed, and with the calls for Arab forces coming in to control Gaza on the day after the war, its rule over that area will surely be restricted, if not abolished altogether. Therefore, its capability of harassing Israel in the future will be diminished.\n\nOn the Lebanese border, Iran's proxy Hezbollah has also been repeatedly hit by the Israeli Air Force, and it seems that the combination of the military pressure will eventually lead to a political arrangement, which will push the terrorist organization away from the Israeli border.\n\nThe Iranian missile and drone attack on Israel proved to be a colossal failure. Not only have most of the missiles and the drones been shot down (or have failed to reach their destination altogether), the anti-Iran coalition led by the U. S. showed that it is alive and kicking. Furthermore, Israel's response to that attack exposed the weakness of the Iranian defense systems. Israel's deterrence has definitely been enhanced.\n\nOn the downside, the attack on Oct. 7 was a big humiliating blow to Israel, and the fact that after 215 days, 94 Israelis are still kept hostages in the hands of Hamas is extremely painful. If and when they will be released, the price Israel will surely have to pay, especially by exchanging them for jailed terrorists and pulling out of Gaza, will be a bitter pill to swallow. Also, Israeli leaders kept telling the public that the releasing of the hostages was one of the top war aims.\n\nAs long as this doesn't happen, Israelis are increasingly doubting whether the continuation of the war actually leads toward the release of the hostages, and with each additional day, the chances of them returning alive are diminishing.\n\nAnother goal of the war, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu kept trumpeting, is the \"total victory\" over Hamas. No one really knows what exactly that means, but if after six months of ferocious fighting and so much destruction inflicted on Gaza, Hamas still stands on its feet, then there are more doubts about the wisdom of the Israeli policy.\n\nIn the meantime, tens of thousands of Israelis have been evacuated from the border areas both near Gaza and on the Lebanese border, and it remains to be seen when they will be able to return to their homes without being attacked again by either Hamas or Hezbollah.\n\nThen, there is the tension between the Biden administration and Netanyahu's government over the refusal of the latter to discuss the day after the war and the dire humanitarian conditions of the people of Gaza and the continued attacks.\n\nFinally, once the initial empathy towards Israel abated, there emerged a global negative sentiment, which sparked not only political pressures and anti-Israeli demonstrations, but also anti-Semitic attacks, culminating in the emerging violence on the US campuses.\n\nWeighing all these pros and cons leads many Israelis to the somber conclusion that the current government has failed twice: First, by its policy over the past years of \"containing\" Hamas and weakening the Palestinian Authority, it actually helped strengthen Hamas.\n\nAnd then, by launching the constitutional coup against the Israeli democracy, it portrayed Israel as a weak society, torn apart from within, something which seduced Hamas to unleash its attack. Secondly, many Israelis believe that Netanyahu is prolonging the war in order to deflect criticism or, in other words, simply to remain in power.\n\nProtesting against governments in times of war is always a sensitive issue, as the Vietnam era has shown.\n\nIn Israel, though, the public pressure is rising, with more Israelis becoming convinced that the current government has failed and it should go; the sooner, the better.", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "uri_dromi@miamiherald.com", "name": "Uri Dromi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Declaration of war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Proxy war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.sacbee.com/latest-news/inqaf7/picture288427817/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/SAC_20240508_PK_JEWISH_0022.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544195", "eventUri": "eng-9544195", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1290, "textEnd": 1296}], "sentiment": -0.607843137254902, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Therefore, gaining control of this border is seen as a crucial strategic goal, as it enables Israel to regulate the main gateway to and from Egypt.\n\nHighlighting the reasons why the Israeli government views the Rafah invasion as unavoidable, Bremmer remarked, \"The US has delivered an ultimatum to Benjamin Netanyahu saying that there will be strong consequences if they proceed with such a war. But I do believe that some form of military operation is inevitable because this isn't just about Netanyahu or the war cabinet, but rather the entire Israeli population. They believe that Hamas is responsible for civilian deaths due to their operations in civilian areas and holding hostages. Therefore, most Israelis support continued military strikes until Gaza's military infrastructure is destroyed, Hamas leadership is neutralised, hostages are freed, and fighters are removed.\n\nSeveral aid organisations have warned that the Rafah attack would bring a surge of civilian deaths in the Israeli campaign that in nearly seven months has already killed 34,000 people, exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and devastated the region.\n\nDeliberating on the US' failed attempt to contain the war, Bremmer said, \"This is a really challenging policy decision for the US President. Almost no other country supports the US position in the war. Most US citizens increasingly want a ceasefire, including young people and Democrats. But Biden has certainly tried very hard to prevent the Israeli war cabinet from launching a ground invasion in Rafah, worrying that it's going to be a bloodbath perhaps even worse than what we've seen over the last seven months.\"\n\n\"At the same time, Biden is also striving to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas, most of whom are civilians, illegally detained and tortured. But Hamas refuses to budge despite the efforts and the negotiations. Therefore, it is almost impossible to get a temporary ceasefire unless there is a breakthrough,\" Bremmer added.\n\nHamas had agreed to a three-phase ceasefire and hostages-for-prisoners exchange on Monday. However, Israel rejected the deal, saying it was not acceptable because its terms had been \"softened\". The proposal involved releasing 33 hostages in the first 42-day phase, while Israel would release Palestinians from its jails and partially withdraw troops from Gaza. Phase two would entail a complete halt to military activity, followed by the exchange of bodies and the implementation of reconstruction overseen by Qatar, Egypt, and the UN in phase three.\n\nDiscussing the potential long-term political solution to the conflict, Bremmer said, \"It's very helpful to have the US, the Gulf states, and Israelis, recognise that we need to have a solution for the Palestinians. However, the Israeli government's reluctance to cease military actions and the PM's rejection of a two-state solution is hindering the process. So, we must first get to a point where a permanent ceasefire can be declared, and we also need the Israeli PM out of office. Honestly, I can't see any peace when the sitting leader of Israel refuses to accept a two-state solution.\n\nIran has supported both Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) with financial aid, weapons, and political backing. Iran's first direct attack on Israel with 300 drones and missiles was reportedly in response to an Israeli airstrike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria, which resulted in the deaths of senior military commanders. Prior to this, Israel and Iran have engaged in a years-long shadow war, targeting each other's assets without officially acknowledging responsibility. These attacks have intensified considerably during the ongoing Gaza conflict.\n\nDiscussing Iran's potential to get directly involved in the war, Bremmer said, \"Iran's role in the war has been as the leader, the funder, the trainer of the so-called called axis of resistance, and a number of organisations in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Lebanon, in the occupied territories, and now apparently Bahrain as well, which do not recognise the right of Israel to exist.\"\n\n\"They are considered terrorist organisations by Israel and by the US and Iran is providing them with money and weapons and intelligence. So, as long as that continues, the potential for Iran to get directly involved in the war is high. I mean, they are clearly, you know, they're waist deep in a proxy war, in a number of proxy wars across the Middle East.\n\n\"So, after the Israelis engaged in direct strikes against an Iranian government building in Damascus, Iran hit Israel back with over 300 missiles and drones directly on its territory. Now fortunately most of them didn't get through but that was a big risk for the Iranians to take. If the attack had been more successful, which the Iranians were clearly hoping for, then the Israelis would have responded with a much more significant military engagement and we could be talking about the Straits of Hormuz disrupted, and the US in a war against Iran.\"\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump recently commented during an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that Israel is \"absolutely losing the PR war\" and urged for a swift end to the violence. He offered a tough message to Israel regarding its conflict with Hamas, advising the country to \"get it over with.\"\n\nMoreover, the Biden administration's decision on March 25 to not veto a United Nations Security Council resolution advocating for a ceasefire in Gaza intensified the strain between the Biden administration and the Netanyahu government.\n\nShedding light on the potential outcome if Trump were still the president, Bremmer suggested that the events of October 7 and the subsequent conflict might have been avoided.\n\n\"Netanyahu wants Trump to win. See, Biden, who is the elected president of the most powerful country in the world, has the Israeli PM walking all over him. He demanded a two-state solution, and Netanyahu said no. He demanded a halt on any plans for a ground invasion in Rafah, and Netanyahu said, \"I'm gonna do it no matter what\".\n\n\"Now, Netanyahu is the same leader that the US citizens have just committed $17 billion of additional military aid to? This is the same leader who is accountable for the killings of hundreds of aid workers, including US citizens, in Gaza, over the past months. He's the same leader who has refused to allow humanitarian aid (in Gaza),\" Bremmer said.\n\nWhile Trump's stance on the war remains unclear, his actions as president unequivocally supported Israel. During his presidency, Trump relocated the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and acknowledged Israel's control over the Golan Heights, in a reversal of longstanding US policy.\n\nEmphasising Israel's preference for Trump, Bremmer explained that he is a \"huge friend\" of Israel. The ideological orientation of Trump is very much towards the far right and towards Netanyahu's support base. \"After all, it was Trump that moved the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. It was Trump who has been instrumental in getting the Abraham Accords done, normalising Israeli relations with several Arab states. So, at the end of the day, there's no surprise that the Israeli government wants Trump,\" he added.\n\nHamas has repeatedly expressed concern about the suffering of Gazans, condemning the Israeli attacks as systematic violence targeting Palestinian civilians, particularly women and children.\n\nHowever, Bremmer feels that there's no justification to believe Hamas has \"any concern about civilians\". Hamas, according to him, sees civilians as expendable for their political goals, similar to how they treat Israeli civilians.\n\n\"I don't think anybody in the world today can say that Hamas does not bear responsibility for civilian deaths in Gaza. Of course, Israel is also responsible. But I happen to think that Hamas is more responsible. So, a ceasefire is required precisely for that reason. And furthermore, an immediate release of the hostages is required,\" he stated.\n\nEven if Israel and Hamas agree to a cease-fire and maintain it, experts predict that Gaza will not return to normalcy anytime soon. Amid the rise of antisemitism and Islamophobia, actions and words hold significant weight. However, opinions on the Israel-Gaza conflict remain polarised, extending from public spaces to cultural realms, sparking protests and inevitable backlash.\n\nStressing the bleak prospects for Gaza's recovery, Bremmer commented, \"I don't think Gaza will recover in the near future. I think, in the last seven months, there has been a radicalisation of a generation of Palestinians against Jews and vice versa. That's going to lead to a lot more violence, a lot more hatred.\n\n\"Despite all its efforts to target every last member of Hamas and its military capabilities, Tel Aviv will end up with much more anti-Israel radicalisation because of the war than it would have if it had fought it in a much more restrained way.\"", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan

Now it remains to be seen if and how the United States pushes its proxy regime in Tel Aviv to agree to the deal that came after marathon negotiations.\n\nIf the Israeli regime rejects the text of the deal, drafted by Egypt, Qatar and the US itself, and carries on with its genocidal aggression on Gaza, all indications point towards a wider regional conflict, which could potentially have dangerous ramifications for the Benjamin Netanyahu regime.\n\nThe Axis of Resistance has sent signals that it will not sit idly by while more Palestinian women and children are slaughtered by the occupation forces and will step up its military operations against the Israeli occupation on multiple fronts and on a level not seen over the past seven months.\n\nThis Axis of Resistance continues to expand, from Palestine to Lebanon to Iraq to Yemen to Bahrain and now Egypt as well. The Palestinian resistance movement Hamas is nowhere near being eliminated. It continues to inflict heavy blows on the illegitimate regime, pushing it closer to annihilation.\n\nSo, the key goal of the Israeli regime's unbridled aggression on Gaza - to wipe off Hamas - has failed.\n\nThere is nothing the Israeli military invasion of the city of Rafah in southern Gaza - the only so-called 'safe zone' - will achieve for the Zionists other than the massacre of more women and children.\n\nNearly five months after the Israeli occupation boasted about eliminating Hamas in northern Gaza, the regime forces were back there last week fighting the armed wing of Hamas, the Al-Qassam Brigades.\n\nThe regime warplanes repeatedly pounded the al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza recently, claiming the Hamas command center was operating there. It then raided the medical facility and went on to raze it to the ground and still failed to prove its claims.\n\nEvery hospital, school, shelter and other civilian infrastructure that the Israeli occupation forces have bombed and raided, from the north and all the way south to the city of Khan Younis, with lofty claims that it defeated Hamas has all turned out to be a farce.\n\nThe regime has failed to hoodwink the international community and even settlers who have been protesting against Netanyahu's war-mongering cabinet for months now.\n\nThe reality is that the armed wing of Hamas is still active, inflicting heavy blows on Israeli forces on the streets across Gaza using guerrilla warfare tactics. Only the ambushes planted against invading troops have proven to be enough to force entire IOF battalions to withdraw from areas they had occupied.\n\nDuring the battles in the southern city of Khan Younis that took four months before the Israeli military withdrew under intense fire, Israeli media was reporting and naming fatalities among the Israeli forces on an almost daily basis, and yet the official Israeli military death toll stayed static.\n\nThe Palestinian resistance has proven with its actions that it is as strong as it was on October 7. Considering the operations it is carrying out daily, the resistance has only grown in strength.\n\nThe terms that the embattled Israeli premier Benjamin Netanyahu seeks in order to boast about a victory to Israeli settlers is the dismantling of Hamas, the Palestinian resistance laying down its arms with its leaders surrendering or leaving the besieged territory.\n\nFor seven months, this has not been achieved militarily or through negotiations. For seven months, the Palestinian resistance has sent a clear and categorical message: it will never leave Gaza, not in this lifetime, and whoever doesn't like it can smack their heads against the wall in frustration.\n\nAt present, Netanyahu's political survival hinges on the massacre of Palestinian women and children. That is to either continue the genocidal war and expand it to Rafah or face a prison sentence.\n\nSustaining genocide is going to come at a higher cost than before. The world today has one thing on mind and that is Palestine, while the mission of the Axis of Resistance is also solely focused on Palestine.\n\nThe US is aware of what faces the Israeli regime much more than the regime itself. CIA director William Burns traveled to Cairo on Friday to change the ceasefire text and agree to the terms of Hamas in order to avoid the region going up in flames. This is the region that is home to US military bases.\n\nIf there is no sustainable ceasefire in Gaza and the slaughter of Palestinian civilians continues and expands, especially in Rafah, all options would be on the table for the Axis of Resistance.\n\nHamas Agrees to Mediators' Proposed Deal with 'Israel'\n\nHamas is not only negotiating on behalf of the Palestinian resistance factions or the people of Palestine but on behalf of the Axis of Resistance. What is happening in Gaza today concerns all of them.\n\nNo end to the genocide means the Mediterranean Sea will be on fire, the doors of the Bab al-Mandeb Strait being shut by the Yemeni military and the resistance movement to international maritime traffic.\n\nThe strait will not only be close to Israeli and Israeli-affiliated ships but all companies that have any links with the occupying entity. Before, it was maritime links, now it's any links.\n\nThat equates to about 90 percent of companies worldwide. Yemen has proved it is capable of imposing such an embargo on the occupying regime if it does not halt its genocidal onslaught against Palestinians.\n\nThe Iraqi resistance will increase operations against vital Zionist targets to a level not seen over the past seven months. Even entering the occupied Golan through Syria has been spoken about.\n\nDrones and missiles from Iraq heading in the direction of the Israeli-occupied lands have already increased over the past few days and that has rattled the regime and its Western backers.\n\nThe Secretary-General of Kataib Seyyed al-Shuhada, a major faction within the Iraqi resistance, Abu Ala'a al-Walaei perhaps summed it up best by saying \"The battle of al-Aqsa Storm has strengthened, after seven months of resilience and genocide\".\n\n\"The Zionist enemy believes it will achieve the alleged victory through crimes and shedding blood, but its efforts are in vain,\" Al-Walaei asserted.\n\n\"The great struggle of the battle of al-Aqsa Storm has drawn two paths before the world, with no third option: the path of resistance and support for the oppressed Palestinian people, and the path of the greatest devil, America, and its feeble Zionist ally.\"\n\nThe Iraqi resistance commander went on to warn the Zionists that \"your temporary occupation will not stay for long before our land is liberated, you are humiliated and encircled.\"\n\nHezbollah, according to reports, (there is no information from the Lebanese resistance movement), will start operations to liberate the occupied Sheba'a Farms if a full-scale invasion of Rafah commences.\n\nAnd we have seen more resistance players joining the fray recently from Bahrain to Egypt. They all have the same goal and the same enemy and the enemy knows who is it dealing with.\n\nThe Axis of Resistance doesn't want a war. Hamas has agreed to a ceasefire, an agreement that the Gaza-based resistance movement said it was extremely flexible in reaching.\n\nThe ball is in Netanyahu's court and his fascist ministers need to listen to their superiors in Washington and sign the deal on the table because the geopolitics of the region has changed.\n\nWesam Bahrani is an Iraqi journalist and commentator.\n\n(PressTV)\n\nfrom

Israel has submitted to mediators its reservations about a Hamas proposal for a hostage release deal, the official said.\n\n\"If we must, we shall fight with our fingernails,\" Netanyahu said in a video statement. \"But we have much more than our fingernails.\" In Gaza, Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad said their fighters fired anti-tank rockets and mortars at Israeli tanks massed on the eastern outskirts of the city.\n\nResidents and medics in Rafah, the biggest urban area in Gaza not yet overrun by Israeli ground forces, said an Israeli attack near a mosque killed at least three people and wounded others in the eastern Brazil neighbourhood. Video footage from the scene showed the minaret lying in the rubble and two bodies wrapped in blankets.\n\nAn Israeli air strike on two houses in the Sabra neighbourhood of Rafah killed at least 12 people including women and children. Among the dead was a senior commander of the militant Al-Mujahedeen Brigades, and his family, and the family of another group leader, medics, relatives and the group said.\n\nIsrael says Hamas militants are hiding in Rafah, where the population has been swelled by hundreds of thousands of Gazans seeking refuge from the bombardments that have reduced most of the coastal enclave to ruins. In the United States, the White House repeated its hope that Israel would not launch a full operation in Rafah, saying it did not believe that would advance Israel's aim of defeating Hamas.\n\n\"Smashing into Rafah, in [President Biden's] view, will not advance that objective,\" spokesperson John Kirby said. Kirby said Hamas had been pressured significantly by Israel and there were better options to hunt down what remains of the group's leadership than an operation with significant risk to civilians.\n\nIsrael's assault on Gaza has killed nearly 35,000 Palestinians and wounded nearly 80,000, most of them civilians, the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said. It launched its offensive in response to a cross-border attack by Hamas militants on Israel on Oct. 7 in which they killed about 1,200 people and abducted 252. Some 128 hostages remain in Gaza and 36 have been declared dead, according to the latest Israeli figures.\n\nBiden on Wednesday issued his starkest warning yet against a full ground invasion in Rafah, telling CNN that: \"I made it clear that if they go into Rafah...I'm not supplying the weapons.\" Israel's ambassador to the United States said the decision to withhold weapons from Israel over Rafah sends the \"wrong message\" to Hamas and the country's foes.\n\n\"It puts us in a corner because we have to deal with Rafah one way or the other,\" Ambassador Michael Herzog told a Carnegie Endowment for International Peace webinar. The Israeli military has the munitions it requires for operations in Rafah and other planned operations, chief armed forces spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said.\n\nIsraeli armed forces have already killed 50 Palestinian gunmen in east Rafah and uncovered several tunnels, Hagari said. Hamas had no immediate comment. TALKS END\n\nIn Cairo, delegations from Hamas, Israel, the U.S., Egypt and Qatar had been meeting since Tuesday. The talks in Egypt's capital made some headway but no deal was reached, according to two Egyptian security sources. Izzat El-Risheq, a member of Hamas' political office in Qatar, said the Hamas delegation had left Cairo, having reaffirmed its approval of the mediators' ceasefire proposal. The plan entails the release of Israeli hostages held captive in Gaza and a number of Palestinians jailed by Israel.\n\nHamas blamed Israel for the lack of agreement so far. Israel has said it is open to a truce, but has rejected demands for an end to the war.\n\nU.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington continued to engage with Israel on amendments to a ceasefire proposal, adding work to finalize the text of an agreement was \"incredibly difficult\". MEDICAL SECTOR COLLAPSING\n\nIsraeli residents set fire twice to the perimeter of the headquarters of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees in East Jerusalem, causing extensive damage to the outdoor areas but no casualties, UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini wrote on X. There was no immediate comment from Israeli police. \"Once again, the lives of U.N. staff were at a serious risk,\" Lazzarini wrote, adding he had decided to close the compound until security is restored.\n\nOn Tuesday, Israeli tanks seized the Gaza side of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, cutting off a vital aid route and forcing 80,000 people to flee the city this week, according to the United Nations. Israel kept up tank and aerial strikes across Gaza and tanks advanced in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City in the north, forcing hundreds of families to flee, residents said. The Israeli military said it was securing Zeitoun, starting with a series of intelligence-based aerial strikes on approximately 25 militant targets.\n\nDeir Al-Balah in central Gaza was packed with people who had fled Rafah in recent days. Palestinian medics said two people, including a woman, were killed when a drone fired a missile at a group of people there. The closure of the Rafah crossing with Egypt has prevented the evacuation of the wounded and sick and the entry of medical supplies, food trucks and fuel needed to operate hospitals, the Gaza health ministry said on Thursday.\n\nThe only kidney dialysis centre in the Rafah area had stopped operating due to the shelling. \"The entire medical sector has collapsed,\" said Ali Abu Khurma, a Jordanian surgeon volunteering at Al Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah.\n\nUnited Nations aid chief Martin Griffiths said that for three consecutive days, \"nothing and no one has been allowed in or out of Gaza.\" \"It means no aid. Our supplies are stuck. Our teams are stuck. Civilians in Gaza are being starved and killed, and we are prevented from helping them. This is Gaza today, even after 7 months of horrors,\" Griffiths posted on X.

Israel has submitted to mediators its reservations about a Hamas proposal for a hostage release deal, the official said.\n\n\"If we must, we shall fight with our fingernails,\" Netanyahu said in a video statement. \"But we have much more than our fingernails.\" In Gaza, Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad said their fighters fired anti-tank rockets and mortars at Israeli tanks massed on the eastern outskirts of the city.\n\nResidents and medics in Rafah, the biggest urban area in Gaza not yet overrun by Israeli ground forces, said an Israeli attack near a mosque killed at least three people and wounded others in the eastern Brazil neighbourhood. Video footage from the scene showed the minaret lying in the rubble and two bodies wrapped in blankets.\n\nAn Israeli air strike on two houses in the Sabra neighbourhood of Rafah killed at least 12 people including women and children. Among the dead was a senior commander of the militant Al-Mujahedeen Brigades, and his family, and the family of another group leader, medics, relatives and the group said.\n\nIsrael says Hamas militants are hiding in Rafah, where the population has been swelled by hundreds of thousands of Gazans seeking refuge from the bombardments that have reduced most of the coastal enclave to ruins. In the United States, the White House repeated its hope that Israel would not launch a full operation in Rafah, saying it did not believe that would advance Israel's aim of defeating Hamas.\n\n\"Smashing into Rafah, in [President Biden's] view, will not advance that objective,\" spokesperson John Kirby said. Kirby said Hamas had been pressured significantly by Israel and there were better options to hunt down what remains of the group's leadership than an operation with significant risk to civilians.\n\nIsrael's assault on Gaza has killed nearly 35,000 Palestinians and wounded nearly 80,000, most of them civilians, the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said. It launched its offensive in response to a cross-border attack by Hamas militants on Israel on Oct. 7 in which they killed about 1,200 people and abducted 252. Some 128 hostages remain in Gaza and 36 have been declared dead, according to the latest Israeli figures.\n\nBiden on Wednesday issued his starkest warning yet against a full ground invasion in Rafah, telling CNN that: \"I made it clear that if they go into Rafah...I'm not supplying the weapons.\" Israel's ambassador to the United States said the decision to withhold weapons from Israel over Rafah sends the \"wrong message\" to Hamas and the country's foes.\n\n\"It puts us in a corner because we have to deal with Rafah one way or the other,\" Ambassador Michael Herzog told a Carnegie Endowment for International Peace webinar. The Israeli military has the munitions it requires for operations in Rafah and other planned operations, chief armed forces spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said.\n\nIsraeli armed forces have already killed 50 Palestinian gunmen in east Rafah and uncovered several tunnels, Hagari said. Hamas had no immediate comment. TALKS END\n\nIn Cairo, delegations from Hamas, Israel, the U.S., Egypt and Qatar had been meeting since Tuesday. The talks in Egypt's capital made some headway but no deal was reached, according to two Egyptian security sources. Izzat El-Risheq, a member of Hamas' political office in Qatar, said the Hamas delegation had left Cairo, having reaffirmed its approval of the mediators' ceasefire proposal. The plan entails the release of Israeli hostages held captive in Gaza and a number of Palestinians jailed by Israel.\n\nHamas blames Israel for the lack of agreement, and its Al-Aqsa TV's Telegram account said the group would not make any concessions beyond those in the proposal it had accepted. Israel has said it is open to a truce, but has rejected demands for an end to the war.\n\nU.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington continued to engage with Israel on amendments to a ceasefire proposal, adding work to finalize the text of an agreement was \"incredibly difficult\". MEDICAL SECTOR COLLAPSING\n\nIsraeli residents set fire twice to the perimeter of the headquarters of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees in East Jerusalem, causing extensive damage to the outdoor areas but no casualties, UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini wrote on X. There was no immediate comment from Israeli police. \"Once again, the lives of U.N. staff were at a serious risk,\" Lazzarini wrote, adding he had decided to close the compound until security is restored.\n\nOn Tuesday, Israeli tanks seized the Gaza side of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, cutting off a vital aid route and forcing 80,000 people to flee the city this week, according to the United Nations. Israel kept up tank and aerial strikes across Gaza and tanks advanced in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City in the north, forcing hundreds of families to flee, residents said. The Israeli military said it was securing Zeitoun, starting with a series of intelligence-based aerial strikes on approximately 25 militant targets.\n\nDeir Al-Balah in central Gaza was packed with people who had fled Rafah in recent days. Palestinian medics said two people, including a woman, were killed when a drone fired a missile at a group of people there. The closure of the Rafah crossing with Egypt has prevented the evacuation of the wounded and sick and the entry of medical supplies, food trucks and fuel needed to operate hospitals, the Gaza health ministry said on Thursday.\n\nThe only kidney dialysis centre in the Rafah area had stopped operating due to the shelling. \"The entire medical sector has collapsed,\" said Ali Abu Khurma, a Jordanian surgeon volunteering at Al Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah.\n\nUnited Nations aid chief Martin Griffiths said that for three consecutive days, \"nothing and no one has been allowed in or out of Gaza.\" \"It means no aid. Our supplies are stuck. Our teams are stuck. Civilians in Gaza are being starved and killed, and we are prevented from helping them. This is Gaza today, even after 7 months of horrors,\" Griffiths posted on X.

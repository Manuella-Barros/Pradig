Williams famously played Marnie Michaels, the self-centered roommate to Lena Dunham\u2019s main character, Hannah. Moss-Bachrach later joined the cast in Season 4 as Desi Harperin, Marnie\u2019s bandmate and love interest. The pair sat with Vanity Fair to discuss the \u201ccringey\u201d music they were forced to perform on the show, some of which had such \u201cembarrassing\u201d lyrics, Williams didn\u2019t even want to recite them. \u201cWe had some incredible luck in terms of the music that we performed. I actually think a lot of the songs we performed were really beautiful, the lyrics are what made them cringey often,\u201d Williams told her former co-star. She said that her favorite song was possibly \u201cOaxaca,\u201d adding, \u201cThe lyrics are so cringey I don\u2019t want to say them out loud.\u201d She then recited the lyrics to the song they performed in the Season 5 episode \u201cHomeward Bound,\u201d which showed Marnie and Desi earnestly recording the odd song in the studio, singing, \u201cYeah, you\u2019ll find me in a dark bar / Where no gringos are.\u201d \u201cMarnie singing the word \u2018gringo\u2019 should be illegal,\u201d Williams joked. With a laugh, Moss-Bachrach said he recently found out that \u201cmost of our songs were discards from Kelly Clarkson.\u201d Williams replied, \u201cI think the song \u2018Breathless,\u2019 \u2013 I guessed we\u2019re allowed to say this, it\u2019s been a long time, \u2013 was written by Jack Antonoff for Kelly Clarkson.\u201d The stars then opened up about how embarrassing it felt to perform the songs on set. \u201cI think what was nice that was built in was that they were supposed to be maybe not so great, like nobody had very high expectations so that felt safe to me,\u201d Moss-Bachrach said, before later admitting, \u201cI tried as hard as I could try.\u201d \u201cThe lyrics were so\u2026 guileless and embarrassing, that even Leonard Cohen could sing them and they would still suck,\u201d he declared \u2013 though Williams wasn\u2019t so sure. Williams also clued Moss-Bachrach on the fact that there were many memes saying Desi and Marnie were the \u201coriginal Tortured Poets\u201d after Taylor Swift\u2019s newest album. \u201cIt feels right, it feels canonically accurate,\u201d Williams said. Now, the stars can be found in their own respective projects. Moss-Bachrach is now an Emmy-winning actor thanks to his breakout performance in The Bear. Williams has also forged her own career in film and television with performances in M3GAN and Fellow Travelers. Girls is now streaming on Max.", "summary": "\"The lyrics were so... guileless and embarrassing, that even Leonard Cohen could sing them and they would still suck,\" Moss-Bachrach said.", "url": "https://decider.com/2024/05/29/girls-allison-williams-ebon-moss-bachrach-cringey-songs-discards-kelly-clarkson-jack-antonoff/", "image": "https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ebon-Moss-Bachrach-Allison-Williams-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/usr4ypWb-QVS3bn7S.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:15:08", "author": "mliss1578,Radhamely De Leon", "authors": ["mliss1578", "Radhamely De Leon"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.042}

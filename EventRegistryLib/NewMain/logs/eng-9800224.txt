Private Practice, Heroes, Criminal Minds, The Mentalist and Boardwalk Empire.\n\nHe also appeared in the 2021 movie The Eyes of Tammy Faye, which starred Jessica Chastain.\n\nHowever, the actor is now behind bars after being accused of rape, with seven felony charges laid against him.\n\nIt's been reported he was charged on July 19 after several women came forward and reported their allegations to police.\n\nOlds, who lives in Los Angeles, was taken into custody on August 7 after the Los Angeles Superior Court issued a warrant for his arrest.\n\nClaims made against Olds have dated between 2013 and 2023.\n\nPolice said their investigation started after a 41-year-old woman filed a report that claimed she was raped by the actor.\n\nThis woman alleged the incident happened at her Los Angeles home, when she came forward in January last year.\n\nTwo other women later went to police and also accused Olds of sexual assault.\n\nOlds, who is from New York and graduated from Yale University, allegedly met these women on dates.\n\n'His victims reported that he used his status as an Ivy League alumnus with success in the film industry to meet women and arrange dates,' the Los Angeles Police Department has said.\n\n'Each victim reported that Olds lured them into a false sense of security during their initial encounters, then turned violent without seeking their consent,' they added.\n\nPolice revealed that three women came forward with assault claims and two other women reported less violent sexual acts.\n\nLAPD special assault section supervisor, Detective Brent Hopkins, shared some insight into the investigation, according to CBS affiliate KCAL.\n\n'We heard the same story again and again,' he said.\n\n'Mr. Olds started off as charming, but then used brutal violence to carry out these rapes,' he claimed.\n\nHe continued: 'Some of these survivors suffered in silence for years before finding the strength to speak up.\n\n'Now that he's off the streets, we want to make sure everyone has a chance to be heard.'\n\nPolice have said they also believe there could be more possible victims and have urged these people to contact them.\n\nThey have been told to reach out to Detective Hopkins at 213-473-0417 or by email at 39343@lapd.online.\n\nAside from his acting work, Olds has also worked as a screenwriter in Hollywood.\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted the Los

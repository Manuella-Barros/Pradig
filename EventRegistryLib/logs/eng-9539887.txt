What if the Falcons can avoid the Cousins contract if he doesn't pass a physical before a specific deadline?\n\nUnlike the Raiders in 2023, the Falcons have no out. With one very narrow exception.\n\nPer a source with knowledge of the terms, Cousins's $50 million signing bonus requires the passing of a physical but specifically excludes the pre-existing Achilles injury -- \"provided Player continues to rehabilitate such pre-existing Right Achilles injury as required by and under the supervision and direction of Club's Head Team Physician and Club's Head Athletic Trainer.\"\n\nAs long as Cousins does what the team doctor and head athletic trainer tell him to do regarding the Achilles injury, the Falcons are on the hook for the full $50 million.\n\nOf course, that doesn't force the Falcons and Cousins together indefinitely. With only $27.5 million in salary due to Cousins in 2025, it wouldn't be hard to find a suitor for Cousins if both sides decide to make a clean break after one season. (Cousins has a no-trade clause.) While the dead-money charge for a pre-June 1 trade would be $37.5 million, the Falcons would avoid $37.5 million in additional guarantees to Cousins. Also, if they believe Penix is ready after only one year, the fact that they have their starting quarterback under a rookie deal makes it easier to absorb the Cousins cap charge.\n\nThat said, they still will have paid him $62.5 million for only one season, if he's traded in 2025.\n\nA trade after 2025 (and before June 1, 2026) would result in a smaller cap charge of $25 million. Under that scenario, the Falcons will have paid Cousins $90 million for two years.\n\nIt all comes down to when they decide to flip to Penix. They've tried to defuse the situation by suggesting Penix could sit for four or five years, which is ridiculous on its face. The truth is that a pivot to Penix could happen within a year or two without major contractual complications for the Falcons.\n\nThere's also a slim chance that the Falcons could trade Cousins before the start of the 2025 season. If Penix lights it up in OTAs, if another team loses a starting quarterback before the regular season starts, and if that team and Cousins decide to get together, a trade after June 1, 2024 would have the same cap effect as a trade before June 1, 2025. And with $12.5 million of the Cousins signing bonus due in September 2024 and another $12.5 million due in December 2024, the new team could agree to pay the money.\n\nIn 2016, the Vikings lost Teddy Bridgewater just before the start of the season. The Eagles, who were planning to start Sam Bradford while rookie Carson Wentz sat and learned, changed plans quickly when the Vikings offered a first- and fourth-round pick for Bradford.\n\nThese aren't probable outcomes, but they are possible. At least they're not impossible. If Penix quickly shows he can be the guy, there are ways the Falcons can accelerate the timetable to pivot from Cousins to Penix.\n\nPenix is clearly the future.

With the Falcons selecting Michael Penix Jr. eighth overall in the 2024 NFL draft, the quarterback room situation has a chance to be at least awkward, if not disastrous. So, Florio hatches a plan to give the Falcons options to get out of the Cousins deal just in time to allow Atlanta to enjoy at least a few years of Penix's rookie contract.\n\nWith only $27.5 million in salary due to Cousins in 2025, it wouldn't be hard to find a suitor for Cousins if both sides decide to make a clean break after one season. (Cousins has a no-trade clause.) While the dead-money charge for a pre-June 1 trade would be $37.5 million, the Falcons would avoid $37.5 million in additional guarantees to Cousins.

And with $12.5 million of the Cousins signing bonus due in September 2024 and another $12.5 million due in December 2024, the new team could agree to pay the money.\n\nI want to iterate here that the chances that any of these scenarios play out are slim to none. The most likely scenario is that Penix, Cousins and Heinicke go into 2024 with Cousins starting, Heinicke as the backup and Penix there in case of emergency.\n\nHaving Penix get the kinks out of his game should do him good, even if he was one of the more pro-ready quarterbacks in the 2024 NFL draft. There's still plenty for him to learn and plenty for Cousins to get out of Atlanta, even with the situation not playing out as he hoped when he signed the contract.\n\nBut as Florio said, \"If Penix quickly shows he can be the guy, there are ways the Falcons can accelerate the timetable to pivot from Cousins to Penix.\"", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeMarcus_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DeMarcus Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Florio", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Florio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Penix_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Penix Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kirk Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signing_bonus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Signing bonus"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-04/Kirk%20Cousins%20Michael%20Penix%20Jr%20042524%20Getty%20FTR.jpeg?itok=272q3Di2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539887", "eventUri": "eng-9539887", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 774, "textEnd": 780}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 231, "relevance": 1}

It's a good thing. Kirk knows his time is winding down.\"\n\nThe Falcons shocked the football world by taking Penix just a month after signing Cousins to a four-year, $180 million contract. Cousins' agent, Mike McCartney, told Daniel Jeremiah of NFL Network that the quarterback was given no head's up beforehand.\n\n\"It was a big surprise. We had no idea this was coming,\" McCartney said via text. \"The truth is the whole league had no idea this was coming. We got no heads up. Kirk got a call from the Falcons when they were on the clock. That was the first we heard. It never came up in any conversation.\"\n\nCousins' camp understandably expected the Falcons to select a player who would help the team win next season. Penix, while talented, will only play next season if Cousins is injured.\n\nDespite the surprise, Penix said Cousins reached out to him in the aftermath to offer support.\n\n\"He did reach out. We had a very good conversation. He reached out last night,\" Penix said. \"I'm going to keep it just between me and him right now, but it was definitely a good conversation, and I'm super excited to work with him, and he said he was the same with me.\"\n\nWhile it's unclear how the Falcons sold Cousins on leaving Minnesota for Atlanta, it's very likely the concept of Super Bowl contention was mentioned.

McCarthy at No. 10 overall.\n\nThe Vikings' decision came two picks after the Falcons stunned many -- including Cousins -- by drafting Washington quarterback Michael Penix Jr., believing they've secured the position for both the present and future.\n\nFalcons Podcast: Watch | Spotify | Apple Pods\n\nFalcons general manager Terry Fontenot and head coach Raheem Morris have since stressed Cousins is their starter, and they'd be pleased if the four-time Pro Bowler starts for the entirety of his four-year, $180 million contract, because it likely means team success has followed.\n\nIt's also worth noting, as Breer said, Minnesota wasn't willing to fully guarantee Cousins' contract in 2025, while Atlanta was. The Falcons will be giving Cousins some $90 million over the next two years, signaling at least a short-term commitment.\n\nAdding more strife to the move, the Falcons face tampering charges in 2025 for their involvement with signing Cousins from Minnesota.\n\nStill, Cousins felt blindsided. He knew the Falcons were pondering the idea of drafting a quarterback, but didn't think they'd do so in the first round.\n\nAtlanta's braintrust called Cousins moments before turning in the draft card with Penix's name on it. The Falcons wanted to keep their interest in Penix secretive, perhaps because Fontenot saw the Kansas City Chiefs snatch Patrick Mahomes from his grasp with the New Orleans Saints in 2017.\n\nNevertheless, Cousins left draft night stunned -- and after leaving Minnesota with plans of avoiding the drama that follows when having a first-round quarterback in his shadow, he was suddenly thrust into precisely that scenario.\n\n\"It had to be a crappy call to take if you were Cousins, considering the basis of the decision you'd made six weeks earlier,\" Breer writes. \"It remains to be seen if that'll lead to any sort of early fissure in the player-team relationship there. I think they'll be able to get past it, because head coach Raheem Morris is a phenomenal relationship guy, and Cousins is an adult.\n\n\"But if there are early bumps in the season, this one will be interesting to watch.\"\n\nCousins and Penix shared a phone call on draft night, one Penix said went well. Their official working relationship begins May 13, when Atlanta starts OTAs.\n\nBut for Cousins, the overall idea in which the relationship stems is one he didn't wish to be a part of entering the spring.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_flick@si.com", "name": "Daniel Flick", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kirk Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Penix_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Penix Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raheem_Morris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raheem Morris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Saints"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_7830,h_4404,x_0,y_0/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hx7m0312852d6fs6hh", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539887", "eventUri": "eng-9539887", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-13", "textStart": 3188, "textEnd": 3194}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

Cousins was playing some of the best football of his career before rupturing his Achilles in Week 8 against the Green Bay Packers.\n\nHad Cousins stayed healthy and won a playoff game, there's the possibility the Vikings would have reconsidered bending a bit more for the veteran quarterback.\n\nHowever, all signs showed that even if that were the case, the Vikings would still have looked toward finding Cousins' successor soon -- however, there appear to be no hard feelings between the two sides.\n\n\"I know Cousins appreciated how open the Vikings were about their draft strategy, even if it meant him leaving,\" Breer wrote.\n\nAnother irony in Atlanta is the fact that Cousins, once the backup to No. 2 overall pick Robert Griffin III, will now have a talented backup quarterback pushing him for the starting job.\n\nThe Falcons can push back -- call Cousins their quarterback all season -- but if Cousins and the Falcons cannot deliver early-season success, the calls for Penix will echo throughout Atlanta.\n\nThis was a situation the Vikings strived to avoid for years by creating a quarterback room that was a support system instead of creating room for competition -- which is a reasonable play considering the investment the team put into Cousins for six seasons.\n\nThe Falcons will have a delicate balance to strike this season.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "trevor_squire@heavy.com", "name": "Trevor Squire", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kirk Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Penix_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Penix Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Achilles tendon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Griffin_III", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert Griffin III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1754427519-4-e1709686330529.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539887", "eventUri": "eng-9539887", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

With this, the Falcons made it seem they would go all-in on the present day, building a contender around Cousins with the start of the new regime. They went so far as to tamper and risk either this year's or next year's draft pick to sign him. This decision, and their persistence to sign Cousins, essentially put Atlanta out of the quarterback conversation at eight in the eyes of many across the league. Instead, Cousins became, as The Athletic's Dianna Russini called it, \"the most expensive smokescreen in NFL history.\"\n\nPenix never came into the facility in Flowery Branch for a top-30 visit with the Falcons. Given his medical history, anybody interested in Penix should have been bringing him in to get an inside look at his medicals and getting a second opinion from the team doctors that he was worth the risk. Then, when Atlanta took Penix, they risked the opportunity to add an impact player in 2024, making it that much more risky.\n\nSo, let's break this down, this regime has taken the risk of:\n\nWhen you line it up, this is a risky proposition that many front offices would not have had the nerve to pull off.

The Vikings were honest with Cousins in telling him they planned to draft their QB of the future even if Cousins re-signed with Minnesota.\n\nBreer said Cousins appreciated that the Vikings were so up front with him.\n\nThe Falcons, of course, drafted Michael Penix Jr. with the No. 8 overall pick.

The Falcons probably kept their plan under wraps so no other team would jump ahead of them to draft the former Washington star. Still, unless they were deliberately trying to deceive Cousins so they could sign him, they probably should have trusted the 35-year-old with their secret.\n\nEven if the Falcons insist they are committed to Cousins as their starter, there is going to be a great deal of pressure on the veteran to perform with Penix waiting on the bench.

Per SI.com, the Vikings were up front with Cousins about the possibility of selecting a quarterback high in the draft -- even if he decided to remain in Minnesota. What's ironic is that Cousins' new team shocked the NFL world by taking quarterback Michael Penix Jr. at No. 8 overall.\n\nCousins, who turns 36 soon and is coming off a torn Achilles, reportedly was appreciative with how the Vikings were honest with him about their plan. Minnesota took the fifth quarterback of the draft at No. 11 overall with Michigan's J.J. McCarthy. It's clear Cousins was looking for a situation where he would be the solidified starter for more than a season, but more pressure has been placed on him by his new franchise after the Falcons utilized a top 10 pick on a rookie quarterback who turns 24 this week.\n\nCousins reportedly had no idea the Falcons were going to take a quarterback at No. 8 overall -- a decision which left him \"shocked\" and \"disappointed,\" according to NFL Media. While Cousins did sign a four-year contract, it gets easier for Atlanta to get out of the deal in two years. When will the Falcons' brass want to turn the page under center? That's a question we will be asking until it eventually happens.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordan_dajani@cbssports.com", "name": "Jordan Dajani", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kirk Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Penix_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Penix Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Achilles tendon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2023/10/20/7b6ee2c4-95ce-41f9-85fd-51bd4b3484c8/thumbnail/1200x675/9be47fc79afe140ac378563f7ae32ae5/kirk-cousins-usatsi-cbs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539887", "eventUri": "eng-9539887", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

So, hearing the latest news about Atlanta Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins' departure from Minnesota this offseason is a bit tough to digest.\n\nSports Illustrated's Albert Breer confirms in his recent installment of TheMMQB that the reason Cousins left was the possibility that the Vikings would select a quarterback in the first round of this year's draft.\n\nI do have one last take on the Atlanta Falcons' handling of the quarterback situation. And that's that I would 100% understand if Kirk Cousins is still stinging a bit from the whole ordeal.\n\nHere's why -- a reason he decided to leave Minnesota is because the Vikings were very up front with the 35-year-old about the possibility that, even in the case he stayed, they'd take a quarterback of the future high in the draft. Tying that together with the team's willingness to guarantee part, but not all, of a second year on another contract, Cousins figured that, if he stayed, there was a good shot that he'd be on the move in 2025.\n\nSo if you were him, how would you feel when that call came, as his new team was on the clock, to explain how the Falcons were taking his heir apparent, Michael Penix Jr., with the eighth pick? Now, I do understand why Atlanta felt the need to keep it quiet, and why GM Terry Fontenot's experience in New Orleans in 2017, when the Chiefs knew the Saints coveted Patrick Mahomes and jumped ahead of them to get him, marked the decision not to tell Cousins of their plans.\n\nStill, it had to be a crappy call to take if you were Cousins, considering the basis of the decision you'd made six weeks earlier. It remains to be seen, of course, if that'll lead to any sort of early fissure in the player-team relationship there. I think they'll be able to get past it, because head coach Raheem Morris is a phenomenal relationship guy, and Cousins is an adult. But if there are early bumps in the season, this one will be interesting to watch.\n\nCousins has been handsomely paid over his career, pulling in over $281 million, including Atlanta's $50 million signing bonus. But at the end of the day, he's still a human being and it's clear that he was fed a dream from General Manager Terry Fontenot and head coach Raheem Morris and they did not keep up their end of the bargain.\n\nSo, yes, Cousins will go on to presumably play well for the Falcons over at least the next two years. He probably will even be a good mentor for Penix as he navigates the league, but there is no doubt that this whole situation has to be deflating for a quarterback who set his sights on retiring as a Falcon.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kirk Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Fontenot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terry Fontenot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raheem_Morris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raheem Morris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signing_bonus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Signing bonus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2022-11/Kirk%20Cousins%20110722.jpeg?itok=Zq9iArj9", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539887", "eventUri": "eng-9539887", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

It was one of those moments that made me scream \"WHAT!\" and I am not even a fan of the Falcons.\n\nThe Falcons are clearly in win-now mode and taking a rookie quarterback with an incumbent in place is mind-boggling.\n\nI understand the logic behind this pick but it certainly clashes with the Falcons' other offseason moves and needs. Let's break down the reasoning behind this pick.\n\nMichael Penix Jr. has a rocket of an arm and precision accuracy, and his NFL combine and Pro Day performances proved that he has decent athleticism.\n\nPenix has a ton of experience having played for six college seasons due to the COVID-19 pandemic and injuries granting him extra eligibility. On one hand that makes Penix an excellent NFL-ready prospect. However, considering Cousins' four-year contract, do the Falcons expect to start Penix for the first time during his age-27 season?\n\nSupposedly, Raheem Morris loved everything about Penix. During Morris' first stop as a head coach, his quarterback was Josh Freeman. Do you even recognize that name? As such, Morris may have looked around the league and decided that this may be the best chance he has to protect the future of the position in Atlanta. This team projects to be very good for the next few years and will likely not find themselves picking in the top ten again anytime soon.\n\nThe Falcons' biggest needs heading into the draft were edge rusher and cornerback. They could have had their pick of any defensive player in the draft considering that the first 14 picks were all on the offensive side of the ball. Drafting a defenseman would have helped them win now.\n\nPerhaps there is something we do not know about Kirk Cousins' Achilles injury that led the Falcons to make this pick. It is difficult to justify because they gave Cousins $100 million guaranteed. Either way, Penix's age and the Falcons' championship window make this pick puzzling. However, we have seen many teams live in quarterback purgatory for years so this pick could turn out to be very good. Perhaps the Falcons will have the last laugh in three or four years.

Dynasty Fantasy Football Outlook", "body": "The Atlanta Falcons stunned the football world when they selected Michael Penix Jr. with the eighth overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft. It was a head-scratching selection considering Atlanta just inked quarterback Kirk Cousins to a four-year, $180 million contract in free agency.\n\nDynasty managers now have to figure out when to select Penix in rookie drafts. It looks like he will be riding the bench for a while behind Cousins, so that complicates matters quite a bit.\n\nMake sure you keep up to date with all your fantasy football needs by following RotoBaller on X and checking out RotoBaller.com. Let's have a brief discussion on when you should be selecting the Falcons rookie quarterback.\n\nPenix is a controversial player in the dynasty community. Gamers are turned off by his age, injury history, the amount of time he spent in school, and his lack of rushing production. These are certainly fair concerns, but it's worth noting that several teams (including the Falcons) had Penix rated as their number two quarterback in this class. He also finished 2023 as Pro Football Focus' (PFF) eighth highest-graded collegiate passer.\n\nFurther driving down his value is the fact he's snookered behind Cousins on the depth chart. This is not really a good reason to fade Penix as we have seen things work out incredibly well for Jordan Love when faced with a similar situation. He was forced to sit behind Aaron Rodgers for three years then burst onto the season in 2023 en route to a QB5 finish.\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that Penix may not have to sit for the entirety of Cousins' contract. The Packers signed Rodgers to an extension with Love still waiting in the wings. They eventually shipped Rodgers to the Jets. Cousins could follow a similar trajectory. He could also be injured at some point, or perhaps he isn't the same player following his Achilles injury. This would open the door for Penix to play sooner than expected.\n\nThrough my 14 super flex rookie drafts so far, Penix has gone as high as 12th overall and as low as 24th overall. He has an average draft position (ADP) of 15.5 in these drafts. That equates to about pick 2.03. Players in super flex leagues should feel fine selecting Penix in this range. It's not often you can get a quarterback with top-eight draft capital in the second round of rookie drafts.\n\nManagers in single quarterback dynasty leagues should be able to land Penix in the third round of drafts. He's less valuable in this format but can be a nice asset to leave on your taxi squad while he develops.\n\nThe fact is, Atlanta sees Penix as their quarterback of the future. He is going to be given an extended opportunity at some point. Dynasty gamers just need to exhibit patience and realize it will be a few years before they see any return on investment.", "source": {"uri": "rotoballer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "rotoballer.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dave_ventresca@rotoballer.com", "name": "Dave Ventresca", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeMarcus_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DeMarcus Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Penix_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Penix Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_football_(gridiron)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fantasy football (gridiron)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kirk Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Love", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depth chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_squad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Practice squad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Achilles tendon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.rotoballer.com/2022/09/Michael-Penix-Jr.-CFB-DFS-Picks-Daily-College-Fantasy-Football-NFL-Draft-Rookies-icon-rotoballer.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539887", "eventUri": "eng-9539887", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Everyone was taken aback. General manager Terry Fontenot and head coach Raheem Morris had to defend this unprecedented selection ad nauseum in the draft presser that followed.\n\nIn that press conference, Morris and Fontenot were doing everything they could to reiterate to Falcons fans that this 24-year-old kid will become the face of this franchise. Whether in two or five years, Atlanta will have a decade of stability at quarterback that they haven't had since Matt Ryan was traded.\n\nIn this exercise, we look at how viable a claim that is. We dive into how much of a fit Penix will be in a projection of offensive coordinator Zac Robinson's offense.\n\nOne of Penix's superpowers is making sure that when things were right, and they were right a lot at Washington (419 dropbacks and 415 attempts while being kept clean, according to PFF), he took advantage. Penix had the second-highest offensive grade of any quarterback in the 2024 NFL draft class and tied for third-highest when kept clean. He had the most yards (3,834), touchdowns (30) and the most big-time throws (28) when kept clean.\n\nPenix can pick you apart with his arm, which we'll discuss later, and with his mind. Penix is known for processing information quickly and using his football IQ pre-snap to obliterate a defense post-snap.\n\nThe Falcons have made a point to make their roster as quarterback-friendly as they possibly could for whenever the answer at the position arose. With Penix, they found a quarterback who could maximize the environment given to him and run the system as it is supposed to.\n\nPenix is seen by many as the most natural thrower of the football in this class. Morris made it known that when they went to Seattle to see him, they fell in love with the way the ball flew out of his hand.\n\nWhen watching the film, this same ability jumps off the screen. The velocity that he can put on the ball, the spin on the spiral as it flies through the air, Rich Eisen called it \"The NFL Films\" ball because of how aesthetically pleasing it looks out of his hand.\n\nPenix's arm talent drew in Morris and Robinson because they had seen what that kind of talent could do. In Los Angeles, Stafford was able to make throws that not many quarterbacks in NFL history, let alone those that are active, couldn't make on the way to their Super Bowl in 2021.\n\nNow, the Falcons have their semi-version of Stafford in Penix and hope that same arm talent, and the confidence that comes with it, will lead Atlanta to success.\n\nFour season-ending injuries in four years.\n\nMost people see that and think of the physical toll that will take on a player and how they will never be the same athlete. For Penix, as he stated in his Player's Tribune letter to GMs before the draft, it's the emotional toll that he's endured that those watching him should focus on.\n\nThe mental trauma that comes from these kinds of injuries can be debilitating. There's a good chance that you won't see the same caliber of athlete ever again after them.\n\nWith Penix, he chose to channel that adversity into a two-year stint of Washington football that resulted in a National Championship berth. Penix has the mental makeup of a franchise quarterback, he can take the hits and continue to march on. As Fontenot would say, he fits the ethos they are trying to build in Flowery Branch.\n\nOne of the problems with Penix, which is probably where the plan for sitting him for two years to develop comes from, is his inconsistencies in his mechanics. These inconsistencies are heightened significantly when he is under pressure.\n\nPenix has a great arm, with that arm comes a ton of confidence that he can put it virtually anywhere that he wants. That confidence Is a gift and a curse.\n\nThere are times on his film where he will look for the big-time throw, as opposed to following the progression and getting to the correct read. There are also times when he will move off his spot and won't correctly reset his feet and almost will the ball to the spot using only his arm.\n\nAgain, he has great arm talent and it sometimes works for him, but there are times when this leads to inaccuracies and balls sailing on him unnecessarily.\n\nThis is around the time when I am obligated to remind you that Penix was a six-year college player and will be a 24-year-old rookie. It is a worry that these types of mechanical issues may be too ingrained in his style of play to eliminate. Accuracy is a hard thing to fix, and it will take time to fix those issues for Penix.\n\nIn Sports Illustrated's Albert Breer's piece detailing how the Falcons came to draft Penix eighth overall, there is a note that once Penix ran his 4.5 40-yard dash, Assistant GM Kyle Smith told Fontenot \"this guy is gonna go quick.\"\n\nUnfortunately, Penix isn't seen using that top-tier speed all that often on his film. Last season he had eight scrambles on his over 575+ dropbacks. Whether it's his injury history or his lack of creativity, Penix doesn't add much value once he is outside of the pocket. His 26 throwaways when pressured were the most of any quarterback in the 2024 NFL draft.\n\nPenix is learning from the perfect quarterback in that room for his development. Kirk Cousins is the ultimate system quarterback. When things are going well, he can make magic happen, a bet that the Falcons are relying on for this experiment to work. Cousins has been a surgeon from the pocket for years and has a chance to bestow some of that magic to Penix.\n\nOverall, Penix has all the makings of a franchise quarterback. He has the arm, he has the intangibles, he is capable of leading a team to a lot of success.\n\nDo I agree with the Falcons' decision to take him at eight? Not necessarily, but only because I haven't seen it work. This is unprecedented territory that the Falcons have decided to put themselves in and it will take some time to see if it will pay off.\n\nBut if it was going to work with anyone, having someone with the mental fortitude of Penix is a great way to start.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I'm not,\" Filice writes. \"In college football's national semifinals, he artfully cooked a loaded Texas team that just set a program record with 11 players drafted. I was in awe of that performance, just like everyone else. What I'm disparaging here is the process.\n\n\"I didn't understand it on draft night, I don't understand it today and I'm unlikely to understand it for at least a few years, if ever. When such a bold decision is made with SUCH a premium pick, it acutely trumps everything else in the draft class.\"\n\nAtlanta had its choice of the draft's top defensive players but instead chose Penix, the Heisman runner-up who battled injuries early in his career but rebounded to set Washington's single-season passing yards record in 2022 and again in 2023.\n\nBut Penix was the Falcons' second big quarterback move this offseason, which is where Filice's problem stems from.\n\nKirk Cousins signed a four-year, $180 million contract March 13 to be Atlanta's starting quarterback. Falcons head coach Raheem Morris and general manager Terry Fontenot have since said they have no issue with Cousins starting for the next three to four years.\n\nAnd so, expending a top-10 pick on a backup is a thought process Filice can't get behind.\n\n\"The NFC South is there for the taking right now,\" Filice writes. \"The Bucs held the throne with a 9-8 record last season and an 8-9 mark in 2022. When Cousins signed with the Falcons, they immediately vaulted to the top of divisional odds. Sure feels like it's GO TIME.\n\n\"If it's not? Then Atlanta shouldn't have given a soon-to-be 36-year-old quarterback $100 million guaranteed in the first place. If it is? Don't you think this roster could use a closer off the edge?\"\n\nThe Falcons' braintrust has defended the pick by saying they're following the Green Bay Packers' model of a quarterback succession plan.\n\nBut Penix, as Filice points out, has 45 collegiate starts under his belt and is an older option than 21-year-old J.J. McCarthy, who went off the board two picks later to the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nThus, in his eyes, comparisons to the Packers model fall short.\n\n\"Even if the Falcons still view (Penix) as something of a developmental quarterback, spending the No. 8 overall selection on a developmental quarterback is the definition of a luxury pick, but Atlanta hasn't had the luxury of a winning season since 2017,\" Filice writes. \"So all comparisons to Green Bay's approach with Jordan Love or Kansas City's top-10 selection of Patrick Mahomes just ring hollow.\"\n\nThere's also the element of opportunity cost, with the Falcons now forced to watch the careers of premier pass rushers Laiatu Latu (Indianapolis Colts) and Dallas Turner (Vikings) unfold while Penix is expected to spend the next few seasons watching from the sidelines.\n\nIt's a risk Atlanta felt was worth it, armed with the belief that Penix will become the franchise's long-term solution. But Filice sees it differently, instead referencing the \"curse\" of franchise great John Abraham.\n\n\"Since Atlanta released Abraham in March of 2013, exactly one Falcon has posted double-digit sacks (Vic Beasley in 2016),\" Filice writes. \"Fontenot and Co. had their pick of the pass-rushing litter in this draft, but they opted for a backup passer.\n\n\"Consequently, Atlanta's edge-rushing unit is headlined by Arnold Ebiketie, Lorenzo Carter, Zach Harrison and rookie third-rounder Bralen Trice.\"\n\nThe Falcons feel confident in their group and the thought process behind their decisions. Outside pundits don't.\n\nOnly time will tell whether Atlanta's draft class \"D\" ends up being dumbfounding ... or delightful.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports

Now the former NFL quarterback, Cam Newton, has placed the entire blame of the QB strategy at the management's feet.\n\nThe Falcons signed the former Minnesota Vikings QB Cousins, coming off an Achilles injury, at a $180 million contract with $100 million in guaranteed money. This suggested that the Falcons have placed their bets on Cousins to be their QB for the next four years. However, after a month, they drafted highly touted QB Michael Penix Jr. in the 2024 NFL Draft as well.\n\nThe former Carolina Panthers quarterback, Newton, had a lot to say about the entire situation. He used his podcast '4th and One' to criticize the Falcons front office's quarterback approach.\n\nNewton said on the show that Cousins will have to \"look over his shoulder\" during the season and that the coaches may turn on him after a few bad results.\n\n\"'We got a young team anyway yeah we can do all bad with a rookie,\" Newton said. \"But it's still gonna cost you it's going to cost you a $100 million so where do we draw the line and hold these upper man management people accountable.\"\n\nThough Newton hopes things work out well for both the QBs and the Falcons, his intuition says otherwise.\n\n\"I would love for everything to work out. It's I'm telling you it's not going to,\" he added.\n\nThe Falcons have clarified that Kirk Cousins will be their No. 1 QB. However, as Newton suggested, a few bad games or an injury could change the scenario.\n\nCam Newton on the difference between the Packers and Falcons\n\nThe top brass at the Falcons have hinted at employing a similar strategy that the Green Bay Packers employed in the 2020 NFL Draft by drafting QB Jordan Love, despite having Aaron Rodgers on their roster. Newton said about Cousins:\n\n\"He ain't even made it his town yet or his city yet.\"\n\nSince Love joined the Packers, Rodgers has already spent 15 seasons with the team.

The defense also likely remains vulnerable after it was neglected to an extent this offseason.\"\n\nUltimately, Gagnon is on board with Cousins leading Atlanta to the playoffs.\n\n\"Why we're buying: Cousins is apparently on track, and he was performing damn well before going down last season,\" wrote Gagnon. \"He should have plenty left and will be surrounded by Bijan Robinson, Kyle Pitts and Drake London in that offense.

Getting out to Washington, that's a trek,\" DeBoer said about recruiting Penix. \"I saw that talent in him. You can see glimpses and it was just a matter of stringing it together. ...He had a great offseason, a full offseason going into 2022 where that allowed him to just really be healthy, continue to define what he was, who he was as a person through the experiences and the he led.\n\nDeBoer also said that the team was bought into Penix last season, which led to the team reaching the national championship. \"They already bought into him, but when he spoke, they all listened,\" DeBoer said. \"He's just ready for this moment. I'm fired up about him getting this opportunity and people also realizing that he truly is that good.\n\nIt might take some time for NFL fans to see Penix in action as the Falcons will start four-time Pro Bowler Kirk Cousins this season and in 2025 since they just signed him to a four-year, $180 million. However, Penix is determined to be ready to go when the Falcons take the field this fall.\n\n\"I'm still going to prepare like I'm going to be on that field because you never know when your number is called, but you got to be ready,\" Penix told reporters, per the Falcons' official website. \"So, for me, I'm going to do whatever I can to be ready at Day 1.

He was great at putting the ball up for his bigger receivers at Washington and letting them go and make a play. In a McVay/Shanahan-type system, he would be working more in the middle of the field and using timing and anticipation to attack the defense.\n\nIt isn't saying that Penix can't work the middle of the field, he wasn't asked to due to the talent disparity between Washington's receiver corps and the defensive backs who had the unfortunate task of guarding them.\n\nThe Rams, where Zac Robinson and most of the staff came from, were experts at building an offense around the players' strengths, including the quarterback. Stafford found his partner in crime in Cooper Kupp during their Super Bowl run in 2021, who gave him a security blanket while he used his exceptional arm talent to make the throws necessary to win.\n\nPenix could find that same security blanket with either Kyle Pitts or Drake London on the outside, as well as sixth-rounder Casey Washington, who has become a \"sleeper\" in the eyes of some. Darnell Mooney and Rondale Moore could be used to complement those ball-winner types of receivers with their speed, especially Mooney and his route-running capabilities.\n\nIf Cousins doesn't have a 2024 that inspires confidence that he can win a Super Bowl in 2025, Atlanta has an avenue to get out of Cousins' contract and continue to build around Penix.\n\nIf the Falcons decide to build out their receiver room focusing outside the numbers, some receivers could be found in the 2025 offseason, via free agency and the draft.

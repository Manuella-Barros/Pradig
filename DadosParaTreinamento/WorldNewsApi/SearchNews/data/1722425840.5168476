The IOC said Pavel Kotov, the 50th-ranked men\u2019s player, and Anna Kalinskaya, ranked No. 17, were invited to join the eight-person Russian team for tennis in Paris. The players are competing as neutrals during the military invasion of Ukraine. The tournament is at Roland Garros from July 27-Aug. 4. The top two Russian men\u2019s players, No. 5 Daniil Medvedev and No. 6 Andrey Rublev, had neither confirmed nor declined their invitations on the International Olympic Committee\u2019s updated list on Friday. Rublev is reportedly not going to Paris for health reasons. Olympic invitations were accepted by Roman Safiullin and Ekaterina Alexandrova, the IOC said. Governing bodies of Olympic sports and the IOC are vetting individual athletes from Russia and its military ally Belarus to compete with neutral status in Paris. Athletes are being blocked if they expressed support for the Russian invasion or had ties to sports clubs linked to the military or state security services. ___ AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3J1c3NpYS10ZW5uaXMtcGFyaXMtb2x5bXBpY3MtMzM3ZDNmM2M4MDkxYWZlYzc4YTY1Nzc3YWI0MmFmYznSAQA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Russian tennis players Khachanov, Samsonova decline Paris Olympics invites.

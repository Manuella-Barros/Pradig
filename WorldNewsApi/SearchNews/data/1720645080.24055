The 67-year-old was seen walking through the Aegean island's town of Pedi on Wednesday afternoon, around 20 minutes after setting off from St Nickolas beach on a hiking trail. It's thought he may have encountered trouble during the hike. Dr Bailey Mosley released a poignant statement today, the first time she has spoken publicly since he vanished. She said: \"It has been three days since Michael left the beach to go for a walk. The longest and most unbearable days for myself and my children. \"The search is ongoing and our family are so incredibly grateful to the people of Symi, the Greek authorities and the British Consulate who are working tirelessly to help find Michael. We will not lose hope.\" The Mirror reports helicopters, drones, dogs and a number of emergency responders continue to scour the Dodecanese Island. Local police were informed about the disappearance of the British national, who was born in India, on the island on Wednesday. A search is being carried out by the Fire Brigade with the assistance of forces of the Hellenic Police, Civil Protection (a local and regional coordination agency), volunteers and a police dog, with drones also being used to find Dr Mosley. It is understood Mosley was last seen by CCTV at a grey-stoned house beside a harbour on the island. He may have walked along a steep uphill concrete road. At the end of the street, a small path leads into the rocky landscape which has little vegetation beyond thistles and dry grass. Eleftherios Papakaloudoukas, the mayor of Symi, has said he will continue the extensive search operation which has involved police, firefighters with drones, and divers. Speaking through a translator, the mayor of 22 years questioned how anyone could survive in the heat that topped 40C on the day the 'Trust Me, I'm A Doctor' presenter vanished. Individual firefighters were forced to split up and are covering vast expanses of steep rocky terrain on their own, as well as using a drone to search the area. One uniformed worker said there were 10 of them searching multiple summits because it was too dangerous for large crews to work during the summer months. Firefighter Stergos Giakoumakis said from near one of the peaks: \"Because it's not so easy to bring here 100 people, especially this period, because it\u2019s the most dangerous period. \"Everything is dry and it is too dangerous for firemen to search.\" A different team worked in the morning and there was a half-hour handover, he added. Firefighters having been using umbrellas to protect themselves as there is no shade or path near the top of the hill that sits between Pedi bay and Agia Marina, where they suspect Mosley may have walked. Dead grass juts out between rocks and large boulders, and the only living vegetation is a few small shrubs. On Friday, the mayor's daughter Mika Papakalodouka spoke about the rescue mission. She told the PA news agency that \"a lot of\" island residents had joined the search using their own boats to find the British national. The 20-year-old said: \"It is a small island, people talk. We're good people actually here. Everybody is looking for him. It's such a small island to get lost on. It's so weird for us. Everybody is worried and looking for him.\" Don't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter here.", "summary": "Dr Bailey Mosley spoke publicly for the first time since he vanished on Wednesday.", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/distraught-wife-missing-michael-mosley-32983697", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32989491.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screenshot-2024-06-08-at-50257-PM.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:20:02", "author": "Matt Clemenson,Rory Cassidy", "authors": ["Matt Clemenson", "Rory Cassidy"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.261}

{"id": 225000314, "title": "Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s Husband Is Representing Fox in a Lawsuit", "text": "Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s husband is currently representing Fox Corporation, the parent company of Fox News, in a defamation lawsuit, according to court records reviewed by Rolling Stone. The lawsuit relates to reports by one of Fox\u2019s local stations. Jesse Barrett is a trial lawyer and managing partner at SouthBank Legal. He heads the firm\u2019s Washington, D.C., office, which opened after Justice Barrett joined the high court. While the SouthBank Legal website says that Jesse Barrett \u201cfocuses on white-collar criminal defense, internal investigations, and complex commercial litigation,\u201d it notes, in a recent addition, that he has \u201crepresented a prominent media company in a lawsuit alleging defamation.\u201d That prominent media company is Fox Corporation, which owns the conservative cable news channel Fox News. Fox News regularly covers matters at the Supreme Court and will surely continue to do so as the high court nears the end of its term. It is set to issue rulings soon on a slate of controversial topics, such as abortion, guns, public corruption, and whether Donald Trump is entitled to immunity for life for acts he committed as president. Jesse Barrett\u2019s work for Fox Corporation highlights one of ethics experts\u2019 biggest complaints about the Supreme Court: Justices are not required to disclose their spouses\u2019 clients, so the public has no way to track who is paying money directly to their families. In her 2021 financial disclosure, Justice Barrett even redacted the name of her husband\u2019s firm, despite it being common knowledge that he works there. The lack of disclosure surrounding spouses\u2019 business dealings has been a repeated source of ethical concerns, particularly with Justice Clarence Thomas. His wife, Ginni Thomas, has reportedly received consulting payments from conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, and ran a nonprofit that was reportedly funded by billionaire Harlan Crow. Both Leo and Crow have been at the center of the ethics controversies plaguing the Supreme Court over the past year. It is no secret that Jesse Barrett represents corporate interests: His firm bio says his \u201cclients have included multiple Fortune 500 companies and corporate executives.\u201d The Southbank Legal website says that the firm has represented 26 Fortune 500 companies. The public has no way to identify Barrett\u2019s clients, for the most part. However, federal court records show that Barrett is serving as Fox Corporation\u2019s lead counsel in an ongoing defamation case. He had the case moved from Cook County, Illinois, to federal court late last month. Barrett and Fox Corporation did not respond to requests for comment. The defamation case was filed by Lavell Redmond, an Illinois man who was convicted of aggravated sexual assault as a minor and served 24 years in prison. Redmond was hired as a code enforcement officer by the mayor of Dolton in 2021, the original complaint says. He is suing Fox over a series of reports that scandalized his hiring \u2014 the first of which claimed he had been hired for \u201ca job in which he goes into Dolton homes and businesses to inspect them.\u201d The complaint says that \u201cas a code enforcement officer, Redmond was never responsible for entering village resident\u2019s homes to do his job, nor did he ever enter village resident\u2019s homes. Redmond only had the ability to observe home exteriors to write code violations.\u201d Redmond alleges that \u201cFOX 32\u2019s reporting directly led to Redmond being arrested and wrongfully charged with violating the reporting requirements of the sex offender registry,\u201d as well as his subsequent termination. The complaint alleges Redmond has suffered more than $1 million in damages based on Fox\u2019s reporting. His summons to Fox and its affiliates show he is seeking $3 million. Barrett and Fox have asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit. They argue Redmond filed his lawsuit too late, and that the Fox station did not defame him because the \u201cgist\u201d of its reporting was \u201cindisputably true, even if taking as true Redmond\u2019s allegations that certain immaterial details were inaccurate.\u201d While Southbank Legal does not publicly disclose Barrett\u2019s clients, its website indicates he has represented political and governmental clients, including: \u201ca former elected official in a federal investigation involving alleged bribery in return for political favors\u201d; \u201can executive of a military contractor in a federal investigation regarding alleged bribery in obtaining government contracts\u201d; and \u201ca senior government employee in connection with a grand jury investigation of an elected government official.\u201d", "summary": "Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s husband, Jesse Barrett, is defending Fox Corporation in a defamation case", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/amy-coney-barrett-husband-jesse-fox-1235028838/", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Amy-Coney-Barrett-husband-fox.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:00:00", "author": "Andrew Perez", "authors": ["Andrew Perez"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.116}

Now attention turns towards the group stage and Australia's tournament opener against Spain as the Boomers look to open their Paris Olympics campaign on a winning note.\n\nWhile the controversial non-selection of Matisse Thybulle seemed to only cast further doubt over Australia's chances of going deep into this year's Games, a successful stretch of lead-up games have Boomers fans dreaming of another potential podium finish.\n\nBrian Goorjian's team showed fight to push Team USA before scoring three-straight wins over Serbia, Puerto Rico and France.\n\nAhead of Saturday night's match-up against Spain, foxsports.com.au looks at some of the key talking points to come out of the warm-up games as the Boomers prepare for what has been described as a \"pool of death\".\n\nGETTING OUT OF THE GROUP STAGES IN ITSELF IS AN ACHIEVEMENT\n\nWhy don't we start there because if the Boomers aren't able to get a medal this time around, it won't necessarily be fair to brand Paris a failure in comparison to Tokyo.\n\nAfter all, just getting out of the group stage at this year's Games will be an achievement for Australia, who play Spain, Canada and Greece in Lille.\n\nBoomers great Andrew Bogut said on NBL Media's 'The Gold Standard' podcast before the warm-up games that a podium finish would be \"very hard\" to achieve given not only the strength of Australia's opponents but the do-or-die nature of Spain and Greece's preparation.\n\n\"I hate having two qualifiers because they're playing basketball right now. They're playing games that matter,\" Bogut said of the two nations, who will come into the Games out of qualifying tournaments where they had to earn their way into the group stage.\n\n\"They're not playing China. They're not playing USA in a friendly and Serbia in a friendly where there's going to be antics and hiding sets and all that kind of stuff. These qualifiers they're playing, they mean everything.\n\n\"So they're running everything, they're getting in tune and they flow into the Olympics with great form. On top of that, we have Canada.\"\n\nThat, of course, is not to say that the Boomers' warm-up games since leaving Melbourne weren't meaningful.\n\nFor starters, they helped Josh Giddey and Jock Landale build a pick-and-roll combination that could be one of Australia's greatest assets while Patty Mills is certainly better for the run after starting to find his shooting rhythm.\n\nThe fact the Boomers rallied late against the USA too, even if the Americans were without Kevin Durant and took the foot of the pedal a bit, has to also build confidence.\n\nEither way, Australia's warm-up results are definitely a reason to be optimistic, especially when you consider what the general mood seemed to be after Thybulle was left out of the squad.\n\nBut this is definitely a tricky group and if the Boomers make it out alive that in itself will be something worth celebrating.\n\nThose were Josh Giddey's numbers in Monday morning's win against France and it is the kind of statline Bulls fans should come to expect from the Australian in his first season with the franchise next season.\n\nGiddey said in his exit interview before being traded by the Thunder that he was going to have the ball in his hands \"a lot more\" with the Boomers, \"initiating the offence and setting guys up\".\n\n\"That's who I am as a player and to do that is exciting,\" he added.\n\nThe expectation is Giddey will be able to lean into his strengths more in Chicago too and, as a result, this year's Olympics could serve as a reminder of just how effective the 21-year-old can be in that more ball-dominant role.\n\nAlready in the warm-up games Giddey has not only flashed his obvious potential as a high-level playmaker but also his ability to get downhill and use his 6-foot-8 frame more to finish through contact in the paint.\n\nSo, Chicago fans, keep a keen eye on the Boomers and Giddey in this year's Games because what you see should be closer to the version of the Australian you get next season alongside Coby White in the backcourt.\n\nDYSON DANIELS EMERGES AS THE BOOMERS' X-FACTOR\n\nIn a similar vein to Giddey, this tournament will give the Hawks a sneak peek at Dyson Daniels, who Atlanta acquired as part of a trade that sent Dejounte Murray to New Orleans.\n\nAlthough in the case of Giddey, we already knew he was capable of excelling as the team's primary initiator after his first two seasons with Oklahoma City.\n\nDaniels, on the other hand, was still a question mark of sorts after his second season with the Pelicans.\n\nSure, his defence is definitely not a question as it was the only real reason he was getting minutes from coach Willie Green.\n\nBut even that was not always enough for Daniels, who consistently saw his playing time dwindle in the post-season after struggling to show much growth on the offensive end.\n\nThat looks to have changed, at least with the Boomers, as the 21-year-old has easily established himself as the team's most-improved player after also struggling for minutes in Australia's World Cup campaign last year.\n\nDaniels look comfortable and composed playing off the ball, whether he is cutting towards the rim as an option for Giddey or getting himself in position for a 3-point attempt and importantly, when he is taking those shots, the Hawks guard no longer looks hesitant.\n\nAt times Daniels still needs to be more assertive but that will come with time and the signs are still there that he is definitely on an upwards trajectory.\n\nThe move to Atlanta should allow Daniels to only continue to build his game in a more prominent role on a rebuilding team that will allow him to make mistakes.\n\nThere obviously isn't the same margin for error in the international game but Daniels hasn't given coach Brian Goorjian any reason to doubt he is ready for this moment.\n\nInstead, Daniels looks like Australia's X-factor ahead of the group stages -- quite the turnaround given he was an afterthought at last year's World Cup.\n\nHopefully the one we have seen in Australia's most recent warm-up games.\n\nThere was a genuine reason to be concerned about Mills' performances in the exhibition games against China, while he was equally out-of-sorts against Team USA, going 2-for-8 from the field while committing five turnovers.\n\nIt prompted questions as to whether Mills should come off the bench and while the veteran guard's starting spot looks locked in for now, Goorjian will still need to be mindful in how he manages Mills and Giddey's minutes sharing the backcourt given their shortcomings on the defensive end.\n\n\"My concern is just playing Patty and Giddey for long stretches together,\" Bogut said.\n\n\"I just don't think that worked at the World Cup and I don't think it's going to work long -term. I think Goorj's formula to figure that out has been, OK, if we don't start Patty on the bench or Josh on the bench, we can start them both.\n\n\"One of them is going to come out within the six, six-and-a-half-minute mark. Josh came out three minutes into the game, he was on the bench. Then Josh came in for Patty late in the first quarter.\n\n\"So, they've split the minute strategically that way. That works. I just like Patty's scoring punch, if it continues like this, I can live with it.\"\n\nIrrespective of that, the Boomers are a much better team with Mills firing given he is one of the few players in this squad capable of getting on a hot shooting streak.\n\nThe question is whether Australia can afford to ride the highs and lows.\n\n\"I think with Patty is we've seen with the national team, he's either really good or really bad,\" Bogut said.\n\n\"I think throughout this campaign, we probably just need more consistency from him. I don't think we need him to score 28 every game. That'd be nice. Like if you can do it every night, fantastic. We take it right.\n\n\"But I think it's those ups and downs that we've seen probably in the World Cup and in the lead-up games.\n\n\"... If he can consistently be a threat for us at 15 to 20 points a night, balanced in with everything else that we have, I think that's the perfect ratio for the Boomers.\"\n\nSpeaking of Mills, he is one of the few knockdown shooting options the Boomers have and, as now already covered, even he is at risk of going through a cold streak or two.\n\nThis Australian squad has plenty of length, athleticism and playmaking but compared to some of the other top contenders, the one thing they lack is a dependable outside shooting option.\n\nThe hope is that Jack McVeigh can become that guy.\n\nObviously there is more to his game than that but McVeigh, who went 6-for-8 from deep in the first warm-up game against China, could swing momentum off the bench with even just a few shots -- like he did with a long triple to close out the third quarter against France.\n\nThere is no doubt the Boomers are going to create plenty of open looks but that doesn't mean much if they don't have guys who can capitalise on that.\n\n\"I think probably Goorj's biggest concern is when we are playing and flowing well, who's going to knock down long range shots for us?\" Bogut said.\n\n\"I think McVeigh comes into that. He had nine points tonight (against the USA) ... didn't make a three, but was aggressive. You've got to look to him to knock down those threes for them.\n\n\"They're a different look with him on the floor because I think he brings something a little bit different to Nick Kay. Nick Kay's more of a be in the right place at the right time, space the floor, make the right decision, but it's more of a slower (look).\"\n\nWell, they won't be playing big minutes but even in limited roles both Ingles and Dellavedova could make a significant impact. They will just be doing it in different ways.\n\nIngles plays at a slower pace that doesn't suit the up-tempo style the Boomers will be largely looking to operate in, generating stops on the defensive end and immediately pushing the pace.\n\nBut if Goorjian feels like they are going too far in that direction and losing their way, he may call on Ingles to help calm things down with his veteran presence and smart passing game.\n\nOn the other hand, if Goorjian believes the Boomers need an energy boost on both ends that is where Dellavedova will be given a licence to let loose.\n\nWhile some fans questioned the decision to put a player like Dellavedova in the squad ahead of Matisse Thybulle, not every selection is about pure talent alone.\n\nSomeone like Thybulle wouldn't have as much value to the Boomers in a three or four-minute spurt, at least compared to Dellavedova, who can thrive in that sort of role.\n\nThat was the case in the loss to Team USA, where Dellavedova turned momentum in Australia's favour late with two rebounds, two assists and a steal in just four minutes.\n\n\"Delly is kind of a guy that you can put in for a couple of minutes at a time,\" Bogut said after that game.\n\n\"I think Joe is a little bit harder to put in for spot minutes because he's an older guy, plays at a slower pace, probably takes him a trip up and down to get in the flow and get warm.\n\n\"Whereas Delly just flies off the bench like a bat out of hell, right? And he's up and in within the first minute, first second, he's on the court. So that's why he's on this team.\"\n\nWIN vs FRANCE: Boomers' revelation in dramatic last-second win amid big injury blow\n\nWIN vs PUERTO RICO: Boomers dealt injury scare ahead of Olympics as Giddey stars\n\nWIN vs SERBIA: Patty thrills!

The team is definitely eyeing a gold-medal finish and looking to reassert its dominance in international hoops. It will be a tall task for the Red, White, and Blue, as other nations have grown in talent and aren't intimidated by them anymore.\n\nTake Josh Giddey, for example. The Australian guard recently responded confidently when asked about the challenge of beating the international powerhouse.\n\n\"If you look on paper, obviously they're the most talented team,\" Giddey said. \"It's not a secret to anybody. But I think the difference is these guys have been thrown, they've never played together, whereas a lot of these other countries have had a core that's been together for years.\"\n\nThe Americans' struggles\n\nTalent for talent, no other country can match up well against Team USA, for sure. However, as Giddey pointed out, a possible weakness for the Red, White, and Blue is that the players have had little time to develop chemistry and learn to play with one another on the court.\n\nTheir two most recent performances in the USA Basketball Showcase should serve as a warning for the squad as it prepares for the Olympics. The U.S. won by just one point against South Sudan, arguably the least-ranked team participating in the Paris Games. Then, in the following contest, it also barely got by Germany.\n\nThere was a time when it was unheard of for Team USA not to clobber its foes. But the seasons have changed, and winning against the star-studded unit isn't the expected outcome anymore.\n\nAustralia's golden aspirations\n\nThe Boomers are coming off their best performance in an Olympic tournament three years ago. They secured an international medal for the first time, bringing home the bronze.\n\nAustralia has continued to look formidable this year, even nearly defeating Team USA in an exhibition game earlier this month. The result led to Devin Booker urging his teammates to clean things up quickly if they want to clinch the gold in Paris.\n\nA furious rally from the Aussies in the fourth quarter helped erase a 24-point deficit, although the Americans were able to eke out the 98-92 victory. Giddey finished that contest with 17 points, eight rebounds, and seven assists.\n\nA rematch could be waiting in Paris, although the Boomers will have their hands full in the preliminary round. They are grouped with Canada, Greece, and Spain, so an early elimination before the knockout stage is a strong possibility for Giddey and the company.\n\nRelated: Nick Wright says LeBron James is the best player on Team USA: \"I think his teammates think it\"", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "orel_dizon@postandcourier.com", "name": "Orel Dizon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Giddey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Giddey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_basketball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national basketball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Australian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showtime_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Showtime (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Sudan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Sudan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_men's_national_basketball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia men's national basketball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_at_the_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football at the Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Scenario", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Scenario", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757856", "eventUri": "eng-9757856", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Schedule, start times, roster for Australia at Paris Olympics", "body": "The Australian Boomers are once again participating at the men's basketball tournament in Paris, as they look to repeat their performance from Tokyo, which saw them end their long medal drought.\n\nVeterans of that squad Patty Mills and Joe Ingles are there, and are joined by new talent in Josh Giddey and Dyson Daniels, but they face a very difficult task in repeating their exploits, having been handed a difficult group.\n\nThe Boomers have been handed a tough draw in Group A of the Olympics, being pitted against Spain, Canada and Greece.\n\nWhilst Spain's squad may lack the star power it has possessed in previous years, they are still a formidable opponent who have got the better of the Boomers in past Olympics campaigns.\n\nCanada is one of the strongest and best all-round teams at the tournament, being led by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jamal Murray, but also having the likes of RJ Barrett and Dillon Brooks in the team.\n\nGreece then has one of the best players in the world in Giannis Antetokounmpo, with the Boomers needing to be at their best to guard the superstar.\n\nThe Boomers first game of the Olympics will take place on on July 27 against Spain, who famously defeated them in the 2016 bronze medal match.\n\nThey then face Canada on July 30 in what could be their toughest match of the group,\n\nTheir third and final match of the group stage will be against Greece, where the Boomers will hope to be in a strong position to qualify from the group and not be relying on other results to secure their passage to the quarter-finals.\n\nThe gold medal match for the tournament is taking place on 10th August.\n\nMatisse Thybulle has been a shock omission from the final 12-man Boomers roster for the men's basketball competition at the Paris Olympics.\n\nThe 27-year-old, who was part of the side that won the bronze medal in Tokyo, was expected to be named due to his defensive ability and NBA experience, however, coach Brian Goorjian decided to cut him and other in-form players including Chris Goulding and Xavier Cooks.\n\nDespite Thybulle not being selected, the Boomers' Olympic roster contains a strong collection of NBA talent, from veterans Patty Mills and Joe Ingles to young rising stars such as Dyson Daniels and Josh Giddey.\n\nJack McVeigh and Will Magnay will both fly the flag for the NBL - and the Tasmania JackJumpers - at the Games, as well as their Grand Final opponent in the return of Boomers icon Matthew Dellavedova.", "source": {"uri":

After winning a historic bronze medal three years ago in Tokyo - \"rose gold\" even, the first in the history of Australia's men's program - a generational shift began.\n\nAs a golden era of Australian basketballers enter the twilight of their career, it has fallen to Goorjian and his assistants to usher in a new cohort of young stars. The difficulties of that task became clear at last year's World Cup, when Australia failed to progress through the second round.\n\nConcerns ahead of Paris were compounded by Goorjian's squad selections. The omission of Matisse Thybulle, an elite-level defender in the NBA who had a breakout performance in Tokyo, prompted much head-scratching. Thybulle had been considered a likely starter in Paris, and certainly a regular member of the rotation - but suddenly he was not even in the 12-man squad. Also not on the plane was Chris Goulding, one of the best three-point shooters in Boomers history.\n\nIn their place, 33-year-old veteran Matthew Dellavedova, who had been absent from the World Cup side, made a return to the national team. Another mainstay of the Boomers over the past decade, Joe Ingles, also retained his spot. Together with talisman Patty Mills, Ingles will be featuring in his fifth Olympics - a remarkable achievement. Cumulatively it is a line-up of experience - all but two members of the squad have played in the NBA, a team record (and another, Jack McVeigh, has just signed with the Houston Rockets). But does it have the vitality to return to the medal matches?\n\nThose fears are in part the result of an exceedingly difficult group stage draw for the Boomers. Australia's campaign will begin on Saturday against Spain, a team that has historically had the Boomers' number. The Spaniards beat Australia by just one point in the bronze medal match at Rio 2016, and bested the Boomers in double overtime in a World Cup semi-final three years later. Spain is not the team they once were; like Australia, they are undergoing a generational shift. But the clash in Lille will still prove a daunting opening assignment.\n\nThe going gets even tougher from there. On Tuesday, the Boomers will meet Canada - a team full of NBA talent, including Oklahoma point guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Denver star Jamal Murray. The pool will then conclude three days later with a match-up against Greece, led by two-time NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo. The Boomers need to finish in the top two to guarantee progress to the quarter-finals, although the two best third-placed teams also go through.\n\nBut against the pessimism of the selection debate and a tough group has been the hard evidence of the Boomers' warm-up games. Australia only narrowly lost to Olympic champions the United States in a friendly in Abu Dhabi, before dispatching Serbia and Puerto Rico. In their final pre-Olympic work-out, on Sunday, the Boomers overcame hosts France thanks to a clutch set-piece bucket with seconds on the clock.\n\nVeteran Mills and new Chicago Bulls signing Josh Giddey have provided impressive attacking spark in recent games, as has 21-year-old Dyson Daniels. And the Boomers' defensive solidity has been on display in all four matches, most notably in containing 2023 NBA No 1 draft pick Victor Wembanyama on Sunday.\n\nAfter lacking size in the paint at last year's World Cup, strong performances from Will Magnay, Jock Landale and Duop Reath will have reassured Goorjian. And McVeigh, who led the Tasmanian JackJumpers to their first-ever National Basketball League title this year, showed his game-winning potential with a clutch shot on the third-quarter buzzer against France. Even a dislocated finger for creative dynamo Dante Exum looks unlikely to keep him off the court for too long.\n\nAll of which means the Boomers enter their opening clash with Spain buoyed by recent form, even if some question marks linger. Having finally won an Olympic medal in Tokyo, the team will be hoping to go even better in Paris. Another medal would be a fitting send off for the veterans and a statement of intent from this team's young new core.\n\n\"The talent that we have in Australian basketball is, in my opinion, as good as it's ever been,\" Giddey insisted on Tuesday. \"This is probably the realest chance we've ever had to win a gold medal in Australian basketball, so we've got the pieces to do it.\"", "source":

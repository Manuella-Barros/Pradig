Morgan Stanley boosted its dividend to 92.5 cents a share from 85 cents, according to a filing. The announcements came after the banks cleared the Fed's stress test earlier this week, which determines how much capital they need to set aside before they can return money to shareholders. Goldman Sachs' (GS.N)New Tab, opens new tab dividend will climb to $3 per share, compared with $2.75 earlier. How well a bank performs on the stress tests dictates the size of its stress capital buffer (SCB) - an extra cushion of capital the Fed requires banks to hold to weather a hypothetical economic downturn. Goldman said it will engage with its regulator to better understand why its SCB jumped. \"This increase does not seem to reflect the strategic evolution of our business and the continuous progress we\u2019ve made to reduce our stress loss intensity,\" CEO David Solomon said in a statement. Wells Fargo's (WFC.N)New Tab, opens new tab dividend will rise to 40 cents. This year, 31 big banks were tested, compared with 23 last year.

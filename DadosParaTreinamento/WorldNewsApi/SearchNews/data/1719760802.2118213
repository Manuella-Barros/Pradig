In a no-holds-bare press statement, Gombe opined that his interactions with the Hon. Minister of Sports Development so far had proven that Hon. Adams\u2019 accusations of the minister allegedly being insincere and lacking transparency in his dealings on issues in the ministry was valid. Gombe said, \u201cLet me take this opportunity to add my voice to the recent statement credited to the Chairman of House Committee on Sports, Hon. Ekene Adams, about his feelings and impressions on how the Minister of Sports, Hon. Enoh, is managing our sports,\u201d Gombe said. He continued, \u201cI don\u2019t have details of other things Ekene said but from what I know, Senator Enoh is not sincere. I repeat, he is not a sincere person. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t appreciate people making their contributions to the development of sports in Nigeria. The minister came at a time when the sports ministry was down and in a big mess; unfortunately, he was not ready for that. He made so many consultations but his consultations were one-sided. Before someone says because he didn\u2019t listen to Gara Gombe as a leader, you don\u2019t have to wait for people to tell you about how good or bad others are until you personally verify. \u201cWhen Senator Enoh became minister, I don\u2019t know Him. Someone who knows him from the same state, one of our respected coaches, James Peters, took me and Dr. Alex Mana to visit him and he told the minister that he brought some friends who can help offer advise. Some people around him were uncomfortable to see us. \u201cThey kept us for two hours so much that I was almost leaving. Immediately, we were called back and spoke with him. After about 15 minutes, the minister asked me \u2018How do you know about all these, are you part of the sports ministry? I told him no, I\u2019m not part of the ministry, but I have been around sports for about 25 years. He congratulated me and said again \u2018Is there money in sports, I said yes, there\u2019s money, he asked again, \u2018Where is it? I said there is money in sports, first, the right thing has to be done. \u201cHe demanded that I put everything I had discussed with him in writing and I did. My recommendation to him was to constitute a pool of 43-man advisory committee comprising media, technical people, administrators, whose names I also listed and put in the document not that I mentioned it only. So that anything you want, you can pick from the pool. I also raised in that document how to manage sports federations, fight corruption, sanitise the federations to be accountable and sustainable. I also referred to him documents from previous reports of committees set up to change the fortunes of Nigerian sports. \u201cAll these are in the document I submitted to Senator John Enoh but he ignored it, I will soon make that document public. It is very clear the man is not sincere and transparent.\u201d Gombe said further; \u201cCoincidentally, I met Hon. Enoh again during Nigeria vs Ethiopia women national team match at the National Stadium in Abuja. I told the minister, \u2018you gave me an assignment and not even an acknowledgement letter was received? \u201cHe replied that he didn\u2019t receive it, I informed him the document was delivered through his staff, Mr. Brenden his SA, he said I should find out from Mr. Brenden, I said no, Mr. Brenden should call me if he finds it. \u201cOver four months ago till date, I have observed so many mistakes going on in the industry. That alone shows insincerity of a leader. \u201cOn the Nigerian Premier Football League (NPFL), Hon. Gbenga Elegbeleye and GTI signed one of the most dubious contracts against Nigerians national interest, I raised an alarm. \u201cMy partners gave them a Concept Note, which is preparatory to a full proposal, while we are waiting for them to call for a meeting to discuss the note and prepare how the $11 million dollars would be raised fully after we must have signed the agreement. \u201cThey ran away and rush within two days to sign the contract with StarTimes which they have been discussing for six months. It was our entry and Concept Note that triggered them to sign the dubious contract of $800.000 dollars which is against national interest. \u201cTill today, we have not seen the $800.000 dollars and there\u2019s no story about it and the minister Knows. People are asking why was the process not transparent to give other Nigerians the previlage to bid for the sponsorship of the league? \u201cI\u2019m going to talk at the appropriate time about GTI on how they started missleading Nigerians with NFF funds, suddenly, they have turned marketers, sponsors or consultants. They are in the capital market; then, what are they doing in sports.? They\u2019re only misleading people, how much have they raised? \u201cThey are in Federations Cup now to rebrand it, they\u2019re in NFF to raise money for the Federation\u2019s Cup and the minister is also signing contract with them to rebrand Federations Cup to President\u2019s Cup. Something is wrong somewhere which we may have to uproot. Again, when StarTimes, GTI, NPFL signed the so-called sponsorship deal with NFF, I raised alarm, saying $800.000 is not good for Nigeria; I informed them that I have a partner in London, he\u2019s a Nigerian that has the capability of raising $11million a year. \u201cLater, the minister called me I could not pick, he sent a WhatsApp message and later called me back and asked is that Alhaji Gombe?, I said yes, he said he has to speak with me, saying that someone sent a message that I have someone who can raise $11million for the league, I said yes. He said when am I coming to Abuja that he would like to see me. I told him I would be in Abuja tomorrow. There was no flight from Gombe, I had to travel by road from Gombe to Abuja. \u201cThe following day, I started calling Minister John Enoh from Nyanya area of Abuja because I wanted to see hm quickly and travel back to Gombe. I called him severally, he didn\u2019t pick, later, he called back and said he was in a meeting. He asked whether I am in town, I said yes, he said tomorrow he is going to call me and inform me when we would talk. \u201cDo you know that I spent four days in Abuja, this man didn\u2019t call me? I sent him a message, he didn\u2019t reply, I called him severally after, he didn\u2019t oblige. I have to return to Gombe. \u201cSo everything Hon. Ekene said about Minister Enoh\u2019s insincerity is true. there\u2019s no two ways about it. Ask anybody or make your research, if you would find anywhere Senator Enoh has made any statement about corruption, never, and the sports industry is one of the most corrupt sectors in Nigeria. I mean what I am saying,\u201d he alleged. Gombe further alleged, \u201cMost of our past sports ministers are supposed to be in Jail now. Enoh have started his own and everything Ekene said is correct, he is not transparent.\u201d The statement further reads. \u201cLook at the AthIetics Federation of Nigeria (AFN); there was an audit report about the monumental corruption in AFN. In basketball, in boxing even in the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), what has the Minister of Sports done? He alledged that any Minister of Sports you see fraternizing with the NFF, just know that such minister is corrupt. \u201cWhen Senator Enoh arrived for the job, the first thing NFF officials did was put him in a plane and flew him straight to Cairo that we should bid for AFCON and we failed woefully. When one of the past ministers resumed, the same thing happened, they took him to Zurich that we should go bid for U-17 FIFA World Cup. \u201cThe type of friendliness existing between Enoh and NFF shows something is fishy and the bubble will soon burst. See what happened at the Africa Games where they claimed they paid this and that allowances to athletes. The athletes have not actually been paid. The last time I checked, even our 100mh champion, Tobi Amusan, and others are yet to be paid ticket refunds. \u201cEverything the minister said he would do when he came, nothing has been done, just making noise. So, he is not transparent, he is not sincere; that is why I have no respect for him. \u201cFor four days, he kept me in Abuja, saying he wanted to see me, I didn\u2019t ask to see him. Initially, I didn\u2019t want to see Enoh. When you start telling the ministers the truth, they run away from you. Therefore, Hon. Ekene Adams is 100% correct.\u201d", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"508\" height=\"469\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/759BE82C-48AF-4CDC-B92E-1D6531A5C636.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/759BE82C-48AF-4CDC-B92E-1D6531A5C636.jpeg 508w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/759BE82C-48AF-4CDC-B92E-1D6531A5C636-300x277.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px\" /></div>Alhaji Ahmed Shuaibu Gara Gombe, one of Nigeria&#8217;s outspoken sports advocates, has added his voice to the lingering issues of alleged insincerity and lack of transparency which the chairman House of Representatives Committee on Sports, Ekene Adams, levelled against the Minister of Sports Development, Senator John Owan Enoh.

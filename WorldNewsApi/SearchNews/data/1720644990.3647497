The rapper (real name Curtis Jackson) visited Washington, D.C., with civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump for what Crump characterized as discussions about \u201cthe Black wealth agenda, the widening of the wealth gap, and corporate America\u2019s marginalization of Black-owned companies.\u201d I suspect the visit was more transactional: Jackson, Mr. \u201cGet Rich or Die Tryin\u2019,\u201d invests in a liquor brand and media ventures, Crump is on his legal team, and the two wanted to endear themselves to members of Congress (as evidenced by a veiled reference to his legal battle with liquor company Beam Suntory in a post on X). But whatever their purpose, some of the comments Jackson made on the occasion left a bad taste in folks\u2019 mouths. Jackson \u2014 who endorsed Donald Trump in 2020 and has used his social media accounts to push conservative talking points this election cycle \u2014 told the press that Black men are starting to identify with Trump and that criminality is a main reason. \u201cBecause they got RICO charges,\u201d Jackson said, referring to Black men, on the one hand, and to the racketeering charges that Trump and his co-defendants are facing in Georgia on the other (he has pleaded not guilty). He also made sure to stop for smiling photos with lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Reps. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Troy Carter, D-La., Steve Scalise, R-La., and Lauren Boebert, R-Colo. (For the record, that photo was taken in the U.S. Capitol, not at the White House.) Jackson\u2019s appearance on Capitol Hill, his comments about Black men\u2019s supposed criminality and his photos with Johnson and Boebert (both of whom sought to overturn the 2020 election while hyping false allegations of voter fraud) earned eye rolls from Black commentators online. See here, here, here, here and here. The rapper\u2019s reaction to the response was fairly juvenile, which just underscores why people were dismayed at the spectacle to begin with: It reeked of unseriousness at a time when we should expect better from people who claim to advocate on our behalf. And look, none of us should be surprised when Jackson, or any rapper (a class of artists that tends to glorify misogyny and shrewd capitalism), identifies with Trump or the MAGA movement. But the critiques of Jackson\u2019s visit also reflect a broader problem that afflicts D.C. elites these days \u2014 lawmakers, journalists and seemingly everyone in between. Many of these people seem obsessed with rappers, specifically with positioning them as avatars for Black voters. This is easily among the most ridiculous phenomena I\u2019ve witnessed this election cycle. Whether it\u2019s Trump and his supporters thinking endorsements from rappers will translate to a spike in Black support, or the media turning to rappers (especially male rappers) as though they represent the median, purportedly disaffected Black voter, I\u2019m noticing a failure \u2014 or refusal \u2014 to differentiate between Black people who entertain other Black people and Black people who actually represent or influence other Black people. Rhythmic head nods are not endorsements. Just because some Black people enjoy an artist\u2019s music or creativity doesn\u2019t mean we give a damn about their political opinions. And that certainly doesn\u2019t mean they have the standing to speak as our representatives in Washington or in discussions with the media. (Just last month, I wrote about USA Today and Suffolk University\u2019s polling data that shows most people don\u2019t rely on celebrity endorsements to decide their vote.) So when you see people tapping rappers as Black spokespeople, ask yourself: Whose agenda are they really serving? Are there more reputable sources elsewhere, people who are actually talking with Black voters and who represent communities of color? Or could it be an effort to manufacture the appearance of Black support for Trump or some other viewpoint? In the meantime, let\u2019s hope D.C. insiders do us all a favor and limit their obsession with rappers to Spotify playlists.", "summary": "Rapper 50 Cent\u2019s appearance on Capitol Hill on Wednesday was a cringe-inducing spectacle.", "url": "https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/50-cent-capitol-hill-congress-rcna156131", "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-06/240607-50-cent-washington-dc-wm-239p-a1956d.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:50:47", "author": "Ja'han Jones", "authors": ["Ja'han Jones"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.351}

The special one-off match at the the Chicago Cubs' historic home beat the previous mark of 34,130, set by Seattle Reign in the final regular-season home game for U.S. women's national team legend Megan Rapinoe in October 2023. It was the first time in 80 years that a professional women's sporting event was held at Wrigley Field. \"On behalf of the Red Stars, I would like to thank all fans and every person who helped us welcome this record-breaking crowd to Wrigley Field,\" Chicago Red Stars president Karen Leetzow said. \"Chicago has truly shown the country what's possible when we level the playing field with a centrally located stadium that is easy to access, and give these world-class athletes the support they deserve. Our club could not be prouder to call Chicago home tonight. \"This historic match is not just momentous for the Red Stars, but for the NWSL and the future of women's professional soccer. Tonight, Chicago proved once again that fans are hungry to witness the intense level of competition that exists on the pitch every week in the NWSL and around the world.\" The Red Stars, who regularly play their home games at SeatGeek Stadium in Bridgeview, Illinois, lost Saturday's game 2-1 to Bay FC, a first-year expansion team. The team has struggled to attract fans in Bridgeview, seeing the league's lowest average attendance in 2023 at 4,848.", "summary": "The Chicago Red Stars set a single-game NWSL attendance record with an announced crowd of 35,038 fans watching the team's matchup with Bay FC at Wrigley Field on Saturday.", "url": "https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/40308948/chicago-red-stars-nwsl-attendance-record-wrigley-field", "image": "https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2024/0609/r1343517_1296x729_16-9.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:27:36", "author": "ESPN", "authors": ["ESPN"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.291}

Voting on the nomination will likely begin on Aug. 1, however, if there are at least two candidates who qualify, voting will likely begin on Aug. 3.\n\nA majority of the delegates are needed to secure the nomination in the first round of voting during the virtual roll call. If no candidate gains the majority in the first round, the top two candidates will move on to the second round of voting until a candidate wins the majority.\n\nThere will still be a ceremonial roll call during the Democratic National Convention.\n\nDelegates have been released from earlier pledges to vote for Biden after he exited the race and can vote for whomever they would like. And at least one delegate cautioned that a virtual roll call will not become the norm for the party conventions in the future.\n\nBishop Leah Daughtry, co-chair of the rules committee, presided over the meeting along with Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, co-chair of the rule committee and a potential running mate for Harris. Walz thanked attendees for their participation \"as we create a successful convention process that brings our country and our party together,\" as did Jaime Harrison, the chairman of the DNC.\n\n\"Your work here proves that our democracy is strong and our faith in our democracy is even stronger. Our process is reflective of that faith, and we are all working hard to execute this nomination with transparency, with fairness, and efficiency,\" said Harrison.\n\nHarrison also pushed back indirectly against GOP claims that the party had \"rigged\" the nomination for Harris. \"Many of you have probably seen the reporting that Vice President Harris has received expressed support from the majority of pledged delegates, and might wonder what that means for this process,\" he said. \"Delegates are free to support who they choose, and we are glad that they are engaging in this important moment in history. As a party, we have an obligation to design and implement a fair nomination process for delegates to officially express their preferences through a vote, resulting in, eventually, an official nominee of the Democratic Party who will go on to the top ballot in November.\"\n\n\"We understand that this is an unprecedented situation, but I'm confident that we will find a path forward together,\" added Minyon Moore, DNCC chair.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nWhen Biden was still the presumptive nominee, the DNC decided to hold the virtual vote to comply with Ohio's Secretary of State's warning that the state ballot certification deadline was on Aug. 7 ahead of the Chicago convention, when Biden would have officially accepted the nomination. However, the state legislature later amended the law extending the deadline. Democrats are still pushing forth with the virtual roll call to avoid any legal pitfalls, which party leaders repeatedly mentioned during the rules committee meeting.\n\n\"Republicans will use this moment to do what they do, to sue, to try to bar us from the ballot or to try to disqualify our voters and to suggest that somehow the party's nominating process was improper,\" said DNC council Pat Moore. \"This threat is quite real. The RNC and affiliated dark money groups like Heritage Action have been publicly threatening legal action for weeks. And just on Monday, Speaker Mike Johnson joined their chorus, claiming we would face, quote, legal hurdles to and certain litigation about our ballot access in the state. Make no mistake, we have strong legal arguments in response to any such claims, and we're prepared to make them.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mabinty_quarshie@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Mabinty Quarshie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Harrison", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaime Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leah_D._Daughtry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leah D.

governors, as well as leading labor unions and activist organizations have since backed her to replace him.\n\nAn Associated Press survey of delegates to the convention also revealed that the vice president has the support of well more than the 1,976 delegates she'll need to win on a first ballot.\n\nThat doesn't automatically make her the nominee, though, and the party is pushing ahead with

Harris' team is planning to finish the vetting of the VP field and expects her to pick her running mate by that date, according to a source familiar with the plans.\n\nThe DNC's newly adopted rules, the result of a long process that preceded President Biden's departure from the race, also establish a window for any Democrat to qualify and appear on the roll call ballot.\n\nHarris' presidential campaign, and anyone seeking to challenge her, will need to file paperwork with the DNC and obtain digital signatures from at least 300 delegates, with no more than 50 from a single state, by July 30 at 6 p.m. ET.\n\nThat a challenger will meet that threshold to contest Harris' nomination is unlikely at this point. No notable Democrats who could challenge her have stepped forward; instead, the most likely figures quickly backed Harris. And in the days since Mr. Biden dropped out and endorsed her, Harris has won endorsements from well over 3,000 of the 4,000 pledged delegates. The number of delegate votes she would need to secure the nomination is 1,976.\n\n\"Many of you have probably seen the reporting that Vice President Harris has received expressed support from the majority of pledged delegates, and might wonder what that means for this process,\" said DNC Chair Jamie Harrison. \"Delegates are free to support who they choose, and we are glad that they are engaging in this important moment in history. As a party, we have an obligation to design and implement a fair nomination process for delegates to officially express their preferences.\"\n\nThe committee's rules established that if it's just Harris who qualifies, the party would hold a roll call vote virtually as soon as Aug. 1, and not in person at its mid-August convention in Chicago.\n\nIf Harris does have a qualified challenger, Democratic Convention Chair Minyon Moore said the party would delay the roll call vote until Aug. 3, in order to allow candidates to make their case to delegates.\n\nIn May, the DNC made a push for a virtual process because of Ohio's Aug. 7 deadline for major parties to submit the names of their certified candidates for the November ballot.\n\nWhile Ohio Republicans passed a law that pushed that deadline to Sept. 1, because it does not go into effect until Sept. 1, DNC officials cited potential litigation from Republican groups as a reason to go ahead with the early virtual roll call vote.\n\n\"If we take chances with state processes and deadlines, Republican groups could make the argument to challenge Democratic votes on the post-election side, arguing that our nominee should never have been on the ballot in the first place,\" said DNC outside counsel Pat Moore. \"We should not and must not give them that opportunity.\"\n\nMoore and other officials added that the nominee must have a running mate by Aug. 7, because Ohio requires both names to be certified by then.\n\n\"Failure to certify both nominees in advance of each state's ballot access deadline opens us up to very real political and litigation risks,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

There, party officials agreed to move to a virtual nomination ahead of the national convention that's set to begin Aug. 19 in Chicago.\n\nSo far, only Harris has publicly declared her intention of running for president in the wake of President Joe Biden's announcement on Sunday that he would not would not seek a second term, despite cruising through the Democratic primaries earlier this year. Harris has already accumulated more than enough delegate support to win the nomination since Biden, who is 81, quit the race. But they must still vote for it to count.\n\nUnder the new DNC rules, any presidential candidate has from Thursday until Sunday at 6 p.m. ET to file a declaration to compete in the virtual nomination process. Anyone interested needs to collect 300 delegate signatures to qualify, with no more than 50 coming from one state. Voting will begin on or around Aug. 3 if anyone besides Harris meets the specifications. It will start on Aug. 1 if only one person qualifies.\n\nA virtual roll call had long been planned for Democrats due to a prolonged dispute in Ohio and to avoid controversy over 2024 ballot deadlines in other states.\n\nDemocrats also clarified at Wednesday's meeting that only the party's presidential pick can nominate a vice presidential candidate. That decision means Harris is likely to make her selection before August 7, which is in line with an old deadline in Ohio for presidential candidates to get their names on the Election Day ballot.\n\nIt's a schedule that gives Harris a little more than two weeks to vet and select a running mate from a group that includes at least seven prominent party figures, though that list is likely even larger.\n\nA ceremonial vote for both the Democratic presidential and vice presidential nominees will also take place at the Chicago convention, which runs through Aug. 22.\n\nBut the real work is set to take place virtually starting next week as Democrats await word on whether anyone raises their hand before the end of this weekend to challenge Harris. So far, any likely opponents have said they will not run.\n\nThe signature threshold to participate in a contested nomination process has been in place since at least 1996, Leah Daughtry, the convention rules committee co-chair, said. That is equal to about 6% of the convention's delegates.\n\nThe all-important number to win the nomination on the first ballot is 1,976, when only pledged delegates can vote. If voting goes to a second round, a candidate would need 2,351 votes to win, because automatic delegates would be eligible to vote. That group includes Democratic members of Congress, party chairs and governors who were formerly referred to as superdelegates.\n\nDuring Wednesday's meeting, Democrats' outside counsel said that the DNC's \"good conscience\" rule allows delegates who were pledged to Biden to switch their votes to another candidate.\n\nParty officials and elected delegates argued at the meeting that the virtual roll call is needed to avoid litigation from Republicans who could try to keep the Democratic nominee off the ballot in Ohio and elsewhere.\n\nBefore the state changed its law, Ohio had a deadline of Aug. 7 for ballot access. The secretary of state's office directed election officers to implement the change immediately -- but the law does not go into effect until Aug. 31, and Democrats say that's a legal risk they can not afford to take.\n\nDemocrats had planned to approve the move to a virtual nomination at a meeting earlier in the month. But they briefly punted in the aftermath of Biden's rocky debate performance against Republican Donald Trump, which led to blowback about the incumbent's candidacy from a raft of Democratic donors, lawmakers and like-minded celebrities.\n\nRepublicans have attacked the party's plans to hold an electronic voting process and change their nominee after primary elections were held. Democrats challenged claims the process was undemocratic on Wednesday by noting the party does not take secret votes. Candidates will be updated throughout the process on voting progress and will be able to request and receive a full vote tally when it is over.\n\nThe party will also engage in a phone-based campaign to make sure delegates have access to voting and are aware of the rules.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_nominating_convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential nominating convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leah_D._Daughtry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leah D.

But, if Harris is the only candidate, voting would begin Aug. 1. Delegates voting \"uncommitted,\" or for another candidate who hasn\u00b4t qualified under the rules, will have their choices converted simply to \"present.\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris waves as she is introduced during the Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc.'s Grand Boul\u00e9, Wednesday, July 24, 2024, in Indianapolis. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings)\n\nDelegates will receive ballots via secure email. The process will be designed not only to formally nominate Harris, but to eventually do the same for her vice presidential selection prior to Aug. 7 - giving her a tight window to pick a running mate.\n\nWho she might choose is unclear. Early favorites include Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, but potentially half a dozen other candidates are being considered.\n\nBiden dropped out of the race last weekend and endorsed Harris, and hundreds of Democratic members of Congress and governors, as well as leading labor unions and activist organizations have since backed her to replace him. An Associated Press survey of delegates to the convention also revealed that the vice president has the support of well more than the 1,976 delegates she\u00b4ll need to win on a first ballot.\n\nThat doesn't automatically make her the nominee, though, and the party is pushing ahead with the virtual voting process because it says it can\u00b4t wait until the convention starts to formally choose its nominee. It blames a deadline to appear on the Ohio ballot stating that candidates must be selected by Aug. 7.\n\nOhio state lawmakers there have since changed that, but the modification doesn\u00b4t take effect until Sept. 1 - and DNC attorneys warn that waiting until after the initial deadline to determine a presidential nominee could prompt legal challenges.\n\n\"Our party remains steadfast to an open, fair and transparent nominating process,\" said Minyon Moore, chair of the Democratic convention. \"We will do this right.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Democratic National Committee will move forward with a virtual nomination vote for its presidential candidate as soon as Aug. 1, after its Rules Committee approved the process on Wednesday.\n\nThe DNC has been moving forward with plans to hold a virtual nomination roll call since well before President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to take his place.\n\nThe pre-convention vote is necessary to avoid potential legal pitfalls that could arise if the party waits to formally nominate its candidate at its convention in late August, since some states' deadlines to place candidates on their ballots fall before or during that week.\n\nDNC Chair Jaime Harrison said at the beginning of the Rules Committee's meeting that the party is striving to \"execute this nomination with transparency, with fairness and efficiency.\"\n\n\"Many of you have probably seen the reporting that Vice President Harris has received the expressed support from the majority of pledged delegates and might wonder what that means for this process,\" Harrison said.\n\n\"Delegates are free to support who they choose and we are glad that they are engaging in this important moment in history,\" Harrison said. \"As a party we have an obligation to design and implement a fair nomination process for delegates to officially express their preferences through a vote resulting in eventually an official nominee of the Democratic Party who will go on to the top ballot in November.\"\n\nUnder the process adopted during the panel's meeting, Harris as well as other presidential hopefuls have until 6 p.m. EDT Saturday to register their intent to seek the nomination with the DNC Convention secretary.\n\nCandidates then have until 6 p.m. Tuesday to meet the requirements that include collecting at least 300 signatures from DNC delegates with a maximum of 50 of those people representing any one state.\n\nDNC Rules Committee Co-Chair Leah D. Daughtry said during the live-streamed meeting that if only one presidential candidate qualifies, she expects the virtual roll call would take place Aug. 1.\n\nIf more than one candidate qualifies, Daughtry anticipates the virtual roll call would take place on or around Aug. 3.\n\nDemocrats will still hold a ceremonial roll call of the states from the floor of the United Center in Chicago during their convention week, but have argued for months they must certify their nominee beforehand.\n\nMinyon Moore, chair of the 2024 Democratic National Convention, said the party has \"the guideposts and the expertise in place to ensure that we will do this right and in a manner that is consistent with our values as Democrats.\"\n\n\"We understand that this is an unprecedented situation but I'm confident that we will find a path forward together,\" Moore said.\n\nDNC outside counsel Pat Moore said the virtual roll call will provide an avenue for all 4,699 delegates to cast a vote for the presidential nominee. Waiting until the in-person convention to officially certify its presidential nominee, he said, would open the party to lawsuits.\n\n\"Make no mistake, we have strong legal arguments in response to any such claims and we're prepared to make them,\" Pat Moore said. \"But we also have opponents who are willing to make specious arguments and drag out the process in an effort to confuse voters and muddy the waters. And in some states, we will face an unfriendly judiciary.\"\n\nPat Moore said that ensuring the DNC formally nominates its presidential and vice presidential candidates ahead of any state deadlines is about ensuring voters in every state have their ballots counted in November.\n\n\"Past is precedent: Trump and Republicans have already made it 100% clear that they will challenge the validity of the results if they lose on Election Day,\" he said.\n\n\"If we take chances with state processes and deadlines, Republican groups could make the same argument to challenge Democratic votes in the post-election setting, arguing that our nominee should never have been on the ballot in the first place,\" Pat Moore added. \"We should not and must not give them that opportunity.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Harrison", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Harrison", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaime Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minyon_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minyon Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeta_Phi_Beta", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zeta Phi Beta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daughtry_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daughtry (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leah_D._Daughtry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leah D.

In just the first few days of her campaign, Harris earned the backing of hundreds of Democratic elected officials, including all her potential challengers, and it took her less than 36 hours to secure the support of enough delegates to win the nomination.\n\nUnder the rules approved by the Democratic National Convention's rules panel Wednesday, presidential hopefuls have until Saturday evening to formally declare their candidacies and until Tuesday, July 30, to submit signatures from at least 300 delegates, with not more than 50 from a single state counting toward the threshold.\n\nVoting will be conducted by electronic ballots sent to convention delegates. If only one candidate meets the petition requirements, which is likely considering how quickly the party has coalesced around Harris, voting is expected to begin on August 1, although it will be up to party leaders to set the times for voting to begin and end. If more than one candidate were to meet the requirements, party leaders can set a period of no more than five days for candidates to make their case to delegates. Delegates will have 36 hours' notice before voting begins.\n\nThe party has said its goal is to nominate its presidential and vice presidential candidates by August 7 to avoid the possibility of litigation over ballot access in Ohio. While the state has pushed its deadline for political parties to submit their official nominees to September 1, the new law won't take effect until the end of August.\n\nWhile all delegates will receive ballots, votes cast by superdelegates - senior Democrats who serve as delegates by virtue of their current or past positions - will be counted on the first ballot only if one candidate has the support of enough pledged delegates to make up a majority of the full Democratic convention. That could be determined by a candidate either winning enough votes during remote balloting or gathering a sufficient number of signatures.\n\nAfter a presidential candidate is nominated, the rules allow the nominee to name a running mate without the need for additional remote voting.\n\nThe rules also call for ceremonial votes for president and vice president, as well as a vote on the party platform, during the Democratic convention, which is scheduled to take place in Chicago from August 19-22. While the ceremonial presidential vote will be conducted as a roll call, the vote for vice president is likely to be a voice vote.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ethan_cohen@cnn.com", "name": "Ethan Cohen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_methods_in_deliberative_assemblies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voting methods in deliberative assemblies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballot access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_vote", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voice vote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdelegate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superdelegate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Party platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2162559863-20240724172423547.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760946", "eventUri": "eng-9760946", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-19", "dateEnd": "2024-08-22", "textStart": 2666, "textEnd": 2678}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 163, "textEnd": 171, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 829, "textEnd": 836}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 1619, "textEnd": 1627}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-01", "textStart": 1794, "textEnd": 1805}], "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

If she remains the only person running, electronic voting will begin Aug. 1. If other candidates emerge, the voting may start a bit later to give them time to campaign for delegate votes, according to Democratic National Convention rules.\n\nAny Democrat who wants to seek the presidential nomination has until 6 p.m. on Tuesday to formally declare their candidacy and obtain signatures of support from 300 delegates. At least 3,180 of the nearly 4,000 Democratic delegates have endorsed Harris, according to a survey by the Associated Press.\n\nPolitical parties traditionally nominate the presidential ticket at their conventions, but Democrats decided this year to hold a virtual roll call weeks earlier than their Aug. 19 Chicago convention to ensure they meet ballot access deadlines. The issue arose due to an Aug. 7 Ohio deadline that could have kept the Democratic ticket off that state's ballot.\n\n[Harris tells crowd in battleground Wisconsin that election is 'a choice between freedom and chaos']\n\nThe GOP-led Ohio legislature passed a law extending the deadline, but Democrats have insisted that they don't trust Republicans in that state to adhere to it. Democrat have also pointed to late-August ballot deadlines in other states to suggest that the timeline is too tight for them to wait until the convention to nominate the party ticket.\n\nState election officials in several states have said there are processes in place to help parties who might miss deadlines to ensure they get their candidates on the ballot. Election law experts say any legal efforts to challenge this would probably be dismissed by the courts because there is a deference to parties' rights to have their nominees appear on the ballot.\n\nStill, Pat Moore, a lawyer for the Democratic Party, insisted during a virtual meeting of the convention's rules committee that they expected Republicans to be litigious about ballot deadlines, \"arguing that our nominees should never have been on the ballot in the first place.\"\n\nA rules committee member asked during debate why the Democrats hadn't considered the ballot access deadlines when they planned a late-August convention.\n\n\"Unfortunately, 2020 demonstrated that as far as election litigation is concerned, we are in a new world,\" Moore said. \"Will we face litigation no matter what? I think that's safe to say ... but accepting that we will face that litigation does not mean that we are powerless to strengthen our position.\"\n\nThe new rules also note that there will still be a state-by-state roll call for the Democratic ticket at the Chicago convention but described those votes as \"celebratory and ceremonial.\"", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anchorage Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_methods_in_deliberative_assemblies", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Voting methods in deliberative assemblies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electronic voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballot access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Election law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.adn.com/resizer//-9WChKSebKCJ507I-ymn1jjLy_4=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/727NXF4EL5L65AUW7SEF5PGCJI.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760946", "eventUri": "eng-9760946", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 327, "textEnd": 333, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 489, "textEnd": 495}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-19", "textStart": 1134, "textEnd": 1141}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Technically, they could still flake out and vote for someone else in the nomination, said DNC chair Jaime Harrison on a call with the rules committee Wednesday.\n\n\"Delegates are free to support who they choose, and we are glad that they are engaging in this important moment in history,\" Harrison said. \"As a party, we have an obligation to design and implement a fair nomination process for delegates to officially express their preferences through a vote, resulting in eventually an official nominee of the Democratic party who will go on to the top of the ballot in November.\"\n\nFor a potential challenger to Harris, the window to file a notice of candidacy opens Thursday and closes Saturday, 27 July at 6pm ET. A candidate must submit a petition with 300 signatures from delegates before 30 July to be considered as a candidate for a vote by convention delegates. In the absence of a contest, the virtual roll call vote will be held on 1 July, said Minyon Moore, chair of the Democratic national convention. If not, virtual voting would begin on 3 August.\n\nThe rules committee adopted the change Wednesday at a meeting, to help thwart legal challenges to Democratic ballot access in Ohio.\n\nNormally, the state-by-state call of the roll at the Democratic national convention is both part of the pageantry of the political process and a legal matter for election law.\n\nStates with relatively early ballot nomination deadlines, like Ohio, have traditionally accommodated the convention schedule of major party candidates in the past with a legislative exception. In 2020, for example, the Republican national convention was scheduled in September, months after the state's 9 August deadline.\n\nThis year, in a fit of pique over an administrative ruling that temporarily barred Donald Trump from the ballot in Colorado, conservative lawmakers in the Republican-controlled Ohio legislature dug in their heels and refused to extend the ballot deadline for Biden.\n\nWhile the legislature ultimately convened a special session to pass an exception in July, Ohio law requires 90 days for any change to its election law to go into effect, and legislators rejected an addendum to their exception that would override the 90-day waiting period. It creates a legal question that Republicans can be expected to exploit in a post-election legal contest, said Patrick McNally, the committee's attorney.\n\n\"A virtual process will solve our practical timing problems,\" McNally said. \"Failure to certify both nominees in advance of each state's ballot access deadline opens us up to very real political and litigation risk both before and after the election. Republicans will use this moment to do what they do; to sue, to try to bar us from the ballot or try to disqualify our voters and to suggest that somehow the party's nominating process was improper.\n\nThe Trump campaign filed a complaint with the Federal Elections Commission today to try to block Harris from accessing $91m in joint campaign funds raises for the then Biden-Harris ticket. Meanwhile, the Republican House speaker Mike Johnson questioned the legality of Harris's accession to the nomination, describing the process so far as going \"into a backroom somewhere and switch it out and put someone else on the top of the ticket\".\n\nThe Democratic national convention is scheduled for 19-22 August in Chicago.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

The exact date of the vote -- some time between Aug. 1 and Aug. 7 -- will be decided by the convention's co-chairs, Jaime Harrison and Minyon Moore.\n\nThat gives Harris a tight window to vet and select her running mate, now that her elevation to the top of the ticket has left the No. 2 slot vacant. President Joe Biden, 81, said Sunday he would no longer seek the nomination amid concerns about his ability to beat Republican Donald Trump, and his endorsement of Harris allowed her to effectively clinch the nomination within 48 hours.\n\nAmong the names she's thought to be considering are a number of Democratic governors: Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Roy Cooper of North Carolina, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Tim Walz of Minnesota, in addition to Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona.\n\nFormer Attorney General Eric Holder is working to vet possible running mates, according to a person familiar with the process.\n\nDemocratic officials say they're moving up the process to accommodate early ballot deadlines in several states, especially Ohio, where the deadline had been Aug. 7. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine signed a bill in May to move the deadline to Sept. 1, but Democrats say they'll act as if the earlier deadline is in effect to avoid any possibility of a legal challenge to having Harris and her running mate appear on the ticket.\n\nOhio requires major parties to name both a presidential and vice presidential candidate for the ballot, effectively making Aug. 7 the party's deadline for Harris to select a running mate as well.\n\nThe rules ratified Wednesday set a deadline of 6 p.m. New York time Saturday for presidential candidates to declare they're running, and they will need to collect at least 300 signatures to place their names into nomination by July 30.\n\nIf there's only one candidate, the roll call will take place on or about Aug. 1, said committee chairwoman Leah Daughtry. If there's more than one candidate, it could be about Aug. 3, she said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

With over four years of experience, Pierre said no one is more qualified to step in as the Democratic Party's presidential nominee than US Vice President Kamala Harris. Jean-Pierre's statement, made on Wednesday, highlights Harris's proven track record and expertise in leadership. As the nation anticipates the upcoming presidential elections, Harris's tenure and dedication to public service make her a formidable contender.\n\n\"The vice president (Kamala Harris) has been vice president for more than four years. I do not see anyone more qualified to step in at this moment. She was a senator. She was an attorney general...,\" she said while addressing the White House briefing.Jean-Pierre noted that Kamala Harris was a partner in that to the president, adding that President Joe Biden is proud to make this decision.\n\n\"I've listed out what we've been able to accomplish in the last three and a half, almost four years, an unprecedented record. She was a partner in that with the president. This is a decision that this president made, and I think he (US President Joe Biden) is proud to have made that decision...,\" she added.\n\nUS President Joe Biden on Wednesday lauded his Vice President Kamala Harris as \"tough\" and \"capable\" as he addressed the nation from the Oval Office.\"She's experienced, she's tough, she's capable. She's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country. Now, the choice is up to you, the American people,\" he said days after bowing out of the election race and endorsing her.\n\nBiden bowed out of the race later than any other president in US history on Sunday (July 21), giving in to weeks of pressure from Democrats after a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump raised concerns about his age and mental acuity. Biden was seeking re-election to the post as the Democratic Party nominee.\n\nFollowing this, Biden formally announced that he was abandoning plans for a second term in office and endorsed his running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris for the election.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris has quickly consolidated support among Democrats and has already secured the backing of enough delegates to be the likely Democratic nominee. Democrats adopted the rules the party will use to choose their presidential nominee, with voting to officially nominate Harris likely to begin on August 1.\n\nHarris will have to secure the support of the majority of delegates at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago in August.\n\nUnder the rules approved by the Democratic National Convention's rules panel Wednesday, presidential hopefuls have until Saturday evening to formally declare their candidatures and until Tuesday, July 30, to submit signatures from at least 300 delegates, with not more than 50 from a single state counting towards the threshold, reported CNN.\n\nVoting will be conducted by electronic ballots sent to convention delegates. If only one candidate meets the petition requirements, which is likely considering how quickly the party has coalesced around Harris, voting is expected to begin on August 1, although it will be up to party leaders to set the times for voting to begin and end.If more than one candidate were to meet the requirements, party leaders can set a period of no more than five days for candidates to make their case to delegates, reported CNN.\n\nThe party has said its goal is to nominate its presidential and vice presidential candidates by August 7 to avoid the possibility of litigation over ballot access in Ohio. While the state has pushed its deadline for political parties to submit their official nominees to September 1, the new law won't take effect until the end of August.", "source": {"uri": "india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India News, Breaking News, Entertainment News | India.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballot access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/kamala-harris.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760946", "eventUri": "eng-9760946", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-21", "textStart": 1778, "textEnd": 1785}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 2501, "textEnd": 2509, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 2843, "textEnd": 2850}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 3602, "textEnd": 3610}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-01", "textStart": 3777, "textEnd": 3788}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

This decision comes as a strategic move to streamline the nomination process and is likely intended to avoid any perception of instability within the party.\n\nA virtual roll call will be held during the first week of August to formalize Harris' nomination, confirming her as the party's candidate after she secured support from a majority of delegates without any intra-party challengers. This move follows President Joe Biden's announcement that he will not seek re-election and his endorsement of Harris as the party's nominee. Despite Biden's endorsement, his delegates -- nearly all of the pledged delegates for the convention -- were not legally obligated to support Harris. However, the party has taken proactive steps to guarantee Harris' nomination, ensuring she faces no competition and to demand their compliance.\n\nThe virtual roll call, planned since May, was implemented to allow the Democratic ticket ample time to appear on ballots in states with early filing deadlines. The plan was to have Biden confirmed in advance of the convention. The difference is that Biden actually ran for president and received votes. Harris has not received any votes.\n\nThe decision to continue with this planned process also comes amid discussions by right-leaning legal experts about potentially challenging the Democratic Party's effort to replace Biden with Harris on state ballots and to fork over his campaign war chest, accumulated from those who believed they were donating to Biden, to Harris.\n\nWith Harris officially securing the nomination by early August, the focus will quickly shift to her selection of a running mate, as some states require the party to certify the names of both presidential and vice-presidential candidates on the ballot.\n\nThe DNC will take place in Chicago, starting August 19.

After his June 27 debate with Republican candidate Donald Trump, Democrats put pressure on him to withdraw from the race.\n\nFollowing this, on July 21, Biden formally announced that he was abandoning plans for a second term in office and endorsed his running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris for the election.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris has quickly consolidated support among Democrats and has already secured the backing of enough delegates to be the likely Democratic nominee. Democrats adopted the rules the party will use to choose their presidential nominee, with voting to officially nominate Harris likely to begin on August 1.\n\nHarris will have to secure the support of the majority of delegates at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago in August.\n\nUnder the rules approved by the Democratic National Convention's rules panel Wednesday, presidential hopefuls have until Saturday evening to formally declare their candidatures and until Tuesday, July 30, to submit signatures from at least 300 delegates, with not more than 50 from a single state counting towards the threshold, reported CNN.\n\nVoting will be conducted by electronic ballots sent to convention delegates. If only one candidate meets the petition requirements, which is likely considering how quickly the party has coalesced around Harris, voting is expected to begin on August 1, although it will be up to party leaders to set the times for voting to begin and end.\n\nIf more than one candidate were to meet the requirements, party leaders can set a period of no more than five days for candidates to make their case to delegates, reported CNN.\n\nThe party has said its goal is to nominate its presidential and vice presidential candidates by August 7 to avoid the possibility of litigation over ballot access in Ohio.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nWhile the state has pushed its deadline for political parties to submit their official nominees to September 1, the new

It requires Harris, and any other potential Democrat willing to challenge her, to submit 300 electronic signatures from convention delegates, not more than 50 of whom can be from the same state, by the evening of July 30. If multiple candidates qualify, it could spark multiple rounds of voting over several days. But, if Harris is the only candidate, voting would begin Aug. 1. Delegates voting uncommitted, or for another candidate who hasn't qualified under the rules, will have their choices converted simply to present.\"\n\nDelegates will receive ballots via secure email. The process will be designed not only to formally nominate Harris, but to eventually do the same for her vice presidential selection prior to Aug. 7 giving her a tight window to pick a running mate.", "source": {"uri": "business-standard.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Standard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_signature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electronic signature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2024-07/22/thumb/fitandfill/600X300/1721625550-904.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760946", "eventUri": "eng-9760946", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 312, "textEnd": 319}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 470, "textEnd": 476}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 817, "textEnd": 823}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 223695428, "title": "Here&#8217;s who might run for Florida governor in 2026", "text": "The 2024 elections are still months from being decided. But for some in Florida, 2026 is already here. With Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis set to be termed out of office, the field of potential gubernatorial candidates is taking shape, with some of Florida\u2019s most powerful figures jockeying for position. The last time the governor\u2019s race didn\u2019t include an incumbent was 2018 when Rick Scott was reaching the end of his two terms. At this point in that cycle, few would have predicted the rise of then-U.S. Rep. DeSantis. With so much time until voters cast ballots \u2014 and a presidential election coming in November of this year \u2014 most of those thought to be interested in the governor\u2019s race are staying mum. No major party candidate has filed to run. But here\u2019s what the field could look like, listed in alphabetical order by party. Republicans U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds Donalds\u2019 name has been floated for governor, but he is also being talked about as a possible Donald Trump running mate. The 45-year-old Collier County Republican rose to prominence during the Tea Party wave of the early 2010s. In 2023, as Republicans struggled to elect a leader in Washington, Donalds earned a few votes from conservative colleagues to be the speaker of the House. Donalds reportedly got a special shout-out from Trump at a Manhattan fundraiser. The former president asked Donalds then whether he was running for governor in 2026, according to Politico. \u201cThat\u2019s what I hear,\u201d Donalds reportedly replied. U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz In part because he\u2019s one of Trump\u2019s most loyal foot soldiers, Gaetz likely has the name recognition to compete in a statewide race. When asked about a potential statewide run, Gaetz, 42, left the door open. \u201cPresident Trump keeps telling my wife she\u2019d make a great First Lady of Florida. I keep telling him my only political focus is his re-election,\u201d the Pensacola-area Republican wrote in an emailed statement. \u201cWithout that, we don\u2019t have a country.\u201d Before November 2026 rolls around, the four-term U.S. representative will have to navigate an ethics investigation into his alleged relationship with a minor. Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing in that episode; in 2023, the Justice Department closed a criminal case into Gaetz without charging him. Attorney General Ashley Moody Moody, 49, who\u2019s finishing her second term as attorney general, has proven that she can win a statewide election. The Republican has been a thorn in Biden\u2019s side as attorney general, having sued the White House over numerous policies. Perhaps her most notable moment in office was a display of loyalty to Trump. In December 2020, she endorsed a lawsuit hoping to overturn the result of the 2020 election that Trump lost. A lawyer in her office called that lawsuit \u201cbats\u2014t insane,\u201d but Moody has defended the litigation, saying she would have liked the Supreme Court to weigh in on the suit. The court declined to hear the case. Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis If loyalty to Trump is the main criterion in a Republican primary, the state\u2019s twice-elected chief financial officer is trying to stand out. In recent months, Patronis backed a bill in the Legislature that would have provided public funding for the former president\u2019s legal defense. He criticized Trump\u2019s New York trial, calling it \u201cstupid.\u201d And he wrote to Trump inviting him to claim $54,000 of unclaimed money found in Trump\u2019s name. With two statewide victories under his belt, Patronis, 52, could well have a shot at the governor\u2019s mansion. Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson Simpson, who became agriculture commissioner in 2023, has numerous conservative policy achievements he can point to in a Republican primary. He served as the president of the Florida Senate during the 2021 and 2022 legislative sessions. However, he has had a rocky relationship with DeSantis at times, as evidenced by the governor\u2019s moves to veto some of Simpson\u2019s pet budget projects. Simpson, 57, an egg farmer, is worth about $21 million, according to financial disclosure forms. U.S. Rep. Michael Waltz Waltz, 50, who represents a large district north of Orlando, is less well-known than Gaetz or Donalds, but he has been raising his national profile. Like Gaetz, Waltz seems to have the approval of Trump. In a recent Axios story, Trump said of Waltz, a former Green Beret: \u201cWhen I want to know about the military, I call him.\u201d In a March interview with WFTV, Waltz appeared to be mulling a 2026 run for governor. \u201cI joke a little bit that we\u2019ve had two Navy governors, in Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis. Maybe it\u2019s time for some Army boots up there,\u201d Waltz said. Democrats State House minority leader Fentrice Driskell Driskell, the Democratic leader in the state House, has seen her party badly outnumbered in Tallahassee. But from her post, she\u2019s had a platform to speak out against Republican legislative priorities like abortion bans and expansions of school voucher programs. The 45-year-old Harvard-educated attorney is considering a run in 2026, she said in a statement. But first, she wants to help her party win back a few House seats. Nikki Fried, Florida Democratic Party chair Fried ran for governor in 2022. Could she give it another shot in 2026? \u201cNo time for that right now,\u201d Fried wrote in a text message in response to a question about her 2026 plans. Fried, 46, the state\u2019s former agriculture commissioner, is the only Democrat to have won statewide in the past decade. But her first run for governor ended in a 24-point loss to Charlie Crist in the Democratic primary. Democratic state Sen. Shevrin Jones Jones, 40, a vocal Democratic state senator from the Miami area, is seen as a rising star in his party. However, he\u2019s also untested on the statewide stage. In a statement, Jones said he is focused on getting Democrats elected in 2024. U.S. Rep. Jared Moskowitz There\u2019s trying to raise your national profile, and then there\u2019s what Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Moskowitz, 43, has been doing for the last few months. In March, Moskowitz showed up to a House Oversight and Accountability Committee hearing on Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings wearing a Vladimir Putin mask. Moskowitz has trolled some of the more progressive members of his own party, too. In April, when Moskowitz visited Columbia University, he compared the anti-Israel protests on that campus to the white nationalists who protested in Charlottesville in 2017. Moskowitz, a first-term U.S. representative who served in DeSantis\u2019 administration from 2019 until 2021, has signaled he is open to a 2026 run for governor. In an increasingly red state, Moskowitz seems to be attempting to appeal to the state\u2019s more moderate voters. Democratic state Sen. Jason Pizzo Pizzo, a South Florida state senator, often speaks out against Republican priorities in the state Senate. He\u2019s also tried to show he\u2019s a team player for his party. In 2022, when he didn\u2019t have an opponent running against him, a political committee chaired by Pizzo donated nearly $700,000 to Democratic causes around the state. In October, he told the outlet Florida Politics that he would run if Gaetz runs. Pizzo, 48, is worth more than $60 million, according to financial disclosure forms he\u2019s filed with the state.", "summary": "The 2024 elections are still months from being decided.

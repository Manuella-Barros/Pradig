{"id": 223703886, "title": "Camanachd Cup: Beauly stun Kinlochshiel as Lochaber thrash Kyles Athletic", "text": "Beauly and Lochaber were the Tulloch Homes Camanachd Cup second round shock-troops and go into Tuesday\u2019s quarter-final draw. At Braeview Park, Sandy Elrick twice had National Division Beauly ahead against top-flight Kinlochshiel only to be pegged back by Jordan Fraser\u2019s penalty and then John MacRae\u2019s strike just four minutes from time. Jordan Fraser hit the post with a second half penalty while John MacRae struck the crossbar during a goalless extra-time period, so referee John Angus Gillies took the tie to a penalty shoot-out. Beauly, who were missing Euan MacCormick and Finlay MacLennan, were 5-4 sudden death winners and their co-manager Gregor MacCormick said: \u201cThat was a fantastic game of shinty and probably our best performance this season. \u201cWe had the better of the first half with Shiel taking the second 45-minutes while extra-time was 50-50. \u201cOur defence were terrific and keeper Lee Dunbar scored a penalty in the shoot-out and saved three, including a sudden death stop from John MacRae to win the tie. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to pick out any players but as well as Lee Dunbar, Sandy Elrick played well, twice beating his marker before running on to score.\u201d Over at Spean Bridge, Lochaber turned on a devastating display to beat Kyles Athletic 8-1. Shaun Nicolson scored in the opening minute before Max Campbell\u2019s hat-trick, Pat Toal\u2019s brace and efforts from Stuart Callison and Ben Delaney, all coming before James Pringle\u2019s consolation. Lochaber boss Ally Ferguson said: \u201cWe\u2019ve pulled a good squad together with boys who have worked hard at training, and it clicked for us today.\u201d Kyles player/coach Roddy Macdonald pulled no punches. He said: \u201cThat was unacceptable, and I\u2019m embarrassed by that performance. \u201cIf we don\u2019t turn it around soon, we\u2019ll be playing National Division shinty next season and for many years to come.\u201d Bragging rights for Gillies Jamie Gillies played a key role in Skye\u2019s 3-0 win over Glenurquhart, scoring against his cousin Stuart MacKintosh in the Glen goal. Skye led midway through the first half through youngster Iain MacInnes before Jamie Gillies, who was switched to buckshee forward, turned home a second half rebound. Dan MacDonald added a third after Stuart MacKintosh\u2019s brilliant save denied Jamie Gillies another. Jamie Gillies said: \u201cWe took a while to get going but sorted things out at half-time. It was nice to score against \u2018Smack\u2019 again and I won\u2019t let him forget that one. He also made a great save to stop me getting another.\u201d Glen boss Davie Stewart added: \u201cSkye were sharper up front, and we didn\u2019t take our chances when they came.\u201d Kings ease through Holders Kingussie beat Bute 8-1 with Dylan Borthwick and Thomas Borthwick both netting twice and George Taylor-Ramsay, Liam Borthwick, Iain Fraser and Lee Bain getting the others. Rory McDonald countered in stoppage time. Manager Iain Borthwick said: \u201cWe were always in control and gave 15-year-old Macleod Dawson an hour on his senior debut and he was fantastic.\u201d Oban Camanachd beat Newtonmore 5-3 after extra-time. Lewis Cameron and Ross Macmillan twice had Oban Camanachd ahead, but Drew MacDonald and Iain Robinson levelled. Daniel MacVicar and two-goal Matthew Sloss made it 5-2 in extra-time with Iain Robinson\u2019s second coming late on. Lovat passed a tricky test, beating Caberfeidh 4-1. Lewis Tawse broke the deadlock with two-goal Graeme MacMillan and Fraser Heath adding to their tally before Craig Morrison\u2019s late counter. Glasgow Mid Argyll edged Inveraray 3-2 after extra-time. Allan MacDonald and Campbell Watt twice had hosts Inveraray ahead but Calum McLay and then Craig Anderson, in the final minute, pegged them back. Calum McLay\u2019s second four minutes into extra-time time settled the tie. Fresh from securing a cottages.com MacTavish Cup final appearance last weekend, Fort William beat Inverness 4-0 through Lachie Shaw\u2019s hat-trick and Victor Smith\u2019s strike. In the Mowi National Division, Kilmallie beat Col Glen 3-1 with Shane O\u2019Rua scoring twice and Calum MacDougall the other. Scott MacVicar scored for Col Glen who included new signing Neil MacVicar from Skye.", "summary": "Beauly made it through to the last eight of shinty's top cup competition.", "url": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/sport/shinty/6482195/camanachd-cup-beauly-stun-kinlochshiel/", "image": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/BKL_0524_1367-d5ypht8i-e1716726704547.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:40:26", "author": "Reporter", "authors": ["Reporter"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.104}

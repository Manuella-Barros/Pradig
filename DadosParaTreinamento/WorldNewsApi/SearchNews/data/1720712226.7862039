And it doesn\u2019t mean my version \u2013 standing in the only bank branch for miles that hasn\u2019t become a Costa, looking for someone, anyone, with a lanyard, a tablet and a can-do attitude to sort out my direct debit problem. \u201cTrust fund, 6\u20195\u201d, blue eyes,\u201d continues the hook. If you haven\u2019t heard it yet, click with caution: it\u2019s a weapons-grade earworm. It was originally a joke \u2013 its creator, Megan Boni (@GirlonCouch), told Today.com she was mocking women who complain about being single while having absurd non-negotiables in a prospective partner. But it\u2019s become, among other things, an (arguably) sincere anthem for girls who genuinely want to date private equity giants in quilted gilets. Because that\u2019s a trend, apparently: influencers are encouraging young women to date rich, to let themselves be taken care of by a \u201cprovider\u201d and to embrace a \u201csoft life\u201d (pursuing hobbies, travel, self-care, having a nice home) without financial responsibilities. New York magazine recently featured some, including a self-described \u201cspoiled girl\u201d matchmaker and a YouTube guru whose dating advice focuses on marrying for money rather than love. That scrabbly noise you hear behind the thumping man-in-finance beat is the Pankhursts spinning in their graves; a vein in my eyelid is throbbing along. But hang on: is it actually serious? TikTok and gen Z memes can be a baffling millefeuille of irony, absurdity and self-referential, satirical silliness. \u201cIf you can\u2019t tell it\u2019s a joke, that\u2019s your problem,\u201d as one of the \u201cprovider\u201d influencers said. I\u2019ve watched tons of man-in-finance content and there\u2019s some good, funny stuff: I loved the Royal Horticultural Society\u2019s \u201cgreen thumb, secateurs, loppers\u201d version featuring a game, if baffled, older gent snipping a hedge, and there\u2019s a fun gilet-ed flashmob in Liverpool Street, London. But I think there\u2019s more to it; after all, the joke doesn\u2019t work unless it\u2019s skewering something recognisable. So: what? There\u2019s that yearning for the \u201csoft life\u201d for a start. When work is exhausting, unstable and unfulfilling, you can see why you might not want to bother; not needing a job at all could be the logical next step after the \u201clazy girl job\u201d. Even before man-in-finance, my social media frequently showed me the girlfriends of rich men, who don\u2019t need to work, filming their travel itineraries and luxury shopping trips. I don\u2019t think they post in a self-skewering spirit of mockery and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s consumed satirically either. Displaying or pursuing conspicuous wealth isn\u2019t as taboo as it used to be (perhaps thanks to the safety net of social media plausible deniability: you can say it\u2019s a joke the offended viewer is too dim to get). Vogue\u2019s claim that \u201cfinance bros are having a renaissance\u201d makes me queasy, but it\u2019s understandable at a time of profound upheaval that financial stability is on people\u2019s partner wishlist. Then New York magazine also explored the grim \u201cnightmare\u201d of dating for young women: men who crave conquests rather than connection, violent-porn-inspired sex that disregards women\u2019s pleasure and an adversarial, contemptuous attitude forged in, or at least influenced by, the men\u2019s rights movement. Women\u2019s disillusionment is real (see also the pushback against the dating app Bumble\u2019s jokey anti-celibacy ads \u2013 some aren\u2019t \u201clooking for a man\u201d at all). You can see that might feed a cynical, even mercenary, sort of relationship nihilism \u2013 if not in reality, at least in what you post or consume in the hyperbolic arena of social media. But wow, how bleak. For a start, it nourishes the manosphere\u2019s dimmest, most damaging ideas about women as shallow gold-diggers who crave an \u201calpha\u201d. Then that kept woman life of financial dependency, even consciously chosen, feels so retrograde, so vulnerable and anxious. How could anyone find a time of stashing away pin money or building up a running away fund aspirational? All those hard-won rights to own property, to inherit, to equal pay, the continuing struggle to close the gender pay gap exchanged for a powerless soft life? My eyelid vein is throbbing again. I should probably just lighten up and enjoy the memes, but the joke just doesn\u2019t feel very funny.

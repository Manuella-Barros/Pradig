{"id": 223699530, "title": "Hermione Norris open to Cold Feet reunion as women her age 'are snubbed from good roles", "text": "She\u2019s forever immortalised in telly history thanks to roles in Cold Feet, Drop The Dead Donkey and Wire In The Blood. But far from wanting distance from that younger on-screen versionof herself, Hermione Norris is happy to embrace it \u2013 and the ageing process that goes with it. Ostensibly she\u2019s chatting to Notebook about the launch of a new channel, Rewind TV, a kind of telly time machine set to bring back some familiar small-screen favourites \u2013 Drop The Dead Donkey included. But, speaking on a chilly Monday morning from her home on a farm in Dorset, the mum-of-two is in a reflective mood about those early roles which made her a household name \u2013 and why now, at 57, she believes women \u201ccome into their power\u201d in their later decades. \u201cIt is a bit of a strange place to be, seeing yourself from 10 or 15 years ago but it is kind of my reality,\u201d laughs Hermione, who was cast in her breakout role of Karen Marsden in Cold Feet back in 1998. \u201cPersonally, I love seeing actors I\u2019ve worked with throughout my career, or who I\u2019ve admired and respected down the years, in old reruns of programmes like Miss Marple. I\u2019m excited by that \u2013 there they are in different incarnations and in different chapters of their lives but still themselves. I think it\u2019s great. \u201cAnd at the end of the day it\u2019s a special thing to get older, after all.\u201d Ageing \u2013 and society\u2019s attitude to older women in particular \u2013 is something which the London-born actress has forthright views about. \u201cI think ageing is a beautiful thing, particularly for women. We come into our power and strength at 50 plus. \u201cSadly, I just don\u2019t see women of my age represented very much. We\u2019re not reflected back on TV, culturally we start to disappear yet we make up such a proportion of society and the workforce. \u201cThere are lots of women in that age bracket who I know, who I admire and respect and who inspire me and they have done or are doing extraordinary things in their lives. It may be being done quietly, not very visibly yet they have the most powerful voices and wisdom. \u201cThey are sharing that too \u2013 and that is golden. They are golden.\u201d If it\u2019s tough for women in general to retain visibility after a certain age, then the spectre of ageism must be particularly haunting for actresses. \u201cIt is just a statement of fact that work stops for a lot of us after a certain age \u2013 it gets less after 45 and then goes down again later on,\u201d she reveals. Has she ever been tempted to turn to cosmetic procedures to hold back the years? \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said no,\u201d admits Hermione, who has been married to Simon Wheeler, a writer on Wire In The Blood, since 2002 and with whom she shares son Wilf and daughter Hero. \u201cAs an actor you\u2019re very visible \u2013 you are your own currency, your own utensil. It\u2019s just you and that\u2019s what you\u2019re employed for \u2013 not being able to write or work out maths \u2013 it\u2019s just you. So of course you want to look as good as you possibly can and as fresh as you possibly can and yes, that definitely magnifies the issues around getting older.\u201d She admits that the younger Hermione may have been \u201cjudgemental\u201d about the quest to retain youth, adding, \u201cBut don\u2019t judge anyone until you\u2019re in their shoes because when you take the journey your views change.\u201d So, is she a gym bunny or a runner? Hermione bursts out laughing \u2013 \u201cThat would be no. I\u2019m too lazy!\u201d \u2013 and is adamant that she looks after herself for herself alone. \u201cNot for a man or a woman or anybody. Just me. I think if women want to feel good about themselves for themselves, however they do it, then I support that.\u201d It was a desire to find greater peace and balance for both her and her family which saw them move from London to the countryside nine years ago, finally settling in a farmhouse in Dorset. \u201cMy son was very dyslexic and I needed him to have other stuff in his life where he could be free and not be constantly weighed and measured by numeracy and literacy. With dogs to walk and acres of green around her, it\u2019s clear that, although she still loves the capital \u2013 \u201cit has a pulse of its own and it\u2019s where I am most aligned\u201d \u2013 being surrounded by nature is where she feels at peace. \u201cThe best things about the countryside? Rolling around in the mud. Nobody cares what you look like. The freedom and nature \u2013 they are the best healers. It\u2019s gorgeous. \u201cThe worst thing about the countryside? Probably the mud again!\u201d Talk of the children leads her to reflect on the looming empty nest. With Wilf now 19 and no longer at home and her daughter in lower sixth, it won\u2019t be long until the household is child-free. \u201cI guess you don\u2019t know how things are going to affect you until you get there, do you? I just want them to be living their best lives and if they\u2019re happy, I\u2019m happy.\u201d Are either of them likely to follow their parents into show business? \u201cI\u2019ve had the most amazing time, a wonderful career and I\u2019ve loved it but it can be bumpy \u2013 I\u2019d rather they had some joy elsewhere.\u201d That \u201cwonderful career\u201d began in earnest when, having been out of work for some months, she secured the role of Karen in Cold Feet. The much-loved comedy drama series, which also starred James Nesbitt, John Thomson, Fay Ripley, Robert Bathurst and Helen Baxendale, followed the lives of three 30-something couples in Manchester and initially ran from 1998 to 2003. A further outing came in 2016. But having been hesitant to return, would she consider another re-boot? \u201cI do think because it has followed a generation throughout their lives, then yes \u2013 perhaps catching up with us in our seventies!\u201d She and her former castmates were reunited recently at a mutual friend\u2019s birthday party while she and Fay Ripley will feature in a new series of ITV\u2019s DNA Journey, something she describes as an \u201cextraordinary experience\u201d. \u201cWe laughed a lot for a week,\u201d is all she will reveal about that at this stage. We will also see her on cinema screens in The Salt Path starring Jason Isaacs and Gillian Anderson, the film adaptation of the much-loved book. Back to TV and Hermione is very much looking forward to catching those old episodes of Drop The Dead Donkey. \u201cI did that before Cold Feet and it was just a very, very exciting time. As a young actress, life felt hopeful \u2013 it was all in front of us.\u201d So what might her advice be to her younger self? \u201cI\u2019d say be kind to yourself. I think we\u2019re taught from a very early age to take care of others \u2013 it\u2019s all about everybody else, not ourselves. \u201cIt would be good if women were taught to nurture and care for themselves.\u201d", "summary": "Cold Feet star Hermione Norris said she'd be 'lying' to say she hadn't considered cosmetic work as she hit out at women being overlooked after the age of 45. &quot;Ageing is a beautiful thing, particularly for women.

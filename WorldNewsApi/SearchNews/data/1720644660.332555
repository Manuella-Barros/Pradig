{"id": 231251564, "title": "The importance of Merrick Garland stating the obvious", "text": "One of the eternal questions among liberals and leftists is whether Donald Trump and the Republicans believe what they are saying. These days, they\u2019re saying Joe Biden manufactured the former president\u2019s felony conviction in an effort to interfere with the 2024 election. They\u2019re saying the president\u2019s \u201cweaponization of the legal system\u201d is the reason for their own weaponization of it in the future. \u201cYou have to wonder if the magas believe their own outlandish rhetoric,\u201d Lindsay Beyerstein said in her latest for the Editorial Board. Some do, she said, but most don\u2019t. \u201cThis embrace of frothing conspiracism is an excuse to justify the authoritarian measures they\u2019ve long wanted to implement.\u201d I agree, but I want to add a layer. Some don\u2019t know. The great depth of ignorance in America I don\u2019t mean the Republicans. As Lindsay said, they are not ignorant. They know they are peddling a conspiracy theory. They know the facts, too. They know the criminal trial of Donald Trump is led by a state law enforcement official who sought justice according to state law in a case presided over by a state judge in New York state\u2019s judicial system. They know the president \u2013 this one, or any other, at any time \u2013 has nothing to do with state and local law enforcement. The president is the executive of the federal government, not state government. He\u2019s the leader of America, but he\u2019s not the leader of Manhattan or Albany. No, I\u2019m talking about normal people, including some GOP voters. Some don\u2019t know. We can ask if Trump and the Republicans believe what they\u2019re saying, but let\u2019s not forget the impact of their saying it on those who are, for reasons good and bad, too ignorant to even ask whether they mean it. They just believe the Republicans do. They don\u2019t know enough about how government in America works. They don\u2019t know enough about the US Constitution, the sovereignty of the states, the separation of powers. They don\u2019t even know that Biden doesn\u2019t control, you know, everything. (Indeed, lots of people, even quite famous people, believe presidents are very nearly omnipotent.) This is important to point out, because liberals and leftists typically do not place value on the important role played by the ignorant. (We tend to go straight to whether the Republicans believe what they say.) The Republicans, however, do place value on ignorance. They depend on it. There are only so many people around as cynical and craven as they are. A vast majority of people don't agree with them or don't know enough about anything to know whether they agree with them. Which brings me to Merrick Garland. For the Republicans, conspiracy theories work The US attorney general gets a lot of grief from liberals and leftists, because he\u2019s an institutionalist who believes in maintaining norms. But what he said during yesterday\u2019s testimony on Capitol Hill wasn\u2019t just more of the same, not when you consider the great depth of ignorance in this country, which is usually working in the Republicans\u2019 favor. In front of the House Judiciary, he said what many needed to hear. \u201cWe do not control the Manhattan district attorney, the Manhattan district attorney does not report to us,\u201d he said. Later, he added: \"That conspiracy theory is an attack on the judicial process itself.\u201d That might have sounded obvious, and it might have come off as rather feeble on account of sounding obvious, but remember \u2013 lots of people just don\u2019t know enough about how government works to know it was obvious. They might have been surprised to learn the president has no control over state criminal proceedings. (Perhaps they might have felt lied to!) And remember, the Republican response partly depends on ignorance. People who are knowledgeable about civic structures are unlikely to be duped into believing their conspiracy theories. These days, conspiracy theories are the Republican party line, not because the Republicans are crazy, but because they are practical. Conspiracy theories work. \u201cJoe Biden rigged the trial\u201d attacks their chief adversary while softening the blow to Trump\u2019s campaign. But they only work on two groups. One is the cynics, that is, people who may know they are being lied to, but go along with it, because going along is useful. Two is the ignorant, that is, people who don\u2019t know enough about anything to know they\u2019re being lied to. Conspiracy theories rally the GOP\u2019s cynics while bullying the ignorant (who are sometimes politely called \u201clow-propensity voters\u201d) into falling in line. Together, these two groups may constitute a majority of American voters, but things like Garland\u2019s remarks can wedge them apart. He can\u2019t do that alone, of course. Fortunately, the Republicans themselves often provide the wedge by way of saying the quiet part out loud. Wedge apart the GOP and the ignorant According toAxios, on Tuesday, the Republicans in the House want to move on legislation that would \u201callow current or former presidents to move any state case brought against them \u2014 such as the one in New York that resulted in Trump's conviction \u2014 to federal court.\u201d With this bill, these Republicans are admitting they don\u2019t believe Joe Biden rigged Trump\u2019s trial. If they believed it, they wouldn\u2019t be talking about moving things from the state to the federal level. They wouldn\u2019t be talking about levels of government at all given that levels of government are entirely missing from their lies. According to the conspiracy theory, there are no levels. Biden controls everything. \u201cCurrent or former presidents\u201d refers to Trump, presumably. Why move state criminal cases to the federal level? Because presidents administrate the federal government, not state governments. Trump can\u2019t stop state trials, but he could (in theory) stop federal trials. Moreover, if more people were aware of the fact that there are indeed levels of governments \u2013 by which one does not usually involve the other \u2013 the impact of their conspiracy theory on people who don\u2019t know much about government would be blunted, perhaps neutralized. Merrick Garland is trying to make them aware. So are the Republicans \u2013 indirectly. Liberals and leftists can talk about whether they mean what they say or we can talk about the meaning of what they say for the benefit of those who don\u2019t know enough to know what it means.", "summary": "<img src=\"https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=33329366&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C66%2C0%2C67\"/><br/><br/><p>One of the eternal questions among liberals and leftists is whether Donald Trump and the Republicans believe what they are saying. </p>\n<p>These days, they\u2019re saying Joe Biden manufactured the former president\u2019s felony conviction in an effort to interfere with the 2024 election.

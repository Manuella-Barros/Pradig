{"id": 223701200, "title": "Experimental new lane expected to mitigate traffic to Maine, N.H.", "text": "A new way to ease traffic is going into use this weekend. The New Hampshire Department of Transportation (NHDOT) will implement a new dynamic part-time shoulder use (PTSU) system for about three miles on Interstate 95 in conjunction with the Maine Department of Transportation and the Maine Turnpike Authority, according to the agencies. This change will be between Exit 5 in New Hampshire and Exit 3 in Maine, according to officials. The agencies will open this new lane of travel for the holiday weekend to study how it will affect traffic congestion during the expected busier period, according to WCVB. \u201cIf the congestion is happening northbound, NHDOT will go into our system and be able to turn on a green arrow over the shoulder so traffic knows you can use this part-time shoulder use,\u201d said Susan Klasen, director of operations at NHDOT, to WCVB. NHDOT said it\u2019s important that drivers pay attention to the traffic signals along these exits. There will be a red \u201cX\u201d symbol when the shoulder is only available for emergency stopping. NHDOT will be managing the northbound side of the system while the Maine Department of Transportation and Maine Turnpike Authority will manage the southbound side.", "summary": "<p>This change will be between Exit 5 in New Hampshire and Exit 3 in Maine, according to officials.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2024/05/26/experimental-new-lane-expected-to-mitigate-traffic-to-maine-n-h/\">Experimental new lane expected to mitigate traffic to Maine, N.H.</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.boston.com\">Boston.com</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2024/05/26/experimental-new-lane-expected-to-mitigate-traffic-to-maine-n-h/", "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/BDC_Logo_2020_256x256-60d0abc34135e.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:30:21", "author": "Rosemary Ford", "authors": ["Rosemary Ford"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.203}

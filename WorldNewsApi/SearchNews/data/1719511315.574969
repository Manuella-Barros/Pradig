{"id": 223767202, "title": "Best Fiber Internet Providers in Your Area", "text": "What\u2019s the best fiber internet provider in your area? Fiber internet is sought after for its fast, symmetrical speeds and unmatched reliability, but service can be hard to find. Your best bet for fiber internet comes from major internet service providers like AT&T Fiber, Frontier Fiber, Quantum Fiber and Verizon Fios. Such providers have the largest fiber-optic networks, bringing fiber internet to numerous markets across the US. That said, many regional and hyper-local internet providers also offer fiber internet. My fiber internet, for example, comes from Comporium, a small ISP serving my local area in the suburban Charlotte area. Fiber internet providers, like most ISPs, operate in specific areas, so there may be only one or two available in your area. It\u2019s also possible that no fiber providers are available near you. Or, perhaps a fiber provider serves your area but not your specific address. So how do you know if fiber internet is available in your area? You\u2019ll find a rundown of the largest fiber ISPs and where they offer service below, followed by tips for finding fiber internet near you. 10 best fiber internet providers by nationwide availability AT&T Fiber - 12% coverage, available in 22 statesVerizon Fios - 9% coverage, available in eight states and Washington, DCFrontier Fiber - 4% coverage, available in 15 statesQuantum Fiber - 2% coverage, available in 16 statesGoogle Fiber - 1% coverage, available in 12 statesMetronet - 1% coverage, available in 16 statesKinetic by Windstream - 1% coverage, available in 18 statesZiply Fiber - Less than 1% coverage, available in four statesBrightspeed - Less than 1% coverage, available in 18 statesGoNetspeed - Less than 1% coverage, available in eight states Where to find the top fiber internet providers Cable providers with fiber connections Fiber is the top-tier technology when it comes to home internet. As a result, internet providers that traditionally used coaxial cable lines to run service have added fiber connections to their networks. Astound Broadband - Known for its low introductory rates, Astound offers fiber internet in most of its markets, albeit to a limited number of households. Austin, Chicago and Seattle have Astound\u2019s greatest fiber coverage. Cox Communications - Fiber service is slowly entering Cox markets, but at a slower pace than other cable ISPs. Most Cox cities, including Oklahoma City, Omaha, Phoenix and San Diego, see little fiber coverage from the cable ISP. Optimum - With more than 2.7 million homes, mostly in the greater NYC area, serviceable for fiber internet, Optimum has the best fiber coverage of any cable-first provider. Parts of Texas and western North Carolina (former Suddenlink markets) may also be eligible for fiber service.Spectrum - Spectrum has arguably the largest fiber network of any traditional cable ISP, with coverage in parts of 20 states, including Hawaii. Xfinity - The nation\u2019s largest cable provider also has a growing fiber network, though total coverage falls short of Optimum and Spectrum. Like Cox, Xfinity offers fiber internet in many of its markets, but actual availability is limited to select neighborhoods. How to find fiber internet in your area Your address determines the available connection types and internet providers. ISP search tools, like the one on this page, are a great starting point for finding internet providers in your area, fiber or otherwise. If you\u2019re setting up internet in a new place, ask your neighbors (posts to Facebook neighborhood groups or Nextdoor are sure to get some responses) about which internet providers they use and why. Or, if you need internet for an apartment, check with the leasing office about available internet options for your home. Keep in mind that a neighbor\u2019s opinion may be relatively uninformed or biased, and a leasing office may have ulterior motives when recommending an internet provider. Be sure to do your own research when shopping for internet service. How do I know if an internet provider is fiber? Once you have an idea of the available internet providers in your area, there are a couple of surefire ways to distinguish a fiber provider from a non-fiber provider. Many ISPs advertise a fiber product right in the name -- AT&T Fiber, Frontier Fiber, Google Fiber, Quantum Fiber, even Verizon Fios indicates fiber service. Others, like Brightspeed or Kinetic, that don\u2019t have fiber specifically in the name, may add fiber to the plan name. Kinetic plans, for example, are either \u201cHigh-speed internet,\u201d which is a DSL-based service, or \u201cFiber.\u201d If the name doesn\u2019t indicate a fiber or non-fiber product, the speeds will. Fiber is the only connection type capable of delivering symmetrical upload and download speeds. So if a plan offers the same (or close) upload and download speeds, it\u2019s likely fiber. Max available speeds may also point to a fiber connection. Cable and fiber are the only connection types that can reach multigigabit speeds, but max advertised speeds from cable reach at most 2,000Mbps, or 2 gigabits per second (Cox and Xfinity offer 2,000Mbps in select areas, Astound has a 1,500Mbps plan). Fiber, on the other hand, can reach much faster speeds, up to 5Gbps, 8Gbps or higher. Of course, you can also ask a sales or customer service representative what connection type the internet provider uses. How we chose the best available fiber ISPs CNET\u2019s broadband reviews and best lists often involve considering, researching and evaluating several different attributes, from availability and plan selection to service terms and customer satisfaction. To learn more, see our breakdown of how we review internet service providers. For a list that focuses solely on availability such as the one above, coverage area and total units served are the biggest considerations. Broadband maps and data from the Federal Communications Commission are our primary sources when determining an internet provider\u2019s availability. While admittedly imperfect, the data gives us a solid understanding of where an internet provider offers service and the connection type, such as fiber, they use. Using FCC data, we identified fiber internet providers with multi-state availability and coverage of at least 0.3% households (around 500,000 units) nationwide. Qualifying providers are featured in the best list above. Fiber in my area FAQs", "summary": "Is fiber internet available near you?

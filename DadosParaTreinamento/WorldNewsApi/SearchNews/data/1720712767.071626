{"id": 232090086, "title": "Taylor Swift fans soak up the sun ahead of Eras tour third and final night", "text": "Swifties forever was the chant for Day Three of Taylor Swift in Edinburgh and a lazy Sunday afternoon turned into a sweltering Sunday Funday as tens of thousands turned out to greet the star. The atmosphere around Murrayfield was electric as families and friends turned out in force after waiting months to see their favourite gal. In pubs and restaurants nearby, friendship bracelets were being swapped in the toilets while people posed in front of the Murrayfield sign for Instagram and their other socials. Less wind on day three meant people could enjoy the summer sun that bit more but people heeded advice and many brought anoraks and warm coats to wear over their outfits in the evening. Katrina Coutts, 42, and her daughter Aela, 9, from Liberton got Swiftie tickets, like many, for a Christmas present. Katrina who we was glittering from the Fearless Era whilst Aela was dressed after Lover, said: \u201cMy dad somehow managed to pull something out on Christmas day because we didn\u2019t think we\u2019d get tickets.\" She added: \u201cI like Cool Summer and Aela likes Down Bad. \"Taylor is just so positive and puts a lot of good out in the world and brings a lot of good out.\u201d With fans around from many different countries it was interesting to hear how everyone first discovered Taylor and how her music fitted in with their cultural experiences. Angelina Dong, 21, and Ranie Fan, 20, from China came to see Taylor from their respective homes in London and Glasgow. Angelina said: \u201cI think it\u2019s best to come to Scotland to see Taylor and travel around Edinburgh.\u201d Angelina said listening to Taylor\u2019s songs helped her to learn English and bond with the Kiwis when she stayed in New Zealand. She explained: \u201cWe played songs in New Zealand in boarding school and our parents had not heard of them so this was a way to learn English too.\u201d Ranie said her school in China used to use Taylor\u2019s songs as a morning alarm call to wake pupils up from their beds! She said: \u201cSince primary school I loved Love Story because they usually played it for morning alarm to get us up in China.\u201d The girls were dressed to impress and added that they wrapped up a bit warmer after hearing reports of the cold night air. As traditional bagpipes played on for many in the queue, Samuel Cook,28, who works at 02 explained why he came dressed as the Heartbreak Prince from the Lover Era. He said: \u201cLover\u2019s Heartbreak Prince is my look today. I\u2019ve been a fan for too long, well over a decade. I\u2019m hoping it see the full tour and maybe a bit of Debut as a surprise song. \"What do I like about Taylor Swift? I\u2019d be lying if I said it was about her legs but it\u2019s her overall instrumental value. The fact she gets up and plays guitar, play piano and the vocals. Everything is spot on.\u201d Elle Easton, 13, was with her mum and both couldn\u2019t wait to get into the arena to hear Paramore and Taylor perform. As she fished in the queue she had on a silver dress from the Folklore album and the song Mirrorball. She said: \u201cHer lyrics are just amazing and I\u2019m very excited about seeing her.\u201d Swift has brought everyone together in Edinburgh and the atmosphere over the last three days has been amazing with even solo travellers being made welcome by groups of loyal fans.

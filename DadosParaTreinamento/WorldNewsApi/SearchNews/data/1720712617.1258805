{"id": 232061640, "title": "Hall of Fame NBA Forward, Champion Passes Away At Age 84", "text": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame former Philadelphia 76ers and Chicago Bulls small forward Chet Walker has unfortunately passed away, reports Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN. The seven-time NBA All-Star was 84 years old. No cause of death has yet been divulged.Walker was a key component of the Wilt Chamberlain-led Philadelphia 76ers team that won the title during the 1966-67 season.Across a 13-year pro career with the then-Syracuse Nationals (who became the Philadelphia 76ers in 1963-64), the Sixers, and the Bulls, the swingman appeared in 1,032 total regular season contests, averaging 18.2 points on 47 percent shooting from the floor (his era pre-dated the three-point line), 7.1 rebounds, 2.1 assists, and 0.7 steals. During his final pro season, 1974-75, the small forward was still playing at a high enough level that he finished 16th in MVP voting while leading the Bulls to a 47-35 record and a seven-game Western Conference Finals loss to the eventual champion Golden State Warriors.The 6-foot-7 Bradley product was an All-American twice over during his NCAA days. Syracuse selected him with the No. 14 pick in the second round of the 1962 NBA Draft. He was belatedly inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2012. Walker scored 18831 career regular season points and 1,916 career playoff points.The tributes have already started pouring in for one of the great two-way swingmen of his era.Former 17-year journeyman wing Eddie Johnson, now a broadcaster for the Phoenix Suns, weighed in with his memories of Walker, whom he grew up enjoying during his Bulls tenure. Johnson took an opportunity on his X account to single out Walker's versatile offensive bag.\"I fell in [love] with basketball watching Chet Walker @chicagobulls play,\" Johnson wrote. \"He was not athletic, but had an unreal ability to pump fake guys off their feet and score. True Professional. RIP &#128591;&#127999;.\"Brandon Anderson of The Action Network also weighed in, celebrating Walker as one of the league's less-appreciated classic pre-ABA merger players.\"[Aw] man,\" Anderson wrote. \"Chet Walker is one of my favorite relatively unknown all time greats.\"\"[He] was SO good, and I had so much fun discovering him going back through NBA history. [Really] an underrated great,\" Anderson continued. \"RIP. [The] Chet torched has been passed.\"Longtime WSCR-AM 670 Chicago reporter David Schuster also relayed his thoughts on Walker.\"R.I.P. to Chet Walker,\" Schuster noted. \"One of the great members of those early Bulls teams that made me fall in love with Basketball.\"As coached by Hall of Famer Alex Hannum, that title-winning Sixers roster went 68-13, burning through Oscar Robertson's Cincinnati Royals, Bill Russell's Boston Celtics, and Nate Thurmond's San Francisco Warriors en route to its first league title in Philadelphia. The team boasted five eventual Hall of Famers in Chamberlain, Walker, combo guard Hal Greer, forward Billy Cunningham, and a past-his-prime Larry Costello. Chamberlain, Greer, and Walker were the club's three leading scorers, in that order. It was a stacked group. Elsewhere on that club, point guard Bill Melchionni and big man Luke Jackson also each eventually made All-Star teams.Philadelphia wrote a touching missive on its X account.\"Chet Walker spent the first 7 seasons of his Hall of Fame career with our franchise & delivered a championship in '67. Affectionately nicknamed 'The Jet,' Walker made a profound impact in our city & within our League.\" the Sixers wrote in part.After Chamberlain was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, Walker himself was eventually flipped to Chicago in exchange for Bob Kauffman and Jim Washington in 1969.Walker's defense-first Bulls teams in the 1970s briefly electrified the Chicago Stadium faithful. He was accompanied by fellow All-Stars Norm Van Lier, Jerry Sloan, Bob Love, and, in 1974-75, an aging Nate Thurmond (an eventual Hall of Famer himself, Thurmond was by then past his All-Star prime), creating a ferocious, perimeter-oriented squad that terrified opponents for years and was a frisky playoff out, though it could never get over the hump.Chicago's official X account paid tribute to their fallen hero.\"An inductee of the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame, Chet left an indelible mark on the court and in the hearts of fans,\" the Bulls wrote in part. \"He was a seven-time NBA All-Star and an inaugural member of the Chicago Bulls Ring of Honor. His skill, dedication and contributions to the game made a lasting impact on the sport of basketball and the city of Chicago.\"The Bulls would only make the Finals for the first time in 1991. They had better luck that time.Another huge element of Walker's legacy actually happened off the court, per Harvey Araton of The New York Times. Walker had served as a plaintiff for a groundbreaking antitrust federal lawsuit that the NBA Players' Association, for whom he was a rep, had filed against the league in 1970, led by union president Oscar Robertson, a Hall of Fame point guard then with the Milwaukee Bucks. The case was settled in 1976 and essentially created NBA free agency, albeit in a nascent iteration. Movement via free agency is now a huge part of the NBA's player empowerment era, as free agents seek their fortunes wherever they see fit. But it took brave folks like Robertson and Walker to make it pave the way.Walker had left Chicago ahead of the team's 1975-76 season due to a contract dispute with then-owner Arthur Wirtz. Walker eventually filed an appeal following the Players' Association settlement, frustrated that, in his mind, the agreement did not allow enough player flexibility, and subsequently sued Wirtz and the Bulls. After being informed that, should he ever suit up again, he would have to do so for Chicago, Walker balked and opted to retire for good. He would eventually take on a successful career as a film producer, one heck of a second act.", "summary": "The seven-time All-Star was a beloved swingman for several playoff squads during the pre-merger era of the 1960s and '70s.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/sports/nba/hall-fame-nba-forward-champion-passes-away-age-84-1910125", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2406406/chet-walker-jim-brewer-bulls-cavaliers.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:00:02", "author": "Alex Kirschenbaum", "authors": ["Alex Kirschenbaum"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.104}

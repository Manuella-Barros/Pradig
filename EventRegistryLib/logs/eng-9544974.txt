Photo Courtesy: Special Arrangement\n\nIndian philanthropist and businesswoman Sudha Reddy, hailing from Hyderabad appeared at the prestigious Met Gala 2024, hosted at the Metropolitan\n\nMuseum of Art in New York on May 6. Embracing the theme 'Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion', her red-carpet ensemble was a true reflection of her profound understanding of the theme and the 'Garden Of Time' dress code, following her remarkable debut in 2021.\n\nClad in a custom creation from the esteemed couturier Tarun Tahiliani's atelier, complemented by exquisite jewellery from Farah Khan Ali, Sudha Reddy presented a\n\nred-carpet moment that seamlessly blended timelessness with avant-garde flair. Capturing the fleeting essence of time, the monochromatic ensemble wasn't just couture; it was a masterclass in storytelling and symbolism through fashion. It served as a metaphor for India's artistic revival, mirroring the nation's current creative and cultural boom and showcasing the beauty and depth of Indian craftsmanship and design.\n\nHandcrafted by over 80 artisans over a period of 4,500-man hours, the ivory silk gown was a true testament to collaboration. The hand-corseted bodice featured a miniature self-portrait of Sudha holding a delicate rose, symbolising the promise of hope and peace. The bodice itself was a marvel of meticulous craftsmanship, painstakingly rendered with thousands of French knots, intricate Indian couching embroidery, and shimmering silk threads. Adorning the bodice were hand-carved mother-of-pearl flowers, symbolizing luminosity and permanence, while 3D butterflies symbolized the cycle of life. The flowing drapery of the gown cascaded like unfolding flower petals, embodying the yearning for self-expression.\n\nSymbolising themes of regeneration and transformation, a voluminous cape made of panels of embroidered tulle added a textural element to the hand-crafted mother-of-pearl flowers and crystal shoulder accessory designed by Miodrag Guberini\u0107, known for creating accessories for Lady Gaga and Madonna.\n\nThe centerpiece of Sudha Reddy's ensemble was undoubtedly the 'Amore Eterno' necklace, a stunning masterpiece from her personal collection. This exquisite piece was adorned with 25 exceptional solitaires, totalling over 180 carats, embodying the enduring legacy of the present and future generations of the Reddy family. At the core of the necklace lay a symbolic family tree crafted from four large, heart-shaped diamonds. The largest diamond, a 25-carat King of Hearts, honouring Krishna Reddy, while the Queen of Hearts, a 20-carat heart, symbolising Sudha Reddy. Two additional 20-carat hearts, known as the Prince of\n\nKnowledge and Prince of Treasures, represented their sons, Pranav and Manas.\n\nCompleting this masterpiece were twenty-one luminescent round diamonds, symbolising the shared experiences and cherished moments of Sudha-Krishna's love story. Other jewels included a 20-carat heart shaped diamond ring and a 23-carat yellow diamond ring.\n\nSudha Reddy's elegance extended beyond her outfit with the off-white vintage Chanel clutch from 'Falling For Camellias' collection and custom-made pearl-adorned stilettos. Stylist Gautam Kalra assembled a dream team: celebrity makeup artist Nina Ubhi accentuated her natural beauty with fresh dewy make-up and a clean messy bun accentuated with bejewelled hairpins from Amrapali nail artist Fleury Rose transformed her fingertips into miniature works of art with a cascading white flowers and Swarovski crystals manicure that took 100 hours to create.\n\nSudha Reddy shares, \"It was an incredible evening at the Met Gala 2024! I'm grateful to have received the opportunity to celebrate culture, community and creativity on such a grand scale, once again. Collaborations are what make fashion so exciting! Thank you to everyone who made this possible, from the visionary designers to my management and my glam team.\"\n\nTarun Tahiliani shares, \"It has been a pleasure to collaborate with Sudha Reddy on the custom-make MET outfit and translate the multi-layered theme into a work of art. Sudha's self-portrait on the corset, combined with our signature draping technique and handcrafted embroideries and embellishments, conjures imagery of a blossoming garden, inviting the viewer to embrace authenticity in an ever-changing world. A metaphor for India as a sleeping beauty that is reawakening, the outfit celebrates the timelessness of heritage workmanship, transcendence of temporal boundaries and the eternal cycle of renewal and regeneration.\"\n\nFarah Khan Ali added, \"Crafting the 'Amore Eterno' necklace wasn't just about finding rare diamonds; it was about capturing the essence of love and time. I meticulously searched various corners of the world for these natural diamonds which took months of meticulous planning, designing, high-precision laser cutting and polishing to create the final result. Boasting 180 carats of natural diamonds, Sudha's 'Amore Eterno' necklace mirrors life's cyclical dance, where the past, the present and the future converge.\"", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-day"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarun_Tahiliani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tarun Tahiliani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bodice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_couture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haute couture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jewellery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farah_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Farah Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diamond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Silk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atelier", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atelier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monochrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Symbol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bespoke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bespoke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avant-garde", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avant-garde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artisan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artisan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crystal"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chanel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarovski", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swarovski"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Doll_Making", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Doll Making", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2024/may/MetGala2024SudhaReddy_d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544974", "eventUri": "eng-9544974", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 462, "textEnd": 467}], "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Embracing the theme 'Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion', her red-carpet ensemble was a true reflection of her profound understanding of the theme and the 'Garden Of Time' dress code, following her remarkable debut in 2021.\n\nSudha Reddy, Hyderabad-based businesswoman, captivates in Rs. 2.5 crore worth Tarun Tahiliani couture; carries Rs. 3.34 cr worth vintage Chanel at MET Gala 2024\n\nClad in a custom creation from the esteemed couturier Tarun Tahiliani's atelier worth 30,000 USD, complemented by exquisite jewellery from Farah Khan Ali, Sudha Reddy presented a red-carpet moment that seamlessly blended timelessness with avant-garde flair. Capturing the fleeting essence of time, the monochromatic ensemble wasn't just couture; it was a masterclass in storytelling and symbolism through fashion. It served as a metaphor for India's artistic revival, mirroring the nation's current creative and cultural boom and showcasing the beauty and depth of Indian craftsmanship and design.\n\nHandcrafted by over 80 artisans over a period of 4500-man hours, the ivory silk gown was a true testament to collaboration. The hand-corseted bodice featured a miniature self-portrait of Sudha holding a delicate rose, symbolizing the promise of hope and peace. The bodice itself was a marvel of meticulous craftsmanship, painstakingly rendered with thousands of French knots, intricate Indian couching embroidery, and shimmering silk threads.\n\nAdorning the bodice were hand-carved mother-of-pearl flowers, symbolizing luminosity and permanence, while 3D butterflies symbolized the cycle of life. The flowing drapery of the gown cascaded like unfolding flower petals, embodying the yearning for self-expression. Symbolizing themes of regeneration and transformation, a voluminous cape made of panels of embroidered tulle added a textural element to the hand-crafted mother-of-pearl flowers and crystal shoulder accessory designed by Miodrag Guberini\u0107, known for creating accessories for Lady Gaga and Madonna.\n\nThe centerpiece of Sudha Reddy's ensemble was undoubtedly the 'Amore Eterno' necklace, a stunning masterpiece from her personal collection. This exquisite piece was adorned with 25 exceptional solitaires, totalling over 180 carats, embodying the enduring legacy of the present and future generations of the Reddy family. At the core of the necklace lay a symbolic family tree crafted from four large, heart-shaped diamonds. The largest diamond, a 25-carat King of Hearts, honoring Krishna Reddy, while the Queen of Hearts, a 20-carat heart, symbolizing Sudha Reddy. Two additional 20-carat hearts, known as the Prince of Knowledge and Prince of Treasures, represented their sons, Pranav and Manas. Completing this masterpiece were twenty-one luminescent round diamonds, symbolizing the shared experiences and cherished moments of Sudha-Krishna's love story. Other jewels included a 20-carat heart shaped diamond ring and a 23-carat yellow diamond ring.\n\nSudha Reddy's elegance extended beyond her outfit with the off-white vintage Chanel clutch worth 40,000 USD from 'Falling For Camellias' collection and custom-made pearl-adorned stilettos. Stylist Gautam Kalra assembled a dream team: celebrity makeup artist Nina Ubhi accentuated her natural beauty with fresh dewy make-up and a clean messy bun accentuated with bejewelled hairpins from Amrapali nail artist Fleury Rose transformed her fingertips into miniature works of art with a cascading white flowers and Swarovski crystals manicure that took 100 hours to create.\n\nSudha Reddy said, \"It was an incredible evening at the Met Gala 2024! I'm grateful to have received the opportunity to celebrate culture, community and creativity on such a grand scale, once again. Collaborations are what make fashion so exciting! Thank you to everyone who made this possible, from the visionary designers to my management and my glam team.\"\n\nTarun Tahiliani added, \"It has been a pleasure to collaborate with Sudha Reddy on the custom-make MET outfit and translate the multi-layered theme into a work of art. Sudha's self-portrait on the corset, combined with our signature draping technique and handcrafted embroideries and embellishments, conjures imagery of a blossoming garden, inviting the viewer to embrace authenticity in an ever-changing world. A metaphor for India as a sleeping beauty that is reawakening, the outfit celebrates the timelessness of heritage workmanship, transcendence of temporal boundaries and the eternal cycle of renewal and regeneration.\"\n\nFarah Khan Ali said, \"Crafting the 'Amore Eterno' necklace wasn't just about finding rare diamonds; it was about capturing the essence of love and time. I meticulously searched various corners of the world for these natural diamonds which took months of meticulous planning, designing, high-precision laser cutting and polishing to create the final result. Boasting 180 carats of natural diamonds, Sudha's 'Amore Eterno' necklace mirrors life's cyclical dance, where the past, the present and the future converge.\"\\ Through the Sudha Reddy Foundation and her collaborations with esteemed organizations like UNICEF, the Global Gift Foundation, the Cancer Research Foundation, Fight Hunger Foundation, and Action Against Hunger, Reddy actively works to empower women and children, and promote healthcare and education on a global scale. Her efforts have made a significant impact in these areas, showcasing her dedication to creating positive change in the world.\n\nIn addition to her philanthropic work, Sudha Reddy has made notable appearances at prestigious events such as Paris Haute Couture Week, Fashion 4 Development Awards, Cannes Film Festival, Global Gift Gala, UN General Assembly and the White House Correspondents Dinner, amongst others. Her presence at these events further solidifies her reputation as a respected leader and advocate for important causes.\n\nALSO READ: Sudha Reddy, Hyderabad-based philanthropist to attend Met Gala

No points for guessing that many influential celebrities participated in the 'The Garden Of Time' theme and exhibition launch at the Costume Institute titled, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\". While co-hosts Jennifer Lopez and Zendaya stunned the internet with their jaw-dropping looks, the desi representation by Alia Bhatt, Natasha Poonawala and the celebrated designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee was on point as well.\n\nHowever, one person who grabbed many eyeballs was Sudha Reddy. Not just her outfit but her jewellery made many reach for their sunglasses! Well, the hyderabad-based businesswoman wore diamonds well over 200 carats.\n\nDressed in a bespoke ensemble by Tarun Tahiliani, Sudha captivated attention with her attire inspired by the 'Garden Of Time' motif. The ivory silk gown, meticulously crafted by a team of 80 artisans, consumed 4,500 hours of labor. Adorned with a corseted bodice, the gown showcased a miniature self-portrait of Sudha, delicately holding a rose.\n\nSharing pictures on her Instagram handle, Sudha wrote, \"Engaging with the theme, 'Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,' my ensemble created lovingly by Tarun Tahiliani resonates with India's current cultural renaissance. Imbued with meticulous craftsmanship and profound symbolism, it narrates an artistic saga transcending the realms of haute couture, a tale of heartfelt collaboration.\"\n\n\"Handcrafted by over 80 artisans over 4500-man hours, the ivory silk gown epitomized the talents of master artisans. Its meticulously rendered bodice, adorned with hand-carved mother-of-pearl flowers and symbolic 3D butterflies, flowed gracefully, embodying the essence of self-expression through its cascading drapery.\"\n\n\"Each detail, from the handcrafted motifs to the luminous jewels by Farah Khan Ali, encapsulates the promise of hope and the enduring legacy of craftsmanship. A celebration of beauty, culture, and the eternal spirit of fashion,\" she added.\n\nsudha reddy/instagram\n\nAside from Sudha Reddy's stunning attire, all eyes were drawn to her remarkable 180-carat diamond necklace named 'Amore Eterno.' This statement piece boasts a 25-carat heart-shaped diamond, symbolizing Sudha herself, accompanied by three more 20-carat heart-shaped diamonds representing her husband and their two children. To complement this extraordinary necklace, she adorned a 23-carat diamond solitaire ring and another 20-carat diamond solitaire ring, with an estimated value of $20 million, as reported by Page Six.\n\nIn her Instagram post, Sudha conveyed that the necklace symbolizes the enduring legacy of the Reddy family, serving as a testament to artisanal excellence.\n\nSudha Reddy, wife of India-based billionaire Megha Krishna Reddy, is a philanthropist.\n\nHailing from Vijayawada, Sudha Reddy entered into matrimony with Krishna Reddy at the age of 19, a bond she attributes to their shared upbringing, which has only fortified their relationship. Alongside being a devoted mother to her two children, Manas and Pranav, Sudha holds a directorial position at MEIL(Megha Engineering And Infrastructure Limited). Furthermore, she spearheads the Sudha Reddy Foundation, actively engaging in the company's philanthropic initiatives.\n\nsudha reddy/instagram\n\nRegarded as one of India Inc's prominent philanthropists, Sudha Reddy advocates for a more inclusive approach to billionaire philanthropy. Transitioning from traditional \"cheque philanthropy\" to more active \"hands-on philanthropy,\" the Sudha Reddy Foundation has made significant strides in socially and economically empowering thousands of individuals in Telangana.\n\nWhen she isn't leading the Megha Group Of Industries and TruJet Airlines, Sudha focuses her efforts on promoting affordable healthcare and accessible education.\n\nRecognized for her generous spirit, her philanthropic philosophy draws inspiration from the late Princess Diana.\n\nA prominent figure in Hyderabad, Sudha Reddy is frequently seen mingling with celebrities like Paris Hilton, Eva Longoria, Elizabeth Hurley, Anna Wintour, and a constellation of Hollywood stars and influential leaders from around the world. Whether attending the Global Gift Gala, the MET Gala 2021, Paris Couture Week, or the First Ladies Luncheon, Sudha Reddy consistently makes a memorable impression with her striking red-carpet

It featured a 180-carat diamond centerpiece along with a 25-carat heart-shaped diamond and three additional 20-carat heart-shaped diamonds, each symbolizing a member of her family.\n\nIn addition to her exquisite \"Amore Eterno\" necklace, Reddy's radiant attire was further enhanced by two diamond solitaire rings: one of 23 carats and another of 20 carats, reportedly. The combined worth of these pieces is estimated to be around a staggering $20M. Complementing her jewelry was a custom-embroidered gown that reportedly required about six months or approximately 4,500 hours of labor to complete.\n\nDraped in an ethereal white gown, Reddy embodied the essence of a fairy tale princess, perfectly echoing the theme of \"The Garden of Time\" at this year's Met Gala. Her off-shoulder ensemble hugged her figure gracefully, adorned with a sweeping train that added a touch of drama to her entrance on the red carpet. This marked Reddy's second appearance at the prestigious event, underlining her steadfast commitment to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's mission of promoting and preserving the arts.\n\nReddy, in a conversation with Hello! India in 2021, expressed her love for jewelry and haute couture. \"Jewelry is an essential part of my lifestyle. I love anything OTT (Over The Top) and haute couture.\" She further revealed that most South Indian households have a strong affinity toward jewelry and she considers herself an avid connoisseur. Reddy also praised jewelry designers Farah Khan and Gautam Banerjee who have created bespoke pieces for her in the past, too.\n\nBeyond the glitz and glamor of the Met Gala, the socialite and business tycoon is actively championing various humanitarian causes, collaborating with organizations such as UNICEF and the Global Gift Foundation, with a particular focus on healthcare and hunger relief efforts.", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carat_(mass)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carat (mass)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diamond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jewellery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_tale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fairy tale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-top_media_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over-the-top media service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farah_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Farah Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Socialite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello!_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hello!

Hailing from the land of the Nizams, it makes perfect sense that the businesswoman's personal jewellery probably outshined its rivals borrowed by stars from prestigious jewellery houses for the night. It was a show of true Indian regalia. Reddy made her way on the legendary red carpet of fashion's biggest next night for the second time now, having made her debut at the event in 2021.\n\nPaying tribute to the Met theme and exhibition launched at the Costume Institute titled, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" Reddy, chose an elaborate ivory silk gown designed by Tarun Tahiliani. Featuring elaborate embroidery like delicate French knots, 3D butterflies, and couching, the dress and the trailing cape attached to it were realised by a team of 80 artisans over a period of 4500 man hours. According to the designer, the gown was inspired by old Mughal gardens and features a hand-embroidered image of Mughal royalty on the corset. Designed in Tahiliani's signature muted, beige-gold colour palette, Reddy's look was crafted to look like an antique heirloom in resonance with the theme of the Met Gala this year, which will feature rarely seen historical garments that are too fragile to be worn again. Styled by Gautaum Kalra, Reddy added a crystal shoulder accessory designed by Miodrag Guberini\u0107, who has previously crafted accessories for the likes of Lady Gaga and Madonna. The entrepreneur chose an off-white vintage Chanel clutch from the Falling For Camellias collection to make her way on the red carpet.\n\nBut the shiniest detail of Reddy's look wasn't just the outfit, but the jewellery she paired with her look. While most personalities arrive at the Met red carpet wearing shining jewels borrowed from reputed jewellery houses, Reddy chose this moment to air out her heirloom baubles -- and it doesn't get any better than the Met red carpet to show off your jewels.\n\nThe 'Amore Eterno' necklace features 25 solitaires, totalling over 180 carats, that has been crafted as a marker of the Reddy family legacy to be handed down to future generations. At the core of the necklace lay a symbolic family tree crafted from four large, heart-shaped diamonds. The largest diamond, a 25-carat King of Hearts, honours Reddy's husband Krishna, while the Queen of Hearts, a 20-carat heart diamond, symbolises Sudha Reddy. Two additional 20-carat hearts, known as the Prince of Knowledge and Prince of Treasures, represent their sons, Pranav and Manas. Completing this necklace are 21 luminescent round diamonds, symbolising the shared experiences and cherished moments of Sudha and Krishna's love story. While this may be the piece de resistance of Reddy's look, it doesn't end there. To top off this extravagant affair, Reddy added a 20-carat heart-shaped diamond ring and a 23-carat yellow diamond ring to complete her Met-ready look. While on the road to going the extra mile for fashion's biggest night, don't forget to take a closer look at Reddy's Swarovski and floral manicure, that took 100 hours to create.\n\nThe businesswoman is a well-known leader in the business world. She served as the director of Megha Engineering And Infrastructure Limited and is also recognized for her extensive philanthropic work. For her first-ever appearance at the Met Gala back in 2021, Reddy chose a bespoke Falguni Shane Peacock gown that also featured an exaggerated train. She will be forging a more strategic association with the Met Museum this year to support the arts.\n\nReddy's debut Falguni and Shane Peacock gown was inspired by the theme 'In America: A Lexicon of Fashion'. Her gown featured elements of the American Flag with 3D embellishments executed in Swarovski Crystals. From the stars of the flag to the colours of red, blue and gold, the electric creation took a staggering 250 hours to execute and was paired with a custom jewellery piece made by the designer Farah Khan. Named 'Dreamy Decadence', it was crafted in 18-karat gold with diamond-encrusted stars.", "source": {"uri": "vogue.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vogue India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@vogue.in", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarun_Tahiliani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tarun Tahiliani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jewellery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diamond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizam_of_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nizam of Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heirloom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heirloom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regalia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Regalia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artisan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artisan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embroidery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Embroidery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mughal garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madonna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_of_Hearts_(Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mughal Empire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Resonance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chanel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "3D computer graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crystal"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farah_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Farah Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarovski", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swarovski"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Knitting_and_Crochet", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Knitting and Crochet", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Dollhouse_Miniatures", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Dollhouse Miniatures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://assets.vogue.in/photos/6639d9b43bb8b18e8b447f64/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/JM200219_C7tb1hRS.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544974", "eventUri": "eng-9544974", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

For the event, she wore an ivory silk gown custom made by Indian deisgner Tarun Tahiliani. The handcrafted dress - which featured a corseted bodice with a mini portrait of Reddy - took more than 4,500 people to complete.\n\nIf the entrepreneur's embroidered white gown wasn't impressive enough, it was Reddy's 180-carat diamond necklace that stole the show. According to Town & Country magazine, the jaw-dropping piece is called the \"Amore Eterno\" and was gifted to Reddy by her husband for their 25th wedding anniversary.\n\nThe necklace is worth a whopping $10m and features four large, heart-shaped diamonds connected by 21 luminescent round diamonds. Speaking to the outlet, Reddy explained that she crafted the piece with the help of jewellery designer Farah Khan Ali.\n\n\"The largest of the four heart-shaped diamonds represents my husband, Krishna, while the next one is myself, and the other two adjacent ones represent our sons, Pranav and Manas,\" she said. \"The necklace, for me, stands for an everlasting bond of love and connection. I think it matches my heart-shaped ring well and I'm always about the passion and positivity so it's natural for the hearts to be my favorite designs.\"\n\nIn addition to her diamond necklace, Reddy wore two rings to the Met Gala - one with a 23-carat yellow diamond and another with 20-carat heart-shaped diamond - also both from her personal collection.\n\nThe philanthropist noted that her Met Gala ensemble was meant to serve as a metaphor for India's artistic revival by showcasing handcrafted Indian design. \"The outfit conjures imagery of a blossoming garden, inviting the viewer to embrace authenticity in an ever-changing world,\" Reddy said. \"A metaphor for India as a sleeping beauty that is reawakening, the outfit celebrates the timelessness of heritage workmanship, transcendence of temporal boundaries and the eternal cycle of renewal and regeneration.\"\n\nReddy has been a longtime supporter of the Met Costume Institute and the museum's South Asian arts programming. She attended her first Met Gala in 2021, celebrating its \"In America: A Lexicon Of Fashion\" exhibit, where she wore a Falguni Shane Peacock Haute Couture gown.\n\nThis year, the theme for the Met Gala was \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\". The fashion extravaganza coincided with the opening of the Costume Institute's exhibit, which is centred around 50 historically significant pieces of fashion - some too fragile ever to be worn again. Nearly 250 items were drawn from the Costume Institute's permanent collection, featuring designs from Elsa Schiaparelli, Yves Saint Laurent, Christian Dior, and Givenchy to span 400 years of fashion history.\n\nMuch like every year, this year's Met Gala also came with its own dress code, loosely labelled \"The Garden of Time\". The dress code takes inspiration from a short story of the same title, written by JG Ballard in 1962, which focuses on the theme of fleeting beauty. Attendees were encouraged to wear items that captured the essence of the short story - such as florals to represent an actual garden, or items that signify the passing of time like clocks and sand.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diamond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Krishna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jewellery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_&_Country_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Town & Country (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarun_Tahiliani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tarun Tahiliani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bodice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Music video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embroidery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Embroidery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farah_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Farah Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsa_Schiaparelli", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elsa Schiaparelli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_fashion_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "History of fashion design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sleeping Beauty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Dior", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Dior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour_Costume_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour Costume Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Givenchy", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Givenchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yves_Saint_Laurent_(designer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yves Saint Laurent (designer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Doll_Making", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Doll Making", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/199b2f31d136ac070f5c6e0e2558167b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544974", "eventUri": "eng-9544974", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 317, "textEnd": 322}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Capturing the fleeting essence of time, the monochromatic ensemble wasn't just couture; it was a masterclass in storytelling and symbolism through fashion. It served as a metaphor for India's artistic revival, mirroring the nation's current creative and cultural boom and showcasing the beauty and depth of Indian craftsmanship and design.\n\nHandcrafted by over 80 artisans over a period of 4500-man hours, the ivory silk gown was a true testament to collaboration. The hand-corseted bodice featured a miniature self-portrait of Sudha holding a delicate rose, symbolizing the promise of hope and peace. The bodice itself was a marvel of meticulous craftsmanship, painstakingly rendered with thousands of French knots, intricate Indian couching embroidery, and shimmering silk threads. Adorning the bodice were hand-carved mother-of-pearl flowers, symbolizing luminosity and permanence, while 3D butterflies symbolized the cycle of life. The flowing drapery of the gown cascaded like unfolding flower petals, embodying the yearning for self-expression. Symbolizing themes of regeneration and transformation, a voluminous cape made of panels of embroidered tulle added a textural element to the hand-crafted mother-of-pearl flowers and crystal shoulder accessory designed by Miodrag Guberini\u0107, known for creating accessories for Lady Gaga and Madonna.\n\nThe centrepiece of Sudha Reddy's ensemble was undoubtedly the 'Amore Eterno' necklace, a stunning masterpiece from her personal collection. This exquisite piece was adorned with 25 exceptional solitaires, totalling over 180 carats, embodying the enduring legacy of the present and future generations of the Reddy family. At the core of the necklace lay a symbolic family tree crafted from four large, heart-shaped diamonds. The largest diamond, a 25-carat King of Hearts, honouring Krishna Reddy, while the Queen of Hearts, a 20-carat heart, symbolizing Sudha Reddy. Two additional 20-carat hearts, known as the Prince of Knowledge and Prince of Treasures, represented their sons, Pranav and Manas.

Amidst the theme of 'Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion' and the 'Garden Of Time' dress code, Reddy's red-carpet ensemble transcended mere fashion, offering a profound narrative steeped in Indian craftsmanship and heritage.\n\nDesigned by the renowned couturier Tarun Tahiliani, Reddy's custom creation was a masterpiece of collaboration and creativity. Crafted over 4500-man hours by more than 80 artisans, the ivory silk gown boasted intricate details that wove together symbolism and storytelling. From the hand-corseted bodice adorned with a miniature self-portrait of Reddy holding a delicate rose to the cascading drapery that mimicked unfolding flower petals, every element spoke volumes about India's artistic revival and cultural richness.\n\nThe gown's bodice was a marvel of meticulous craftsmanship, featuring thousands of French knots, intricate Indian couching embroidery, and shimmering silk threads. Adorned with hand-carved mother-of-pearl flowers and 3D butterflies, it symbolized luminosity, permanence, and the cycle of life. The voluminous cape, crafted from embroidered tulle panels, added a textural dimension to the ensemble, further accentuated by a crystal shoulder accessory designed by Miodrag Guberini\u0107, famed for his work with icons like Lady Gaga and Madonna.\n\nHowever, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance of Reddy's ensemble was undoubtedly the 'Amore Eterno' necklace from her personal collection. Adorned with 25 exceptional solitaires totaling over 180 carats, the necklace embodied the enduring legacy of the Reddy family. At its core lay a symbolic family tree crafted from four large, heart-shaped diamonds, each representing a member of the family. The meticulous design and craftsmanship behind the necklace mirrored life's cyclical dance, where the past, present, and future converge in an eternal embrace.\n\nBeyond her attire, Reddy's elegance extended to every detail. With an off-white vintage Chanel clutch and custom-made pearl-adorned stilettos, she exuded sophistication and grace. Her makeup, executed by celebrity artist Nina Ubhi, accentuated her natural beauty, while a clean messy bun adorned with bejeweled hairpins from Amrapali added a touch of regal charm. Even her manicure, a masterpiece by nail artist Fleury Rose featuring cascading white flowers and Swarovski crystals, took 100 hours to create.\n\nIn reflecting on the evening, Reddy expressed gratitude for the opportunity to celebrate culture, community, and creativity on a grand scale. Her collaborators, including Tarun Tahiliani and Farah Khan Ali, echoed her sentiments, emphasizing the transformative power of fashion and the enduring allure of heritage craftsmanship. Through her stunning appearance at the Met Gala, Sudha Reddy not only captivated the audience but also cemented her status as a beacon of style and cultural pride.", "source": {"uri": "thehansindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hans India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "askari_jaffer@thehansindia.com", "name": "Askari Jaffer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bodice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_couture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haute couture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embroidery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Embroidery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulle_(netting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tulle (netting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madonna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarun_Tahiliani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tarun Tahiliani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drapery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drapery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ivory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarn", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yarn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "3D computer graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crystal"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farah_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Farah Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chanel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarovski", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swarovski"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Beading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Beading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Basketry", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Basketry", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Doll_Making", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Doll Making", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2024/05/08/1444741-w.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544974", "eventUri": "eng-9544974", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Krishna Reddy -- stepped out on the red carpet of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in an ivory silk gown that features dozens of flowers, embroidered flowers and a hand-corseted bodice with a tiny self-portrait of herself holding a rose.\n\nComplementing her dress, the centerpiece of her look is her massive, glimmering \"Amore Eterno\" necklace. Estimated to be worth about $10 million, the piece is from the billionaire's personal jewelry collection.\n\nAccording to a press release, the necklace features 25 diamond solitaires that total more than 180 carats. The jewelry piece also includes one 25-carat and three 20-carat heart-shaped diamonds, connected by 21 more round diamonds.\n\nReddy's dress is also a work of art, designed by Indian couturier Tarun Tahiliani. It features \"hand-carved mother-of-pearl flowers, symbolizing luminosity and permanence, while 3D butterflies symbolize the cycle of life,\" according to the release. The dress' silk draping alludes to flower petals, a nod to this year's dress code \"The Garden of Time,\" inspired by a short story by J. G. Ballard.\n\nCatch All the Minute-by-Minute Fashion Updates from the 2024 Met Gala Red Carpet Right Here!\n\nReddy's hand-crafted gown was worked on by over 80 artisans and took more than 4,500 hours to create. The dress was paired with a massive embroidered cape made from tulle and crystal shoulder accessories from designer Miodrag Guberini\u0107, who has also created similar looks for Lady Gaga and Madonna over the years.\n\nReddy's look was completed with long, glittering nails adorned with white flowers and Swarovski crystals, from New-York based nail artist Fleury Rose.\n\nThe billionaire first made her Met Gala debut in 2021. Per reports from the Hindustan Times that year, she sported a star-spangled, golden gown from designer Falguni Shane Peacock in honor of that year's \"In America: A Lexicon of Fashion\" theme.\n\nThe dress featured a train adorned with Swarovski crystals, sequins and bugle beads, and her bodice included gold and silver sequins. She completed the look with a pair of golden Chanel high heels.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diamond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Silk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jewellery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Krishna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embroidery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Embroidery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Ballard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

The PDP president termed the registration of the FIR against her as \u201camusing\u201d. \u201cAmusing to find an FIR filed against me for apparently flouting MCC. This is the price PDP has paid for speaking truth to power. Our protest was against GOI in cahoots with local administration for detaining hundreds of PDP polling agents and workers in the hours leading up to voting,\u201d she said. \u201cStill not satisfied the same administration went onto launch Cordon and Search Operations in traditional PDP stronghold areas to terrorise our voters and prevent them from exercising their right to vote.

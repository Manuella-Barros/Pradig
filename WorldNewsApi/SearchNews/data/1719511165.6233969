Once a favourite haunt of Parisians, the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es has in recent years been steadily abandoned by local people as popular stores and cinemas have given way to luxury boutiques and the avenue has become the preserve of wealthy tourists. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of telling Parisians: \u2018Come back to the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es,\u2019 to show them that the avenue isn\u2019t just for high-end shopping,\u201d said Marc-Antoine Jamet, head of the 180-member Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es committee that organised the event. About 273,000 people applied to take part in \u201cle grand pique-nique\u201d, with 4,400 selected to sit with up to six guests each on a 216 metre-long red-and-white checked picnic blanket, described by organisers as \u201cthe world\u2019s largest tablecloth\u201d. Eight partner restaurants \u2013 including the revered Fouquet\u2019s brasserie, for decades a haunt of French film and music stars \u2013 provided meals for two separate sittings ranging from ham baguettes to caesar salads, crudit\u00e9s and macarons. \u201cThousands of people picnicking on one of the world\u2019s best-known avenues, within sight of the Arc de Triomphe \u2013 that\u2019s a true popular and gourmet celebration,\u201d said the event\u2019s guest of honour, the former \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace chef Guillaume Gomez. Picnickers were enthusiastic. \u201cThe sky\u2019s blue, the sun\u2019s out, we\u2019re sitting in the middle of the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. We\u2019re pretty lucky, no?\u201d Fabien, who had travelled in specially from outside Paris with his wife, Michelle, told BFM TV. \u201cAnd the picnic\u2019s really good \u2013 I got a Ladur\u00e9e macaron,\u201d said L\u00e9o, 14. The committee has repeatedly warned that the iconic avenue has \u201clost its splendour\u201d over the past 30 years, falling victim to changing consumer habits but also crises including the gilets jaunes (\u201cyellow jackets\u201d) protests and the pandemic. Last year it transformed the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es into an open-air mass dictation fest with 1,800 desks laid out along its length in another exercise aimed at \u201cre-enchanting\u201d Parisians with the avenue, the backdrop to countless films. It has, however, been many years since \u2013 as the French-American singer Joe Dassin crooned in a celebrated song in the late 1960s, when the avenue was at the height of its popularity \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019ll find everything you want on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\u201d. The avenue\u2019s last cinema, the UGC Normandie, which opened in 1937, will close next month, the third cinema to shut in recent years amid declining ticket sales and what UGC called a \u201csignificant change\u201d in the demographic of Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es visitors. As entertainment venues and book, record and clothing stores have vanished, they have been steadily replaced with luxury and upmarket sporting goods outlets, for whom an address on the avenue retains considerable pulling power \u2013 particularly for tourists. The French luxury group LVMH \u2013 owners of Louis Vuitton and Dior \u2013 paid more than \u20ac1bn for its recently acquired head store on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, according to estate agents, with surveys showing up to a quarter of all visits to the avenue are now dedicated to luxury-brand shopping. Ronan Guevel, who has lived off the avenue for more than 20 years, told France Info radio: \u201cWhen I was young we used to like going out [to the cinema] on the Champs. There must have been seven or eight on the avenue. Now the last one\u2019s going.\u201d Another cinema had recently been replaced by a Lacoste sportswear store, Guevel said: \u201cThe shops and venues Parisians used to use have been replaced by brands you can find pretty much anywhere. The Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es are losing a bit of their soul.\u201d With more than 1.3 million people strolling along the avenue every month property prices have soared, forcing smaller independent and less profitable shops and venues to hand back their keys in the face of rents that have risen 15% in the past year alone. \u201cProperty speculation is the big issue,\u201d said Paris councillor Nicolas Bonnet-Oulaldj. \u201cThe price per square metre is simply too high. We\u2019re going to have to call on the government for help in regulating and restraining rents in this part of the city.\u201d Paris city hall is working on a \u20ac250m (\u00a3225m) plan aimed at turning an eight-lane urban highway into an \u201cextraordinary garden\u201d, but the bulk of the work is not due to start until after this summer\u2019s Olympic Games. Some minor improvements to the avenue are also being made before the Olympics, with terraces rearranged along its length and more space allocated to pedestrians. The Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es committee is itself due on Monday to present a 1,800-page report on 150 suggestions for reimagining the boulevard, aimed at \u201cguiding a more radical and wholesale transformation\u201d of the neighbourhood, Jamet said.", "summary": "<p>Event aims to reverse decline in local people visiting boulevard, which has become hub for wealthy tourists and designer stores</p><p>More than 4,000 people have gathered on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es for a giant free picnic organised by a committee of local traders and businesses fighting to halt the slow decline of the boulevard long known as \u201cthe most beautiful avenue in the world\u201d.</p><p>Once a favourite haunt of Parisians, the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es has in recent years been steadily abandoned by local people as popular stores and cinemas have given way to luxury boutiques and the avenue has become the preserve of wealthy tourists.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/26/thousands-of-parisians-free-picnic-on-the-champs-elysees\">Continue reading...</a>", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/26/thousands-of-parisians-free-picnic-on-the-champs-elysees", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07332bc07a3446cd6003d1998a6c9c0422cd69eb/0_0_5952_3571/master/5952.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmY", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:30:22", "author": "Jon Henley", "authors": ["Jon Henley"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.426}

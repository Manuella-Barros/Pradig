{"id": 225001474, "title": "Book Review: Joyce Carol Oates&#8217; novel &#8216;Butcher&#8217; is a reflection on women&#8217;s agency over their bodies", "text": "Now well into her 80s, prolific American author Joyce Carol Oates keeps cranking out the books, most recently the disturbing novel \u201cButcher.\u201d The author of more than 50 novels, including \u201cBlonde, \u201d a fictional account of the life of Marilyn Monroe, Oates has often drawn from historical people and events. In \u201cButcher,\u201d she pulls from the authentic documents of 19th century doctors to describe the horrific medical experiments of that time. The novel tells the story of Dr. Silas Aloysius Weir, through his eldest son and the doctor\u2019s own medical journals during his 35 years as director of New Jersey State Asylum for Female Lunatics in the mid- to late 1880s. Weir, who comes to be known as the \u201cFather of Gyno-Psychiatry,\u201d practices grotesque experiments on women who have been marginalized by society at the asylum in Trenton, where he is banished as a beginning doctor who failed at his first experimental surgery to correct an infant\u2019s misshapen skull. Most of his subjects are women who have been declared insane and locked away at the asylum. Weir gets a job at the institution because it is run by a cousin, then rises to become asylum director when his kinsman dies. At a time when it was believed that a woman\u2019s emotions came from her female organs and a man\u2019s emotions came from his brain, Weir performs a female circumcision on a teen who goes on to kill herself and sterilizes women from races or families he considers to be prone to \u201cimmoral & criminal behavior.\u201d He also performs surgeries to correct a fistula, a perforation in the urinary tract usually caused by a difficult pregnancy, on a teenaged indentured servant he becomes obsessed with. Weir\u2019s opinions about women, and mentally ill women in particular, are rife with misogyny and tied largely to their looks. \u201cIn the female in particular, a disheveled appearance, untidy hair & broken fingernails, a strong body odor, above all a failure to dress suitably, including corsetry, were certain symptoms of madness, which the least trained of physicians could identify,\u201d he writes in his journals. Drawing on some themes common in her past books, like sexual abuse and hunger for power, \u201cButcher\u201d also examines the agency girls and women have \u2014 or don\u2019t have \u2014 over their own bodies amid the current political debates around reproductive rights in a post-Roe v. Wade world. Brigit, the indentured adolescent from Ireland who Weir experiments with, is deaf and mute. That makes her an especially attractive victim without control over her situation in life and unable to communicate. The teenager\u2019s experiences show us not only the lack of agency girls and women had in the 19th century, but serves as a reminder of the battles still fought for female autonomy today. ___ AP book reviews: https://apnews.com/hub/book-reviews Anita Snow, The Associated Press", "summary": "Now well into her 80s, prolific American author Joyce Carol Oates keeps cranking out the books, most recently the disturbing novel \u201cButcher.\u201d The author of more than 50 novels, including \u201cBlonde, \u201d a fictional account of the life of Marilyn Monroe, Oates has often drawn from historical people and events.

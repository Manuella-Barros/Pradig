{"id": 223731478, "title": "HK$48,430 for roasted pork lunchbox: Taiwan fines passenger from Hong Kong for bringing in banned meat", "text": "An Indonesian passenger travelling from Hong Kong to Taiwan has been deported after being unable to pay a NT$200,000 (HK$48,430) fine for bringing in a lunchbox with roasted pork, contravening import regulations, local media has reported. The traveller arrived in Taipei on April 30 with the lunchbox containing a combination of Cantonese-style roasted meats, news outlets reported on Sunday. From a picture posted online, the food included rice with roast pork and soy sauce chicken, both typical Cantonese dishes. A customs detector dog sniffed out the contraband and alerted its handlers. The visitor, said to be a man, was fined NT$200,000 on the spot for the undeclared pork. But as he was unable to pay the penalty immediately, he was deported and instructed to settle the fine before entering Taiwan again, the media reports said. Taiwanese authorities have imposed strict controls on the import of pork from areas where cases of African swine fever have been detected since 2018. The fine for a first offence is NT$200,000, increasing to NT$1 million for subsequent transgressions.", "summary": "Traveller was carrying lunchbox filled with Cantonese-style meats, including pork, which is banned due to African swine fever concerns.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3264180/hk48430-roasted-pork-lunchbox-taiwan-fines-passenger-hong-kong-bringing-banned-meat", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/05/26/d1f09c92-34d8-434e-bb8c-27ca125c0c8d_085a03be.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:02:47", "author": "A.

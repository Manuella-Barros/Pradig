And that didn\u2019t sit well with Eagle Mountain Casino based in Porterville. The casino said the show was sold out and Lopez ended it 30 minutes early because of hecklers. The casino lashed out at Lopez and said \u201chis own private security that could have easily escorted any hecklers out.\u201d Prior to the show, Eagle Mountain said casino staff and Lopez\u2019s staff had a preshow meeting in case of any hecklers. \u201cHe could have provided us an opportunity to allow our security and team to escort any hecklers out since his own private security did not,\u201d the casino wrote on Facebook. The Friday night show was previously rescheduled from an April show that was postponed due to a medical emergency. \u201cTonight we went above and beyond to provide George with first class service from his arrival to the property to the start of his show. \u201cWe never want to let our guests down and we are as disappointed and shocked as you are.\u201d Lopez\u2019s team told TMZ that they place the blame on the venue. \u201cIt\u2019s the venue or casino\u2019s job to provide a good experience for both the artist and the fans, but the casino failed in this regard. The audience was overserved and unruly, and the casino staff was unable to provide a safe and enjoyable experience for the artist and guests. \u201cGeorge\u2019s personal security team worked with the venue security staff to maintain order, ensure safety, and eject disruptive individuals. Unfortunately, the casino security team was not adequate to accomplish this task. George is not obligated to perform in an unsafe environment. He feels badly that those who came to see the show were unable to do so as a result.\u201d The casino told The Bee they\u2019ll have an official statement on Sunday or Monday. Casino followers chimed in with comments on social media and even said \u201cdon\u2019t invite him back.\u201d Another said \u201cI\u2019ve heard that he is not worth having anymore that he does this kind of stuff. You guys are first class all the way. Sorry it happened.\u201d Fans paid at least $65 to see Lopez.", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/george-lopez-walks-show-ends-023220287.html", "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/fresno_bee_mcclatchy_articles_660/5b9e858e93a79591de3a076f6023fabe", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:41:33", "author": "Anthony Galaviz", "authors": ["Anthony Galaviz"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.311}

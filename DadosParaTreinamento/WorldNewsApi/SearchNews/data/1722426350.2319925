Dougie Brown, longstanding festival producer at Belladrum said: \u201cWe are delighted that Tomatin are marking our 20th anniversary with this very special bottling of a rare single cask. \u201cThe Tomatin Bothy has been one of the highlights of the festival for many years now featuring their award winning whisky, popup sessions from artists, and of course their incredible cocktails. We will see you at the Bothy and raise a glass to 20 years of Bella!\u201d Describing the new whisky, a Tomatin spokesperson said: \u201cThis whisky has been matured in a first-fill Oloroso Sherry cask for over twenty years. The label design has been curated by Belladrum designer Michael Forbes and pays homage to this year\u2019s festival theme: Love. \u201cThe result is a truly unique dram that epitomises the exceptional craftsmanship, tradition and quality of Tomatin\u2019s Highland malt, bringing together decadent, rich flavours imparted from the Oloroso cask, a favourite among whisky lovers. \u201cThe nose is full of spice and burnt orange; a mix of cinnamon, clove, ginger and flamed orange peel. Baked bananas drizzled in rich caramel sauce with an underlying oaky character. \u201cBlack tea like tannins and flavours of dried apricot and mango bring flavours reminiscent of peach iced tea. This will be excellent over an ice ball on a warm day at the Belladrum Tomatin Bothy! The finish is dry, spicy and fruity.\u201d Do you want to respond to this article?

{"id": 223701610, "title": "Cowboys Rumors: CeeDee Lamb 'Likely Waiting' on Justin Jefferson amid Contract Talks", "text": "Dallas Cowboys wide receiver CeeDee Lamb isn't in a hurry to sign a new contract, according to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler. Lamb and quarterback Dak Prescott are both in the last year of their deals. Fowler reported Sunday on SportsCenter that Prescott is believed to have priority in terms of an extension and that Lamb \"okay with that because he's likely waiting on Justin Jefferson in Minnesota.\" The wideout market is already spiking, with the Philadelphia Eagles' A.J. Brown and Detroit Lions' Amon-Ra St. Brown joining Miami Dolphins star Tyreek Hill in earning $30-plus million annually. Signing right now would net Lamb a sizable payday and you'd expect him to become the highest-paid receiver since that's what happened with St. Brown and then Brown. But Jefferson is bound to set a new standard whenever he agrees to a multiyear pact. Spotrac estimates his value to be $32.5 million per year and that's probably a little conservative. The three-time Pro Bowler's impact might extend beyond his overall earnings, too. Fowler reported in April he's emphasizing guarantees in his next contract. The nature of football incentivizes players to take the sure thing. Were Lamb to suffer a major injury in 2024, the kind of deal that's on the table now may not be there next spring. Lamb isn't the only notable receiver who's looking to see what Jefferson ultimately gets, though, and playing the waiting game could pay off in the long run.", "summary": "Dallas Cowboys wide receiver CeeDee Lamb isn't in a hurry to sign a new contract, according to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler.

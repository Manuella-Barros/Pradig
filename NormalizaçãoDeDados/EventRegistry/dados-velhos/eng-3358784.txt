the two month long strike.\n\nFifty-eight days into an ongoing and indefinite shutdown in the Darjeeling hills, a team of Gorkha Janmukti Morcha [GJM], the party that is spearheading Gorkha homeland movement in West Bengal, is expected to meet the Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday evening.\n\nThe GJM general secretary Roshan Giri told The Hindu that the meeting between Home Minister and representatives of GJM will be held at 4.30 pm in New Delhi.\n\nA press statement issued on Saturday by GJM president Bimal Gurung expressed hope that \"hill parties leading the movement will attend the meeting and help find a possible road map for Gorkhaland statehood.\"\n\nIn the statement Mr Gurung confirmed that Mr Singh requested them \"to join for talks\" on Sunday.\n\nHowever, it is yet to be clear whether the talks would facilitate lifting of the strike in Darjeeling and Kalimpong district which is continuing since June 15.\n\nNormal living has been severely affected owing to the two month long strike which was initiated demanding a separate State for the Gorkhas.\n\nWhile no representatives of the West Bengal government is likely to be present in Sunday's meeting, it is interesting to note that the development comes after Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's recent visit to Delhi and her appeal to GJM to come forward for talks.\n\nMr Giri is also camped in Delhi for several weeks and have been trying to initiate talks with all sides, sources told The Hindu. The key challenge for the leadership, after the meeting, would be to decide on whether to continue with the ongoing agitation or to call it off.\n\nWhile people are increasingly turning restless due to a near 60-day bandh, the demand for a separate State is unanimous in the hills.\n\nThe GJM has extended invite to the Gorkhaland Movement Coordination Committee (GMCC), a body comprising representatives of 15 political parties and social organizations in the hills to join the meeting, but it is not clear that whether representatives of GMCC will be meeting the Home Minister along with GJM representatives.\n\n\"It is a welcome development as the Centre has finally broken its silence on the situation in Darjeeling and is willing to engage with the stakeholders of the hills. However, it is just a meeting and should not be misunderstood as any kind of formal talks,\" a GMCC member said.\n\nDuring the past two months Darjeeling hills also saw one of the most violent agitation over the demand of separate State of Gorkhaland with at least nine Gorkhaland supporters being killed and over 100 public properties being set on fire.", "time": "08:39:00"}

The office is located on the first floor of a two storied structure that houses a post office in the ground floor.\n\nThe fire reduced furniture, stationary and documents to ashes. \"The office was torched by the police and CRPF. It is a conspiracy to derail the ongoing movement for Gorkhaland by creating rifts between pro Gorkhaland outfits.\" alleged Binita Roka, Spokesperson, GJM.\n\nRoka further alleged that the West Bengal Government on the direction of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is trying to arrest GJM President Bimal Gurung who is spearheading the Gorkhaland movement. She asked the public to remain united to foil any such conspiracy.\n\n\"This is a baseless allegation. The police have nothing to do with the fire. We are investigating the case. The culprits will be brought to book\" stated a police officer.\n\nMahendra Pradhan, former GTA member of the Sonada constituency alleged that his house along with the houses of 3 Youth Morcha activists were vandalised by the CRPF and IRB on Thursday morning.\n\n\"At around 10:30am when we were out attending the daily rally when the CRPF and IRB vandalised my house along with the houses of Amrit Pradhan, Vavhindra Rai and Deven Rai.

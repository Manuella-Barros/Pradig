Actor and eco-activist Woody Harrelson wasn\u2019t about to let a motorcycle spill in Beverly Hills rush hour keep him from introducing his new Holistic Spirits Co. cocktails to California on Tuesday at his sustainable Holy Water bar in West Hollywood. While a bandaged hand kept him from mixing up signature cocktails like the Glass Half Full, made with Harmony gin, Optimist Cocchi Americano, elderflower, and a pour-over with grapefruit and orange, specialty cocktails created by bartender Yael Stormborn and Holy Water\u2019s Bar Director Cameron Dodge-White flowed freely. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily something I wanted to do,\u201d Harrelson told the crowd at the cozy bar next to his cannabis consumption lounge, The Woods, joined by Holistic Spirits co-founder Amy Holmwood. \u201cThat is, to get involved with a liquor or any kind of spirit and compete with a cacophony of other celebrity voices including three of the world\u2019s sexiest men alive like Ryan, George, and Mathew. But I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. I don\u2019t know why nobody ever put organic superfoods into spirits before.\u201d From the garden to the glass, Origen Speciality Vodka and Harmony Gin are infused with artichoke leaf, elderberry, muscadine grape, and green tea leaf extract designed for a better way to drink, and created with transparency around ingredients and Harrelson\u2019s obsession with sustainable manufacturing in mind. The non-GMO brands are made in the USA at a USDA green-certified distillery that uses less water and recycles its by-products back into farming, and a zero-waste facility that employs no-water-waste processes. \u201cMe and the wifey drank about a half bottle of the spirit and the next day \u2014 we felt nothing,\u201d the lifelong environmentalist said while sipping on a Woodever made with Origen Vodka, Aperol, pineapple, and watermelon. \u201cNone of the traditional grief you feel when you wake up after a night of drinking. Our interest was tres piqued.\u201d Advertising disclosure: We may receive compensation for some of the links in our stories.

In 2000, Jesse became the first Filipino mayor to receive the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Government Service because of his work in Naga.\n\nMany groups have been urging the former vice president to run for the Senate in 2025, or three years after she led an emotionally-charged, volunteer-driven bid for the presidency against Ferdinand Marcos Jr.\n\nThe grassroots presidential campaign that backed her inspired Robredo to put up a volunteer network and the Angat Buhay Foundation. But those who took part in her campaign think she could serve the country in another way through public service.\n\n\"For us in Akbayan, we're really hopeful na she would answer the call,\" Akbayan president Rafaela David said in a Rappler Talk episode on Thursday, adding that it does not matter if she runs for a local position or a national post - as long as she brings with her the brand of leadership she displayed when she was vice president.\n\nThere have been many speculations on whether Robredo would consider another position in public office, even after losing with 14 million votes against Marcos' record-30 million.\n\nTalks began after Robredo transferred her voter registration records in back to Naga City in April. She previously transferred her registration to Magarao in Camarines Sur back in 2021.\n\n\"She has, in several meetings with various supporters, expressed her preference for running for a local post. This might be where congressman Edcel is coming from,\" Gutierrez said.\n\n\"But she has yet to make a final decision on the matter, and will make the announcement herself when that time comes,\" he added.\n\nThe Liberal Party, which already bared some of the opposition's Senate bets for the 2025 polls, said they were still convincing Robredo to run for a position in the upper chamber just last February.\n\nAccording to a Tugon ng Masa (TNM) survey conducted from March 11 to 14, Robredo would not make the cut for the 12 open Senate seats. As of the first quarter of 2024, the former vice president ranked at just 19 among the prospective candidates.\n\nA Pulse Asia survey on potential senatorial bets also held in March also ranked her outside the Magic 12, at 19th to 36th place.\n\nHowever, what's for sure is that Robredo will be joining the campaign trail for 2025.\n\n\"Siya naman ay sasama sa national campaign para sa senatorial slate ng Liberal Party at ng mga ka-alyansa ng Liberal Party,\" Lagman said.\n\n(She will join the national campaign for the Liberal Party's senatorial slate and our allies.)\n\nBut the former vice president is in demand.\n\nAfter Vice President Sara Duterte stepped down from her post Department of Education secretary, Robredo's supporters said she could fill the seat that Duterte vacated.\n\nBut to even consider this, she would have to be offered the position first - a pipe dream, given her history with Marcos with whom she had bitter exchanges bookended by two elections: the 2016 vice presidential race and the 2022 presidential elections. Marcos had filed an electoral protest against Robredo's 2016 victory, which the Supreme Court junked in 2021.\n\nWhen asked by reporters about Robredo possibly being tapped as Duterte's replacement at DepEd, Lagman said: \"'Yan ay call ni Leni. Wala kaming control diyan at hindi namin ini-expect na siya ay aalukin ng Pangulo.\"\n\n(That's Leni's call. We don't have control over that and we also do not expect the President to offer her the position.) - Rappler.com", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rappler"}, "authors":

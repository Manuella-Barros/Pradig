Despite a rocky start with a four-over 75, which led to many predicting a poor outcome and a wave of criticism, the 30-year-old golfer made a strong comeback and excelled in the following days.\n\nUltimately, he finished eight shots behind Olympic champion Scottie Scheffler. Given the criticism he faced, reporters asked if Clark had reflected on it or read the comments. Many had questioned whether other American golfers should have been in Paris instead of Clark. The 30-year-old has a clear response to those critiques.\n\n\"I didn't hear any of that but I knew some other stuff. I think some of it wasn't very justified because you know, I was the third-highest ranked player for the US to come here.\"-Clark said, as quoted by Golf Monthly.\n\nWyndham Clark admitted his start was far from ideal but noted that the experience is something he will never forget. Despite some golf fans downplaying the Olympics, it has become clear that many golfers hold it in higher regard than expected. As golf gains popularity in the Olympics, the emotions displayed by players at the end are a strong indicator of its importance. The patriotism associated with competing in the Olympics provides extra motivation and drive for success. Clark, as an American golfer, recognizes the importance of participating in the Olympics and cherishes the experience.\n\n\"Yeah, poor start. I don't think it has anything to do with attending events or not attending events.\n\nThis potentially could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and to be able to go watch events, spend time in the [Olympic] Village and get the full experience, may never get that again. So I wanted to make sure I did everything right. I don't regret anything I did.\"-Wyndham Clark said.\n\nWyndham cannot be happy with the start, but after that, he showed character and desire and deservedly celebrated. He showed that the Olympics are important to him, but in some moments it was felt that he was playing under a small amount of pressure.\n\n\"Once I got to Tuesday, I shut everything down and was ready to go. I played really good golf for 60 holes. I just had nine bad holes.\"\n\nWyndham Clark expressed that playing in the Olympics was a matter of personal and national pride. He emphasized that he was determined to represent his country well and wasn't only participating for the experience or fun.\n\nAlthough some golfers seemed to downplay the importance of the Olympics, Clark was not one of them. He saw the event as a significant opportunity to bring a medal to his country and approached it with that mindset.\n\nAfter his first round, he was particularly frustrated because he was aiming to win a medal. Despite the disappointment, Clark recognized that his participation was for a greater cause than just himself. He saw it as an opportunity to honor his country and build momentum for the upcoming Playoffs.\n\nRepresenting his country at such a prestigious event is a dream come true for Clark. He hopes to have the chance to represent the USA at future Olympics as well. Given his skills, it's clear he has the potential to secure a spot on the big stage again. Achieving this will depend on his exceptional performance and results.\n\nClark explained that securing a top-three finish in any tournament is extremely challenging. Because only the top three positions earn recognition, this makes achieving those spots even more demanding. Golf requires perfect timing every week, which is particularly difficult for just one week of competition.\n\nThe Olympics differ from regular golf tournaments in several ways. Unlike standard tournaments where only the win matters, the Olympics offer medals in three categories: gold, silver, and bronze. Clark aimed to win at least one of these medals. Although he fell short, his fellow American, Scottie Scheffler, secured the gold for his country. Tommy Fleetwood earned the silver, and Hideki Matsuyama brought home the bronze for Japan.\n\n30-year-old emphasized his goal to appreciate every moment of the experience, and he felt he had succeeded in doing so. General, he described the week as incredible for him.\n\nThis talented golfer hasn't particularly shone this year, but he will have the opportunity to showcase his best in the remainder of the season. The injury he sustained in March is likely one of the reasons why Clark hasn't been able to perform at his best. He must work hard to overcome the injury and get back on the winning track. We know that Clark has the potential to achieve this.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sead_dedovic@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Sead Dedovic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Matsuyama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hideki Matsuyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image152269.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793238", "eventUri": "eng-9793238", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

But then, these last two days have been really good form, yeah. Yeah, I played really good golf. The first nine holes were terrible [on Thursday], and one bad 18th hole [on Friday], and things might be a little different.\"\n\nClark garnered the respect and admiration of many for his strong finish, and the golf fans who lambasted him after Thursday's round owe him an apology. But the 2023 U.S. Open winner did not pay attention to any of the projectiles directed his way.\n\n\"I didn't hear any of that, but I knew some other stuff. I think some of it wasn't very justified because, you know, I was the third-highest-ranked player for the U.S. to come here. Yeah, poor start,\" Clark said.\n\n\"This could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I may never get that opportunity again to watch events, spend time in the [Olympic] Village, and get the full experience. So, I wanted to make sure I did everything right. I don't regret anything I did. Once I got to Tuesday, I shut everything down and was ready to go. I played really good golf for 60 holes. I just had nine bad holes.\"\n\nDespite the difficult nature of this competition, Clark still had an amazing week. He finished as the third-highest-ranked American player at 11-under-par for the championship, one stroke behind Xander Schauffele, who held a share of the 54-hole lead.\n\n\"To finish first, second, or third in any tournament is very hard, and when those are the only three places that actually receive anything, I think it kind of changes your expectations a little bit because golf, it's really hard to time everything perfectly every single week and especially for one week,\" Clark said.\n\n\"I wanted to enjoy every minute and I felt like I had, and so yeah, it's been an amazing week for me.\"\n\nIt's no secret that Clark has had a healthy dose of struggles throughout 2024, even though he currently sits fifth in the FedEx Cup standings. He missed the cut at Augusta National, Valhalla, and Royal Troon. He tied for 56th at Pinehurst No. 2 as the reigning U.S. Open champion, looking like a shell of himself from the Los Angeles Country Club the year before. Yet, Clark has had glimpses of success this year, notably at Pebble Beach, where he shot a final round 60 to win the rain-shortened AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. He also has five top-10s since that victory in February, including a pair of runner-up finishes at the Arnold Palmer Invitational and The Players Championship.\n\nBut Clark injured himself in the gym in late March ahead of the Texas Children's Houston Open, and his injury has lingered ever since. That has undoubtedly contributed to his inconsistency over the past few months, but Clark still rightfully made Team USA.\n\nWhen qualifying concluded after the U.S. Open, Clark was the fifth-ranked player in the world and the third-highest American. He may not have looked the part in the majors, but he has still had an impressive 18-month period, winning elite tournaments at Quail Hollow, LACC, and Pebble Beach.\n\nA big reason why he had success in those events -- and a few others -- is because he got off to a strong start.\n\n\"I've actually been struggling a lot with my starts, and it's been tough to overcome, especially the majors. I started so poorly, and then as I got to the back nine on Friday and I started playing really good golf, I barely missed the cut, and some of the cuts that I did make, then I back-doored into the top 10,\" Clark explained.\n\n\"So starting poorly, that's something I've really got to work on; at least just get out of the gates somewhat solid. I feel like I can play well on the weekend.\"\n\nThat perfectly summarizes Clark's play at Le Golf National this past week.\n\nBut the reality of 72-hole stroke play events is that you cannot win a golf tournament on Thursday, but you can certainly lose it. Clark lost it on Thursday with his opening 4-over 75, but he did not lose anyone's respect in the following three rounds. Instead, he should have gained some because his valiant efforts on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday only rivaled that of Scheffler -- the best player in the world.\n\nSo to those of you that slammed Clark after day one, you owe him an apology.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_milko@sbnation.com", "name": "Jack Milko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta_National_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Augusta National Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FedEx Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T_Pebble_Beach_Pro-Am", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Golf_National", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Le Golf National"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Palmer_Invitational", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arnold Palmer Invitational"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Players_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Players Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senior major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/76sJ61IAnICzV1UsqdJHS_qyPwQ=/0x265:2442x1486/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25560256/2164350353.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793238", "eventUri": "eng-9793238", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

He acted as manager, songwriter, publisher, and producer. Clark started the band to raise money for his soccer team to go to Holland. Team members played instruments, but no one played drums, so Clark bought a cheap drum set from a Salvation Army outlet and became the drummer. The band appeared regularly at the Tottenham Royal Mecca Ballroom in London and gained a rabid following. After reaching the charts with a cover of \"Do You Love Me,\" the band concentrated on writing original material. They topped the British charts and reached No. 6 in the U.S. Let's take a look at the story behind \"Glad All Over\" by The Dave Clark Five.\n\nAs record labels approached the group, it became clear they would dictate which songs the group recorded. If Clark paid for the sessions himself, he could control the repertoire. He then approached EMI Records, asking for a royalty rate three times the going rate and expecting a counteroffer. To Clark's surprise, the label accepted his excessive rate as they didn't have to pay for recording costs. The drummer also asked for the master recordings to revert back to his possession after 10 years. No one expected the songs to be worth anything a decade later, so the label agreed. Like Clark had captained his soccer team, he acted as the band's manager, leading them through the paces.\n\nThe Dave Clark Five's first chart success was \"Do You Love Me,\" which had been a hit for The Contours a year before. Brian Poole and the Tremeloes released a version a week earlier than the DC5, and it went all the way to No. 1, while Clark's version peaked at No. 30. Clark saw how much money was generated for the songwriter and publisher and how it all went to somebody else. Clark began writing songs with his band members and started a publishing company. He teamed up with lead singer Mike Smith, who accepted the challenge of coming up with original material. He found a song by Carl Perkins called \"Glad All Over,\" and the pair worked up their own song with the same moniker. As Smith recounted in Jon Kutner and Spencer Leigh's book 1000 UK #1 Hits: \"We had lost out on 'Do You Love Me' to Brian Poole, and so Dave thought we should do an original. He asked me to come up with something, and I looked through my record collection for a suitable title.\"\n\nThe first few songs were produced by Adrian Clark. This was a pseudonym Dave Clark used out of fear others would view his overall interaction with every aspect of the group as being overbearing. Adrian Kerridges was the engineer on the sessions, and Clark utilized his first name. The band recorded at Landsdowne Studios, London's first independent recording studio. Kerridges was a staff engineer who assisted Clark in achieving the unique sound of their recordings. They utilized four-track tape machines and reverb, placing a speaker and a microphone in the concrete stairwell at the rear of the studio to add a novel echo to the recordings. Fans at the Tottenham Royal Mecca Ballroom had begun a tradition of stamping their feet as the band played, and the group integrated the pounding beat into their songs. It is especially evident in their later hit \"Bits and Pieces.\"\n\n\"Glad All Over\" was the song that knocked \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" by The Beatles out of the top spot on the UK chart. After The Beatles created a sensation in America by appearing for three consecutive weeks on The Ed Sullivan Show, the show's producer wanted another British act to continue the wave of momentum. They reached out to Dave Clark, who initially declined their offer. The Ed Sullivan Show was not aired in the UK, so Clark had no idea how big of an impact it had on the record-buying public. The show's producer sweetened the offer monetarily and convinced Clark to make the trip to the U.S. The DC5 went on to appear on the show 12 times and cemented the fact the U.S. was indeed experiencing a British Invasion.\n\nMost drummers set up behind a band and are hidden behind a wall of percussion. Clark would often set up front and center. Clark told Uncut magazine, \"I went to Alexander Palace once and saw a big band called The Eric Delaney Band. On the front of the stage, he had these timpanis. He came off the drums at the back and played these timpanis, and it was quite amazing. It was showmanship. That's always stuck in my mind. It wasn't very clever, what he was doing, but it was dynamite. The crowd loved it. That was a big influence.\"\n\nI'm so glad you're mine now\n\nI'm so, I'm so glad you're mine\n\nI'm-a so glad you're mine now", "source": {"uri": "americansongwriter.com", "dataType": "news",

I think some of it wasn't very justified because you know, I was the third-highest ranked player for the US to come here.\n\n\"Yeah, poor start. I don't think it has anything to do with attending events or not attending events.\n\n\"This potentially could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and to be able to go watch events, spend time in the [Olympic] Village and get the full experience, may never get that again. So I wanted to make sure I did everything right. I don't regret anything I did.\n\n\"Once I got to Tuesday, I shut everything down and was ready to go. I played really good golf for 60 holes. I just had nine bad holes.\"\n\nPossibly the most integral aspect behind Clark's turnaround in form this week was down to his putting. In rounds one and two, the 2023 US Open champion was 56th and 41st, respectively, in Strokes Gained: Putting before drastically improving on that during Saturday (3rd) and Sunday (10th).\n\nClark stated that it was showing some pride for his country that really fuelled him to turn things around, however.\n\nAsked how he bounced back at Le Golf National, he said: \"I think it's more pride for myself and my country. I wanted to make sure that I showed up for my country.\n\n\"I didn't want anyone to think that I was doing this as just an exhibition or just coming here to have fun. I was serious about it. I was very pissed after round one because I wanted to medal. So I'm really bummed about it.\n\n\"But at the same time, I said this is for something greater than myself. It's for my country and it also builds a lot of momentum for the Playoffs that we have coming up.\"", "source": {"uri": "golfmonthly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf Monthly Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonny_leighfield@golfmonthly.com", "name": "Jonny Leighfield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Golf_National", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Le Golf National"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County,_Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clark County, Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clark County, Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Cookie_Jars", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Cookie Jars", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ue6k62aAfHkqmYJEbiV6yV-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793238", "eventUri": "eng-9793238", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Wave(s) just continued to crash over the back of the boat,\" read a post by Janet Lynch, to the Lake George NY Boaters group on Facebook at the time.\n\n\"I don't think there was any nefarious intent at all, but I think it wasn't organized,\" Clark said of the previous event. \"That's what I'm trying to do.\"\n\nTo avoid any calamity this year, Clark looked to other floating parades for guidance. She developed a set of rules which will be strictly enforced, such as no personal watercraft (jetskis), maintaining a speed below 10 mph, and keeping in a single file formation.\n\n\"Instead of just willy-nilly going around the lake, we have a route that we have published,\" she said. \"We avoided the bay areas and the islands because from what we understood the boats the last time around came too close to the islands and too far into the bays and it created a lot of wake disruption.\"\n\nClark said she also notified the Warren County Sheriff's Department so law enforcement can be on scene to ensure boaters adhere to the rules and to keep things safe. The route begins at Plum Point on the eastern shoreline, progresses southward to Lake George Village, north to Bolton Landing and returns to Plum Point.\n\n\"Trump is a controversial guy, so there were agitators that spun around some of the boats and were creating issues,\" Clark said of the last parade.\n\nOf course, the goal of the event is to show support for Donald Trump, but Clark said just as important is to show folks that participating in politics doesn't have to be a contact sport.\n\n\"Instead of this anger, this terrible anger... we need to be positive, no matter what we just need to stay positive,\" Clark said. \"That's where I'm at.

Her favorite part of the time off -- ironically, more basketball.\n\n\"Just getting some time to relax and reset, and then honestly just getting in here and getting to work on some stuff we haven't probably gotten to work on all year long,\" Clark said. \"I think it's been good. You don't have to mentally prepare for the games. You know that takes a lot of preparation. It's mentally taxing at the same time.

Obviously we're in seventh place right now but that can change from game to game as we know.

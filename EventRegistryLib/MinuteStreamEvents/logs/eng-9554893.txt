Further adding fuel the speculation, her dancers posted a video of them dancing to her new track \"So Long, London\" in early May.\n\nIn addition to adding The Tortured Poets Department to the setlist, Swift made a handful of other big changes to the Eras Tour, including many new costumes and new performances.\n\nRead ahead for the biggest changes to the Eras Tour.\n\nRelated: Taylor Swift's Eras Tour Surprise Songs: The List So Far\n\nSwift first teased the addition of The Tortured Poets Department at the beginning of the show. To the intro, which features Swift naming all of her album titles, she added a clip of her singing the title track \"The Tortured Poets Department.\" Additionally, fans noted that she added the lyric \"What if I told you I'm back?\" featured in the song \"The Alchemy,\" which fans have theorized is about her boyfriend Travis Kelce.\n\nThe singer debuted several new costumes during her Paris show. She kicked things off with her Lover set by donning a bright orange bodysuit as well as matching shoes and a blazer (all Versace) as she performed \"The Man.\"\n\nAs she transitioned into her Fearless era, she debuted a silver and black fringe dress, which is much more reminiscent of the dress she wore during her original Fearless Tour in 2009, and had a new gown for her Speak Now set.\n\nAdditionally, she wore a new shirt during her \"22\" performance, which read: \"This is not Taylor's Version\" (a new addition to the rotation), which had fans speculating about what it could mean.\n\nHer Folklore era also included a new yellow dress while her 1989 set included a pink and green two-piece which gave fans vibes of Ariel's outfit in The Little Mermaid (which was released in, you guessed it, 1989 and contains the line \"Daddy, I love him!\" -- just like a song onTTPD). The outfit also included one pink and one green shoe.\n\nMeanwhile, her Reputation outfit stayed the same: a Roberto Cavalli catsuit which she has worn the entire tour.\n\nWith the addition of songs from the new album, Swift cut a few tracks from the original setlist. Some of the most notable cuts include \"The Archer\" which previously ended the Lover era, \"Long Live,\" which was a more recent addition to the Speak Now set, and several Folklore and Evermore songs including \"The Last Great American Dynasty,\" \"Willow\" and \"Tolerate It.\"\n\nSwift also reordered some of the eras. In the past, the Folklore era had followed her Red set, but in Paris she changed things up by having Speak Now directly follow her performance of Red's \"All Too Well.\"\n\nAnother major change is that Folklore and Evermore are now combined into one set. As she sat at the piano to perform \"Champagne Problems,\" Swift explained that she always saw the two albums as part of a whole, with Folklore representing spring/summer and Evermore representing fall/winter. \"On the Eras Tour, we have now reunited the sisters [and] combined them into one chapter,\" she said, joking fans can call the new era \"Folkmore\" or \"Everlore.\"\n\nThe new order of the eras is as follows: Lover, Fearless, Red, Speak Now, Reputation, Folklore and Evermore (now combined), 1989, The Tortured Poets Department, the acoustic set and Midnights.\n\nAdditionally, there are several new visuals that pop up on the screen as Swift transitions from one set to the other.

The 1989 Era was always Style, Blank Space, Shake It Off, Wildest Dreams, Bad Blood.\n\nThen it's the acoustic section where she usually plays two surprise songs from her extensive back catalogue. One on the guitar, one on piano.\n\nAnd finally, she ends the show with the Midnights Era which gets an extensive setlist consisting of Lavender Haze, Anti-Hero, Midnight Rain, Vigilante Shit, Bejeweled, Mastermind and Karma.\n\nSO, WHAT'S CHANGED?\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department has been added as an era, with a shake-up to the whole show as a result.\n\nWhen Swift appeared on the stage in Paris, the first big change fans noticed was she had swapped her iconic pink bodysuit for an orange version. Lots of costume changes followed, with new outfits for Fearless and the Speak Now eras too.\n\nSetlist-wise, the first couple of songs remained the same, but it soon became apparent changed was afoot as some songs had been cut from the setlist, and she then began to switch around the order of the eras.\n\nIf we go by Paris, fans in Dublin can now expect Lover followed by the Fearless era, then Red, Speak Now, Reputation, a combination of the Folklore / Evermore eras, 1989... and drumroll please....a brand new The Tortured Poets Department Era, and finally, Midnights.\n\nTHE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT ERA\n\nAs expected, Swift has added The Tortured Poets Department as a brand new era to the already three-hour long show which catalogues ten studio albums.\n\nThe new era kicked off with But Daddy I Love Him followed by Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?. Next up was So High School which is believed to be about her American football superstar boyfriend Travis Kelce.\n\nA mash-up of Down Bad and Fortnight came next, with The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived, a cutting track believed to be about Matty Healy, rounding up proceedings.\n\nJust kidding! Of course she also added I Can Do It With a Broken Heart, a song about smashing it on tour while, you guessed it, being broken-hearted.\n\nTHE SONGS THAT DIDN'T MAKE THE CUT\n\nAlas, at an already three-hour long show, the addition of The Tortured Poets Department Era means she's had to cull other sections of the show.\n\nSo what songs didn't make the cut? Here's each era and the cuts Swift has made from her three-hour long setlist.\n\nRed: No cuts, but a new t-shirt that says \"This IS NOT Taylor's version\".

After two eventful months off, Swift is kicking off the European leg of her massive tour.\n\nTaylor Swift embarked on the Eras Tour on March 17, 2023, in Glendale, Arizona, U.S. Since finishing her U.S. leg last summer, the Grammy-winning singer has also toured South America, Asia, and Australia with a huge global cultural impact. Her last concert was on Mar. 9 in Singapore, and she's officially back on with a four-date stop in Paris, France.\n\nHowever, during the two months of a well-deserved break, Swift didn't just sit and watch Netflix with her beau, Travis Kelce. In the time off, the singer premiered the concert film on Disney Plus, and also released her eleventh studio album, The Tortured Poets Department. After putting out 31 brand-new songs, the tour has also received a makeover.\n\nThe Eras Tour was born after Swift released five studio albums since her last tour, 2018's Reputation Stadium Tour. Since then, she released 2019's Lover, 2020's two pandemic sister albums Folklore and Evermore, and 2022's Midnights. The tour reflected all the eras she's had so far (except for the debut album, which was unfortunately absent from ten acts). With Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour available to stream on Disney Plus after premiering in theaters last October, Swift has decided to make several changes.\n\nSwift kicked off the Eras Tour in Paris, France with the Lover era, as usual. She wore a brand-new outfit, an orange bodysuit and blazer for \"The Man.\" \"The Archer,\" the last song of Act 1, was dropped. Fearless was the second act, which also introduced a different outfit, this time, a black and silver one. There weren't any other changes to the Fearless setlist.\n\nNormally, following Fearless, she'd dive right into Evermore and, after that, Reputation. Instead, this time she switched straight to Red. She debuted a brand-new T-shirt for \"22,\" reading, \"This Is Not Taylor's Version,\" a reference to her re-recorded albums. She didn't make any changes to the setlist.\n\nThe next era was Speak Now, another big change in the order of the acts. The era got a brand-new intro and a new dress. Swift also dropped \"Long Live,\" and went straight into the Reputation era. Swift kept the same Reputation outfit, the only era that never got an outfit update. There were no other changes to the setlist.\n\nAfter Reputation she went into Folklore, which got a brand-new intro. Wearing a new yellow dress, Swift hopped on top of the Folklore cabin and opened the era with \"Cardigan\" instead of \"The 1.\" Choosing chaos, after performing \"Betty\" she headed straight to the piano, explaining that she was finally uniting Folklore with Evermore. She then started singing \"Champagne Problems.\" Following the applause break, she went straight into \"August\" and \"Illicit Affairs.\" The next songs were \"My Tears Ricochet,\" \"Marjorie,\" and \"Willow.\"\n\nShe continued with 1989, where she debuted a multi-colored outfit for the first time with no changes to the setlist. After the 1989 act, she moved on to the new era, The Tortured Poets Department.\n\nThe most exciting thing about Swift's concert was the changes to the Eras Tour to fit in her latest studio album. On top of that, people were wondering which songs she'd perform from TTPD. Having made so many changes, Swift had enough space to introduce songs from her brand-new album.\n\n\"But Daddy I Love Him\" was the first song, which Swift performed with a white dress with the lyrics \"I love you, it's ruining my life\" on it, also wearing the \"Clara Bow\" choker. She then moved on to a \"So High School\" mashup, the song she seemingly wrote for her boyfriend, Travis Kelce. The next song was \"Who's Afraid Of Little Old Me,\" with a part of the stage moving her around as if she were levitating.\n\nSwift then moved on to \"Down Bad\" with a mashup with \"Fortnight,\" followed by \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\" and \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart,\" shown on the screen in black and white.\n\nTo make room for her brand-new era, Swift had to drop several songs. The removed songs were some of the ones missing from the concert film, which fans widely speculated she would replace. Among them were \"The Archer\" and \"Long Live.\"\n\nAs she united the two sister albums, the songs she dropped were \"The 1,\" \"'Tis the Damn Season,\" \"Tolerate It,\" and \"The Last Great American Dynasty.\" She did keep \"Cardigan,\" which wasn't a part of the concert film but was added later on the Disney Plus version.\n\nFollowing the newly added TTPD act, she moved on to the acoustic set, and then Midnights, where she debuted a brand-new bodysuit. After the three-hour-long chaotic set filled with changes, Swift finished the concert with \"Karma,\" and was done for the night, ready to do it all over again all through the summer.", "source":

Taylor Swift returned to the stage in Paris on Thursday, May 9, and added some tracks from her 11th album to the show.\n\nBefore the TTPD set, Taylor, 34, made several changes to the setlist to account for the new additions. In the Lover set, she cut the song \"The Archer,\" while also debuting a brand new orange bodysuit and sparkly blazer. The Fearless set stayed the same, although it included a new black and gold dress. Rather than segueing into the Evermore set after Fearless, the singer skipped ahead to the Red era, which kept the same songs, but also featured some new costumes.\n\nThe Speak Now era came next, along with a completely revamped introduction and dress. She also cut \"Long Live\" from the set after previously adding it following the release of Speak Now (Taylor's Version) in July 2023. Reputation followed Speak Now, keeping its original outfit and song choices from the first leg of the tour.\n\nFollowing Reputation, there was a new transition into Folklore, where she rocked a new yellow dress and started the set with \"Cardigan,\" which used to be toward the end of the segment. However, Taylor revealed that the Folklore set was actually being combined with Evermore, as she went on to switch back-and-forth between both albums. Unfortunately, this meant a lot of songs were cut from the sister albums: \"'Tis the Damn Season,\" \"The Last Great American Dynasty,\" \"The 1,\" and \"Tolerate It\" all didn't make the cut.\n\nAs usual, Folklore transitioned into 1989, where Taylor wore a mismatched skirt and top for the first time. All of the songs remained the same.\n\nTaylor released TTPD on April 19 while the Eras tour was on a two-month break. However, fans began speculating that some of the tracks would make their way onto the show's setlist after the pop star posted behind-the-scenes rehearsal footage on YouTube on April 25. In the clips, Taylor appeared to be using a microphone that she doesn't normally use during the concert. Some fans also thought they spotted a TTPD logo in the background of one video, while other footage showed dancers using never-before-seen props.\n\nThe Eras tour began in March 2023 with a United States leg that lasted throughout the summer. Taylor then traveled for international shows in August 2023 and November 2023, as well as throughout February and the beginning of March. The four Paris shows are the kickoff to the tour's European leg, which concludes on August 20 in London.\n\nIn October and the beginning of November, the pop star has a string of shows in Miami, Florida, New Orleans, Louisiana, and Indianapolis, Indiana, before heading to Canada to close out the year.\n\nIn April, Taylor's boyfriend, Travis Kelce, confirmed that he would be heading to Europe to \"support\" her on tour this summer. However, football will be in-season by the time she's back in the United States. The couple has already made their romance last throughout one season of football and touring overlapping.\n\nThe Eras tour actually helped Taylor and Travis, 34, get together, as he attended one of the stops in Kansas City in July 2023. After the show, the NFL star gave Taylor a shout-out on his podcast, which led to her reaching out to him. They quietly dated for several weeks before going public with their relationship in September 2023.\n\n\"This all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell,\" Taylor told Time magazine in December 2023. \"We started hanging out right after that. So we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I'm grateful for, because we got to know each other.\"\n\nAlthough the two have managed to maintain a certain level of privacy, they also haven't shied away from the public frenzy surrounding their romance. \"When you say a relationship is public, that means I'm going to see him do what he loves. We're showing up for each other,\" the Grammy winner explained. \"Other people are there and we don't care. The opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you're seeing someone. And we're just proud of each other.\"", "source": {"uri": "lifeandstylemag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Life & Style"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alyssa_norwin@lifeandstylemag.com", "name": "Alyssa

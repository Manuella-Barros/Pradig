Additionally, get up to $300 Samsung credit when you purchase one of the new monitors1. Plus, gain 10 entries into a sweepstakes for the chance to win a $5,000 Samsung credit.2\n\nThese new and updated models bring features that people want -- as well as some they don't expect -- to deliver new experiences, no matter how they use their monitors. While the Odyssey lineup brings a next-level OLED experience and new AI capabilities3 to the Odyssey OLED G8, the Smart Monitor lineup enables more enhanced entertainment features powered by AI to the Smart Monitor M8. For a complete workstation, consumers can turn to the ViewFinity lineup which boosts connectivity to create an efficient work environment.\n\n\"Samsung continues to reinforce why we are the #1 monitor brand two years in a row by delivering innovations that are at the forefront of technology, and our new 2024 lineup will further solidify this. With our Odyssey, ViewFinity, and Smart Monitor lines, Samsung offers monitors that match what gamers, students, creative professionals, and hybrid workers look for as they work and play,\" said David Phelps, Head of the Display Division, Samsung Electronics America. \"Samsung ushers in a new era of monitors with technological advancements like AI upscaling, OLED Glare-Free technology, and OLED Safeguard+, as well as enhanced entertainment and connectivity features like Multi Control and a KVM Switch.\"\n\nOdyssey OLED Series: Visual Excellence With New Burn-In Prevention Features\n\nThe 2024 Odyssey OLED models offer the next-generation OLED performance with the new Odyssey OLED G8 (G80SD model) and Odyssey OLED G6 (G60SD model).\n\nThe Odyssey OLED G8 is the first flat 32\" Samsung OLED gaming monitor with 4K UHD (3840 x 2160) resolution and a 16:9 aspect ratio. It has a 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms gray-to-gray (GtG) response time for ultra smooth and responsive gameplay. The Odyssey OLED G6 is a 27\" QHD (2560 x 1440) resolution monitor, supporting a 16:9 aspect ratio. Its 360Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms GtG response time make it easy for gamers to keep up with fast-moving gameplay.\n\nThe new Odyssey OLED G8 is Samsung's first OLED gaming monitor powered by AI. The NQ8 AI Gen3 processor, which is the same processor Samsung uses in its 2024 8K TV, upscales content to nearly 4K when using Samsung Gaming Hub4 and the monitor's native Smart TV apps for higher resolution in gaming and entertainment.5\n\nBoth new Odyssey OLED models feature Samsung OLED Safeguard+, a new proprietary burn-in protection technology. This technology is the first in the world to prevent burn-in by applying a pulsating heat pipe to the monitor. Additionally, the Dynamic Cooling System evaporates and condenses a coolant to diffuse heat five times more effectively than the older graphite sheet method, which prevents burn-in by reducing temperature at the core. The monitor also detects static images like logos and taskbars, automatically reducing their brightness to provide another means of burn-in prevention.6\n\nThe Odyssey OLED G8 and OLED G6 both deliver unmatched OLED picture quality with a brightness of 250 nits (Typ.), while FreeSync Premium Pro keeps the GPU and display panel synced up to eliminate choppiness, screen lag and screen tearing.\n\nSamsung's new OLED Glare Free technology7 also preserves color accuracy and reduces reflections while maintaining image sharpness to ensure an immersive viewing experience, even in daylight. The OLED-optimized, low-reflection coating overcomes the trade-off between gloss and reflection thanks to a new, specialized hard-coating layer and surface coating pattern.\n\nBoth monitors feature a super slim metal design that gives them a distinct identity, while Core Lighting+ enhances entertainment and gaming experiences with ambient lighting that synchronizes with the screen. The ergonomic and height-adjustable stand also makes long sessions more comfortable with tilt and swivel support.\n\nThe new Odyssey OLED monitors will expand Samsung's OLED monitor market leadership. The release of these two monitors comes after Samsung achieved the top position in global sales in the OLED monitor market within only one year of launching its first OLED model.8 This achievement underscores Samsung's rapid ascent in the competitive landscape of OLED monitors while reinforcing its commitment to diversifying its gaming monitor lineup with new models that leverage the company's proprietary technology.\n\nSmart Monitor M8: AI Processing for Crystal Clear Video and Audio\n\nThe updated Smart Monitor lineup brings together a complete multi-device experience into one hub for smarter entertainment and greater productivity. The upgraded 2024 models include the M8 (M80D model), M7 (M70D model), and the M5 (M50D model).\n\nThe upgraded 32\" 4K UHD Smart Monitor M8 introduces new features powered by AI with the NQM AI processor, taking entertainment experiences to the next level. AI upscaling brings lower resolution content up to nearly 4K9, and Active Voice Amplifier Pro uses AI to analyze background noise in the user's environment to optimize dialogue in the user's content.10 360 Audio Mode11 is available on the M8, which pairs with Galaxy Buds to create an immersive sound environment. The built-in SlimFit Camera also makes it easy to conduct video calls through mobile applications with Samsung Dex.12\n\nNew to the entire line of Smart Monitors is a Workout Tracker,13 which pairs with a Galaxy Watch to enable real-time health data on the screen, even while streaming content. This makes it easier to track workout goals.\n\nThese new features enhance the already impressive Smart Monitor functionality. Smart TV apps and Samsung TV Plus14 provide instant access to a wide range of streaming services and live content, without needing to boot up a PC or connect to other devices.15", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Eight", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Group of Eight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Odyssey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer monitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Electronics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samsung Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_G6", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LG G6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_burn-in", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Screen burn-in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aspect ratio (image)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_time_(technology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Response time (technology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workstation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Workstation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo Switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scaling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Image scaling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "8K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pipe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat pipe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diffusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Proprietary software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taskbar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taskbar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Environmental_Monitoring", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Environmental Monitoring", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Networking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Networking", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622524", "eventUri": "eng-9622524", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5372549019607844, "wgt": 228, "relevance": 1}

The Odyssey lineup brings a next-level OLED experience and new AI capabilities1 to the Odyssey OLED G8; the Smart Monitor lineup heightens joy with more enhanced entertainment features, plus the Smart Monitor M8 powered by AI; and the ViewFinity lineup boosts connectivity to create a complete workstation.\n\n\"Our latest monitor lineups deliver a breadth of options to users globally and create better experiences, no matter how people use them,\" said Hoon Chung, Executive Vice President of Visual Display Business at Samsung Electronics. \"From the groundbreaking AI-powered Odyssey OLED gaming monitor to multi-device experiences in the Smart Monitor and ViewFinity lineups, Samsung remains committed to redefining the market and delivering cutting-edge technologies to users everywhere.\"\n\nOdyssey OLED Series: Visual Excellence With New Burn-In Prevention Features\n\nThe 2024 Odyssey OLED models expand Samsung's offerings of next-generation OLED performance with the new Odyssey OLED G8 (G80SD model) and Odyssey OLED G6 (G60SD model).\n\nThe Odyssey OLED G8 is the first flat 32\" Samsung OLED gaming monitor with 4K UHD (3840 x 2160) resolution and a 16:9 aspect ratio. It has a 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms gray-to-gray (GtG) response time for ultra smooth and responsive gameplay. The Odyssey OLED G6 is a 27\" QHD (2560 x 1440) resolution monitor, supporting a 16:9 aspect ratio. Its 360Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms GtG response time make it easy for gamers to keep up with fast-moving gameplay.\n\nThe new Odyssey OLED G8 is Samsung's first OLED gaming monitor powered by AI. The NQ8 AI Gen3 processor, which is the same processor Samsung uses in its 2024 8K TV, upscales content to nearly 4K when using Samsung Gaming Hub2 and the monitor's native Smart TV apps for higher resolution in gaming and entertainment.3\n\nBoth new OLED models feature Samsung OLED Safeguard+, a new proprietary burn-in protection technology. This technology is the first in the world to prevent burn-in by applying a pulsating heat pipe to the monitor. Additionally, the Dynamic Cooling System evaporates and condenses a coolant to diffuse heat five times more effectively than the older graphite sheet method, which prevents burn-in by reducing temperature at the core. The monitor also detects static images like logos and taskbars, automatically reducing their brightness to provide another means of burn-in prevention.4\n\nThe Odyssey OLED G8 and OLED G6 both deliver unmatched OLED picture quality with a brightness of 250 nits (Typ.), while FreeSync Premium Pro keeps the GPU and display panel synced up to eliminate choppiness, screen lag and screen tearing.\n\nSamsung's new OLED Glare Free technology5 also preserves color accuracy and reduces reflections while maintaining image sharpness to ensure an immersive viewing experience, even in daylight. The OLED-optimized, low-reflection coating overcomes the trade-off between gloss and reflection thanks to a new, specialized hard-coating layer and surface coating pattern.\n\nBoth monitors feature a super slim metal design that gives them a distinct identity, while Core Lighting+ enhances entertainment and gaming experiences with ambient lighting that synchronizes with the screen. The ergonomic stand also makes long sessions more comfortable with adjustable height, plus tilt and swivel support.\n\nThe new Odyssey OLED monitors are the next entry to expand Samsung's OLED monitor market leadership. Their release comes after Samsung achieved the top position in global sales in the OLED monitor market within only one year of launching its first OLED model.6 This achievement underscores Samsung's rapid ascent in the competitive landscape of OLED monitors while reinforcing its commitment to diversifying its gaming monitor lineup with models that leverage the company's proprietary OLED technology.\n\nSmart Monitor M8: AI Processing for Crystal Clear Video and Audio\n\nThe updated Smart Monitor lineup brings together a complete multi-device experience into one hub for smarter entertainment and greater productivity. The upgraded 2024 models include the M8 (M80D model), M7 (M70D model) and the M5 (M50D model).\n\nThe upgraded 32\" 4K UHD Smart Monitor M8 introduces new features powered by AI with the NQM AI processor, taking entertainment experiences to the next level. AI upscaling brings lower resolution content up to nearly 4K,7 and Active Voice Amplifier Pro uses AI to analyze background noise in the user's environment to optimize dialogue in the user's content.8 360 Audio Mode9 is available on the M8, which pairs with Galaxy Buds to create an immersive sound environment. The built-in SlimFit Camera also makes it easy to conduct video calls through mobile applications with Samsung Dex.10\n\nNew to the entire line of Smart Monitors is a Workout Tracker,11 which pairs with a Galaxy Watch to enable real-time health data on the screen, even while streaming content. This makes it easier to track workout goals and can make working out more enjoyable.\n\nThese new features enhance the already impressive Smart Monitor functionality. Smart TV apps and Samsung TV Plus12 provide instant access to a wide range of streaming services and live content, without needing to boot up a PC or connect to other devices.13\n\nThe M7 is available in 32\" and 43\" with 4K UHD (3840 x 2160) resolution, a brightness of 300 nits (Typ.) and a gray to gray (GtG) response time of 4ms. The M5 is available in 27\" and 32\", with FHD resolution (1920 x 1080), a brightness of 250 nits (Typ.) and a GtG response time of 4ms.\n\nViewFinity Series: Maximizing Creativity and Ease of Use\n\nOptimized for creatives and professionals and built with responsible practices, the latest ViewFinity lineup includes the ViewFinity S8 (S80UD and S80D models), ViewFinity S7 (S70D model) and the ViewFinity S6 (S60UD and S60D models).\n\nThe updated 2024 ViewFinity monitors14 help recycling efforts by being made with a minimum of 10% recycled plastic and not applying chemical sprays to the plastic components.15 The packaging also uses glue instead of staples for easier disassembly.\n\nThe Easy Setup Stand is put together with one quick click, requiring no tools or screws, making it fast and easy to set up and enjoy the ViewFinity's vibrant display. Every 2024 ViewFinity monitor supports HDR10 and the display of 1 billion colors, ensuring accurate color representation, while also integrating T\u00dcV-Rheinland-certified Intelligent Eye Care features to alleviate eye strain during prolonged work periods.\n\nThe ViewFinity S8 offers 27\" and 32\" screen options, each with 4K UHD (3840 x 2160) resolution, a refresh rate of 60Hz and a brightness of 350 nits (Typ.). They also feature a USB hub for easy connectivity and a height-adjustable stand. The S80UD model includes a new KVM switch for easy connection and switching between two different input devices, as well as a USB-C port that allows users to charge devices with up to 90W of power.\n\nThe ViewFinity S7 is available in 27\" and 32\" options, each with UHD 4K (3840 x 2160) resolution, a brightness of 350 nits (Typ.) and a refresh rate of 60Hz. The ViewFinity S6 is available in 24\", 27\" and 32\" options, each with QHD (2560 x 1440) resolution, a refresh rate of 100Hz and a brightness of 350 nits (Typ.), including a USB hub and height-adjustable stand.

The Odyssey OLED G8 will sell for $1,300, while the smaller Odyssey G6 will cost $900. As a bonus, Samsung is offering up to a $300 Samsung credit on a future purchase when you order one of these models.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe Odyssey OLED G8 has a 32-inch 4K UHD display with a 16:9 aspect ratio, 240Hz refresh rate, 250 nits of SDR brightness, and 0.03ms gray-to-gray (GtG) response time. The Odyssey OLED G8 is Samsung's first smart monitor featuring AI capabilities. It is powered by the Samsung NQ8 AI Gen 3 processor, which allows it to project most content in 4K when using its Samsung Gaming Hub and Smart TV apps.\n\nMeanwhile, the Odyssey OLED G6 has a 27-inch QHD display with a 16:9 aspect ratio, 360Hz refresh rate, 250 nits of SDR brightness, and a 0.03ms GtG response time.\n\nBoth flat-screen displays run Samsung's Tizen monitor operating system. The brand has also added technology to address burn-in to both monitors. The Odyssey OLED G8 and Odyssey OLED G6 feature Samsung's new, proprietary OLED Safeguard+ burn-in protection technology, which includes a dynamic cooling system that diffuses the heat evenly across the monitor. It can also auto-adjust brightness to cool down hotspots on the screen. Samsung is also releasing its OLED displays from 2024 and on with three-year warranties, up from one year.\n\nThe monitors also include OLED glare-free technology, which reportedly reduces light reflection by up to 55% while maintaining color accuracy and image sharpness on the displays.\n\nThe monitors both have ergonomic and height-adjustable stands that support tilt, swivel, and pivot motions and VESA mounting. They also include a circular built-in ambient light feature in the rear called CoreLighting+, which can also adjust according to the color scheme of a game.\n\nFor input, they both include two HDMI 2.1 ports, one DisplayPort 1.4, and three USB 3.0 ports.\n\nSamsung is well-known in the OLED space as the brand was one of the first to begin releasing this style of gaming monitor in late 2022. it also urged competitors such as LG and Alienware to follow suit. Now, many other brands have done so, making the competition steeper than ever. Samsung is quick to boast about its two consecutive years of being rated the number one monitor brand in the industry, with the help of models such as the 49-inch curved Odyssey OLED G9.\n\nSamsung also shared that it expects OLED gaming monitors to account for over a quarter of the overall gaming monitor industry by the end of 2024, making the need for refreshes of its models paramount for it to stand out.\n\nWe're excited to spend some more quality time with these monitors once we get them in for review, as they're certainly among some of the most highly anticipated gaming monitors of 2024.\n\nEditors' Recommendations Acer is finally back in the gaming monitor fight An OLED gaming handheld rises up to challenge the Steam Deck OLED monitors just had a major breakthrough Gigabyte

The company is also launching the 27-inch Odyssey OLED G6 monitor with a resolution of 2,560 x 1,440 and a 360Hz refresh rate.\n\nSamsung says both of the new Odyssey OLED monitors have new Samsung OLED Safeguard+ tech designed to help prevent burn-in on the displays with the use of a pulsating heat pipe on the monitors.\n\nYou can order the 32-inch Odyssey OLED G8 monitor on Amazon now for $1,299.99.

The 2024 monitors can be pre-ordered today. Pre-orders on the latest monitors will come with up to $300 Samsung credit for a separate purchase.\n\nThe M80D Smart Monitor is a 32-inch 4K (3,840 x 2,160) productivity monitor with HDR10+ support. Like other Samsung Smart Monitors, the M80D offers access to streaming TV applications like Prime, Netflix, and YouTube and the Samsung Gaming Hub for access to cloud gaming platforms like Nvidia GeForce Now, Xbox Cloud Gaming, or Utomik.\n\nOther features for the monitor include two-channel built-in speakers using Active Voice Amplifier Pro, Head Tracking for Buds 360 Audio with your Galaxy Buds, and Multi-Control to move content between the M80D and other Samsung devices. Because the M80D Smart Monitor comes with the SlimFit camera, you can use it for video calls or for Samsung Health TV. You can also use Bluetooth to connect the M80D to your fitness trackers for added health tracking for your workout sessions.\n\nThe M80D also includes AI upscaling thanks to a NQM AI Processor, which can transform lower-resolution content to nearly 4K resolutions, for a more cinematic experience. Of course, there may be some issues with upscaling the resolution using AI, so this may not be the best way to watch those old episodes of Honeymooners, but it could be fun to play around with.\n\nThe M80D retails for $699.99.\n\nOther new Smart Monitors include the M70D and M50D models.\n\nSamsung's ViewFinity line is designed for creative professionals, offering high resolution monitors with a high-degree of color accuracy.\n\nThe 32-inch ViewFinity S80UD is a 4K UHD (3,840 x 2,160) monitor with high pixel density for added clarity. Samsung claims the ViewFinity S80UD is capable of outputting \"1.07 billion colors and near-limitless hues\" for wide color gamut coverage and high accuracy. The monitor also features HDR10 support, a built-in LAN port, and a USB-C port that allows for 90W charging and data transfer.\n\nThe ViewFinity monitor also has a built-in KVM switch for switching between different inputs, including split screen, picture-in-picture, and picture-by-picture modes.\n\nThe ViewFinity S80UD starts at $499.99.\n\nOther new ViewFinity monitors include the S80D and S70D.\n\nThe Samsung OLED G80SD and G60SD were announced back at CES in January. Both OLED monitors support Samsung's new OLED Glare-Free technology, a 0.03ms response time, active temperature control using Samsung OLED Safeguard+ technology, a Dynamic Cooling System to diffuse heat and lower brightness to prevent overheating, and burn-in protection by auto-controlling brightness on static images like task-bars, mini-maps, or other UI features in games or shows.\n\nBoth the G8 and G6 also feature slim metal designs, smooth display swivel hinges, and CoreLighting+ to sync the RGB lighting on the back of the monitor to your mouse, keyboard, and tower lights.\n\nThe Odyssey G8 (G80SD) is a 32-inch 4K (3,840 x 2,160) OLED monitor with 240Hz refresh rates and retails for $1,299.99.\n\nThe Odyssey G6 (G60SD) is a 27-inch QHD (2,560 x 1,440) OLED monitor with 360Hz refresh rates and retails for $899.99.\n\nI was able to take a look at the Odyssey G6, Odyssey G8, and M80D Smart Monitor at Samsung's New York headquarters ahead of the announcement.\n\nWhile the M80D Smart Monitor was a fun product with plenty of quirks and features to be an interesting object, what really claimed my attention was the anti-glare coating on the revamped Odyssey G6 and G8 monitors.\n\nSamsung set the new Odyssey G6 and G8 next to the curved Odyssey G9, which has its own anti-glare tech. All three monitors were set up side-by-side in front of a wall of windows on a bright day, so there was plenty of light to cause glare. The G9 struggled with its glossy OLED panel between the overhead lights and the Sun. The Odyssey G6 and G8 barely showed any glare at all. Even on darker screens like the Red Dead Redemption II menu or the Cyberpunk 2077 settings screen, both of the new Odyssey monitors were nearly glare-free.\n\nWhile OLED display panels are often brighter and more vibrant than their LCD counterparts, the glossy panels often come with a lot of extra glare which is generally a bad combination when it comes to gaming monitors. Of course, you can get OLED displays with a matte finish, but they tend to be less impressive than glossy OLED screens. The Odyssey G6 and Odyssey G8 present a compelling compromise between the gorgeous detail and color accuracy of a glossy OLED and the glare-free properties of a matte panel.", "source": {"uri": "laptopmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LaptopMag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "madeline_ricchiuto@laptopmag.com", "name": "Madeline Ricchiuto", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_scaler", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video scaler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Odyssey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer monitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Eight", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Group of Eight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_G6", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LG G6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-order", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pre-order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Cloud_Gaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Cloud Gaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDR10+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "HDR10+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_gaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud gaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GeForce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amplifier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_screen_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Split screen (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDR10", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "HDR10"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USB-C"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sun Microsystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Instrumentation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Instrumentation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Environmental_Monitoring", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Environmental Monitoring", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Networking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Networking", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Human_Interfaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Human Interfaces", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6LfJ57urcowYj66ReEtkJ9-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622524", "eventUri": "eng-9622524", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

This launch includes enhancements across various models aimed at improving user experience for gaming, entertainment, and professional use. The 2024 Odyssey OLED series offers new AI capabilities and burn-in prevention technologies. The Odyssey OLED G8 model features a flat 32-inch display with 4K UHD resolution, a 240Hz refresh rate, and a 0.03ms gray-to-gray (GtG) response time, enhancing responsiveness in gaming scenarios.\n\nThe smaller Odyssey OLED G6, a 27-inch model, supports QHD resolution and boasts a 360Hz refresh rate for fluid visuals in fast-paced games.

While it may not use fancy tandem OLED tech as seen in the Apple iPad Pro, it does come equipped with OLED Glare-Free technology, which reduces reflections to ensure you get the most out of your OLED panel.\n\nGaming feats abound on the OLED G8, measured by its up to 0.03ms of input latency on a 240Hz refresh rate screen. Samsung also kitted out the G8 with AMD FreeSync Premium Pro for diminished screen tearing in addition to a newfangled Dynamic Cooling System aimed at preventing OLED burn-in.\n\nThe G8 is saddled alongside the Samsung Odyssey OLED G6, a somewhat more budget-friendly design that leverages a 360Hz refresh rate on a 27-inch 1440p display. Preorders for both monitors go live today on Samsung's official store page, with the OLED G8 sporting a $1,299 price tag while the OLED G6 comes in at $899.\n\nSamsung is a leading provider of some of the best gaming monitors money can buy, and it's taking that knowhow to the extreme in its new Odyssey lineup. Beyond just the tantalizing OLED screens, both the Odyssey OLED G8 and Odyssey OLED G6 combine some of the best technologies found in Samsung's 2024 TV lineup with the most advanced gaming specs on the block.\n\nThe OLED G8 uses the NQ8 AI Gen3 processor for 4K upscaling across the Samsung Gaming Hub and assorted streaming apps. This means that all of your favorite content, from cloud-based gaming via Xbox Game Pass to binges of the new \"Star Wars: The Acolyte\" on Disney Plus will be crystal clear and unblemished on the G8.\n\nMost exciting for all of those who might worry about their favorite OLED gaming monitor being ruined by burn-in is the new dynamic cooling system, named Samsung OLED Safeguard+ technology. Both the G8 and the G6 use an advanced heat pipe that dynamically reducing temperatures and brightness to better prevent burn-in.\n\nBest of all is the new addition of HDR10+ Gaming across the OLED range. Essentially, HDR10+ on Samsung's new OLED monitors automatically adjusts the game on-screen with improved fidelity, lighting, and color. You won't have to fiddle with settings or make any changes, as the feature dynamically adjusts to your set-up, allowing you to game in HDR without any friction.\n\nAnd gaming is made all the more fluid with one of the lowest response times on an OLED monitor, beat only by the ViewSonic XG272-2K-OLED, which sports just 0.01ms. At 0.03ms, the OLED G8 and G6 ensure you get some of the best coverage against ghosting and improved motion clarity in the market.\n\nThe 27-inch OLED G6 launches with an MSRP of $899, while the 32-inch OLED G8 comes in at a $1,299 premium.

The Samsung Odyssey OLED G8 is Samsung's first flat 32-inch 4K OLED panel designed for gaming. Given that it's built with gamers in mind, the monitor prioritizes refresh rate and responsiveness, delivering a 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03s gray-to-gray response time.\n\nThe OLED G6, on the other hand, is a 27-inch QHD (2,560 x 1,440) resolution monitor with a 360Hz refresh rate, a bit swifter than its larger sibling.\n\nBoth monitors sport a 16:9 aspect ratio and feature Samsung's OLED Safeguard+ technology, a new proprietary defense against burn-in. This technology, a first of its kind, applies a pulsating heat pipe to the monitor. This heat is paired with a dynamic cooling system that evaporates and condenses a coolant to diffuse heat five times more effectively than the older graphite sheet method. The display also detects static images, like toolbars and logos, and reduces their brightness to reduce the risk of burn-in.\n\nSamsung says its new OLED displays support 1.07 billion colors, covering 99% of the DCI-P3 color gamut with HDR10. Speaking of HDR, the monitor supports it, although its maximum brightness is just 250 nits, which is not very far into HDR territory.\n\nAnother trick up the Odyssey's sleeve is Samsung's NQ8 AI Gen3 processor. This is the first time a Samsung OLED gaming monitor has included this feature, and it upscales content to nearly 4K resolution when using the Samsung Gaming Hub.\n\nThe Odyssey OLED G8 is available to preorder for $1,500 while the G6 is $900.\n\nSamsung also announced new Smart Monitor and ViewFinity series products. The new Smart Monitor series displays range from 27 to 43 inches, with the M80D as the top-end option. The 32-inch panel has a 60Hz refresh rate, 4K resolution, and 400 nits maximum brightness. It also features 4K upscaling technology, unlike the M70D and M50D monitors. The M80D, the highest-end of the new Smart Monitor series, is $700.\n\nThe new ViewFinity displays, optimized for creative professionals, come in S6, S7, and S8 models. The high-end ViewFinity S8 series includes the S80UD and S80D displays. They both come in 27- and 32-inch sizes, with the smaller one sporting an IPS display and the larger one opting for VA type. Both models top out at 350 nits and 4K resolution, and cover 99% of the sRGB color space.

I've been writing, playing, and complaining about games for as long as I remember, but it wasn't until recently that I've been able to shout my opinions directly at a larger audience. My work has appeared on iMore, Windows Central, Android Central, and TWICE, and I have a diverse portfolio of editing work under my belt from my time spent at Scholastic and Oxford University Press. I also have a few book-author credits under my belt -- I've contributed to the sci-fi anthology Under New Suns, and I've even written a Peppa Pig book.\n\nSamsung was full of teasers at this year's CES, offering us a sneak peek of its latest fleet of gaming and productivity monitors. Specifically, instead of following the familiar formula of higher resolutions and wider screens, the company injected its newest screens with today's hottest tech -- AI. Enter the Samsung OLED G80SD and Samsung M80D, the first monitors in the company's gaming and productivity lineups to offer AI upscaling, promising to bring lower-resolution streamed content up to near-4K levels.\n\nStopping by the Samsung 837 Store in New York City recently, we got a chance to go hands and eyes on with the new displays, which are among the first of the models announced at CES to go on sale. We left impressed by Samsung's thoughtful injection of AI, the M80D's productivity-packed feature set, and the G80SD's gorgeous 4K OLED display (even though it arrives halfway through a year packed with similar monitors).\n\nSamsung OLED G8: AI Upscaling, OLED Brilliance\n\nOn the gaming monitor front, Samsung is introducing the OLED G80SD and the G60SD (G8 and G6 for short). Part of the same family as the Samsung Odyssey OLED G9, the G8 might be familiar to those who've kept an eye on the premium gaming monitor segment over the years. Here are the specs, and stop me if you've heard this before: a 32-inch OLED panel with 4K resolution, AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, a 0.03ms response time, and a 240Hz refresh rate. Yes, we've seen similar offerings this year from Alienware, Asus, LG, and MSI, but Samsung hopes to stand out with some help from today's tech buzzword: AI.\n\nTechnically, we've seen AI in gaming monitors before -- for instance, optimizing settings and power usage options in some of MSI's 4K OLED displays. That's a time saver, but not quite a groundbreaking use of the emerging tech.\n\nSamsung is injecting AI into its gaming monitors in perhaps a more meaningful way: upscaling streaming content. Thanks to what the company calls the NQ8 AI Gen3 Processor, the G8 monitor can upscale content to nearly 4K when using Samsung Gaming Hub and Smart TV apps. Samsung has used this technology before in TVs (see the Samsung 85-Inch QN900D 8K QLED TV), but this marks its first appearance in a gaming monitor.\n\nHowever, AI upscaling is not without issues, as the rebuilt image can often leave behind unintended artifacts and add some unwanted input lag. We weren't able to see the upscaling in action ourselves during our hands-on time with the new monitors, so it remains to be seen if the quality is noticeably affected by the upscaling. But considering the noticeable gains while using the technology in Samsung's TVs, we remain optimistic.\n\nThe new monitors also support HDR10+, which means they can read metadata from HDR content and apply dynamic per-scene HDR and dynamic HDR tone mapping in real time. In our demo, we took a stroll down the streets of Cyberpunk 2077, a game packed full of neon lights and other visual effects that are really perfect for showcasing the HDR. Even in our short demo, you could immediately notice the strong contrasting colors and vibrant textures of in-game scenes. Highlights from streetlights were particularly eye-catching, and the added fidelity helps you appreciate the finer details of Night City.\n\nIn addition to AI upscaling, the monitor offers many new features that are firsts for Samsung's gaming line, including a dynamic cooling system that diffuses heat and predicts surface temperature, controlling brightness to prevent overheating. The monitor also automatically adjusts brightness on static images to help prevent burn-in.\n\nThe G8 might be the belle of the ball, but Samsung is also offering another OLED display: the G6. It's made with hard-core gamers in mind, dropping size to 27 inches and resolution to QHD (2,560 by 1,440 pixels) but raising the refresh rate to 360Hz. It retains many of the features of the G8, though it does not offer an AI processor or the Samsung entertainment options.\n\nBut while AI upscaling is off the cards, the G6 does offer a remarkably sleek metal design, measuring just 0.15 inch at its thinnest point. Its smaller footprint is ideal for gamers with limited desk space. It's a more traditional gaming monitor than Samsung's other gaming displays, which tend to borrow features from the company's TVs. Still, we haven't met an OLED monitor we didn't like, and the 27-inch variant is no exception.\n\nAs for price, you'll reach deep into your wallet no matter your choice. The 32-inch Samsung OLED G80SD retails for $1,299, while the 27-inch Samsung OLED G60SD comes in at $899.\n\nSamsung M80D Smart Monitor: AI Without OLED\n\nSamsung's 32-inch M80D also uses an AI processor, which like the OLED G8's promises to upscale streamed content to near-4K resolution. And you'll find plenty of content to choose from: Like its predecessors, the M80D offers access to streaming TV apps from partners like Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, and YouTube, as well as the Samsung Gaming Hub to stream games directly to your monitor with no additional hardware required.\n\nNeed to get some work done? The Multi Control feature lets you easily move images between the monitor and other Samsung devices with just your keyboard and mouse. You can also pair the M80D with Matter-compatible smart home devices to transform your monitor into a bona fide control hub.\n\nWe especially like the detachable SlimFit camera. The camera sits atop the thin frame of the monitor and is attached to a USB-C port. While it can be used for video calls, it's even more fun when it works in tandem with exercise devices and fitness apps. The M80D also offers an ergonomic design, built-in speakers, and plenty of ports, including USB-A, HDMI, and USB-C.\n\nWhat was striking in our demo was just how compact the monitor was, especially for a 32-inch screen, and I can see it being an ideal companion for the home office. Yes, there's no OLED here, but the M80D's target audience will probably not mind, thanks to how feature-rich the monitor is. However, in our short demo, I admittedly struggled to get the camera to lock on to me while trying out the fitness apps.\n\nThe Samsung M80D Smart Monitor is less expensive than the OLED options, retailing for $699.\n\nWhether you're gaming, working from home, or just looking for a display that does it all, the new Samsung offerings likely have you covered. They're now available for purchase, with an additional launch sweetener if you buy direct from Samsung: a $300 credit for a future purchase. Still, it might be worth waiting to buy until we've had a chance to give a final verdict after testing in PC Labs.

At this stage, screens really have to go out of their way to leave an impression on me, but this new duo has caught my attention through style, impressive specs, and one feature that facilitates punchy visuals at every angle. In fact, I'm worried that many other displays in 2024 are going to fall short if they can't replicate one particular trait.\n\nIt takes more than just an impressive OLED panel to make my best gaming monitor list, as the whole package matters. Sure, previous models like the Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 hold their position thanks to incredible contrast and colors, but it's the screen maker's attention to design that ultimately earns it the crown. While I'll need to properly road-test the new Odyssey OLED G6 and G8 models to know if the same applies, even a short demo has left me thinking about how the displays would look in my office.\n\nLast week, I was invited by Samsung to feast my eyes on the new Odyssey OLED G6 and G8. Admittedly, I wasn't sure whether the 32-inch 4K UHD model or the 27-inch QHD model would rock my world, as I've tested plenty of excellent OLED panels with speedy refresh rates and snappy response times. And, while the displays impress in both those departments with 240Hz and 360Hz abilities, getting a good look at them first-hand hammered home what all the fuss is about.\n\nThe very first thing I noticed was that the OLED G6 and G8 appeared immune to glare, which is impressive given the \"demo bus\" was parked right next to a large window. Better still, it happened to be one of the sunniest days we've had in weeks, but even that seemingly couldn't beat Samsung's new \"OLED Glare-Free technology.\" My gaming desk at home sits right next to a window, so I'm more than aware of the havoc a nice day can wreak on a gaming session (promoting me to go out for a walk instead of bashing my Steam backlog).\n\nBefore planking myself down for a proper test session, I got a 360\u00b0 look at the OLED G6 and G8, and the experience was refreshing. I'm well aware that Samsung knows how to make pretty displays, and both these new gaming monitors embody the tech giant's dedication to aesthetics. The design is similar to that of the Odyssey Neo range, but the panel type allows for a much slimmer profile and a tapered back that avoids using a big boxy hump for IO placement.\n\nI'm not saying that having the likes of the Dough Spectrum Black and Corsair Xeneon 27QHD240 with a protruding box is a deal breaker, but both do look clunky compared to the gentle curves of the new Odyssey OLED range. Plus, I'm a big fan of HDMI and DisplayPort facing outwards rather than living under a lip, as it's far easier to hook up consoles and other PCs on a whim. It also means that functional elements don't disrupt the RGB ring at the center, helping add a bit of flare to an otherwise minimalist design.\n\nI want to also praise the G6 and G8's choice of pedestal stand, as it trades V-shapes and chonky bases for a low-profile pentagon. At first, it may look like it takes up more space than it needs to, but since it's thin, you'll actually have more freedom to fit accessories and things like soundbars underneath. I reckon it could even serve as a nice console platform - a huge win if you're looking specifically for a monitor for PS5 or somewhere to pop your Steam Deck dock.\n\nTo get a feel for both the G6, I used Samsung's gaming mouse and keyboard setup to whiz around in Rocket League. At 27 inches, I wasn't able to sniff out any fidelity issues playing at 1440p, with the display's 360Hz 0.03ms abilities also helping to keep my eyes busy. Everything felt as slick as I'd have expected from an OLED panel in 2024, and the contrast was once again elevated by the complete lack of glare from either the room's lighting or the glorious weather happening outside.\n\nThe larger 32-inch G8 model dials things down to 240Hz to achieve UHD, and it makes for a strong 4K gaming monitor contender. It'd take more than a quick session in Fortnite for me to detect the difference in refresh rate, but at face value, the experience feels just as snappy. The OLED panel also pulls punches to help maintain that balance of speed and vibrance, and once again, zero glare in spite of being positioned right in front of a large window.\n\nMy hands-on impressions aside, there are a couple of OLED G6 and G8 features that should help both panels win players over. For instance, Samsung has armed both with OLED Safeguard+ tech, which uses a \"pulsating heart pipe\" and \"Dynamic Cooling System\" to shift more heat than traditional methods. There are also some preventative brightness measures at hand to combat things like static logos and images, so you probably won't be haunted by your favorite game's UI after a few years of use.\n\nI'm also thrilled to report that G8 comes with a remote control, and I really hope it helps end fiddly nubs and OSD buttons. Admittedly, the 4K model comes with Tizen smart features baked in, which makes the addition of a remote necessary, but I'm still pretty hyped for the added extra. I'd go as far as to say that it makes it worth picking up over smaller gaming TV options out there, as you'll have everything to hand that you'd find in a living room display.\n\nI don't want to act all clairvoyant about my own upcoming Samsung Odyssey OLED G6 review, but I'm certain Glare-Free tech is going to be a big talking point. Same applies to the G8, and it could be enough to make rivals sweat. Combatting reflections and bright patches isn't anything new, as it's been a feature of many screens over the past few years. However, now that I've clapped my eyes on Samsung's latest attempt, I'm going to struggle using and reviewing other screens.", "source": {"uri": "gamesradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "gamesradar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "phil_hayton@gamesradar.com", "name": "Phil Hayton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Eight", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Group of Eight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_G6", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LG G6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Odyssey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer monitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_display_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics display resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steam (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ZX Spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RGB color model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minimalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DisplayPort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "HDMI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aesthetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_Deck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steam Deck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1440p", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "1440p"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high-definition_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ultra-high-definition television"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z6JrwtHm8atri4AVsqEsc-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622524", "eventUri": "eng-9622524", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}
{"uri": "8160109880", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-06-03", "time": "23:07:03", "dateTime": "2024-06-03T23:07:03Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-06-03T23:02:04Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7411764860153198, "url": "https://www.stuff.tv/hot-stuff/samsungs-new-odyssey-oleds-look-stunning-from-every-angle/", "title": "Samsung's new Odyssey OLEDs look stunning from every angle | Stuff", "body": "Slim gaming monitors promise high resolutions and refresh rates\n\nThe most important part of any gaming monitor is the panel you'll be spending all your time staring at - but it never hurts to be easy on the eye everywhere else. Samsung's design team have put just as much effort into the new Odyssey G6 and Odyssey G8 as its OLED display division, which will be music to the ears of players who put good looks on equal footing with refresh rates and resolution.\n\nBased on an early demo ahead of their official reveal, I'm already planning an upgrade to my home office/gaming space.\n\nBoth screens have metal frames that are mere millimetres thick at certain points, and bolt onto slim stands that are height-, tilt- and rotate-adjustable, with cable channels to keep wire tangles at bay. RGB light effects are of course present and correct, with a circular LED array at the rear that can be customised through software.\n\nThe 32in Odyssey G8 is more of a head-turner, and not just because of its size. Samsung has equipped it with a Tizen-powered smart OS that can handle streaming video, cloud gaming and PC-free productivity, without needing to plug in a laptop or desktop rig first. A pared-back remote control is included in the box, which could make this a superb single-screen option for students in tiny dorm rooms.\n\nNaturally it gets the gaming part right, with a 4K resolution, 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response times. AMD FreeSync Premium Pro adaptive refresh then stops any sort of stuttering, and a brightness/HDR optimiser accentuates highlights while keeping shadows inky black.\n\nSamsung has also applied a glare-free coating to the panel, which did a fantastic job in the brightly-lit demo area; even right next to a floor-to-ceiling window, I could see the onscreen action perfectly, with no noticeable reflections. The panel itself is a beauty, looking wonderfully vibrant and colourful when playing a quick game of Fortnite.\n\nImportantly, Samsung reckons its new dynamic cooling system is five times better at protecting against burn-in than its previous OLED efforts. It detects static screen elements and rotates pixels, too.\n\nThe Odyssey OLED G8 is going on sale imminently for \u00a31099.\n\nIt's effectively Samsung's new 'entry-level' OLED monitor, but I couldn't spot anything particularly entry-level about the Odyssey OLED G6 during my short taster session. It hits the current PC gaming sweet spot, with a 27in flat panel, 1440p resolution and rapid 360Hz refresh rate. That's high enough to persuade esports pros to abandon their TN displays.\n\nRocket League felt unbelievably smooth, with a beefy GPU providing a consistent frame rate and FreeSync ensuring no torn or dropped frames. The 0.03ms response time made all the difference, too; once you've played on a high refresh rate OLED, it'll be very hard to go back to anything else.\n\nThe Odyssey G6 doesn't have the G8's Tizen smarts, so you'll be relying on a PC or console for your downtime entertainment - but it doesn't skimp on ports, with two HDMIs, a DisplayPort, 3.5mm headphone port and even a two-port USB-A hub. It'll launch at \u00a3799 in the coming weeks, which is a seriously appealing price point for an OLED. Previously you needed to spend silly money on the curved Odyssey OLED G9 - which still remains king of the hill, alongside the epitome of excess that is the Odyssey Ark.\n\nIt's not all about gaming, though. Samsung is also catering to creative types with the Viewfinity S90PC - a 5K resolution stunner that promises high colour accuracy and easy calibration using your smartphone. All those extra pixels mean you can edit native resolution 4K video footage and still have plenty left over for your software's UI elements - not to mention perfect pixel scaling when hooked up to a modern MacBook.\n\nSamsung makes no bones about going after Apple owners here; a Studio Display with height and tilt adjust will set you back \u00a31899, even before applying Apple's nano-texture glass treatment, making the S90PC a relative bargain at \u00a31400.\n\nIt's packing Thunderbolt 4 connectivity, a LAN port and built-in KVM switch, as well as a clip-on webcam and Tizen-powered smartOS for video streaming outside of work hours. The slim bezel and minimalist stand complete the look.", "source": {"uri": "stuff.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stuff"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_morgan_freelander@stuff.tv", "name": "Tom Morgan-Freelander", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Odyssey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_G6", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LG G6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeSync", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FreeSync"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RGB color model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer monitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortnite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fortnite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High dynamic range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_gaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud gaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Remote control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pixel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video on demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Studio_Display", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Studio Display"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.stuff.tv/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/Samsung-Odyssey-G6-OLED-hands-on-lead.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622524", "eventUri": "eng-9622524", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

The style of the Samsung 32G80SD is more restrained than the glossy white we are used to, fading into the background of your setup more than the Odyssey Neo G8.\n\nAt 32-inches, this is a prime size for a flat monitor and the 16:9 aspect ratio means it is perfect for console gaming and movies, where ultrawide isn't always supported. We tested the Samsung 32G80SD with the PlayStation 5 and an Alienware gaming laptop.\n\nSamsung Odyssey OLED G8 Performance\n\nThe Samsung 32G80SD is capable of 4K at 240Hz over HDMI or DisplayPort if you have a graphics card capable of pushing it to the limit. The majority of our testing was at 120Hz, allowing us to enjoy the great-looking display and fast 0.03ms response time. This display supports FreeSync Premium Pro to keep your GPU and monitor in sync.\n\nThis display features a 16x9 aspect ratio, like most widescreen TVs, which makes it perfectly suited for console gaming and PC gaming if you don't want an ultra-wide experience. The display features a low glare coating, which helps you stay focused and preserve viewing even in a bright room or near a window.\n\nYou'll still find an easy-to-control Game Mode that offers fast access to common game settings and an Auto mode that detects what you are playing and switches to the best settings for that style of game.\n\nTesting the Samsung 32G80SD with Call of Duty: Warzone, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, Rocket League and Fall Guys left us impressed. Call of Duty specifically allowed us to test the limits of our console and laptop, and leave breathing room on the monitor. The 120 FPS and fast reaction time kept us in the game. As an older gamer this edge helped me keep up with my two teens better. The contrast is wonderful and the colors in Call of Duty and the more casual games we tested are great.\n\nThe display is more than capable of handling anything we threw at it. With DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.1, this monitor supports what you can do with current consoles and most PCs, and will support higher refresh rates as you upgrade your setup into the future. In addition to hooking up a device, you can use the NVIDIA GeForce NOW streaming service to play games right on the monitor with a controller or a mouse and keyboard.\n\nThe Samsung Odyssey OLED G8 uses AI to upscale video and photos to 4K, so lower-resolution media is better on this screen. The performance from the NQM AI Gen3 Processor feels on par with Samsung TVs, which are at the top of the upscaling game.\n\nSamsung also includes an OLED Safeguard+ feature on this display that prevents burn in with a \"Pulsating Heat Pipe\" that uses coolant to lower the temperature in areas of the screen that are too hot without lowering the brightness. This is in place of the graphite sheet that most OLED displays use. The screen also features logo and taskbar detection and a screensaver function to help prevent burn in.\n\nThe monitor is powered by a Tizen OS that looks like a Samsung TV. This allows you to run apps on the display and use it like a 32-inch Smart TV without using your PC or plugging in a streaming box. The flat design also makes this feel more like a TV, so it can pull double duty in a small room or a dorm.\n\nThe smart TV software includes most streaming apps, support to use the monitor as a wireless computer display on Windows, wireless connectivity for smartphones, and a gaming hub to connect directly to game streaming services. The display is also a SmartThings Hub, enhancing your smart home connectivity.\n\nSamsung Odyssey OLED G8 Design\n\nThis flat gaming monitor is more stealthy than the more familiar curved gaming monitor lineup from Samsung, but it still feels very modern. This may be a better style choice if you have your gaming setup in an open floor plan and you don't want a traditional gaming aesthetic in the corner of the room.\n\nThe base is slim and easy to install, so setup takes less than 5 minutes without any tools needed. Sasmung's traditional gaming monitors often use a very wide base with feet that come out into your desk. A cord holder in the back helps route the cables for a cleaner look. The display features two HDMI 2.1 ports, one DisplayPort 1.4 port, an ethernet port and two USB 2.0 ports.\n\nSamsung includes a remote that allows you to access the Smart software. This is perfect for when you use this for streaming or watching Live TV.\n\nShould You Buy the Samsung Odyssey OLED G8?\n\nThe Samsung 32G80SD is a fast 4K OLED monitor with a good smart TV interface and the ability to act as a smart home hub. The display delivers an incredibly fast refresh rate at full 4K resolution and a super fast response rate to give you as much of an edge as you can.\n\nThe downside to this monitor is that it is going to be pretty pricey peice in your setup and most gaming systems won't be able to hit 4K at 240 Hz. This is an inverstment in a display that will handle several upgrades to your PC or even a next gen console.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_smith@newsweek.com", "name": "Josh Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aspect ratio (image)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Call of Duty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DisplayPort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "HDMI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alienware", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alienware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaming_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaming computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PC game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widescreen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Widescreen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer monitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Warzone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Call of Duty: Warzone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Electronics", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung Electronics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2403706/samsung-odyssey-oled-g8.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=180a6cfe66518981d9b4690c6c6ee335", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622524", "eventUri": "eng-9622524", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

The G60SD with a 27-inch WQHD panel will cost \u20ac899, and the 32-inch G80SD with 4K resolution will cost \u20ac1,299.\n\nThe Samsung Odyssey OLED G6 G60SD and Samsung Odyssey OLED G8 G80SD both have a QD OLED panel from panel manufacturer Samsung Display. These panels have previously ended up in displays from other manufacturers. For example, Tweakers have already looked at the ASUS ROG Swift PG32UCDM, which, like the Odyssey G80SD, has a 32-inch 4K display with a 240Hz refresh rate. The Gigabyte AORUS FO27Q3, like the Odyssey G60SD, has a screen diagonal of 27 inches, 2560 x 1440 pixels. And a refresh rate of 360 Hz.\n\nWhat sets the new Odyssey displays apart from previous QD OLED displays is the matte finish. At the beginning of this year, Samsung also introduced a mirrorless QD OLED TV: the S95D. According to an employee at the event where Tweakers was present and where the displays were showcased, the matte panels will remain exclusive to Samsung for the time being. This matches announcements made by other manufacturers so far; There is not a single matte QD OLED screen. Anyone who wants a matte OLED screen has long been able to choose a screen based on LG's wool panel.\n\nThe Odyssey G60SD and G80SD feature a slim, silver-gray design with a ring of RGB lighting around the mounting point of the base. The screen is cooled passively by a type of heat pipe located behind the panel. Both monitors have a full-size DisplayPort 1.4 input and two HDMI 2.1 ports, one of which has Audio return channel On the 32-inch model. The 27-inch monitor has a 3.5mm headphone port instead. There's also a two-port USB3.1 hub, but no USB-C port with DisplayPort support and Power Delivery. Many other QD OLED displays from this year have it.\n\nThe Odyssey G60SD has a traditional OSD and five-point joystick control, while the G80SD has a remote control and the same Tizen software found in Samsung TVs and some displays, like the Odyssey OLED G95SC. In addition to the ability to use streaming services and display the image from a smartphone wirelessly, this display has Matter and SmartThings support.

Specifically, instead of following the familiar formula of higher resolutions and wider screens, the company injected its newest screens with today's hottest tech -- AI. Enter the Samsung OLED G80SD and Samsung M80D, the first monitors in the company's gaming and productivity lineups to offer AI upscaling, promising to bring lower-resolution streamed content up to near-4K levels.\n\nStopping by the Samsung 837 Store in New York City recently, we got a chance to go hands and eyes on with the new displays, which are among the first of the models announced at CES to go on sale. We left impressed by Samsung's thoughtful injection of AI, the M80D's productivity-packed feature set, and the G80SD's gorgeous 4K OLED display (even though it arrives halfway through a year packed with similar monitors).\n\nOn the gaming monitor front, Samsung is introducing the OLED G80SD and the G60SD (G8 and G6 for short). Part of the same family as the Samsung Odyssey OLED G9, the G8 might be familiar to those who've kept an eye on the premium gaming monitor segment over the years. Here are the specs, and stop me if you've heard this before: a 32-inch OLED panel with 4K resolution, AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, a 0.03ms response time, and a 240Hz refresh rate. Yes, we've seen similar offerings this year from Alienware, Asus, LG, and MSI, but Samsung hopes to stand out with some help from today's tech buzzword: AI.\n\nTechnically, we've seen AI in gaming monitors before -- for instance, optimizing settings and power usage options in some of MSI's 4K OLED displays. That's a time saver, but not quite a groundbreaking use of the emerging tech.\n\nSamsung is injecting AI into its gaming monitors in perhaps a more meaningful way: upscaling streaming content. Thanks to what the company calls the NQ8 AI Gen3 Processor, the G8 monitor can upscale content to nearly 4K when using Samsung Gaming Hub and Smart TV apps. Samsung has used this technology before in TVs (see the Samsung 85-Inch QN900D 8K QLED TV), but this marks its first appearance in a gaming monitor.\n\nHowever, AI upscaling is not without issues, as the rebuilt image can often leave behind unintended artifacts and add some unwanted input lag. We weren't able to see the upscaling in action ourselves during our hands-on time with the new monitors, so it remains to be seen if the quality is noticeably affected by the upscaling. But considering the noticeable gains while using the technology in Samsung's TVs, we remain optimistic.\n\nThe new monitors also support HDR10+, which means they can read metadata from HDR content and apply dynamic per-scene HDR and dynamic HDR tone mapping in real time. In our demo, we took a stroll down the streets of Cyberpunk 2077, a game packed full of neon lights and other visual effects that are really perfect for showcasing the HDR. Even in our short demo, you could immediately notice the strong contrasting colors and vibrant textures of in-game scenes. Highlights from streetlights were particularly eye-catching, and the added fidelity helps you appreciate the finer details of Night City.\n\nIn addition to AI upscaling, the monitor offers many new features that are firsts for Samsung's gaming line, including a dynamic cooling system that diffuses heat and predicts surface temperature, controlling brightness to prevent overheating. The monitor also automatically adjusts brightness on static images to help prevent burn-in.\n\nThe G8 might be the belle of the ball, but Samsung is also offering another OLED display: the G6. It's made with hard-core gamers in mind, dropping size to 27 inches and resolution to QHD (2,560 by 1,440 pixels) but raising the refresh rate to 360Hz. It retains many of the features of the G8, though it does not offer an AI processor or the Samsung entertainment options.\n\nBut while AI upscaling is off the cards, the G6 does offer a remarkably sleek metal design, measuring just 0.15 inch at its thinnest point. Its smaller footprint is ideal for gamers with limited desk space. It's a more traditional gaming monitor than Samsung's other gaming displays, which tend to borrow features from the company's TVs. Still, we haven't met an OLED monitor we didn't like, and the 27-inch variant is no exception.\n\nAs for price, you'll reach deep into your wallet no matter your choice. The 32-inch Samsung OLED G80SD retails for $1,299, while the 27-inch Samsung OLED G60SD comes in at $899.\n\nSamsung's 32-inch M80D also uses an AI processor, which like the OLED G8's promises to upscale streamed content to near-4K resolution. And you'll find plenty of content to choose from: Like its predecessors, the M80D offers access to streaming TV apps from partners like Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, and YouTube, as well as the Samsung Gaming Hub to stream games directly to your monitor with no additional hardware required.\n\nNeed to get some work done? The Multi Control feature lets you easily move images between the monitor and other Samsung devices with just your keyboard and mouse. You can also pair the M80D with Matter-compatible smart home devices to transform your monitor into a bona fide control hub.\n\nWe especially like the detachable SlimFit camera. The camera sits atop the thin frame of the monitor and is attached to a USB-C port. While it can be used for video calls, it's even more fun when it works in tandem with exercise devices and fitness apps. The M80D also offers an ergonomic design, built-in speakers, and plenty of ports, including USB-A, HDMI, and USB-C.\n\nWhat was striking in our demo was just how compact the monitor was, especially for a 32-inch screen, and I can see it being an ideal companion for the home office. Yes, there's no OLED here, but the M80D's target audience will probably not mind, thanks to how feature-rich the monitor is. However, in our short demo, I admittedly struggled to get the camera to lock on to me while trying out the fitness apps.\n\nThe Samsung M80D Smart Monitor is less expensive than the OLED options, retailing for $699.\n\nWhether you're gaming, working from home, or just looking for a display that does it all, the new Samsung offerings likely have you covered. They're now available for purchase, with an additional launch sweetener if you buy direct from Samsung: a $300 credit for a future purchase. Still, it might be worth waiting to buy until we've had a chance to give a final verdict after testing in PC Labs.

Consisting of the new M8 (M80D model), M7 (M70D model), and M5 (M50D model) ranging in sizes from 27-inches up to 43-inches, they are once again looking to bring \"a complete multi-device experience into one hub for smarter entertainment and greater productivity.\"\n\nA 360 Audio Mode that pairs with Galaxy Buds \"to create an immersive sound environment,\" the onboard streaming features for gaming and services like Netflix (without a PC), and the built-in SlimFit webcam are making a return, but there is also a new feature coming to the entire lineup in the form of Galaxy Watch pairing. The new Workout Tracker pairs with your Samsung wearable to \"enable real-time health data on the screen, even while streaming content.\"\n\nAnd as promised here's a rundown of the new Odyssey and ViewFinity lineups:\n\nAll of these monitors will be up for pre-order at any minute now, if they aren't already, alongside the up to $300 in Samsung credit for doing so. And this kind of credit can really come in handy when it comes to scoring a new Galaxy handsets or wearable in the future (or right now), especially considering the deep deals the Samsung site has been cranking out as of late. We will update this post with specifics in terms of pricing and where the credit lands shortly.", "source": {"uri": "9to5toys.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "9to5Toys"}, "authors": [{"uri": "justin_kahn@9to5toys.com", "name": "Justin Kahn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Odyssey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer monitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-order", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pre-order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samsung Galaxy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workstation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Workstation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Webcam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Environmental_Monitoring", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Environmental Monitoring", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Galaxies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Galaxies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Boats_and_Ships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Boats and Ships", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/9to5toys.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/06/Samsung-Smart-Monitors-2024-01.jpeg?resize=1200%2C628&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622524", "eventUri": "eng-9622524", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

However, while the massive 49-inch Odyssey G9 (G95SD) garnered most of the attention when initial details came out in January, I recently had a chance to check out its smaller siblings in person (plus one of Samsung's new smart monitors), which are just as impressive due to their lower prices and more-practical screen sizes.\n\nSimilar to the Alienware AW3225QF and HP Omen Transcend 32, the 2024 Odyssey G8 OLED (G80SD) and Odyssey G6 OLED (G60SD) are based on Samsung's third-gen QD-OLED tech. That means you get rich colors and deep blacks along with support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and increased brightness compared to traditional OLED displays. But from there, the two monitors diverge slightly with the 32-inch G8 being more of an all-rounder thanks to its 4K resolution and 240Hz refresh rate. Meanwhile, the smaller G6 is better suited for competitive gaming with its 2,560 x 1,440 resolution and 360Hz refresh rate.\n\nMy favorite of the two is the G8, as it features a flat display (not curved like the Alienware) with an anti-reflective matte coating and an extremely sleek design that lets you appreciate its super-thin 0.15-inch panel. Meanwhile, Samsung has equipped both the G8 and G6 with a dynamic cooling system that better reduces temperatures and can even preemptively control brightness if needed. And, for the first time, Samsung is offering a three-year warranty in case the monitor succumbs to burn-in.\n\nI also appreciate that even though it's a relatively large monitor, the G8 supports height adjustment and the ability to rotate into portrait mode. As a nod towards convenience, it comes with built-in stereo speakers and a solar remote (similar to what you get from Samsung's flagship TVs), so you can easily connect it to gaming consoles alongside a traditional PC. And in case that's not enough, the G8 also features Samsung's Gaming Hub, which allows you to access streaming services like NVIDIA GeForce Now and Xbox Cloud Gaming without needing to connect to another device.\n\nAlternatively, for more hardcore gamers, the G6 packs almost all of the same tech (including the remote and matte coating) into an even more practical 27-inch display. You still get Samsung's CoreLighting+ module in back to supply some ambient RGB hues and a similarly sleek metal design. Samsung even redesigned the G8 and G6's feet to give people with unusual gaming setups more flexibility and room to position their mouse and keyboard.\n\nFinally, while it's neither OLED nor a gaming display, Samsung's M80D Smart Monitor is a neat take on 4K office productivity. It features a magnetic mount for a detachable webcam, so you can easily position it without the need for a tripod or quickly remove it at the end of a video call. You can also pair it over Wi-Fi with other Samsung devices, allowing you to easily move images or files from one to another. Just like the G8 and G6, it supports Samsung's Gaming Hub and the ability to stream shows from apps like Netflix natively on the monitor.\n\nThe G9 remains the true flagship of Samsung's gaming monitors, but the company has now made great options at smaller sizes too. The Odyssey G8 and G6 will start at $1,300 and $900, respectively, while the M80D Smart Monitor will go for $700. Pre-orders go live today and will come with a $300 discount for anyone who makes an early purchase before official sales begin later this month.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Eight", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Group of Eight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_G6", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LG G6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Odyssey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer monitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alienware", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alienware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeSync", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FreeSync"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer Electronics Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot_display", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quantum dot display"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-order", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pre-order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Esports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereophonic_sound", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stereophonic sound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Cloud_Gaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Cloud Gaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer mouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Videotelephony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RGB color model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Webcam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GeForce"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/yVqkED7AqBWEPL5dw27GlQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03MjA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-06/d8f2a820-21ea-11ef-bfce-b358ee830513", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622524", "eventUri": "eng-9622524", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

So, we're not surprised that the company stopped by the big tech event going on right now. Samsung showed off its new monitors at Computex 2024. It introduced new additions to its Odyssey, Smart Monitors, and ViewFinity lines.\n\nIn case you didn't know, Computex is still going on, and it will be going on for a few more days. It will last until Friday, June 7th, so there's still plenty of time to catch all of the exciting announcements going on. For example, Tecno showed off some of the exciting tech that it's working on.\n\nStarting off the list we have the new 2024 line of Odyssey monitors. they are designed to take your gaming to the next level. The new Odyssey OLED G8 is a large 32-inch monitor with a 4K resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. This will make all of the games you play pop, and you won't have to worry about latency because it has a .03ms GtG response time.\n\nNext, the smaller OLED G6 is less robust, but it will still give you an amazing gaming experience. It comes in at 27 inches, and it has a QHD resolution. That's still twice as sharp as 1080p, so you're good on pixel density. It has a fluid 360Hz refresh rate.\n\nBoth models include Samsung's new OLED Safeguard+ technology and a pulsating heat pipe and Dynamic Cooling System. This technology help reduce the screen burn-in issue that plagues many OLED screens.\n\nObviously, the company had to showcase some sort of AI technology. Both of the monitors use the company's NQ8 AI Gen3 processor. This uses AI to upscale to near 4K quality.\n\nSamsung has a line of monitors that are basically computers on their own. These are monitors that are meant to be connected to devices. However, if you need to use them separately, they can act as their own devices and even access Microsoft Office programs.\n\nAt Computex, the company showed off three new models of its Smart Monitor computers. These are the M8, M7, and M5. Starting off with the M8, this monitor has a 23-inch 4K display that uses Samsung's superior display technology. There are also features like image upscaling, Active Voice Amplifier Pro, and 360 Audio Mode which enhances the audio quality.\n\nAll three of the models support several streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, AppleTV+, and more. They're great monitors to have if you want just a bit more from your monitor.\n\nRounding the new additions, we have the new VeiwFinity series. These monitors are designed for professional use. They focus on precision and high-quality imagery. The view Finity S8 comes in at 4K resolution while the ViewFinity S6 comes in at QHD resolution with a 100Hz refresh rate.\n\nBoth of these monitors have high color accuracy, HDR10 support, 1 billion colors, and T\u00dcV-Rheinland-certified Intelligent Eye Care features.", "source": {"uri": "androidheadlines.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Android Headlines"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arthur_brown@androidheadlines.com", "name": "Arthur Brown", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computex", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer monitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_G6", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LG G6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_burn-in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Screen burn-in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_time_(technology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Response time (technology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Latency (engineering)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_density", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pixel density"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_display_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphics display resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1080p"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDR10", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HDR10"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_scaler", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video scaler"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Environmental_Monitoring", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Environmental Monitoring", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Networking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Networking", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.androidheadlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Samsung-new-monitors-computex-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622524", "eventUri": "eng-9622524", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 474, "textEnd": 482}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

However, Samsung's latest flat-paneled Odyssey OLEDs have some of the most exciting features behind the display. I had the opportunity to spend about an hour in front of Samsung's latest Odyssey monitors, including the G6, G8, and G9. And damn, are they nice. Even with a great screen and all the extra trimmings, I still can't say whether they're worth their very high asking price.\n\nThe Odyssey OLED line sports the G6, G8, and G9, but ignore the big curved screen introduced last year since the OLED G8 is more interesting than it first seems. The $1,300 monitor does 4K, and the 240 Hz refresh rate most high-end monitors promote at the base. It's everything you expect from OLED, including the inky blacks, great color contrast, and .03ms response times. But for anybody who has used Samsung's latest TVs like the QN90D, you may be surprised to find the G8 also supports Samsung's Smart TV content like Gaming Hub, making it possible to access a whole host of streaming services like GeForce Now or Game Pass without needing to have a PC or streaming device connected at all.\n\nThe monitor is essentially a Samsung TV and a typical Odyssey monitor rolled into one. It is supposed to have the same NQ8 Ai Gen3 processor as the latest smart TVs meant to upscale non-4K content to a higher resolution. In my personal experience, the difference is negligible. Perhaps the smaller screen could make a difference in the look of your upscaled SD content, but I would need to do a lot more with the monitor to see more.\n\nI spent some time in front of the new, smaller Odyssey OLED G6, a 27-inch that doesn't do 4K but can push refresh rates up to 360 Hz. Both share the same cooling system heat monitoring that's supposed to decrease the risk of OLED burn-in by distributing heat more evenly across the monitor's surface. The two displays can also auto-control the brightness of some parts of the screen, such as logos or taskbars, which should also decrease the likelihood an image will get burned into the screen.\n\nThe G6 has the same kind of rear, swirling RGB lighting to dance some fancy effects across your back wall, but with a 2,560x1,440 resolution at $900 MSRP, it also doesn't seem like you're getting nearly as much bang for your buck compared to the $1,300 monitor that does the full 4K. I will repeat it: those ultra-competitive gamers obsessed with high refresh rates should only care about hitting the 240 Hz standardized for competitive multiplayer tournaments.\n\nThey can swivel, pitch, and pivot a fair degree, but what's extra striking about the new monitors is how well they can reduce glare without sacrificing picture quality. I could compare it to the massive, ultrawide Samsung OLED G9's 49-inch 1000R curved screen. Yes, I could sit in front of the $1,300 G9 and be swallowed whole by the encroaching maw of the screen, but in most kinds of direct light, I would find some pretty annoying reflections or glare. The flat, G8 and G6 didn't have that problem. We opened the blinds to a sunny spring day and blasted lights at the screens, and each looked good, either in dark or direct sunlight.\n\nBut there's some stiff competition for that $1,200 price point. You could also look at the Alienware AW3225QF that also does 4K at 240 Hz, but it also comes with a nice, 32-inch 1700R curved screen that's far more gentle and manageable than something like the 49-inch Odyssey G9. It may not boast as many RGB lights as Samsung's Odyssey latest G-series, but it's also a far more unique screen you'd be getting for that heartbreaking price tag.\n\nSamsung was happy to let me try the silliest features on its new 4K M80D Smart Monitor. It's another one of those devices that boasts you don't need to have a PC nearby to get it running with your favorite streaming services. Similar to the Odyssey OLED G8, the $700 M80D comes packed with the same Smart TV menus and apps found on its TVs, but it also comes packed with some rather strange personal fitness apps that will see you dash across the room or else lunge like an Olympic fencer to match the prompts on-screen.\n\nOkay, it's not something I would use in my workouts, though -- yes -- it does work up a sweat. I was also pretty disappointed when the detachable SlimFit camera didn't pick up when I hit my mark. Samsung promises you will be able to pair it with any number of Matter-compatible IoT devices or connect it to your fitness apps over Bluetooth.\n\nThe M80D also syncs directly with other Samsung-brand products, especially the company's earbuds, tablets, and PCs. Samsung was happy to show off how to automatically sync a Galaxy tablet with the M80D for a quick, two-screen experience. The cursor was pretty laggy on the tablet screen, which wasn't on the main monitor. This software issue may get ironed out in time, but I wouldn't buy it now, thinking your Samsung-centric lifestyle would get a boost.", "source": {"uri": "gizmodo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gizmodo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Eight", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Group of Eight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_G6", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LG G6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Odyssey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer monitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_Now", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GeForce Now"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gamer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Electronics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samsung Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_(vision)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contrast (vision)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Game_Pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Game Pass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SD_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SD card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_burn-in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Screen burn-in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_scaler", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video scaler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RGB color model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taskbar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taskbar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multiplayer video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smart TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alienware", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alienware"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop_Customization", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop Customization", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Environmental_Monitoring", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Environmental Monitoring", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Video", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Video", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet_PCs", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet PCs", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Home_Theater", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Home Theater", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/0d3faa260e40bef751bdd44cbe581d16.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622524", "eventUri": "eng-9622524", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

There are already plenty of OLED monitors to choose from for gamers. But for creators, who prefer a 4K panel, there aren't as many choices and the sizes were limited to 27''. With the Samsung Odyssey G80SD, creators can do their work with all the needed resolution, space and OLED goodness, but still play their games on the same monitor.\n\nEstimated reading time: 13 minutes\n\nBefore we jump into the review, as I always do with these types of reviews, I must clarify one thing. I am not a hard core gamer. If you're looking for a game-centric review of the Samsung Odyssey G80SD, then you're probably better served finding a pure gaming site for that. I will touch on my gaming experience with this monitor but I am a content creator first and I used this monitor the way I would any other monitor. That is for creating content and doing some light entertainment and gaming. So let's get into it!\n\nIf you're just not content with the 27'' OLED gaming monitors that are on the market currently. Then the Samsung Odyssey G80SD is the perfect choice. This is a monitor for all gamers, but for me, it sits as one of the best choices for creator-gamers.\n\nFor the creator who games, this has all the essential gaming needs, 240Hz refresh rate, even if you won't get that in most games. Great colors, vibrancy, and deep blacks for all of your favorite FPS games and whatever you enjoy playing. And of course, OLED with Quantum Dot back lighting, which is a fan favorite for gamers.\n\nFor the creative side of things. With the Samsung Odyssey G80SD, you don't have to switch to another monitor. Finished playing a game? Then turn it off and go back to work on a crisp and sharp 4K display with excellent color accuracy, brightness, viewing angles, and plenty of workspace area.\n\nThe Samsung Odyssey G80SD is a wet dream for creator-gamers and it should satisfy that group of people very well.\n\nThe Samsung Odyssey G80SD has the following features and specifications:\n\nThe Samsung Odyssey G80SD design blends the Odyssey look with a minimal and clean design aesthetic. This is unlike the Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 G95NC in terms of looks and more like a normal monitor. You could use this at work, and turn off the RGB, and no one would know it was that special. Even the Odyssey logo is subtle and unassuming.\n\nThe front of the G80SD is fairly plain, the bezels are thin but not invisible, they look good. The Samsung logo is tiny and centered at the bottom of the front panel. The overall color is silver with black accents and there is a venting rail at the bottom of the monitor.\n\nThe back of the Samsung Odyssey G80SD has a little more going on, with the majority of its silver coloring with black accents here. The Odyssey logo is on the back and it is subtle and unassuming. There are a few accent lines and a vent here as well. Then there is the I/O, power button, and joystick. There is a Solarcell remote included, which is great and lets you control most functions without having to reach around. Then there is the RGB ring in the center that lights up and can be controlled through the interface, cool looking indeed!\n\nI've discussed the Samsung solar remote and it's by far my favorite remote, and the company uses them on their TVs as well. Since this monitor also has Samsung's TV interface, you can use it as a TV if you like and you have access to all the streaming apps you want. More on this in the software/interface section.\n\nFinally, on the back are the input and outputs, which are listed above in the specifications section. But here's what you get:\n\nI wish they would have included a USB-C/Thunderbolt port on the back as well for creators to use external USB-C/Thunderbolt drives without having to get a USB-A dongle out.\n\nThe stand is fairly simple, more on setting it up in the next section. But the stand articulates and has a cable management strap on the back. In does a good job of holding cables but it's pretty simple. The monitor swivels and you can rotate it in portrait mode to. I think there's a good amount of flexibility with this panel.\n\nOverall, the design of the Samsung Odyssey G80SD is pretty simple and minimal. There's nothing hugely crazy about it and it doesn't even look like a gaming monitor, except for the RGB ring on the back. I like this design, simple, effective, straightforward, and accessible.\n\nAssembling the stand is simple. It comes in two parts, the base and the arm. The base just screws in at the bottom with a thumb screw and holds securely. Then you simply slip the arm into the back of the monitor where the RGB ring is and it locks in place. Easy as pie. Once setup, getting it going is easy to.\n\nSetting up the software is like setting up a Samsung TV. Just go through the prompts and sign into your Samsung account and you are done. Overall, setting up and using the Samsung Odyssey G80SD is dead simple.\n\nThe Samsung Odyssey G80SD runs on Tizen OS, the same as the company's TV ecosystem. Also shared with the other Samsung monitors and its TVs is the Smart Hub user interface. Smart Hub, which includes Samsung's Gaming Hub. Through the Smart and Gaming Hubs you can perform a myriad of tasks and you can access the Hubs with the included remote by pressing the home button. Here are some of the things you can access using the Hub:\n\nSamsung says that the Gaming Hub enables players to instantly access their favorite games from its content partners. In addition to accessing games, gamers can also look forward to enhanced gameplay with minimized judder and blur, thanks to advanced motion enhancements and latency reducing technology.\n\nYou can install apps such as Disney+, Netflix, Prime Video, and pretty much everything you can install on a Samsung TV you can install on the Samsung Odyssey G80SD. When you are not using the sources you've plugged, the Samsung Odyssey G80SD can function as a full-on streaming box/television.\n\nYou have Ambient Mode, which allows you to display artwork, news, or photos like wallpaper on the screen. There is Workspace, which will enable you to use Samsung DeX and mirror devices and use things like Microsoft Teams. Of course, there is Game Hub, which allows Xbox Cloud Gaming, Stadia, NVIDIA GeForce Now, Utomik, and other gaming sources. There are also features such as Multi-View, which allows you to split the screen between sources.\n\nOverall, Samsung has been making its latest monitors far more than just monitors. The Smart and Gaming Hub addition is a fantastic, especially for a gaming monitor, though some may worry about yet another device that needs to be updated. That is a valid concern, as a dumb monitor needs no updating. From our experience, with previous Samsung Smart Monitors, the Samsung Ark, and the Samsung Odyssey G80SD, this new software experience has been solid on the company's new monitors.\n\nSo here we are at the display, what can I say about this thing? It's a Samsung display and we all know how damn good these things are!\n\nThe Samsung Odyssey G80SD OLED panel is vibrant and colorful with Quantum Dot backlighting. QD backlighting is Samsung's answer to getting the brightness levels up on OLED displays, and boy does it work! Usually OLED displays are not super bright, but this one is nice and bright. While still not at QLED brightness levels, it is brighter than older OLEDs and brighter than a lot of other OLEDs on the market.\n\nI'm not going to say much more about how great this panel looks, it is common knowledge how good Samsung panels are. It is colorful, vibrant, crisp, deep blacks, clean whites, and with Quantum Dot backlighting, makes it nice and bright. I think what we need to address is OLED burn in. Samsung is addressing this with what it calls OLED Safeguard+, here's a simple explanation.\n\nThe main feature of Samsung's OLED Safeguard+, the company's proprietary Dynamic Cooling System, effectively cools down the screen temperature to prevent burn-in by applying the \"Pulsating Heat Pipe.\n\nSamsung's OLED Safeguard+ also supports various features that automatically adjust brightness, reducing a major cause of heat and burn-in.\n\nSamsung's OLED Safeguard+ probably needs a long-term test to really get an idea if it works well. So we didn't have that long for testing. But hopefully, we can see what comes of it later this year.\n\nOverall, this display is fantastic for creating videos and editing photos but it works equally well for gaming with its high refresh rate and super colorful and bright display.\n\nPerformance is one area I most likely won't be getting too technical with. I know numerous gamers have an insatiable need to know the framerates from some sample games and the specs of the PC being used, but I won't be getting into that.\n\nI used this monitor with a 2024 Dell XPS 16 and with a Mac Mini M1. But I did not run any sort of benchmark software.\n\nI had no issues with the performance of the Samsung Odyssey G80SD. When editing video in DaVinci Resolve, everything looked crisp and colorful. The colors were spectacular, vibrant, and the blacks were deep. I did use my Spyder calibration tool to calibrate the monitor, only minor tweaks were needed.\n\nThe monitor powers on quickly and connects quickly. Moving through the interface and selecting sources with the remote is fast and seamless.\n\nWhen tested with Affinity Photo and editing photos, everything rendered quickly and without any issues. Color accuracy, I believe, is near perfect.\n\nFor gamers, I understand this monitor runs at 240Hz refresh rate, but you'll be hard-pressed to get that from most rigs today. I know the systems I tested with aren't going to deliver that rate and when I played games, everything looked buttery smooth with no lag or dropped frames.\n\nWhat I will add is that the Samsung Odyssey G80SD runs Samsung's NQM AI Gen3 Processor. Samsung says by combining 512 multi-layer neural networks, Samsung's \"most powerful AI-powered processor\" analyzes images and restores details by the pixel for AI-upscaled picture quality to nearly 4K. The upscaling works when using Gaming Hub, Smart TV apps or in AV mode, but the image quality is not affected in PC mode.\n\nOverall, I think the Samsung Odyssey G80SD is an outstanding performer for creatives, and gamers should also be impressed with the muscle this thing has.\n\nThe 10W 2Ch speakers work nicely. They aren't headphone or desktop speaker powerful, but they do work in a pinch. You should never expect superior sound from speakers like these, but the sound they deliver is excellent for what they are. Not to mention, speakers on monitors are getting better. Four years ago, I would have told you to not even bother with them, now, these will actually work nicely if you have nothing else.\n\nThe Samsung Odyssey G80SD is priced at $1299.99 and the value to price ratio is there. You are getting the absolute best for your money with this monitor. You can find the G80SD on Samsung's website.\n\nThe Samsung Odyssey G80SD is the ultimate 32'' 4K OLED gaming monitor for creators and gamers alike. I highly recommend this one, it is well worth your money.", "source": {"uri": "techaeris.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Techaeris"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_hernandez@techaeris.com", "name": "Alex Hernandez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "RGB color model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Odyssey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer monitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USB-C"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot_display", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quantum dot display"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbolt_(interface)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thunderbolt (interface)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Display device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gamer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dongle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tizen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tizen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telecine"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://techaeris.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Samsung-Odyssey-G80SD-review-4K-QD-OLED-goodness-for-creator-gamers.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622524", "eventUri": "eng-9622524", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}
{"uri": "8160579426", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-06-04", "time": "07:04:30", "dateTime": "2024-06-04T07:04:30Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-06-04T07:03:53Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6000000238418579, "url": "https://www.techradar.com/gaming/samsung-odyssey-s32g80sd-review", "title": "Samsung Odyssey S32G80SD review: a supreme 4K gaming monitor", "body": "The Samsung Odyssey S32G80SD seems to want to be all things to all people. While it ticks pretty much every gaming box you'd expect a gaming monitor to tick (and then some), it also just so happens to be a stunning video display.\n\nAt the heart of its multifaceted talents is one of Samsung's latest Quantum Dot OLED panels, here delivered in a flat 32-inch screen with a 16:9 aspect ratio. Samsung has managed to fit a full 4K resolution into this gaming monitor, backed up by support for a 240Hz refresh rate.\n\nWhere the S32G80SD really kicks up a gear, though, is with a trio of remarkable new features. First, a potent new screen filter enhances gaming immersion and contrast by somehow suppressing almost all reflections from your room. Second, pictures are driven by the same ultra-powerful processor deployed in Samsung's flagship 8K TVs. Third, a new ultra-efficient cooling system has been built into the S32G80SD's OLED screen to protect it more effectively than any other OLED monitor from potential heat damage.\n\nAdd to these ground-breaking features insanely precise and vibrant gaming images and a video performance that humbles many premium TVs, and the S32G80SD's initially hefty-looking $1,499 / \u00a31,099 price suddenly doesn't look unreasonable at all.\n\nThe Samsung Odyssey S32G80SD is available from the first week of July, priced at $1,499 in the US in the US and \u00a31,099.99 in the UK. That represents a serious hunk of change in a world where 32-inch HDR-capable monitors such as the recently tested Gigabyte GS32QC can be had for $250 / \u00a3250, but the S32G80SD does one heck of a job of justifying that cost.\n\nIt's built around a premium Quantum Dot type of OLED panel for starters, with all the innate picture quality advantages that it brings. Around that screen, moreover, Samsung has built a gorgeous-looking chassis packed with premium processing and hardware features the like of which, in some cases, the monitor world hasn't seen before.\n\nThe S32G80SD looks and feels every inch a premium monitor. Build quality for the 32-inch, 16:9 flat screen is excellent, as a silvery metallic sheath wraps around from the outer edges of the bezel to cover the rear panel. This is replicated, too, over the handsome, heavy-duty hexagonal desktop foot. The rear panel is on-trend slim, but still finds room for some elegant arcs and curves, while the stand neck features a reflection-free corrugated black finish on its front edge and a cable tidy 'ring' on its rear.\n\nAgainst such a subtle and refined design the appearance of a ring of colored LEDs around the stand attach point feels a bit garish at first. Thankfully you can turn this light show off if you wish - though actually, over time I grew to quite like the extra immersion it brings to gaming.\n\nImpressively the S32G80SD's screen attaches to the neck and the neck attaches to the stand simply by twisting them together until they click into place. There's not a screw in sight. The screen can tilt, swivel, pivot, and slide up and down on the stand, and there's support for VESA mounting if you want to move away from the provided stand.\n\nConnections are rather awkwardly positioned but impressively include two high bandwidth HDMI 2.1 ports as well as two USB-C ports, one USB-B port, and a DisplayPort (1.4). The S32G80SD ships with a small but ergonomic remote control that features a USB-C charge point on the bottom and, even better, a solar panel on its rear.\n\nThe Samsung Odyssey S32G80SD's epic roster of features kicks off with its use of one of Samsung's new Quantum Dot OLED type of screens, which are already renowned for their remarkable color and contrast properties. What's more, using a 16:9 aspect ratio has allowed Samsung to squeeze in a native 4K/UHD pixel count of 3840x2160.\n\nThe screen sports arguably the most effective anti-reflection filter I've ever seen on a monitor. General ambient light and mildly reflective objects in your room are rejected pretty much completely, while even harsh direct lights positioned directly opposite the screen are dispersed to a degree where you barely notice them even when you're wandering around the dark underground environments in Shadow Of The Tomb Raider. There's no overstating how much this reflection suppression enhances your immersion in whatever you're watching or playing.\n\nAnyone concerned about OLED's susceptibility to screen burn-in should be very interested indeed in the S32G80SD's new Pulsating Heat Pipe cooling system. This condenses or evaporates coolant contained in tiny pipes that run behind the screen to control heat where necessary without any compromise to image brightness.\n\nThis potentially game-changing new OLED panel protection feature is joined by more traditional ones such as local dimming of logo/HUD elements, general 'thermal modulation' (brightness control), and a screen saver.\n\nThe S32G80SD is powered by what has to surely be the most powerful processor in the gaming monitor world. Samsung has essentially ported in an optimized version of the Neo Quantum 8 AI Gen 3 processor used in Samsung's latest, highly acclaimed flagship 8K TVs. This might sound like overkill for a 4K monitor, but it really does make sense to apply to a gaming monitor a processor able to handle vast amounts of pixels, motion, color, and multi-window management (including simultaneous playback of different external AV sources) in real-time backed up by a knowledge base derived from no less than 512 separate neural networks.\n\nThe S32G80SD also carries the same Tizen operating system, with a few monitor-specific tweaks, used in Samsung's latest gaming TVs. This means you get access to Samsung's excellent Game Hub, which brings together your external game devices as well as streamed gaming services like Xbox Game Pass, NVidia GeForce Now, Boosteroid, and Utomic into one attractive and intelligently curated dedicated home screen. A 'Daily+' section of the Tizen interface also provides monitor-friendly features such as Easy PC setup, Remote PC support for PCs and Macs, Microsoft 365, and Samsung's DeX system, while the home screen additionally gives you access to a great selection of video streaming apps. Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube, Disney+, and Apple TV, for instance, are all present and correct, as are many of the UK's most popular terrestrial broadcaster catch-up platforms.\n\nAlmost every aspect of the S32G80SD's features can be controlled by voice commands using either the Bixby or Alexa voice recognition systems, often giving you an excellent shortcut without having to delve into the on-screen menu system.\n\nAlongside the relatively unusual and premium features detailed so far, of course, are plenty of other modern gaming staples. There's support for 240Hz, for instance, as well as 120Hz with native 4K feeds meaning it is firmly positioned to offer a premium PS5 monitor or Xbox Series X monitor solution. Variable refresh rates are supported in the core HDMI and AMD Freesync (though not NVIDIA G-Sync) flavors, while Auto Low Latency Mode switching (ALLM) is provided so that the TV can switch into a video or gaming mode automatically depending on what sort of content you're playing on your console or PC.\n\nYou can also call up a dedicated Game Bar menu while gaming to get game signal information and fast access to gaming assistants such as an onscreen crosshair, and a couple of motion enhancement levels if you want to reduce judder at the cost of a little screen response time, and the option to raise the brightness level of dark areas without impacting the rest of the picture.\n\nWhen it comes to HDR, finally, the S32G80SD supports the HDR10, HLG, and HDR10+ formats. There's no support for the popular Dolby Vision system.\n\nThe Odyssey S32G80SD's combination of a top-end OLED panel and ground-breaking new processing and features delivers images that are consistently jaw-dropping. And not just with games, either.\n\nIn fact, because it's so monumentally good with video compared with any other monitor I've seen, that's where I'm going to start. With streamed video or external video sources, for starters, immaculately deep and clean black levels combine with pristine bright whites and rich colors without the slightest hint of compromise - even when the lightest and darkest parts of an HDR image are just a pixel apart.\n\nSharpness and detail are out of this world, as cramming a 4K pixel count into a 32-inch screen delivers a pixel pitch so small that high-quality 4K sources essentially just look like real life rather than something a screen is producing. The hugely powerful NQ8 AI Gen 3 processor delivers the most natural, detailed, and dense upscaling of sub-4K content I've ever seen on a monitor too. Please note, though, that while it's fine with internal apps and connected video devices and consoles, the upscaling doesn't work if the monitor is set to its PC mode.\n\nColors are gorgeously rich (bolstered by the pure RGB architecture of the QD-OLED panel), but also full of nuance and balance. They enjoy totally natural video tones, too - something most other monitors find very difficult to achieve.\n\nViewing angles are pretty much infinite, while the ability of the NQ8 AI processor to show even small objects like tennis or cricket balls without them phasing in and out of the picture is like nothing I've seen before on a monitor.\n\nYou have to be a little careful with some of the S32G80SD's video settings. I'd recommend avoiding the garish Dynamic preset, turning off the Auto Picture clarity mode, and choosing a custom setting with the Blur and Judder reduction elements set no higher than their level five. I'd also turn off Dynamic Tone Mapping, as it can cause some brightness instability with HDR sources.\n\nSet up correctly, though, the S32G80SD's video images are nothing short of a revelation.\n\nWhile the S32G80SD's video mastery might be its biggest surprise, though, it is also, of course, a joyously brilliant gaming display. The sense of detail with native 4K games like Ori And The Will Of The Wisp delivered from an Xbox Series X is out of this world, for starters. In fact, the extra sense of the beauty of Ori's world I got when running the game in 4K 120Hz on such an incredibly precise monitor actually felt a bit emotional!\n\nContributing to this sense of absolute precision is the OLED panel's ability to control the light output of every individual pixel, which yields a gorgeously refined but also at times remarkably dynamic and intense sense of contrast. The range of colors the S32G80SD can cover (I measured 100% of sRGB and a whopping 99.2% of the DCI-P3 gamut) with almost infinite tonal subtlety plays a part in the immaculate finish of high-quality gaming images too.\n\nIf you've got a gaming PC capable of running 240Hz smoothly, you'll find the S32G80SD more than up to the job of doing full justice to it. Unfortunately, neither this nor an incredibly fast screen response time of 0.03ms Grey to Grey could stop me sucking at Fortnite on PC - but at least getting hammered looked nicer.\n\nCall Of Duty Modern Warfare 3 on PS5 looked and played better than I've ever experienced before on a monitor, too, while the beguiling world of Baldur's Gate 3 on console and PC became even more enticing and rich looking - especially with the Game Motion Plus tool called in to smooth away any slight judder.\n\nGames streamed from the many services the S32G80SD's Game Hub carries are all handled extremely slickly too, thanks to the monitor's high-bandwidth Wi-Fi system and processing architecture expressly designed to minimize lag.\n\nIt's tough to find anything negative to say about the S32G80SD's image performance. The Dynamic Tone Mapping option set to on by default in the Standard video preset can cause some distracting brightness instability with video sources, and I guess the image isn't spectacularly bright in HDR or SDR (319 nits and 190 nits respectively on a 10% measurement window) mode. On the brightness point, though, the pinpoint precision of the OLED lighting, the reflection-free screen, a pretty high claimed typical brightness of 250 nits, and the impressive potential to hit nearly 1000 nits when showing small HDR highlights all add up to a typically quite rich and punchy HDR performance.\n\nThe S32G80SD partners its imperious pictures with a stereo 5W sound system. This is not, inevitably, in the same realm of brilliance as the picture quality is, but it does deliver game and film soundtracks with a decent sense of clarity and busyness, and without succumbing to distortion even at almost maximum volume. There isn't much bass around, maximum volumes are limited and the sound lacks forward impact and impetus. But it's perfectly acceptable, for the most part, for users who are likely to be sat quite close to the screen.\n\nAll in all, while not cheap by 32-inch monitor standards, the Samsung Odyssey S32G80SD does more than enough in the feature and, especially, image quality departments to justify its cost. While there are a couple of notable absentees in the form of Nvidia G-Sync and Dolby Vision support, the S32G80SD compensates for this with a raft of new unique cutting-edge performance enhancements and a remarkable ability to be a fantastic video screen as well as a brilliant and wonderfully immersive gaming monitor.\n\nNot sold on the Samsung Odyssey S32G80SD? Here are two good alternatives to consider.\n\nOver the course of the 12 days I spent with the Samsung S32G80SD before writing this review, it was liberally used not just as a desktop display and gaming monitor, but also, once I realized how good it was with video, as a screen for watching streamed video from the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.\n\nI've never spent anywhere near as much time watching video on a gaming monitor as I did with the S32G80SD, in fact. But then I've never previously come across a video that's so brilliant at showing video.\n\nThis didn't prevent me from getting many (many!) hours of both work and play out of the monitor too, though. Calman software was used to measure the screen's color capabilities and accuracy, along with a Murideo signal generator and Minolta colorimeter.\n\nGames that found themselves in regular rotation were Fortnite and Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 on a PC; Ori And The Will of The Wisp, Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Baldur's Gate 3 on Xbox Series X; and Fortnite and Elden Ring on PS5.\n\nTests were done for video, desktop and gaming uses in both HDR and SDR modes.", "source": {"uri": "techradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRadar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_archer@techradar.com", "name": "John Archer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Display device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Odyssey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "USB-C"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "8K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aspect ratio (image)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Porting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_hardware", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USB hardware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Electronics_Standards_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video Electronics Standards Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High dynamic range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tizen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tizen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bandwidth (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Image resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speech recognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DisplayPort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Remote control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_365", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft 365"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blur_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blur (band)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/History", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/History", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JdC5woompdbegaqDMiTBTh-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622524", "eventUri": "eng-9622524", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

That means at 11:59 PST, the deal is over and the price goes back up. Now why would you want to consider the Odyssey G6 for your next gaming monitor? Well, for starters, it's a decent-sized display at 32 inches. It also comes with the 1000R curve, and the curved monitors can make your games look and feel more immersive.

That is going to be the biggest reason why this monitor is a no-brainer.\n\nA fast refresh rate makes a world of difference in fast-paced games. If it offers competitive multiplayer, you want a fast refresh rate. In terms of other features the Odyssey G6 comes with Display HDR 600 support, as well as support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. One of the cooler features too is that this comes with Samsung Gaming Hub. This lets you have access to all kinds of apps for streaming gaming content. Specifically for services like Xbox Game Pass, NVIDIA GeForce NOW, and others.\n\nThe monitor connects to the internet and then you can stream your games from one of the available services.

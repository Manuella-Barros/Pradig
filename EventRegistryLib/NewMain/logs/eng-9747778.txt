We're in the midst of doing exactly that,\" he said.\n\nOne difficulty, he said, was ensuring a lasting peace for both the Israeli and Palestinian people after the war was over.\n\n\"There's some fundamental realities that we can't escape,\" Mr. Blinken said.\n\n\"Between Gaza and the West Bank, there are somewhere over 5 million Palestinians. There are about 7 million Israeli Jews. Neither is going anywhere.\"\n\nTo that end, he said that the United States remained committed to a two-state solution but that key milestones would need to be achieved before Palestinian statehood would be feasible.\n\n\"We can see a future where Israel is integrated in the region, it's more secure, [and] the Palestinians recognize their aspirations for a state,\" he said, adding that \"there are important things that we need to have in order for a state to be realized.\"\n\n\"Who tried to disrupt the Oslo Accords? Hamas. When the Arabs launched the Arab Peace Initiative, and were moving towards recognition of Israel, who .. disrupted that? Hamas,\" Mr. Blinken said.\n\nThe United States and Israel would therefore need to work to ensure that \"Iran and its various proxies are isolated,\" Mr. Blinken said, in order to ensure the continued normalization of Israel's relations with other powers in the region.\n\nMr. Blinken expressed some hope for that goal, noting that regional powers previously antagonistic toward Israel actually came to the nation's defense in April, when Iran attacked the nation with some 300 drones and missiles.\n\nIran continued to pose a great threat to the stability of the region and the possibility of peace, he said, in no small part because of the regime's continued efforts to produce fissile material that could be used in the construction of nuclear weapons.\n\nMr. Blinken described the state of the Iran nuclear situation as \"not a good place.\"\n\n\"One or two weeks is probably what the realistic breakout time is,\" he said, referring to how long it would likely take Iran to build a serviceable nuclear warhead if it so chose.\n\nOn that issue, Mr. Blinken said that terminating the Obama-era Iran Nuclear Deal was \"one of the biggest mistakes\" made in U.S. policy in recent years and that efforts should be taken to limit Iran's ability and desire to create nuclear material that could be used in weapons.\n\n\"If you can at least take one problem off the board, which is Iran potentially with a nuclear weapon, that's inherently a good thing,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We've imposed more than 600 sanctions on Iranian persons and entities. We haven't lifted a single sanction,\" he asserted.\n\nRegarding the war in Gaza, he stated that Iran and Hamas are working to obstruct the two-state solution, referring to the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel.\n\nBlinken, speaking at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado, said, \"Hamas and Israel had agreed to the ceasefire framework outlined by US President Joe Biden in May after a lot of pushing and diplomacy, but some issues need to be resolved,\" adding, \"We're in the midst of doing exactly that.\"\n\n\"I believe we're inside the 10-yard line and driving toward the goal line in getting an agreement that would produce a ceasefire, get the hostages home and put us on a better track to trying to build lasting peace and stability,\" he pointed out.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to visit Washington next week and speak before a joint session of the U.S. Congress on July 24.

The U.S., under President Biden, has been the most important supporter of Ukraine's more than two-year battle against invading Russian forces.\n\nTrump's public comments have varied between criticizing U.S. backing for Ukraine's defense and supporting it, while his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, has been a leader of Republican efforts to block what have been billions in U.S. military and financial assistance to Ukraine since Russia invaded in 2022.\n\nRelated Biden announces $225 million weapons package for Ukraine, including Patriot system\n\nConcerns among Ukraine and its supporters that the country could lose vital U.S. support have increased as Trump's campaign surges and Biden's falters.\n\nBlinken said Friday that any new administration would have to take into account strong bipartisan backing in Congress for Ukraine in the interests of countering Russian President Vladimir Putin's attempts to expand Moscow's territory and influence.\n\n\"Every administration has an opportunity, of course, to set its own policy. We can't lock in the future,\" Blinken said, speaking to an audience of U.S. policymakers and others at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado.\n\nRelated Biden pushes party unity as he resists calls to step aside, says he'll return to campaign next week\n\nBut he pointed to the security agreements that the United States and more than 20 other allies - including some NATO partners, Japan and the European Union - signed at a NATO summit in Washington this month.\n\n\"Were we to renege on that ... I suppose that's possible, but happily we've got another 20-some-odd countries that are doing the same thing,\" Blinken said.\n\nUkraine itself was on a trajectory to ensure it \"stands on its own feet militarily, economically, democratically,\" Blinken said.\n\nCopy the Story Link Related Headlines After embrace at NATO summit, Zelensky takes his case for U.S. military aid to governors Biden announces $225 million weapons package for Ukraine, including Patriot system\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nfiled under: Donald Trump, ukraine Related Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri": "pressherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Portland Press Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspen_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aspen Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_summit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO summit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/07/US_Panama_25677-1721418787.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747778", "eventUri": "eng-9747778", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Trump's public comments have varied between criticizing U.S. backing for Ukraine's defense and supporting it.", "source": {"uri": "kion546.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KION546"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kion546.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://kion546.b-cdn.net/2023/10/kionlogog-860x540.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747778", "eventUri": "eng-9747778", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Bashar Taleb/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has a big job -- with conflicts and tension around the globe, he runs point on U.S. foreign policy worldwide.\n\nCentral to that job, he says, is recognizing the humanity in the person across the table, friend or foe.\n\n\"If we end or minimize the terrible dehumanization we see in so many places around the world, then ... I know that the best of humanity is not only possible, it's what will happen,\" he said on Friday.\n\nIn a wide-ranging conversation with All Things Considered host Mary Louise Kelly at the Aspen Security Forum, Secretary Blinken weighed in on everything from the prospect of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, to the war in Ukraine and what the U.S. is doing to bring home Americans detained in Russia.\n\nWatch the full conversation in the YouTube video below:\n\nThe following interview excerpt has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMary Louise Kelly: Our ambassador at the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said this week, \"negotiations on a ceasefire are trending in the right direction.\" Is she right? And on what is that based?\n\nAntony Blinken: What Linda said is right. I believe we're inside the 10-yard line and driving toward the goal line in getting an agreement that would produce a ceasefire, get the hostages home, and put us on a better track to trying to build lasting peace and stability.\n\nKelly: And again, on what is that based, other than hope?\n\nBlinken: Hope is good, but it's insufficient. No, it's based on reality. And the reality is this: A month ago, President Biden put out a detailed proposal for getting to a ceasefire, the release of hostages, and the ability to move forward. And what happened after that was quite extraordinary. The entire world came together in support of that proposal, country after country standing up and endorsing it. The United Nations Security Council, where Linda did a tremendous job, coming together -- something we don't see that often these days -- [voting] 14 to nothing, with Russia abstaining, in support of that agreement. And the result was, after a lot of pushing and diplomacy in the weeks after that, we have an agreement to the framework the president put out by both Israel and Hamas. The question now is finishing the negotiation of some critical details. There remains some issues that need to be resolved, that need to be negotiated. We're in the midst of doing exactly that.\n\nKelly: It's very hard to find a path to optimism given that Israelis are now resisting it -- government, ordinary people -- Gaza is destroyed, settlers are taking more land in the West Bank. Where does that leave room for hope?\n\nBlinken: You know, [late Senator] John McCain used to say that it's always darkest before it goes completely black. If you keep that in mind, it's not bad guidance for the work that we're all trying to do. But look, there's some fundamental realities that we can't escape. The fundamental realities are these: Between Gaza and the West Bank there are somewhere over 5 million Palestinians, there are about 7 million Israeli Jews. Neither is going anywhere. Palestinians are not going anywhere. The Jews are not going anywhere.\n\nThere has to be an accommodation, but an accommodation that does two things: That brings lasting peace and lasting security to Israelis who so desperately want it and need it, and fulfills the right to self-determination of the Palestinians. Now, with any right comes responsibility. Responsibility to build a state that would not be a threat to Israel. That won't be a Hamas-stan, that won't be like Lebanon, with Hezbollah actually dominating the country. So there are important things that would need to happen in order for a state to be realized. But I believe strongly that, yes, that has to be the future.\n\nAnd by the way, the two strongest opponents of a two-state solution, who are they? Iran and Hamas. So, the strongest possible rebuke to both Iran and Hamas would be the realization of two states. At every step along the way in the history of this, you go back to the Oslo Accords, who tried to disrupt the Oslo Accords? Hamas. When the Arabs launched the Arab Peace Initiative, and were moving toward recognition of Israel, who unfortunately effectively disrupted that? Hamas, with one of the most horrific terrorist attacks before October 7 that we've seen in Israel. So if you look at the logic of this, it's compelling. And there's something else. There is a different future. And we've seen its outlines -- in almost embryonic form, but it's there -- a different future for Israel that realizes maybe its number one objective since the founding of the state. And that is its acceptance in the region, having normal relations with all of its neighbors. We see that through the work that we're doing on normalization. We saw that when Iran attacked Israel, and, for the first time, a direct attack from Iran and Israel, the United States, but not just the United States, European countries and countries in the region, came to Israel's defense. So, we can see a future where Israel is integrated in the region, it's more secure, the Palestinians realize their aspirations for a state and the enemies of that future -- Iran and its various proxies -- are isolated.\n\nKelly: Thank you for making the case for hope. On Ukraine, I'll start with the cause for hope: NATO has recently expanded military support. A lot of the ammunition shortages have been addressed. Dozens of F-16 fighter jets are on their way to Ukraine and are expected to be operational this summer.\n\nI want to ask about what it would take for the U.S. to change its policy on how far Ukraine can shoot weapons into Russia. And I'm drawing for that question, I reached out to colleagues in our Kyiv bureau, including Ukrainian colleagues, I was curious what they would want to ask you. They want to know, does Washington want Ukraine to win or not?\n\nBlinken: I think if you look at the last two-and-a-half years, it's hard to conclude that anyone has done more for Ukraine to assure its success than the United States of America. And that will continue for as long as we have anything to say about it.\n\nKelly: That is true. But they would point out, they're being asked to fight with one hand tied behind their back.\n\nBlinken: Every step along the way, we've tried to make sure that we're adapting and adjusting to the realities on the ground, to what's actually happening, to make sure that Ukrainians have what they need when they need it. But often, it's not as simple as it seems. Let me give you an example. At various points during these last two-and-a-half years, one weapon system or another has made its way into the headlines. Maybe it's F-16s, which as you noted are in the process of being delivered, maybe it's an Abrams tank, or some other system. And there seems to be this binary question: \"Oh, we give it to them or we don't.\" But it's not as simple as that. It's not enough to give them a weapon system. They have to be able to use it. They have to be able to maintain it. It has to be part of a cohesive strategy. And so, as we've done these things, and [U.S. Secretary of Defense] Lloyd Austin has done an extraordinary job bringing together more than 50 countries in support of Ukraine's defense, but also working through each of these decisions.\n\nKelly: I want to ask about Americans detained in Russia, including Evan Gershkovich of The Wall Street Journal, who was sentenced this morning to 16 years in prison, and also Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was awarded the Pulitzer Prize this year for his columns for The Washington Post. How do we bring them home?\n\nBlinken: I think you had [U.S. Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs] Roger Carstens here a couple of days ago. Roger, his team, every single day, are working to bring unjustly detained Americans home, wherever they're held. And of course, when it comes to Evan, when it comes to Paul Whelan, in Russia, other Americans, we are working quite literally every day, looking to see what we can do to get them home. We've had a rather extraordinary track record over the last three-and-a-half years of doing just, that bringing some 30 Americans home from different places around the world where they were being unjustly detained. All I can tell you is this: we're working it. We're working it as we speak, and we're not going to stop until we get Evan home. We get Paul Whelan home. Until we get others home.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mary_louise_kelly@npr.org", "name": "Mary Louise Kelly", "type": "author",

reinstatement of the US compliance to the accord, instead saying the prisoners must be freed \"irrespective\" of any agreements.\n\nIn his first interview for the media after being confirmed by the Senate, Blinken also condemned the Russian arrests of demonstrators supporting jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, while also rejecting Moscow's claims that the US was behind the recent protests.\n\nHe also chided China over a lack of transparency and cooperation with the World Health Organization team of experts, currently in the country attempting to find the origins of the coronavirus pandemic that has blighted large swathes of the world for the last 12 months.", "source": {"uri": "ynetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ynetnews"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

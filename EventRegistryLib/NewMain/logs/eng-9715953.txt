However, due to the frequency of these incidents, the sheriff's office reached out to Google to address the problematic routing.\n\n\"We've had to take those steps to try to be able to mitigate the problems, but we haven't had any luck with Google until today,\" Huntington said earlier.\n\nThe most severe case involved an 18-wheel semi-truck with a trailer that got stuck in the mud after its GPS directed the driver onto the remote road. Following this, the sheriff's department and a news outlet contacted Google, which promptly responded.\n\nA Google spokesperson explained the company's approach to updating maps, saying, \"We use multiple sources to update the map - including contributions from the community, information from local authorities, along with Street View and satellite imagery. We've updated this route on our map and it should be reflected in the coming days.\"\n\nALSO READ| Do UFOs 'target' high-speed planes, warheads and nuclear reactors? Experts weigh in\n\nHuntington replied back with relief and satisfaction, saying they were \"super excited\" when Google took action.\n\n\"We're happy that [travelers] won't run into that problem anymore, it won't damage their vehicles or cause problems, and then we're able to keep our resources in the most populous areas of our county,\" he expressed.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com",

But not all Tercels are built alike, as one driver found out the hard way. By that I mean -- they had to be rescued by a UTV after driving down an off-road trail when Google Maps failed them.\n\nRecounted on Facebook by Wasatch County Search & Rescue, the incident occurred during the wee hours of July 4. The Tercel's 23-year-old driver was traveling between Springville, Utah (south of Salt Lake City) and Vernal, in the northeast corner of the state. Their route took them past Strawberry Peak, where their phone (which had Google Maps active) lost cell service. From there, the poor lighting and a wrong turn were all it took to get the little Toyota stranded on the trail.\n\nAt 12:39 am, the county search and rescue team received a call for assistance and responded in a UTV. Pictures taken on-site show a broken trail of the sort you'd want reasonable ground clearance to tackle -- more than the Tercel offered. Maybe if it'd been one of those all-wheel drive Tercel wagons, it might have made it.\n\nIt's not clear what exactly stranded the Toyota, though there doesn't appear to be fluid on the rocks leading up to the car's stopping point. Instead of a punctured radiator or oil pan, it seems likely that the driver got a flat tire and pulled to the side of the trail.\n\nIn any case, it seems the driver was fine, but needed a lift to get off the mountain. That suggests the car couldn't make it under its own power, and was indeed immobilized. While the driver's pride may be a little bruised, having a car stranded on the side of a mountain is probably a bigger problem for them. Either they have to go back up on their own to fix it, or pay for an expensive off-road recovery service. And that'd probably cost more than it would to just replace the Tercel.

Unfortunately, more and more drivers make the same mistake and blindly trust these navigation apps, sometimes even following routes that don't look safe.\n\nThis is what happened recently to a driver in Utah. The 23-year-old man followed a route suggested by Google Maps between Springville and Vernal without double-checking whether the road was dangerous.\n\nWhile it's never a good idea to use an unpaved road in the middle of the night and without proper equipment, the young driver followed Google's suggestion and drove his Toyota on the west side of Strawberry peak. You can already imagine what happened, as it didn't take long before the driver realized that his adventure ended abruptly.\n\nThe vehicle got stuck at midnight, as the unpaved route was rough and unsuitable for cars. Fortunately, the driver still had a cellular signal, so he dialed 911 and called the emergency teams to save him. He wasn't injured, but the local rescue teams claim the man required transport off the mountain. The operation took three hours.\n\nGoogle reportedly said they couldn't identify a route on Google Maps that would lead a driver to the location where the 23-year-old man got stuck, but the company continues the investigation and says it'll update its application to offer safer routing.\n\nThis wouldn't be the first time when Google Maps sends drivers on a dangerous route. Earlier this year, a dozen drivers followed a route suggested by the application on an unpaved desert trail, leaving the interstate to avoid a closure reported ahead. Using the unpaved road proved a bad idea, as they ended up stuck in the desert and forced to return to the interstate after hours of driving in the middle of nowhere.\n\nGoogle acknowledged the problem with Google Maps' routing engine and removed the unpaved road from the map.\n\nHowever, this case is another sign that drivers should always use common sense when running navigation software in their cars. These applications don't know what happens on the road in real time and can't warn of dangerous conditions. In 2020, Google Maps sent two young Russians to a closed road covered in snow without knowing that the route was dangerous and should have been avoided. The driver eventually froze to death after the vehicle broke down and got stuck in the snow.\n\nUsers are recommended to check their routes before driving - Google Maps includes a route preview screen that allows them to explore every turn before they begin navigation. If required, users should also download offline maps to make sure navigation remains available in regions with no cellular reception.", "source": {"uri": "autoevolution.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "autoevolution"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bogdan_popa@autoevolution.com", "name": "Bogdan Popa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Maps", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google Maps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Navigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirt_road", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dirt road"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasatch_County,_Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wasatch County, Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wasatch County, Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernal,_Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vernal, Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vernal, Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springville,_Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Springville, Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Springville, Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Desert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/North America", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Route_66", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Route 66", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Offroad_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Offroad Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/man-takes-google-maps-shortcut-finds-out-the-ugly-truth-about-navigation-apps-236724_1.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715953", "eventUri": "eng-9715953", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

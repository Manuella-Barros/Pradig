{"id": 232064688, "title": "Kia\u2019s 2024 EV9 seats seven", "text": "Most electric vehicles available in the United States are mid-size sedans, five-passenger crossovers, or pickup trucks, and many of them are expensive luxury vehicles. Kia is one of the first automakers to introduce a reasonably affordable seven-passenger EV, and it\u2019s a winner. The 2024 EV9 features three rows of seating, two roof rails, no tailpipes, and up to 304 miles of driving range, making it an excellent choice for large, adventurous families looking to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The highly acclaimed EV9 is an advanced EV with impressive capabilities. Like many modern EVs, it is available as a single-motor rear-wheel-drive that is more efficient or a dual-motor all-wheel drive that provides better performance. The 379 horsepower AWD models are only available with a 99.8kWh battery and can venture up to 280 miles on a single charge. The RWD models can be purchased with a smaller 76.1-kWh battery or the 99.8-kWh battery. The EV9 achieves its maximum driving range of 304 miles when the RWD is configured with the larger battery, while the smaller battery provides 230 miles of range. The two RWD models deliver respectable fuel economy for a mid-size SUV, with the long-range version earning a combined MPGe rating of 89 and the short-range version getting 88. The combined MPGe rating drops to 83 with the addition of all-wheel-drive. The purchase of the AWD GT-Line decreases MPGe even further to 80 and reduces driving range from 280 to 270 miles. All EV9 models benefit from Kia\u2019s 800-volt electrical architecture, which facilitates rapid refueling at the fastest public charging stations. Equipped to handle powerful 350-kilowatt DC fast chargers, the EV9 can recharge its depleted battery from 10% to 80% in just 24 minutes. When charging at home using a capable Level 2 AC charger, it will accept 240-volt current fast enough to fully recharge overnight. To sweeten the pot even further, Kia is offering 1,000 kWh of free charging credit through Electrify America\u2019s network. Many automakers are reducing the costs of their electric vehicles by deploying standard drivetrain platforms that remain consistent across a variety of wheelbase lengths. The versatile strategy saves money by improving economies of scale and reducing design costs. The EV9 rides on the Electric Global Modular Platform developed for the Hyundai Motor Group, which includes Kia, Genesis, and Hyundai. Hyundai\u2019s award-winning Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6, and the luxurious Genesis GV60 ride on the same platform as the EV9. The expandability of the platform allowed Kia to develop its seven-passenger SUV quickly, filling a niche that has largely been overlooked in the EV market. The spacious interior of the EV9 can be utilized in a variety of ways by folding down seats, and it can be customized for six-passengers by replacing the 3-passenger bench seat with two captain\u2019s chairs. The EV9\u2019s starting price of $55,000 represents good value, but Kia is determined to reduce that figure by qualifying the vehicle for the $7,500 federal tax credit. Foreign automakers were caught off guard when the finalized tax credit rules disqualified all EVs assembled outside of North America. The first EV9s to go on sale have been shipped from South Korea, but they will soon be rolling off of Kia\u2019s new assembly line in West Point, Georgia, and are expected to become eligible for the full credit. If you and your family are a good fit for the EV9, it\u2019s never too soon to take a test drive.", "summary": "Most electric vehicles available in the United States are mid-size sedans, five-passenger crossovers, or pickup trucks, and many of them are expensive luxury vehicles.

Less expensive versions of these vehicles were equipped with turn-key ignitions rather than a button-press to start, and they're roughly twice as likely to be stolen as other vehicles of a similar age, according to the HLDI.\n\nMany of these vehicles also lack some basic auto-theft prevention tech, such as electronic immobilizers, included in most other vehicles made the same years, says the HLDI. Immobilizers rely on a computer chip in the car and another in the key that communicate to confirm that the key is authentic and really belongs to that vehicle.\n\nBetween early 2020 and the first half of 2023, thefts of Hyundai and Kia models rose more than 1,000%.\n\nAs part of a $200 million settlement related to this issue, Hyundai and Kia -- closely related car brands based in South Korea -- began offering free anti-theft software upgrades for some of these older models in February 2023. So far, more than 2 million Hyundai and Kia vehicles have gotten the update, according to the automakers.\n\nThefts remain high\n\nThe HLDI looked at insurance claim data for calendar year 2023. By the end of that year, only about 30% of vehicles eligible for the security software had it installed.\n\nBy now, around 61% of eligible Hyundai vehicles have the software upgrade, a Hyundai spokesperson said. That said, not all of the vulnerable Hyundai and Kia models have the proper hardware to enable the software upgrade. For those vehicles that can't get the software, Hyundai and Kia have been providing steering wheel locks.\n\nAnd even with the new software these older Hyundai and Kia vehicles are still stolen and broken into more often than others, the HLDI found.\n\nOne reason may be that owners aren't using the vehicles' new security software correctly, Moore said. For the anti-theft software to work, the vehicle must be locked using a button on the key fob -- not by turning the metal key in the door lock.\n\nHyundai and Kia theft rates will probably decline now that more vehicles are getting the security software, Moore said in an interview with CNN.\n\nPlus, he added, the wave of Hyundai and Kia thefts was partly a fad spread through social media. Tik Tok and YouTube videos showed how easy it was to steal these vehicles, and many of the people doing it were not serious car thieves, he said.\n\n\"There are certainly news stories indicating that some off the people doing this are just doing it for fun,\" said Moore. \"It's probably logical to assume that at some point...stealing these vehicles as a fad is going to burn out.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Hyundai and Kia issued the updates in February 2023 after a surge in thefts due to viral social media content. About 61% of eligible vehicles now have the software installed.Over a year after Hyundai and Kia introduced new anti-theft software updates, thefts of vehicles equipped with this technology have significantly decreased, even as overall vehicle theft rates remain alarmingly high, according to recent insurance claim data. Hyundai and Kia rolled out these updates starting in February 2023, following a dramatic tenfold increase in thefts of specific models over the previous three years.This surge was triggered by viral social media content that demonstrated how to steal these vehicles.\n\nThe Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI) reports that \"whole vehicle\" theft claims -- referring to the theft of the entire car -- are 64% lower for Hyundai and Kia vehicles with the software upgrade compared to those of the same make, model, and year that do not have the update. Matt Moore, senior vice president of HLDI, praised the effectiveness of the companies' solution.\n\nThe targeted vehicles are older Hyundai and Kia models from before 2023, which are particularly susceptible to theft. These less expensive models often feature turn-key ignitions rather than push-button start systems and are about twice as likely to be stolen as other vehicles of similar age. Additionally, many lack basic anti-theft features like electronic immobilisers, which are standard in most other vehicles from those years.\n\nThefts of Hyundai and Kia models skyrocketed by more than 1,000% between early 2020 and mid-2023. In response, Hyundai and Kia, as part of a $200 million settlement, began offering free anti-theft software upgrades for some older models in February 2023. To date, over 2 million vehicles have received this update.\n\nDespite the progress, thefts remain high. By the end of 2023, only about 30% of eligible vehicles had the software installed. Currently, around 61% of eligible Hyundai vehicles have been upgraded, though not all vulnerable models can receive the software due to hardware limitations. For those, the automakers have been providing steering wheel locks.\n\nEven with the new software, these older models are still stolen and broken into more frequently than other vehicles. One issue may be incorrect usage of the software; for it to be effective, vehicles must be locked with the key fob button rather than by turning a metal key in the door lock.\n\nMoore anticipates that theft rates for Hyundai and Kia vehicles will likely decrease as more cars receive the security upgrade. He notes that the initial spike in thefts was partly a social media trend, with many thieves motivated more by novelty than by criminal intent. As the trend fades, the rate of thefts is expected to decline.\n\nAlso Read: |Celebrities who were also race drivers", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motor vehicle theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_key", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smart key"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Moore_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Moore (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novelty_song", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novelty song"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keychain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keychain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steering_wheel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steering wheel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Repair", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Repair", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Gifts_in_Kind", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Gifts in Kind", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112345730,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-7916,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796765", "eventUri": "eng-9796765", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

New study offers insights.", "body": "A driver adopts a lost kitten as her own after finding it trapped under the hood of her car.\n\nKia and Hyundai's anti-theft software upgrades have deterred car thieves, but theft claims remain elevated for the brands even after new software is installed, according to a new report.\n\nAfter car thefts began to ramp up during the COVID-19 pandemic, the two automakers in early 2023 rolled out a free software update to make it harder to start the vehicle when the owner's key is not in the ignition.\n\nThe software has helped, according to a new report from the Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI), an organization that analyzes insurance data. The report says cars with the software upgrade had 53% lower theft claim frequencies than those without. That includes all theft claims, from vehicle part or content theft to whole vehicle theft.\n\nThe frequency of whole vehicle theft saw an even more dramatic drop after the upgrade at 64%.\n\nWhile the software isn't able to prevent all theft, HLDI senior vice president Matt Moore said the numbers are significant enough to make it clear that eligible drivers should take the time to get the software upgrade.\n\n\"A very optimistic person would look at this problem and this software update and say, well, we'd love to see 100% reduction (in theft claim frequencies),\" Moore told USA TODAY. \"I don't know that that's realistic. A 64% reduction is a big number.\"\n\nWhy are Hyundai and Kia cars being stolen?\n\nKia and Hyundai thefts began to spike in 2021, after instructional videos detailing how to steal vehicles without electronic immobilizers took off on social media.\n\nCompared to other car manufacturers, Kia and Hyundai vehicles were late to the game in making electronic immobilizers standard on new vehicles. The device - which prevents a car engine from starting unless the correct key is present - was standard on only 17% of 2011 Hyundai and Kia models compared to 92% of other models that year. By model year 2022, Hyundai and Kia were standard on 84% of models compared to 96% of the competition, according to HLDI.\n\nThat vulnerability led to a spike in thefts, even in the wake of the anti-theft software rollout. By the second half of 2023, theft claims for 2003-2023 Hyundai and Kia models were 11 times that of claims in the first half of 2020, according to the HLDI report.\n\nTheft is still an issue, in part, because not every Kia or Hyundai model has installed the software upgrade. Some vehicles are not eligible for the software, and as of mid-July, roughly 40% of eligible models have yet to install the upgrade, according to HLDI's report.\n\nBut theft claim frequency for Hyundai and Kia vehicles remains elevated \"even for models with the new software,\" according to the report\n\nNo 'perfect' fix?\n\nJonathon Miller, 32 of Las Vegas, was one of the unlucky Hyundai owners who had his car stolen after installing the software upgrade.\n\nMiller said he had been using a steering wheel lock to protect his 2015 Hyundai Elantra from thieves but \"got a little comfortable\" after the 2023 software upgrade and stopped using the lock. Still, he said he made sure to lock his car every night with his key fob.\n\nIn early June, Miller woke up to discover his car had been stolen. He said the thieves took the car for a joy ride and inflicted about $7,000 worth of damage, totaling his car. He now drives a Nissan.\n\nMiller isn't the only driver who has experienced theft issues after the software update, according to Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a nonprofit advocacy group.\n\n\"It doesn't appear to be a perfect software fix,\" Brooks told Arizona's Family, a Phoenix television station, in May, telling the station that it's unclear why certain cars were still susceptible to theft.\n\n\"It could be thieves are finding other ways to steal these cars,\" he told the station. \"It could also be that sometimes consumers have aftermarket software or their own security system that might be interfering with the Hyundai and Kia software, but that's something that Kia and Hyundai really need to take a look at.\"\n\nHLDI's report said theft claims may still be elevated for car models with the new software because the software-based immobilizer activates only if the key fob is used to lock the vehicle; if the driver uses the switch on the door handle, the anti-theft software is ineffective.\n\nThere's also the threat of lesser crimes. Thieves may still steal other items from inside the vehicle when they can't get the vehicle started. HLDI found a 61% increase in vandalism claim frequency in vehicles that had the software update compared to those that hadn't been upgraded - nearly equivalent to the decrease in whole theft claims.\n\n\"Based on these trends, we expect claim rates for Hyundai and Kia vehicles to gradually drop back in line with those of other brands, as thieves learn they're no longer so easy to steal and the fad gets stale,\" Moore said in the report.\n\nCar recalls: Hyundai, Nissan, Tesla among 1.9M vehicles recalled last week\n\nA statement from Kia said the automaker \"continues to take comprehensive action to enhance the security of our vehicles in an effort to better protect our customers,\" and encourages eligible drivers to upgrade their software.\n\nAn email statement from Hyundai said the company is \"committed to the comprehensive actions we are undertaking to assist customers and communities affected by the persistent thefts of certain Model Year 2011-2022 vehicles

Hyundai and Kia also gave out window stickers aimed at deterring potential thieves.\n\nRoughly two dozen 2011-2022 Hyundai and Kia models are eligible for the upgrade. Of those that received it as of December 2023 -- 30% of eligible Hyundais and 28% of eligible Kias -- theft claim frequencies were 53% lower than vehicles that didn't receive the upgrade, according to the HLDI, which is the research arm of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). That includes claims for vehicles that were stolen and recovered, as well as claims for parts or items stolen from vehicles.\n\nThe rates of claims in which stolen vehicles were not recovered fell by an even larger amount. The frequency of whole vehicle theft -- which the HLDI defines as claims in which owners are payed the same amount as insurers pay if the same model is totaled in a crash -- fell by 64% with the software upgrade.\n\nHyundai and Kia have continued to upgrade vehicles to make them more theft-resistant. While the study period ended in December 2023, the automakers reported that they had upgraded 60% of eligible vehicles by July 2024. The need to offer this upgrade stems from the fact that many Hyundai and Kia models were built without engine immobilizers. Just 17% of 2011 models had them, compared to 92% of 2011 models from other brands, according to the HLDI. And some models were ineligible for the upgrade because they lack alarm systems.\n\nTheft claim frequency also remains high, even for models that have received the upgrade, according to HLDI, which theorizes that owners may be forgetting to lock cars with the key fob rather than a switch on the door handle. Claims for theft of items in cars and vandalism were elevated as well, the latter possible the result of failed theft attempts.\n\nThe Hyundai Elantra, Hyundai Sonata, and Kia Optima sedans were the three most stolen vehicles in the U.S. in 2023, according to an annual report released earlier this year by the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB). But HLDI analysts believe the Hyundai/Kia theft trend has peaked.\n\n\"We expect claim rates for Hyundai and Kia vehicles to gradually drop back in line with those of other brands, as thieves learn they're no longer so easy to steal and the fad gets stale,\" Matt Moore, senior vice president of the HLDI, said in a statement.", "source": {"uri": "thecarconnection.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Car Connection"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Frequency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignition_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ignition system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_Institute_for_Highway_Safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurance Institute for Highway Safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motor vehicle theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_K5", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kia K5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_alarm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Security alarm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immobiliser", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immobiliser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Sonata", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Sonata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Elantra", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Elantra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Insurance_Crime_Bureau", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Insurance Crime Bureau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sedan (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vandalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Repair", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Repair", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://images.hgmsites.net/lrg/2020-hyundai-elantra_100729666_l.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796765", "eventUri": "eng-9796765", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

payment, but the application deadline is approaching.\n\nBoth manufacturers agreed to pay out a $145 million settlement to customers.\n\nHyundai and Kia both said they agreed to the settlement but didn't admit wrongdoing.\n\nPlaintiffs in dozens of states across the US filed complaints against the companies, saying their vehicles didn't come with proper theft-deterrent equipment.\n\nKia and Hyundai vehicles used traditional turn-key ignitions as other manufacturers rolled out engine immobilizers.\n\nAn engine immobilizer is an anti-theft device that prevents a vehicle's engine from starting unless the correct key or fob is present.\n\nThe cars were featured in a months-long TikTok trend called the Kia Boys.\n\nIn the videos, TikTokers, usually teen boys, illegally entered the vehicles and hotwired the cars with objects like screwdrivers.\n\nThe trend, which began in late 2020, coincided with a national spike in auto theft rates.\n\nKia and Hyundai said they agreed to the settlement to avoid \"lengthy litigation and provide relief to people who owned or leased\" vehicles.\n\nSuccessful claimants are eligible for a one-time payment of up to $3,375 as a partial reimbursement if their vehicle was a total loss.\n\nDrivers with totaled vehicles may also be able to grab a $375 insurance-related payment and a $250 reimbursement for other expenses.\n\nMost owners are eligible for a $50 payment that will cover the \"purchase of a steering wheel lock or equivalent device.\"\n\nDrivers must prove they purchased or leased a Kia or Hyundai between 2011 and 2022.\n\nThe deadline to submit an application for the payments is January 11, 2025.\n\nBoth brands have offered free tune-ups to drivers across the US to install anti-theft technology.\n\nIn May, the companies started operating pop-up shops to implement the tech.\n\n\"It makes me feel great that they are trying to do to prevent this from happening to someone else and it's not going to cost anything out of pocket,\" one Kia owner, Maria Mata, said while getting free tech installed in her car at a pop-up, according to California-based Fox affiliate KMPH.\n\nBoth Kia and Hyundai previously told The U.S. Sun they're working to help drivers find more solutions.\n\n\"While no car can be made completely theft-proof, Kia continues to make steering wheel locks available to customers through interested local law enforcement agencies, subject to available supply, at no cost to concerned owners of these vehicles,\" Kia said in a statement.\n\nHyundai added it \"made engine immobilizers

This week, a minke whale off Chatham and a seal off Plymouth were spotted with white shark bites, according to scientists at the New England Aquarium. John Chisholm, an adjunct scientist at the aquarium\u2019s Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life, captured a photo of the injured seal with \u201cfresh bite marks.\u201d \u201cAlthough we haven\u2019t seen a white shark just yet this season, we know they\u2019re here. With beach weather in the forecast and Memorial Day Weekend approaching, this is a good reminder for people to review shark safety guidelines and be shark smart,\u201d said Chisholm. Although there hasn\u2019t been an official white shark sighting yet this year, May is a typical time for white sharks to become active around Massachusetts as they hunt seals and other prey through the summer. Scientists urged the public to be aware of their surroundings even in shallow water. Chisholm encourages swimmers to avoid areas where there are seals or visible schools of fish. He also recommends staying close to shore so emergency responders can easily access anyone who needs help. Those who spot white sharks can report sightings through the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy\u2019s Sharktivity app. Sharktivity users can see where sharks have been reported and can get push notifications when there are sightings. Chisholm verifies the sightings as part of a partnership between the aquarium and the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy. \u201cOne of the Aquarium\u2019s core values is to balance ocean use with preservation, and a big part of that is finding ways to minimize conflict between humans and wildlife,\u201d said Nick Whitney, senior scientist and chair of the Anderson Cabot Center\u2019s Fisheries Science and Emerging Technologies program. \u201cThis partnership with the Conservancy has been a great way for us to lend our expertise to their efforts to increase public awareness and safety around sharks, and we look forward to another year of assisting in those efforts.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Scientists are urging beachgoers to be on alert during Memorial Day weekend.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2024/05/26/signs-of-white-shark-activity-off-mass-beaches-after-multiple-marine-mammals-suffer-bites/\">Signs of white shark activity off Mass. beaches after multiple marine mammals suffer bites</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.boston.com\">Boston.com</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2024/05/26/signs-of-white-shark-activity-off-mass-beaches-after-multiple-marine-mammals-suffer-bites/", "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/HIBTM7NRM5BYBJTTSGX7IYOZEU-664ffae54b34a-740x432.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:07:09", "author": "Rosemary Ford", "authors": ["Rosemary Ford"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.022}

He made his England debut in 1993 at age 24, scoring an impressive 114 runs against Australia at Trent Bridge.\n\nThorpe became a key player in England's middle order, with his unbeaten double-century against New Zealand in Christchurch in 2002 standing out as a career highlight. This innings included 28 fours and four sixes.\n\nThough his international career was marked by intermittent appearances, he retired from England duty in 2005. Thorpe then transitioned into coaching, initially in Australia, where he mentored players like Steve Smith and David Warner at New South Wales. He later joined the England and Wales Cricket Board as a batting coach.\n\nIn March 2022, Thorpe was appointed head coach of Afghanistan's cricket team, but he could not assume the role due to ill

He made outstanding contributions to the Club as a cricketer, and as a man, and he will be so sorely missed.\"\n\nSurrey's CEO Steve Elworthy expressed his grief, saying: \"Everyone associated with the Club is devastated by the tragic news of Graham's passing. He achieved remarkable feats for club and country and was a hero to so many cricket fans.\"\n\nElworthy continued, offering condolences: \"Our thoughts and condolences are with Graham's family and friends, to whom we will offer any support that we are able to. We ask that everyone respects the privacy of the family at this incredibly difficult time.\"\n\nAfter retiring from playing, Thorpe took up coaching, joining England's white ball team as batting coach in 2013 and later becoming assistant to boss Chris Silverwood in 2019.\n\nThorpe also had a stint as interim head coach for England's T20 series against Pakistan, securing a 2-1 victory, and stepped in during the fourth Test of the 2021/2022 Ashes series, managing to secure a draw in what was otherwise a challenging series for England.\n\nHe departed from his position at the conclusion of that series, and in March 2022, he was appointed as Afghanistans head coach. However, Thorpe tragically fell ill before he could begin the job.\n\nDuring a heartfelt tribute, England test captain Ben Stokes donned Thorpe's name and number in a match against New Zealand following his diagnosis.\n\nHis condition remains private as the Professional Cricketers' Association refrained from disclosing specifics, only stating in May 2022: \"Graham Thorpe has recently fallen seriously ill and is currently in hospital receiving treatment.\"\n\nThey added: \"His prognosis is unclear at this stage and we ask for privacy for him and his family at this time. Our thoughts are with Graham and his family.\"", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_wollaston@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "Steve Wollaston", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Thorpe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graham Thorpe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey_County_Cricket_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey County Cricket Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Order of the British Empire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Elworthy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Elworthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_overs_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Limited overs cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oval", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Oval"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_cricket_team_in_Pakistan_in_2022\u201323", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "English cricket team in Pakistan in 2022\u201323"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_cricket_team_in_New_Zealand_in_2020\u201321", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistani cricket team in New Zealand in 2020\u201321"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Cricketers'_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional Cricketers' Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Silverwood", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Silverwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stokes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Stokes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ashes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Ashes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/article29677248.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_england-ashes-squad-training-session.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790854", "eventUri": "eng-9790854", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has confirmed the tragic news on Monday, August 5. Thorpe was known for his exceptional skills as a left-handed batter.\n\nWith a career spanning 13 years, Thorpe played 100 Test matches for England, scoring 6744 runs with the help of 16 centuries before retiring from the game in 2005. One of England's iconic figures, Thorpe, also featured in 83 ODIs, amassing 2380 runs, and had the honor of captaining the England cricket team on three occasions.\n\nIn addition to his playing career, Thorpe made significant contributions as a coach, serving in various roles for the England cricket team from 2010 to 2022. His death comes two years after he was reported to have fallen seriously ill and underwent treatment in a hospital in the UK.\n\nIn 2022, the Players Cricket Association (PCA) released a statement on behalf of Thorpe's family and said that the former left-handed batter had \"fallen seriously ill\" at the time and was in the hospital to receive treatment. The PCA also revealed that \"Thorpe's prognosis is unclear at this stage.\".\n\nMeanwhile, the ECB expressed deep sorrow on the demise of Thorpe while hailing his legacy as one of the finest players of his generation and his impactful coaching career with the England team.\n\nThe ECB said in an official statement: \"There seem to be no appropriate words to describe the deep shock we feel at Graham's death. More than one of England's finest-ever batters, he was a beloved member of the cricket family and revered by fans all over the world.

We will always remember Graham for his extraordinary contributions to the sport.\"\n\nThorpe was also a standout performer at the county level, amassing 21,937 runs for Surrey in First-Class cricket. He made 49 centuries at an impressive average of 45.04. He has also 10871 runs in List-A cricket in 354 matches to his name. Meanwhile, the Chair of Surrey Cricket Club, Oli Slipper, also paid tribute to Thorpe by hailing him as one of the great sons of Surrey.\n\nOli Slipper said in a statement: \"Graham is one of the great sons of Surrey, and there is an overwhelming sadness that he will not walk through the gates of the Oval again.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nFormer England cricketer Graham Thorpe has died aged 55.\n\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced the batter's death after he battled with a serious illness for two years.\n\nIn a statement, the ECB said: \"It is with great sadness that we share the news that Graham Thorpe, MBE, has passed away. There seem to be no appropriate words to describe the deep shock we feel at Graham's death.\n\n\"More than one of England's finest-ever batters, he was a beloved member of the cricket family and revered by fans all over the world. His skill was unquestioned, and his abilities and achievements across a 13-year international career brought so much happiness to his teammates and England and Surrey CCC supporters alike.\n\n\"Later, as a coach, he guided the best England Men's talent to some incredible victories across all formats of the game. The cricket world is in mourning today. Our hearts go out to his wife Amanda, his children, father Geoff, and all of his family and friends during this unimaginably difficult time. We will always remember Graham for his extraordinary contributions to the sport.\"\n\nThe Mirror reports that he spent 17 years playing for Surrey - earning a regular place in the England Test and ODI teams. He earned 100 Test caps for his country, as well as playing in the 1996 and 1999 World Cups.\n\nThorpe struck Over 6,700 Test runs at an average of almost 45, including 16 centuries. His former county is also mourning their loss, with Surrey chairman Oli Slipper hailing his legacy.\n\nSlipper said: \"Graham is one of the great sons of Surrey and there is an overwhelming sadness that he will not walk through the gates of the Oval again. He is a legend of Surrey and brought great pride to the Club wearing both the Three Feathers and the Three Lions. He made outstanding contributions to the Club as a cricketer, and as a man, and he will be so sorely missed.\"\n\nSteve Elworthy, Surrey's CEO, added: \"Everyone associated with the Club is devastated by the tragic news of Graham's passing. He achieved remarkable feats for club and country and was a hero to so many cricket fans. Our thoughts and condolences are with Graham's family and friends, to whom we will offer any support that we are able to. We ask that everyone respects the privacy of the family at this incredibly difficult time.\"\n\nThorpe went on to become a coach. He joined the England white ball coaching staff as batting coach in 2013, before being promoted to becoming boss Chris Silverwood's assistant in 2019.\n\nHe was named interim head coach for England's T20 series against Pakistan and led his country to a 2-1 win. He also stood in for the fourth Test of the 2021/2022 Ashes series, claiming a draw, the only game England did not lose.\n\nHe left his role at the end of that series, before being named head coach of Afghanistan in March 2022. Sadly, he would never take up that role after falling seriously ill. England test captain Ben Stokes wore Thorpe's name and number ahead of a match against New Zealand as a tribute following that diagnosis.\n\nThe exact nature of his illness is unknown, with the Professional Cricketers' Association saying at the time of his diagnosis: In a May 2022 statement, the PCA said: \"Graham Thorpe has recently fallen seriously ill and is currently in hospital receiving treatment.\n\n\"His prognosis is unclear at this stage and we ask for privacy for him and his family at this time. Our thoughts are with Graham and his family.\"\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter here.", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk",

He separated from first wife Nicola in 2002.\n\nVaughan, who captained Thorpe towards the end of his Test career, wrote on X: 'RIP Thorpey. Thanks for all the advice throughout my career, you were a great player and a brilliant team-mate. You have gone far too young but you leave as an England cricket legend... Thoughts with all who knew Thorpey and to all the family xxx.'\n\nAnd Stokes tweeted five love heart emojis next to a picture of Thorpe with 564 on his shirt, denoting his Test cap number.\n\nCurrent England opener Ben Duckett wrote on X: 'Heartbreaking to see Thorpey has passed away. He was one of my heroes growing up and I was fortunate to work with him. My thoughts go out to all of his friends and family during this tough time.'\n\nA statement from the England and Wales Cricket Board read: 'It is with great sadness that we share the news that Graham Thorpe, MBE, has passed away.\n\n'There seem to be no appropriate words to describe the deep shock we feel at Graham's death.\n\n'More than one of England's finest-ever batters, he was a beloved member of the cricket family and revered by fans all over the world.\n\n'His skill was unquestioned, and his abilities and achievements across a 13-year international career brought so much happiness to his teammates and England and Surrey CCC supporters alike.\n\n'Later, as a coach, he guided the best England Men's talent to some incredible victories across all formats of the game.\n\n'The cricket world is in mourning today. Our hearts go out to his wife Amanda, his children, father Geoff, and all of his family and friends during this unimaginably difficult time. We will always remember Graham for his extraordinary contributions to the sport.'\n\nThorpe stayed in the game after his retirement from playing, moving to New South Wales where he worked with a young Steve Smith and David Warner.\n\nHe returned to work with England between 2010 and 2022.\n\nThorpe took charge of his country in the familiar surroundings of the Sydney Cricket Ground after Chris Silverwood was laid low by coronavirus, securing a nailbiting draw to avoid a seemingly inevitable Ashes whitewash.\n\nSteve Elworthy, Surrey chief executive, said: 'Everyone associated with the club is devastated by the tragic news of Graham's passing. He achieved remarkable feats for club and country and was a hero to so many cricket fans.\n\n'Our thoughts and condolences are with Graham's family and friends, to whom we will offer any support that we are able to. We ask that everyone respects the privacy of the family at this incredibly difficult time.'\n\nThorpe's former county Surrey also described him as one of their 'great sons'.\n\nChair Oli Slipper said: 'He is a legend of Surrey and brought great pride to the Club wearing both the Three Feathers and the Three Lions.\n\n'He made outstanding contributions to the Club as a cricketer, and as a man, and he will be so sorely missed.'\n\nDuring his playing career, Thorpe averaged an impressive 44.7 runs in Test matches.\n\nHis highest score was 200 not out and the talented middle-order batsmen also played 77 One Day Internationals.\n\nOne of his most memorable Test innings came in 2000 against Pakistan in Karachi. After a final day implosion from the hosts, Thorpe produced an unbeaten 64 in near darkness towards the end of his innings to lead England to their first series win in Pakistan for 39 years, and Pakistan's first loss at the National Stadium in 35 years.\n\n'I think literally five to ten minutes after we came off, it was pitch black,' Thorpe told Cricket Monthly. 'From the dressing room, coming back on to the balcony, it was pitch black.\n\n'We opened up bottles of lemonade, because we couldn't drink in Pakistan. We were on a flight back to Dubai that evening, where we did have a few Guinnesses. There was about a two-hour turnaround from the end of the game, back to the hotel and on to a flight that night.'\n\nThorpe racked up more than 2,000 runs in the shorter format of the game and his intelligence and leadership allowed a smooth transition into coaching when he retired from playing in 2006.\n\nHe went on to begin a coaching career in Australia, where he worked with the likes of Steve Smith and David Warner at New South Wales, before joining the England and Wales Cricket Board as a batting coach.\n\nHe worked as assistant with the senior side under Trevor Bayliss and Chris Silverwood, stepping up to lead the team in this winter's Sydney Test against Australia due to Silverwood's coronavirus diagnosis.\n\nHis position as England assistant coach looked untenable after the conclusion of the Ashes , when police were called to the team hotel in Hobart while he was smoking a cigar during a rooftop drinking session inside the premises that lasted until 6am.\n\nIt was an unfortunate ending to Thorpe's role in the England coaching set-up and he is still held in enormously high regard among players and fans.\n\nIn May, the Professional Cricketers' Association revealed Thorpe had fallen seriously ill with an unclear diagnosis. His cause of death has not yet been revealed.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He spent his county cricket career with Surrey, representing his home county for more than a decade and a half, and also worked as a coach and broadcaster.\n\nBack in 2022, when Thorpe was hospitalised, the Professional Cricketers' Association issued a statement on his health at the request of the player's family.\n\n\"Graham Thorpe has recently fallen seriously ill and is currently in hospital receiving treatment,\" it read.\n\n\"His prognosis is unclear at this stage and we ask for privacy for him and his family at this time. Our thoughts are with Graham and his family.\"\n\nTributes have flooded in for the popular batsman, who had been due to take over as Afghanistan coach in 2022 before falling ill. Plenty of those from Surrey CCC have honoured Thorpe, as have former team-mates, the Mirror reports.\n\n\"Graham is one of the great sons of Surrey and there is an overwhelming sadness that he will not walk through the gates of the Oval again,\" Surrey CCC chair Oli Slipper said. \"He is a legend of Surrey and brought great pride to the Club wearing both the Three Feathers and the Three Lions.\"\n\n\"He made outstanding contributions to the Club as a cricketer, and as a man, and he will be so sorely missed.\"\n\n\"It is with great sadness that the ECB shares the news that Graham Thorpe, MBE, has passed away,\" an ECB statement read following Thorpe's passing. \"There seem to be no appropriate words to describe the deep shock we feel at Graham's death.\n\n\"More than one of England's finest-ever batters, he was a beloved member of the cricket family and revered by fans all over the world. His skill was unquestioned, and his abilities and achievements across a 13-year international career brought so much happiness to his teammates and England and Surrey CCC supporters alike. Later, as a coach, he guided the best England Men's talent to some incredible victories across all formats of the game.\"\n\n\"The cricket world is in mourning today. Our hearts go out to his wife Amanda, his children, father Geoff, and all of his family and friends during this unimaginably difficult time. We will always remember Graham for his extraordinary contributions to the sport.\"\n\nEngland captain Ben Stokes and former skipper Michael Vaughan were among the players to post tributes. \"RIP Thorpey .. Thanks for all the advice throughout my career,\" Vaughan wrote.\n\n\"You were a great player and a brilliant team-mate. You have gone far too young but you leave as an England cricket legend ... Thoughts with all who knew Thorpey and to all the family.\"\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond.

Thorpe made his international debut in 1993 and scored a century on his first Ashes appearance, becoming the first England player to do so in 20 years.\n\nHe was an England regular and went on to play 100 Tests, scoring 16 centuries and featuring 82 times for the ODI side, as well as enjoying a 17-year career with Surrey. His final Test appearance came in June 2005 before he was omitted from that summer's victorious Ashes series and called time on his international career.\n\nThorpe is survived by his second wife Amanda, whom he married in 2007, and four children, Henry, Amelia, Kitty and Emma. He separated from first wife Nicola in 2002. He came from a family of cricketers, with his father Geoff being the former chairman of Farnham Cricket Club and brother Ian captaining the 2nd XI for many years, with mother Toni the long-serving scorer. His other brother Alan also played for Farnham. Vaughan, who captained Thorpe towards the end of his Test career, wrote on X: 'RIP Thorpey. Thanks for all the advice throughout my career, you were a great player and a brilliant team-mate. You have gone far too young but you leave as an England cricket legend... Thoughts with all who knew Thorpey and to all the family xxx.'\n\nAnd Stokes tweeted five love heart emojis next to a picture of Thorpe with 564 on his shirt, denoting his Test cap number. Current England opener Ben Duckett wrote on X: 'Heartbreaking to see Thorpey has passed away. He was one of my heroes growing up and I was fortunate to work with him. My thoughts go out to all of his friends and family during this tough time.' A statement from the England and Wales Cricket Board read: 'It is with great sadness that we share the news that Graham Thorpe, MBE, has passed away.\n\n'There seem to be no appropriate words to describe the deep shock we feel at Graham's death. 'More than one of England's finest-ever batters, he was a beloved member of the cricket family and revered by fans all over the world. 'His skill was unquestioned, and his abilities and achievements across a 13-year international career brought so much happiness to his teammates and England and Surrey CCC supporters alike. 'Later, as a coach, he guided the best England Men's talent to some incredible victories across all formats of the game. 'The cricket world is in mourning today. Our hearts go out to his wife Amanda, his children, father Geoff, and all of his family and friends during this unimaginably difficult time. We will always remember Graham for his extraordinary contributions to the sport.'\n\nThorpe stayed in the game after his retirement from playing, moving to New South Wales where he worked with a young Steve Smith and David Warner. He returned to work with England between 2010 and 2022. Thorpe took charge of his country in the familiar surroundings of the Sydney Cricket Ground after Chris Silverwood was laid low by coronavirus, securing a nailbiting draw to avoid a seemingly inevitable Ashes whitewash.\n\nSteve Elworthy, Surrey chief executive, said: 'Everyone associated with the club is devastated by the tragic news of Graham's passing. He achieved remarkable feats for club and country and was a hero to so many cricket fans. 'Our thoughts and condolences are with Graham's family and friends, to whom we will offer any support that we are able to. We ask that everyone respects the privacy of the family at this incredibly difficult time.' Thorpe's former county Surrey also described him as one of their 'great sons'. Chair Oli Slipper said: 'He is a legend of Surrey and brought great pride to the Club wearing both the Three Feathers and the Three Lions. 'He made outstanding contributions to the Club as a cricketer, and as a man, and he will be so sorely missed.'\n\nDuring his playing career, Thorpe averaged an impressive 44.7 runs in Test matches. His highest score was 200 not out and the talented middle-order batsmen also played 77 One Day Internationals. One of his most memorable Test innings came in 2000 against Pakistan in Karachi. After a final day implosion from the hosts, Thorpe produced an unbeaten 64 in near darkness towards the end of his innings to lead England to their first series win in Pakistan for 39 years, and Pakistan's first loss at the National Stadium in 35 years. 'I think literally five to ten minutes after we came off, it was pitch black,' Thorpe told Cricket Monthly. 'From the dressing room, coming back on to the balcony, it was pitch black. 'We opened up bottles of lemonade, because we couldn't drink in Pakistan. We were on a flight back to Dubai that evening, where we did have a few Guinnesses. There was about a two-hour turnaround from the end of the game, back to the hotel and on to a flight that night.'\n\nThorpe racked up more than 2,000 runs in the shorter format of the game and his intelligence and leadership allowed a smooth transition into coaching when he retired from playing in 2006. He went on to begin a coaching career in Australia, where he worked with the likes of Steve Smith and David Warner at New South Wales, before joining the England and Wales Cricket Board as a batting coach. He worked as assistant with the senior side under Trevor Bayliss and Chris Silverwood, stepping up to lead the team in this winter's Sydney Test against Australia due to Silverwood's coronavirus diagnosis.\n\nHis position as England assistant coach looked untenable after the conclusion of the Ashes , when police were called to the team hotel in Hobart while he was smoking a cigar during a rooftop drinking session inside the premises that lasted until 6am. It was an unfortunate ending to Thorpe's role in the England coaching set-up and he is still held in enormously high regard among players and fans. In May, the Professional Cricketers' Association revealed Thorpe had fallen seriously ill with an unclear diagnosis. His cause of death has not yet been revealed.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

He began his coaching career with the New South Wales side in Australia, where he worked with the likes of David Warner and Steve Smith, before returning to Surrey as their batting coach for two years.\n\nHe then joined the ECB in a national lead batting coach role, working with the England Lions and younger development squads.

After England lost the Ashes 4-0, Thrope was sacked from his role and was announced as the new head coach of Afghanistan in March 2022, but fell seriously ill and couldn't take up the role.\n\n\"Everyone associated with the Club is devastated by the tragic news of Graham's passing. He achieved remarkable feats for club and country and was a hero to so many cricket fans. Our thoughts and condolences are with Graham's family and friends, to whom we will offer any support that we are able to.

Our hearts go out to his wife Amanda, his children, father Geoff, and all of his family and friends during this unimaginably difficult time. We will always remember Graham for his extraordinary contributions to the sport.\"\n\nThorpe was a fluent left-handed batter - and right-handed bowler - who played precisely 100 Tests as well as 82 one-day internationals during a 12-year international career. He played a further 189 first-class matches for Surrey and in all scored 49 first-class centuries, averaging 45.04, before his retirement in 2005.\n\nAs a child Thorpe had been good enough at football to be selected for England Schoolboys and to be offered a trial with Brentford, but chose instead to sign for Surrey, where he was to spend his entire professional career. Initially an all-rounder - on his first-class debut against Leicestershire in 1988 he batted at No 8 and took the wickets of David Gower and Peter Willey - a back injury eventually forced him to stop his seamers and would affect him throughout his time as a player; by the end of his career he would need painkilling injections just to bat.\n\nHe was also affected by issues in his private life. In 2002 he took an indefinite break from cricket as he coped with the drawn-out collapse of his first marriage. The experience of public humiliation in the media and separation from his two children led to what he called a \"total breakdown\", but he returned to the Test team after a 13-month absence in 2003 with a brilliant century against South Africa at the Oval, and the following year was the most successful of his career - in 20 Test innings in 2004, all at No 5, he averaged 73.15.\n\n\"I don't know where my journey is going to take me over the next few years but I'm going to enjoy working it out,\" he said in 2005, after he announced his retirement during the first Test of an Ashes series in which he had hoped to play.\n\n\"Of all the players I played with, [Thorpe] was the one whose state of mind most affected his play,\" Mike Atherton once wrote. \"A happy, contented Graham Thorpe is a world-class player, his presence beneficial to any team. If something off the field is eating away at him, he cannot put it to the back of his mind and concentrate on his cricket.\"\n\nHis relationship with Amanda, who would become his second wife, gave him the stability to do that, and at the end of his playing career he moved into coaching, starting in Australia, where he worked with rising players such as Steve Smith and David Warner at New South Wales, before joining England, initially as a batting coach in 2010. He had most recently been assistant coach on last winter's difficult Ashes tour, which ended in a 4-0 defeat after which Thorpe, along with the head coach, Chris Silverwood, and the director of cricket, Ashley Giles, lost their jobs as the England and Wales Cricket Board set their sights on a \"red-ball reset\".", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Renowned for his exceptional skill as a Test batter, Thorpe's passing has evoked deep sadness and tributes from across the cricketing community.\n\n\"It is with great sadness that we share the news that Graham Thorpe, MBE, has passed away,\" the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) stated in an official release. \"There seem to be no appropriate words to describe the deep shock we feel at Graham's death. More than one of England's finest ever batters, he was a beloved member of the cricket family and revered by fans all over the world.\"\n\nThe ECB praised Thorpe's contributions to cricket, noting, \"His skill was unquestioned and his abilities and achievements across a 13-year international career brought so much happiness to his team-mates and England and Surrey CCC supporters alike. Later, as a coach, he guided the best England Men's talent to some incredible victories across all formats of the game.\"\n\nThorpe, a fluent left-handed batter and right-handed bowler, appeared in precisely 100 Test matches and 82 One-Day Internationals throughout his 12-year international career. He also played 189 first-class matches for Surrey, amassing 49 centuries and maintaining an impressive average of 45.04 before retiring in 2005.\n\nA talented footballer in his youth, Thorpe had the opportunity to represent England Schoolboys and trial with Brentford but chose a career in cricket. He made his first-class debut for Surrey in 1988, where he initially showcased his all-rounder abilities. However, recurring back injuries eventually forced him to cease his seam bowling, and he endured significant physical pain throughout his career, requiring painkilling injections to bat.\n\nThorpe faced personal struggles as well. In 2002, he took an indefinite break from cricket to deal with the collapse of his first marriage, which he described as a \"total breakdown\" amid public scrutiny and separation from his children. Despite these challenges, he made a triumphant return to the Test team in 2003 with a century against South Africa at The Oval. His remarkable form continued into 2004, where he averaged 73.15 in 20 Test innings.\n\nReflecting on his career in 2005, Thorpe said, \"I don't know where my journey is going to take me over the next few years but I'm going to enjoy working it out,\" as he announced his retirement during an Ashes series he had hoped to play in.\n\nMike Atherton, a former teammate, noted, \"Of all the players I played with, [Thorpe] was the one whose state of mind most affected his play. A happy, contented Graham Thorpe is a world-class player, his presence beneficial to any team. If something off the field is eating away at him, he cannot put it to the back of his mind and concentrate on his cricket.\"\n\nThorpe's second marriage to Amanda brought him stability and support. Following his retirement from playing, he transitioned into coaching, initially working with young talent in Australia, including Steve Smith and David Warner, at New South Wales. He later joined the England coaching setup in 2010, serving as a batting coach and, more recently, as an assistant coach during last winter's challenging Ashes tour.

Graham will always be remembered for his extraordinary contribution to the game.\"\n\nDebut century in the Ashes\n\nThorpe, who played for England between 1993 and 2005, scored a century on his debut against Australia at Trent Bridge and quickly became a key player in England's Test and limited overs teams in the mid-1990s and early 2000s.\n\nHis last Test match was against Bangladesh in June 2005. After missing out on the successful Ashes series that summer, he retired from international play.\n\nWith over 6,700 Test runs, he is England's 10th-highest scorer of all time.\n\n'Legend and hero'\n\nMichael Vaughan, who captained Thorpe towards the end of his Test career, wrote on X that he was \"a great player and a brilliant team-mate\" but that he had \"gone far too young\".\n\nEngland's current season opener Ben Duckett also wrote on X: \"Heartbreaking to see Thorpey has passed away. He was one of my heroes growing up and I was lucky enough to work with him.\"\n\nFormer England batsman David Gower said Thorpe was successful against all types of bowling, including runs against West Indies' pace attack and Australian spin great Shane Warne, and \"showed how good he was in all conditions. He scored runs at home, he scored runs away.\"\n\nGower noted that Thorpe occasionally doubted himself, such as when he left the 2001-2 tour of India early, but said most people looking back on his career will remember his \"Ashes centuries, three of them, centuries against the West Indies, centuries pretty much everywhere\".\n\nFormer England player Shaun Udal, who played with Thorpe, described him at X as a \"little legend\".\n\nA 'warrior' in the line-up\n\nSurrey chief executive Steve Elworthy said on X: \"Everyone associated with the club is devastated by the tragic news of Graham's passing. He delivered remarkable services for club and country and was a hero to so many cricket fans.\"\n\nDean Headley, who played with Thorpe in the 1997 Ashes, called him on X \"a warrior in our batting line-up and a player who is not talked about enough because of his elegance and style of play.\"\n\nThorpe remained active after his retirement as a player and moved to New South Wales, where he worked with the young Steve Smith and David Warner, Australia's future batting stars.\n\nHe returned to England to work as a batting coach.\n\nIn 2022, he led the team to a thrilling draw in the Sydney Test after head coach Chris Silverwood contracted COVID-19, but stepped down from his role following the Ashes series defeat.\n\nThorpe was appointed Afghanistan coach in July but fell \"seriously ill\" shortly afterwards.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

one of the two best English batsmen he had ever encountered.\n\nWhat tributes have been made for Graham Thorpe?\n\nOli Slipper, Chair at Surrey CCC said: \"Graham is one of the great sons of

More info\n\nThe cricketing world has been dealt a heavy blow as it mourns the loss of former England batsman Graham Thorpe, who has died aged 55.\n\nThorpe, with 100 test caps under his belt and a remarkable double century against New Zealand among his many achievements, spent over 10 glorious years at Surrey County Cricket Club, leaving an indelible mark on the grounds he graced. Renowned not just for his prowess on the pitch, but also his work as a coach and broadcaster post-retirement.\n\nHis passing comes barely two years after a severe health scare that saw him admitted to hospital. In 2022, grappling with ill health, the Professional Cricketers' Association conveyed a message from Thorpe's family that read: \"Graham Thorpe has recently fallen seriously ill and is currently in hospital receiving treatment\n\n\"His prognosis is unclear at this stage and we ask for privacy for him and his family at this time. Our thoughts are with Graham and his family.\"\n\nSince news of his death broke, there has been a deluge of tributes honouring the man affectionately known throughout cricketing circles. Due to begin coaching Afghanistan's national team last year, he was unable to take up the position due to his ill health.\n\nSurrey CCC, where Thorpe's brilliance both as a player and person shone, are among those expressing deep sorrow. Oli Slipper, Chair of Surrey CCC, spoke poignantly of Thorpe's legacy, stating: \"Graham is one of the great sons of Surrey and there is an overwhelming sadness that he will not walk through the gates of the Oval again. He is a legend of Surrey and brought great pride to the Club wearing both the Three Feathers and the Three Lions.\"\n\nWith profound sadness, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced the death of Graham Thorpe, MBE, through a statement. \"It is with great sadness that the ECB shares the news that Graham Thorpe, MBE, has passed away,\" the statement revealed as it reacted to the news of his untimely passing.\n\nIt continued: \"There seem to be no appropriate words to describe the deep shock we feel at Graham's death.\n\n\"Graham Thorpe was much more than one of England's most exceptional talents with the bat. To his colleagues and fans around the globe, he was an esteemed and cherished figure.\n\n\"More than one of England's finest-ever batters, he was a beloved member of the cricket family and revered by fans all over the world. His skill was unquestioned, and his abilities and achievements across a 13-year international career brought so much happiness to his teammates and England and Surrey CCC supporters alike. Later, as a coach, he guided the best England Men's talent to some incredible victories across all formats of the game.\"\n\nThe loss leaves the cricketing world in heartfelt sorrow. The statement expressed deep condolences: \"The cricket world is in mourning today. Our hearts go out to his wife Amanda, his children, father Geoff, and all of his family and friends during this unimaginably difficult time. We will always remember Graham for his extraordinary contributions to the sport.\"\n\nReflecting on his legacy, England captain Ben Stokes and ex-captain Michael Vaughan shared their memories and respects. Vaughan paid his tribute, saying, \"RIP Thorpey .. Thanks for all the advice throughout my career,\" acknowledging the positive impact Graham had on his and many others' careers.\n\nHe lauded the late cricketer's attributes both on and off the pitch: \"You were a great player and a brilliant team-mate. You have gone far too young but you leave as an England cricket legend ...

They divorced seven years later, and the pail welcomed their son and daughter years before their split.\n\nAmanda was always keen to keep out of the spotlight and it is not known what she does for a living, but was by his side when he collected his MBE with their daughters Kitty and Emma also posing for a photo after he was honoured for his services to British sports at Buckingham Palace.\n\nToday the England and Wales Cricket Board announced the heartbreaking news, after the cricket battled serious illness since 2022. In a statement, the ECB said: \"It is with great sadness that we share the news that Graham Thorpe, MBE, has passed away. There seem to be no appropriate words to describe the deep shock we feel at Graham's death.\n\n\"More than one of England's finest-ever batters, he was a beloved member of the cricket family and revered by fans all over the world. His skill was unquestioned, and his abilities and achievements across a 13-year international career brought so much happiness to his teammates and England and Surrey CCC supporters alike.\n\n\"Later, as a coach, he guided the best England Men's talent to some incredible victories across all formats of the game. The cricket world is in mourning today. Our hearts go out to his wife Amanda, his children, father Geoff, and all of his family and friends during this unimaginably difficult time. We will always remember Graham for his extraordinary contributions to the sport.\"\n\nGraham spent 17 years playing for Surrey, earning a regular place in the England Test and ODI teams. He earned 100 Test caps for his country, as well as playing in the 1996 and 1999 World Cups.\n\nA lynchpin of England's middle order, Thorpe struck Over 6,700 Test runs at an average of almost 45, including 16 centuries. His former county are also now mourning his sad loss, with Surrey chairman Oli Slipper hailing his legacy.\n\nSlipper said: \"Graham is one of the great sons of Surrey and there is an overwhelming sadness that he will not walk through the gates of the Oval again. He is a legend of Surrey and brought great pride to the Club wearing both the Three Feathers and the Three Lions. He made outstanding contributions to the Club as a cricketer, and as a man, and he will be so sorely missed.\"\n\nSteve Elworthy, Surrey's CEO, added: \"Everyone associated with the Club is devastated by the tragic news of Graham's passing. He achieved remarkable feats for club and country and was a hero to so many cricket fans. Our thoughts and condolences are with Graham's family and friends, to whom we will offer any support that we are able to. We ask that everyone respects the privacy of the family at this incredibly difficult time.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_elliott_gibbs@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Sam Elliott-Gibbs", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Thorpe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graham Thorpe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Order of the British Empire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey_County_Cricket_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surrey County Cricket Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Elworthy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Elworthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oval", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Oval"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33395197.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Investiture-at-Buckingham-Palace-London-Britain-12-Jul-2007.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790854", "eventUri": "eng-9790854", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

He and Nasser Hussain put on 288 for the fourth wicket and England won by nine wickets.\n\nIt was an almost unique match of England domination in an era of ritual hammerings by the old enemy.\n\nThorpe's highest Test score was a blazing 200 not out from just 231 balls against New Zealand in Christchurch in 2002.\n\nIt was eclipsed by Nathan Astle's brutal 222 from 168 deliveries in the same match but England still won comfortably.\n\nIn another famous win, Thorpe scored 64 not out as England beat Pakistan in Karachi in 2000 by six wickets.\n\nIt was virtually dark at the end and there were no floodlights.\n\nThorpe's final Test innings was 66 not out against Bangladesh in 2005 but England decided to drop him to accommodate the recently-qualified Pietersen.\n\nSo Thorpe took no part in the greatest Test series of all time against Australia that summer.\n\nHe scored 16 centuries in exactly 100 Tests with an average of 44.66.\n\nThorpe moved into coaching, working in Australia for New South Wales, where his charges included youngsters called David Warner and Steve Smith.\n\nHe was England's lead batting coach for several years and an assistant-coach on the Ashes tour of 2021-22.\n\nAway from the pitch, Thorpe's first marriage broke down very publicly and he missed some cricket as a result. He had two children.\n\nThorpe could be maudlin and would sometimes spend hours telling people about his problems.\n\nHe found love again and married Amanda and she became a regular when he toured as part of England's coaching team.\n\nHe was his own man - he was fined \u00a31,000 for refusing to attend an official function during the 1999 World Cup, for example - but I liked him a lot.\n\nHe was open, honest and with a self-deprecating humour.\n\nAfter England's defeat in the Fifth Test in Hobart, Thorpe lit a cigar while drinking indoors with players from both teams.\n\nThe police were called and he filmed their arrival on his 'phone, providing a commentary. Within hours, the footage went public.\n\nThorpe lost his job after England's 0-4 defeat in that series but, within weeks, he was hired to become head coach of Afghanistan.\n\nHe never took up that position, however, and in May of 2022, the PCA put out a statement revealing that Thorpe was \"seriously ill\" in hospital.\n\nHe was not seen again in cricket circles after that although some of his former team-mates tried to keep in touch.\n\nThe cricket world will be deeply shocked and saddened by his passing.\n\nThe ECB said in a statement: \"There seem to be no appropriate words to describe the deep shock we feel at Graham's death.\n\n\"More than one of England's finest-ever batters, he was a beloved member of the cricket family and revered by fans all over the world.\n\n\"His skill was unquestioned and his abilities and achievements across a 13-year international career brought so much happiness to his team-mates and England and Surrey CCC supporters alike.\n\n\"Later, as a coach, he guided the best England men's talent to some incredible victories across all formats of the game.\n\n\"The cricket world is in mourning today.

He played in 100 Test matches and, but for back trouble and the emergence of Kevin Pietersen, would have remained an international cricketer for longer.\n\nAlthough a technically sound batsman brought up on true pitches at the Oval, Thorpe did not fit into the mould of classic England stroke-makers. He might well have been drawn to football, for he was talented enough to represent England under-18s. His character was more complicated than his batting and he could be truculent, and sometimes suffered from depression, yet he was also single-minded and fearless.\n\nWhen Wisden named Thorpe as one of its five cricketers of the year in 1998, he was described as having the face and demeanour of a poker player. \"The eyes say nothing, the straight-set mouth betrays no emotion. He does not believe in small talk. Yet the runs have piled up in front of him like piles of chips.\"\n\nIndeed they did, for he finished his career with an aggregate of 6,744 in Test cricket at the highly respectable average of 44.66. He struck 16 hundreds.\n\nBut some questioned his commitment to the esprit de corps. In the harsh opinion of Mike Gatting, at the time an England selector, \"Graham Thorpe only brings runs to the table.\" Dispirited and run down, Thorpe excused himself from a winter of international cricket in 1999-2000.\n\nA good many top-class cricketers were able to leave their problems beyond the boundary when they went out to bat or bowl; Shane Warne, who bowled at Thorpe throughout his career and rated his batting, was the obvious example. Thorpe, however, was unable to shake off personal difficulties.\n\n\"Of all the players I played with, he was the one whose state of mind most affected his play,\" wrote his England colleague Mike Atherton. \"A happy, contented Graham Thorpe is a world-class player. If something is eating away at him, he cannot put it to the back of his mind and concentrate on his cricket.\"\n\nGraham Paul Thorpe was born in Farnham, Surrey, on August 1 1969 and was playing with men for his village at the age of 13. While at Weydon School, and then at Farnham Sixth Form College, where he was taking a PE diploma, he was invited to nets at the Oval. There, he came under the watch of Micky Stewart and Geoff Arnold, two old-school England cricketers who nurtured his development.\n\nRemarkably, Thorpe had learnt to bat left-handed as a boy even though he was naturally a right-hander. The reason for this was that it became harder for his two older brothers to get him out in the family garden, which had a shorter boundary on the leg side. He never changed his stance again.\n\nIn 1988 he made his debut for Surrey and he was in the England side five years later. After two defeats against Australia in 1993, the selectors called up Thorpe for the third Test, at Trent Bridge. There, he made an unbeaten 114, becoming the first England player to score a century on his debut since Frank Hayes against West Indies 20 years earlier.\n\nA broken thumb kept him out of the final Test of the series and he was dropped briefly the following year, but otherwise was one of few regular selections in a weak era for English cricket.\n\nThorpe batted well against spin on the sub-continent, which not many contemporaries succeeded in doing. He made a century against Pakistan at Lahore in 2000 which included just one four, a rare occurrence indeed, but he could also strike the ball expansively and deployed the sweep shot particularly well. He made his highest Test score, an unbeaten 200, against New Zealand in 2002. This came off 231 balls, a quick rate of scoring then as now.\n\nHe had to contend with a rampant Australian side, full of fine bowlers, throughout his career, which, perhaps inevitably, resulted in his \"carrying a lot of baggage\", as Warne put it.\n\n\"Andrew Strauss played in an England side that won his first eight Test matches,\" said Thorpe. \"The first eight I played, six of them were defeats. It is totally different to come into a winning team. I've played in several different eras for England and we have never had that luxury.\"\n\nNo sooner had he been discarded by the selectors, just before the series of 2005, than England regained the Ashes. He had won his 100th cap against Bangladesh earlier that summer, the management seemingly finding room for sentiment in their selection, and he did make some runs, but Pietersen and Ian Bell were now clearly preferred in the middle order.\n\nOn his home ground at the Oval, Thorpe remained a popular figure. After he dropped out of the tour in 2002-03 his return to Test cricket the following summer was marked by a standing ovation. He went on to score 124, propelling England to victory over South Africa.\n\nHe played for Surrey until 2005, scoring 21,937 runs in all first-class cricket at 45.04, not dissimilar to his Test average, which showed how well he adapted to the international game. In one-day cricket he made 2,380 runs for England at 37.18.\n\nThorpe's post-playing career encompassed some media work, writing an autobiography and working as a specialist batting coach and assistant coach for New South Wales, and then for England from 2010 until 2022, when he was sacked along with Chris Silverwood, the coach, following another heavy defeat in Australia.\n\nBizarrely, he filmed the players partying at the end of the series and the footage, including Tasmanian police telling leading players to go to bed following a complaint about \"intoxicated people\", ended up on the website of the Sydney Morning Herald. Officers had apparently been called because Thorpe lit a cigar in an indoor space.\n\nThorpe applied to be head coach of Middlesex at Lord's, but was overlooked. He was subsequently appointed coach of Afghanistan, but shortly afterwards, in May 2022, his family announced that he was seriously ill and receving treatment in hospital, with an unclear prognosis.\n\nThere was always an anti-establishment, non-conformist streak to Thorpe's character, which England had to manage carefully. He deliberately flouted dress codes and, although not a troublemaker, he viewed authority with suspicion. At one stage of his life an anti-monarchist, he none the less accepted the appointment of MBE for services to the game.\n\nThorpe was badly affected by the death of Graham Kersey, his Surrey team mate and friend, after a car crash in 1997. He had a much-publicised and messy divorce from his first wife, Nicky, following his infidelity. They had a son and a daughter, access to whom was denied to him when his marriage broke up. He is survived by them and by his second wife, Amanda, and their daughter.\n\nGraham Thorpe, born August 1 1969, death announced August 5 2024", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

He played in 100 Test matches and, but for back trouble and the emergence of Kevin Pietersen, would have remained an international cricketer for longer.\n\nAlthough a technically sound batsman brought up on true pitches at the Oval, Thorpe did not fit into the mould of classic England stroke-makers. He might well have been drawn to football, for he was talented enough to represent England under-18s. His character was more complicated than his batting and he could be truculent, and sometimes suffered from depression, yet he was also single-minded and fearless.\n\nWhen Wisden named Thorpe as one of its five cricketers of the year in 1998, he was described as having the face and demeanour of a poker player. \"The eyes say nothing, the straight-set mouth betrays no emotion. He does not believe in small talk. Yet the runs have piled up in front of him like piles of chips.\"\n\nIndeed they did, for he finished his career with an aggregate of 6,744 in Test cricket at the highly respectable average of 44.66. He struck 16 hundreds.\n\nBut some questioned his commitment to the esprit de corps. In the harsh opinion of Mike Gatting, at the time an England selector, \"Graham Thorpe only brings runs to the table.\" Dispirited and run down, Thorpe excused himself from a winter of international cricket in 1999-2000.\n\nA good many top-class cricketers were able to leave their problems beyond the boundary when they went out to bat or bowl; Shane Warne, who bowled at Thorpe throughout his career and rated his batting, was the obvious example. Thorpe, however, was unable to shake off personal difficulties.\n\n\"Of all the players I played with, he was the one whose state of mind most affected his play,\" wrote his England colleague Mike Atherton. \"A happy, contented Graham Thorpe is a world-class player. If something is eating away at him, he cannot put it to the back of his mind and concentrate on his cricket.\"\n\nGraham Paul Thorpe was born in Farnham, Surrey, on August 1 1969 and was playing with men for his village at the age of 13. While at Weydon School, and then at Farnham Sixth Form College, where he was taking a PE diploma, he was invited to nets at the Oval. There, he came under the watch of Micky Stewart and Geoff Arnold, two old-school England cricketers who nurtured his development.\n\nRemarkably, Thorpe had learnt to bat left-handed as a boy even though he was naturally a right-hander. The reason for this was that it became harder for his two older brothers to get him out in the family garden, which had a shorter boundary on the leg side. He never changed his stance again.\n\nIn 1988 he made his debut for Surrey and he was in the England side five years later. After two defeats against Australia in 1993, the selectors called up Thorpe for the third Test, at Trent Bridge. There, he made an unbeaten 114, becoming the first England player to score a century on his debut since Frank Hayes against West Indies 20 years earlier.\n\nA broken thumb kept him out of the final Test of the series and he was dropped briefly the following year, but otherwise was one of few regular selections in a weak era for English cricket.\n\nThorpe batted well against spin on the sub-continent, which not many contemporaries succeeded in doing. He made a century against Pakistan at Lahore in 2000 which included just one four, a rare occurrence indeed, but he could also strike the ball expansively and deployed the sweep shot particularly well. He made his highest Test score, an unbeaten 200, against New Zealand in 2002. This came off 231 balls, a quick rate of scoring then as now.\n\nHe had to contend with a rampant Australian side, full of fine bowlers, throughout his career, which, perhaps inevitably, resulted in his \"carrying a lot of baggage\", as Warne put it.\n\n\"Andrew Strauss played in an England side that won his first eight Test matches,\" said Thorpe. \"The first eight I played, six of them were defeats. It is totally different to come into a winning team. I've played in several different eras for England and we have never had that luxury.\"\n\nNo sooner had he been discarded by the selectors, just before the series of 2005, than England regained the Ashes. He had won his 100th cap against Bangladesh earlier that summer, the management seemingly finding room for sentiment in their selection, and he did make some runs, but Pietersen and Ian Bell were now clearly preferred in the middle order.\n\nOn his home ground at the Oval, Thorpe remained a popular figure. After he dropped out of the tour in 2002-03 his return to Test cricket the following summer was marked by a standing ovation. He went on to score 124, propelling England to victory over South Africa.\n\nHe played for Surrey until 2005, scoring 21,937 runs in all first-class cricket at 45.04, not dissimilar to his Test average, which showed how well he adapted to the international game. In one-day cricket he made 2,380 runs for England at 37.18.\n\nThorpe's post-playing career encompassed some media work, writing an autobiography and working as a specialist batting coach and assistant coach for New South Wales, and then for England from 2010 until 2022, when he was sacked along with Chris Silverwood, the coach, following another heavy defeat in Australia.\n\nBizarrely, he filmed the players partying at the end of the series and the footage, including Tasmanian police telling leading players to go to bed following a complaint about \"intoxicated people\", ended up on the website of the Sydney Morning Herald. Officers had apparently been called because Thorpe lit a cigar in an indoor space.\n\nThorpe applied to be head coach of Middlesex at Lord's, but was overlooked. He was subsequently appointed coach of Afghanistan, but shortly afterwards, in May 2022, his family announced that he was seriously ill and receving treatment in hospital, with an unclear prognosis.\n\nThere was always an anti-establishment, non-conformist streak to Thorpe's character, which England had to manage carefully. He deliberately flouted dress codes and, although not a troublemaker, he viewed authority with suspicion. At one stage of his life an anti-monarchist, he none the less accepted the appointment of MBE for services to the game.\n\nThorpe was badly affected by the death of Graham Kersey, his Surrey team mate and friend, after a car crash in 1997. He had a much-publicised and messy divorce from his first wife, Nicky, following his infidelity. They had a son and a daughter, access to whom was denied to him when his marriage broke up. He is survived by them and by his second wife, Amanda, and their daughter.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

There seem to be no appropriate words to describe the deep shock we feel at Graham's death. More than one of England's finest-ever batters, he was a beloved member of the cricket family and revered by fans all over the world,\" the ECB stated, as quoted by the International Cricket Council (ICC).\n\nThorpe's contribution to English cricket over the years has been significant. He made his international debut in 1993 and was a mainstay in the English batting lineup throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s. His illustrious career spanned 100 Test matches in which he scored 6,744 runs at an average of 44.66, including 16 centuries and 39 half-centuries. His highest Test score was an unbeaten 200.\n\nIn One Day Internationals (ODIs), Thorpe amassed 2,380 runs at an average of 37.18, with 21 half-centuries. He played in two ICC Men's Cricket World Cups, contributing significantly in the 1996 edition in Sri Lanka and the 1999 edition held in multiple locations, including England.\n\nThorpe achieved his highest ranking in the ICC Test batting rankings as No. 3 ahead of England's tour of the West Indies in 1998. His peak ODI ranking was No. 10.\n\nAfter retiring from international cricket in 2005, Thorpe took on coaching roles with New South Wales, Surrey, and the England Men's team. He was instrumental as a batting coach in England's setup throughout the 2010s and was part of the coaching staff that led England to victory in the thrilling 2019 World Cup on home soil.\n\nThorpe was appointed as Afghanistan's head coach in March 2022 but was unable to take up the position due to his illness.\n\nThorpe's legacy as both a player and coach remains significant in the cricketing world, with his contributions celebrated by teammates, fans, and the wider cricket community.

Yet the runs have piled up in front of him like piles of chips'\n\nGraham Thorpe, who has died aged 55, was the finest England middle-order batsman of his era, a nuggety left-hander who made a century on his debut against a strong Australian attack and who was as adept against spin as he was pace. He played in 100 Test matches and, but for back trouble and the emergence of Kevin Pietersen, would have remained an international cricketer for longer.\n\nAlthough a technically sound batsman brought up on true pitches at the Oval, Thorpe did not fit into the mould of classic England stroke-makers. He might well have been drawn to football, for he was talented enough to represent England under-18s. His character was more complicated than his batting and he could be truculent, and sometimes suffered from depression, yet he was also single-minded and fearless.\n\nWhen Wisden named Thorpe as one of its five cricketers of the year in 1998, he was described as having the face and demeanour of a poker player. \"The eyes say nothing, the straight-set mouth betrays no emotion. He does not believe in small talk. Yet the runs have piled up in front of him like piles of chips.\"\n\nIndeed they did, for he finished his career with an aggregate of 6,744 in Test cricket at the highly respectable average of 44.66. He struck 16 hundreds.\n\nBut some questioned his commitment to the esprit de corps. In the harsh opinion of Mike Gatting, at the time an England selector, \"Graham Thorpe only brings runs to the table.\" Dispirited and run down, Thorpe excused himself from a winter of international cricket in 1999-2000.\n\nA good many top-class cricketers were able to leave their problems beyond the boundary when they went out to bat or bowl; Shane Warne, who bowled at Thorpe throughout his career and rated his batting, was the obvious example. Thorpe, however, was unable to shake off personal difficulties.\n\n\"Of all the players I played with, he was the one whose state of mind most affected his play,\" wrote his England colleague Mike Atherton. \"A happy, contented Graham Thorpe is a world-class player. If something is eating away at him, he cannot put it to the back of his mind and concentrate on his cricket.\"\n\nGraham Paul Thorpe was born in Farnham, Surrey, on August 1 1969 and was playing with men for his village at the age of 13. While at Weydon School, and then at Farnham Sixth Form College, where he was taking a PE diploma, he was invited to nets at the Oval. There, he came under the watch of Micky Stewart and Geoff Arnold, two old-school England cricketers who nurtured his development.\n\nRemarkably, Thorpe had learnt to bat left-handed as a boy even though he was naturally a right-hander. The reason for this was that it became harder for his two older brothers to get him out in the family garden, which had a shorter boundary on the leg side. He never changed his stance again.\n\nIn 1988 he made his debut for Surrey and he was in the England side five years later. After two defeats against Australia in 1993, the selectors called up Thorpe for the third Test, at Trent Bridge. There, he made an unbeaten 114, becoming the first England player to score a century on his debut since Frank Hayes against West Indies 20 years earlier.\n\nA broken thumb kept him out of the final Test of the series and he was dropped briefly the following year, but otherwise was one of few regular selections in a weak era for English cricket.\n\nThorpe batted well against spin on the sub-continent, which not many contemporaries succeeded in doing. He made a century against Pakistan at Lahore in 2000 which included just one four, a rare occurrence indeed, but he could also strike the ball expansively and deployed the sweep shot particularly well. He made his highest Test score, an unbeaten 200, against New Zealand in 2002. This came off 231 balls, a quick rate of scoring then as now.\n\nHe had to contend with a rampant Australian side, full of fine bowlers, throughout his career, which, perhaps inevitably, resulted in his \"carrying a lot of baggage\", as Warne put it.\n\n\"Andrew Strauss played in an England side that won his first eight Test matches,\" said Thorpe. \"The first eight I played, six of them were defeats. It is totally different to come into a winning team. I've played in several different eras for England and we have never had that luxury.\"\n\nNo sooner had he been discarded by the selectors, just before the series of 2005, than England regained the Ashes. He had won his 100th cap against Bangladesh earlier that summer, the management seemingly finding room for sentiment in their selection, and he did make some runs, but Pietersen and Ian Bell were now clearly preferred in the middle order.\n\nOn his home ground at the Oval, Thorpe remained a popular figure. After he dropped out of the tour in 2002-03 his return to Test cricket the following summer was marked by a standing ovation. He went on to score 124, propelling England to victory over South Africa.\n\nHe played for Surrey until 2005, scoring 21,937 runs in all first-class cricket at 45.04, not dissimilar to his Test average, which showed how well he adapted to the international game. In one-day cricket he made 2,380 runs for England at 37.18.\n\nThorpe's post-playing career encompassed some media work, writing an autobiography and working as a specialist batting coach and assistant coach for New South Wales, and then for England from 2010 until 2022, when he was sacked along with Chris Silverwood, the coach, following another heavy defeat in Australia.\n\nBizarrely, he filmed the players partying at the end of the series and the footage, including Tasmanian police telling leading players to go to bed following a complaint about \"intoxicated people\", ended up on the website of the Sydney Morning Herald. Officers had apparently been called because Thorpe lit a cigar in an indoor space.\n\nThorpe applied to be head coach of Middlesex at Lord's, but was overlooked. He was subsequently appointed coach of Afghanistan, but shortly afterwards, in May 2022, his family announced that he was seriously ill and receving treatment in hospital, with an unclear prognosis.\n\nThere was always an anti-establishment, non-conformist streak to Thorpe's character, which England had to manage carefully. He deliberately flouted dress codes and, although not a troublemaker, he viewed authority with suspicion. At one stage of his life an anti-monarchist, he none the less accepted the appointment of MBE for services to the game.\n\nThorpe was badly affected by the death of Graham Kersey, his Surrey team mate and friend, after a car crash in 1997. He had a much-publicised and messy divorce from his first wife, Nicky, following his infidelity. They had a son and a daughter, access to whom was denied to him when his marriage broke up. He is survived by them and by his second wife, Amanda, and their daughter.\n\nGraham Thorpe, born August 1 1969, death announced August 5 2024", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType":

If something off the field is eating away at him, he cannot put it to the back of his mind and concentrate on his cricket.\"\n\nAnd yet Thorpe, who enjoyed a happy second marriage, did manage a successful return to the Test arena.\n\nBorn on August 1, 1969 in the market town of Farnham, Surrey, Thorpe was both a promising schoolboy cricketer and footballer.\n\nBut it was cricket that claimed him and his first-class debut against Leicestershire saw the best England left-handed batsman of his time dismiss the one of the previous generation when Thorpe took the wicket of David Gower with his rarely-used medium-pace bowling.\n\nHis Test debut, during the drawn third match of the 1993 Ashes against Australia at Trent Bridge, saw Thorpe score a second-innings 114 as he became England's first debutant century-maker since Frank Hayes 20 years earlier.\n\nOne criticism levelled at Thorpe was that a man who got past fifty on 55 occasions in Test cricket, should have ended up with more than 16 hundreds.\n\nBut many of those centuries were memorable, be it his first overseas hundred for England on the notoriously quick WACA pitch in Perth against a formidable Australia attack in 1995 or an unbeaten 119 when facing West Indies greats Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh in Barbados in 2004.\n\nThere was and a superb 200 not out in Christchurch in 2002 -- a match featuring Nathan Astle's spectacular 222 in a losing cause -- and a heroic 64 not out in the fading light of Karachi to seal England's first series win in Pakistan for 39 years.\n\nBut the collapse of his first marriage, played out in lurid headlines, led Thorpe to call time on a one-day international career of 82 matches and then withdraw from the 2002/03 tour of Australia.\n\nYet he returned to England duty for the final Test of the following home season against South Africa, where his 124 at the Oval helped England to an unlikely series draw with the Proteas.\n\nThorpe's last Test was against Bangladesh two years later, with Kevin Pietersen effectively taking his place for England's celebrated 2005 Ashes triumph.\n\nA coaching stint with New South Wales, where he worked with Steve Smith and David Warner, followed and he returned to work with England, initially as a batting coach in 2010.\n\nBut a 4-0 Ashes defeat on England's 2021/22 coronavirus-marred tour of Australia meant Thorpe, then an assistant coach, lost his job as did head coach Chris Silverwood, and the director of cricket, Ashley Giles.\n\nThere was still, however, a huge affection for Thorpe within the England squad.\n\nThis was seen when Test captain Ben Stokes wore a shirt emblazoned on the back with 'Thorpe 564' -- his Test cap number -- at Lord's after Thorpe was admitted to hospital in 2022.", "source": {"uri":

Thorpe, who has passed away aged 55, was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1998 and Colin Bateman wrote this tribute at the time.\n\nThere are few quieter men in the England dressing room than Graham Thorpe, and even fewer with more to shout about. The Farnham boy has the face and demeanour of a poker player. The eyes say nothing, the straight-set mouth betrays no emotion. He does not believe in small talk. Yet the runs have piled up in front of him like columns of chips.\n\nAsk any England follower to name the leading batsmen of recent years and they will reel off Mike Atherton and Alec Stewart. Nasser Hussain might get a mention too, and, oh yes, that little left-hander... Thorpe. None has contributed more consistently over the past four years than that little left-hander, who has the scoreboard ticking over before you have even noticed he has taken guard.\n\nAccumulation is the name of the game. Unspectacular and uncomplicated, Thorpe reached the end of 1997 with a Test average of 42, better than any of his contemporaries in the England side.\n\nHe ushered in the New Year of 1997 with something of a reputation as a nearly man. Since scoring a century on Test debut, he had reached 50 on 20 further occasions in 33 more Tests, but only once made it through to three figures again.\n\nThorpe might have made a New Year's resolution to do something about it. Three centuries came in the next four Tests, two against New Zealand and one against Australia. That brought a rhetorical question from him, at one of his rare press conferences: \"I didn't notice too much of a mental barrier today, did you?\" Even in an Ashes series that brought more disappointment for England, Thorpe topped the home batting with an average of 50.33, while none of his colleagues could reach the 40s. He scored 453 runs in the six-Test series, which was bettered only by Australian opener Matthew Elliott. To round off this summer, he signed off with a career-best 222 in the vital Championship match against Glamorgan.\n\nMore than anything, though, Thorpe had faced the best team in the world and come out with his reputation enhanced. Even then, during a sticky midsummer patch while the Australians were winning three straight Tests, his place in the middle order had been called into doubt again, while other, more high-profile, players escaped criticism.\n\nThorpe insists he will not change for the sake of the image-builders being brought in by the ECB's new regime. The only spin doctor he is interested in is one who can help him identify Shane Warne's variations. \"If you're naturally enthusiastic and a showman, that's fine, but I'm not, and I think it is important not to try to be something you are not. That way, you only fall into traps,\" says Thorpe. \"Others may attract the publicity, but I don't need that. In sport, you can get envy and jealousy in a dressing-room, but thankfully I've never felt that. You've just got to enjoy it your own way.\"\n\n***\n\nGraham Paul Thorpe started in the archetypal English way. Born on August 1, 1969, into a sports-mad family, by the age of 13 he was playing with the men of Wrecclesham, a village team in the heart of Surrey. Two years later, he followed his older brothers, Ian and Alan, into the Farnham first team in the Surrey Championship, and at 16 he was invited up to The Oval.\n\nCricket, though, was only half of it for Thorpe, as he worked his way towards a PE diploma at Farnham Sixth Form College. By winter, he was a highly promising footballer, good enough to make the England Under 18s as a nip-your-ankles midfielder, to use his own description. When it came to the time to make a career move, however, Thorpe had not progressed up the soccer ladder. Only Brentford had shown a passing interest, and cricket won the day.\n\nHis early development was moulded at Surrey by Micky Stewart and Geoff Arnold, two more characters interested in spit and polish rather than flash and dash. Typically, his role models were not two high-fliers but doughty opener Ray Alikhan and left-arm spinner Keith Medlycott, a man whose own playing career nosedived but is now back at The Oval as coach. \"It was their attitude that I admired most. I liked them as blokes,\" says Thorpe. \"They weren't bothered about who they were playing against or who they were playing under, they were not in awe of anyone - they just got on with their job.\"\n\nThorpe, having played for England sides from the age of 15, made the natural progression through to the A team. But there the progress faltered a little. He made four successive England A tours from 1989/90, but did not progress until England were enduring another demolition job by the Australian bowlers in the summer of 1993.\n\nBeaten in the first two Tests, England called up Mark Ilott, Mark Lathwell, Martin McCague and Thorpe for their debuts in the Third at Trent Bridge. The other three made only a passing impact on the international scene, but Thorpe announced himself with a second-innings 114 not out. He was the first England player in 20 years - since Frank Hayes against West Indies - to score a century on debut.\n\nApart from a broken thumb, which kept him out of the last Test of that 1993 Ashes series, and a brief spell in 1994 when he was dropped, Thorpe has been one of the few constants in the England side of the past four years. Despite problems off the field in 1997 which troubled him deeply - the death of Surrey colleague Graham Kersey in a car accident and Sunday newspaper allegations about his private life - Thorpe remained the most single-mindedly successful of English batsmen.", "source": {"uri": "wisden.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wisden"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In 2013, Thorpe became batting coach for the senior England men's white-ball team, who eventually won 2019 ODI World Cup on home soil.\n\nThorpe served as an assistant coach to Chris Silverwood, and even worked as interim head coach for England's T20I series against Pakistan during Covid-19 pandemic. After England lost the Ashes 4-0, Thrope was sacked from his role and was announced as the new head coach of Afghanistan in March 2022, but fell seriously ill and couldn't take up the role.",

He had two children.\n\nThorpe could be sentimental and would sometimes talk about his problems for hours.\n\nHe found love again and married Amanda, who became a regular guest when he toured with the English coaching team.\n\nHe was his own man and was fined $1,000 for refusing to attend an official function during the 1999 World Cup, but I liked him.\n\nHe was open, honest and had a self-deprecating sense of humor.\n\nAfter England's defeat in the fifth Test match in Hobart, Thorpe lit a cigar while drinking inside with players from both teams.\n\nThe police were called and he filmed their arrival on his phone, commenting on it. Within hours the footage was made public.\n\nThorpe lost his job after England's 0-4 defeat in that series, but within weeks he was appointed head coach of Afghanistan.\n\nHowever, he never accepted the position and in May 2022 the PCA issued a statement saying that Thorpe was seriously ill in hospital.\n\nHe was not seen in the cricket world after that, although some of his former teammates tried to keep in touch.\n\nThe cricket world will be deeply shocked and saddened by his passing.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [],

Thorpe, who has died aged 55, will be remembered as one of the best batters of his generation.\n\nAcross his 100 Tests between 1993 and 2005, Thorpe was a world-class left-hander in a struggling England side and a key player in the upturn that followed.\n\nWith his trademark headband in place, he could grind out runs against some of the game's greats or lead a brave counter-attack with a flurry of boundaries.\n\nBetween his playing and coaching careers, Thorpe spent nearly 30 years as a key part of the England set-up.\n\nHe was a Surrey legend and, with bat in hand, he was as complete as England have seen.\n\nThorpe's skill was developed on the club grounds of Surrey, the county he would go on to represent throughout his entire first-class career from 1988 to 2005.\n\nOn his England debut against Australia in 1993 he scored a second-innings 114 not out, having come in with the hosts in a precarious position.\n\nIt was a clear sign of what was to come.\n\nThorpe, who hit 2,380 runs in 82 one-day internationals, would go on to score 6,744 runs in 100 Tests at an average of 44.66, with 16 hundreds.\n\nHe scored a swashbuckling 200 not out, his highest Test score, from 231 balls against New Zealand in 2002, having dug in for 118 from 301 against Pakistan in Lahore 16 months earlier - a knock containing just two boundaries.\n\nFearless against pace and one of England's best against spin, Thorpe averaged 45.17 at home, 47.85 in Asia and 48.18 in Australia - a player for all situations.\n\nAsk his former captain Nasser Hussain to rank England's best players of that era and Thorpe's name would be near the top, if not number one, in the list.\n\n\"When people reel off the list of England greats, he seems to slip people's minds, but he was a man for a crisis, for a battle,\" Hussain said in 2021.\n\nThorpe was the stern-faced rock in a batting line-up that faltered all too often - the one England fans could usually rely on.\n\nIn one of that side's greatest victories, against Pakistan in Karachi in 2000, it was Thorpe who hit the winning runs in the gloom, ending 64 not out.\n\nHe was also a fine fielder and particularly accomplished in the slips.\n\nBut it was not all success.\n\nAfter he had previously missed tours because of the challenges of life on the road, Thorpe's first marriage publicly broke down in 2002.\n\nHe subsequently took an indefinite break from cricket and, despite initially making himself available, pulled out of England's 2002-03 Ashes squad to face Australia.\n\nThorpe would miss more than a year at international level, but he returned with what he described as his finest innings.\n\nAfter being recalled in 2003 for the final Test of the summer at The Oval, he scored 124 in the first innings against South Africa.\n\nIn typically composed style he held his arms aloft and punched the air after reaching three figures, his home crowd giving an emotional, extended ovation from the stands.\n\n\"There were times when I thought I wasn't going to play again and more importantly I had to wipe away the memory of how I walked away from cricket last year,\" he said afterwards.\n\n\"I didn't want to leave cricket like that, and you couldn't have written it better to get a century on your home ground.\"\n\nThat innings marked the start of a resurgence for Thorpe in the latter years of his career.\n\nAfter his recall, he scored 1,635 runs at 56.37 as England's fortunes improved under new captain Michael Vaughan.\n\nThorpe, dubbed the grandad of the team by Vaughan, hit five centuries in that period, including one packed with his trademark grit, batting with a broken finger against West Indies.\n\nHe played his 100th Test against Bangladesh early in the 2005 season, but it proved to be his last.\n\nHaving played in five unsuccessful Ashes series, Thorpe was left out when Vaughan's side famously won back the urn in 2005, the younger batting options of Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen preferred.\n\nAfter retiring that summer, Thorpe began coaching in Australia with New South Wales.\n\nHe soon returned to work with Surrey and by 2010 was again involved in the England set-up, as batting coach of the development Lions side before moving up to assist the senior men's side.\n\nHe left his role as assistant coach in February 2022 after a 4-0 Ashes defeat in Australia, but also had been part of the backroom team for England's 50-over World Cup win in 2019.\n\nAfter leaving England he was appointed Afghanistan men's head coach in March 2022 but did not oversee a match after he fell ill.\n\nWhether batting or coaching, Thorpe was a fixture on the international scene for almost three decades.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

Vaughan wrote on X. 'Thank you for all the advice during my career, you were a great player and a brilliant teammate. You went far too young but you leave an England cricket legend... Thoughts with all who knew Thorpey and all the family xxx.'\n\nTest captain Stokes tweeted five love heart emojis alongside a picture of Thorpe with 564 on his shirt, which represents his Test cap number.\n\nThorpe's former Earldom of Surrey described him as one of their \"fantastic sons\".\n\nChairman Oli Slipper said: 'He is a Surrey legend and brought great pride to the club by wearing both the Three Feathers and the Three Lions.\n\n'He has made an extraordinary contribution to the club as a cricketer and as a person and we will miss him immensely.'\n\nSurrey Chief Executive Steve Elworthy said: \"Everyone associated with the club is devastated by the tragic news of Graham's passing.

My thoughts are with his family and friends x,\" he wrote.\n\nAnother of Thorpe's former team-mates, Derek Pringle, said the batsman was a \"great cricketer\" despite his problems. He wrote: \"Graham Thorpe had his demons but this is just such a sad day...

He was also arrested on Boxing Day 2003 after an altercation on his wife's doorstep.\n\nHe said later in his autobiography Rising From The Ashes: 'One of my most vivid memories comes from just before the last Ashes series in Australia [in 2002]. I'd been selected for the tour but I pulled out because I was having more difficulties with [his ex-wife] Nicky. It was a terrible time which lasted a few months.\n\n'I was living alone in our family home behind these permanently drawn curtains. I remember waking up one morning and seeing this mess in our front room - an empty bottle of Scotch, dirty plates, a mountain of fags.\n\n'My wife had left me, she'd taken [their children] Henry and Amelia and I was desperate. I walked to the fridge and saw this beer. It was 10 o'clock in the morning but I thought 'What the hell. I've got nothing else.'\n\n'It wasn't a daily thing but sometimes I'd fall asleep on the couch at three o'clock in the afternoon having had three or four beers. It seems a slightly worrying period when I look back at it now; at the time it was truly awful. But it's made me more compassionate. If I walk past some guy in a doorway I react very differently. Five years ago I wouldn't have noticed him but now I wonder what terrible chain of events brought him down'.\n\nThorpe later admitted he was no angel before his 'emotionally crippling' divorce. There was a famous drunken ling with a 20-year-old student while on tour in New Zealand in 1997. There were rumours of several other lovers.\n\nBut he accused his first wife Nicola of having an affair with Kieron Vorster, who was a family friend and then fitness coach of Britain's star tennis player Tim Henman.\n\n\"It wasn't just an affair. What she did was to bring another man into my house and stop me from seeing our children. My life fell from under me.

It's all very well dedicating your sporting prowess to your kids from the other side of the world.\n\n'But to be a real dad, you have to be there at bedtime and take them to school.\n\n'Graham loves the children, but for the last five years he has been at home for just a few weeks... and when he was away I had no idea who was sharing his bed.'\n\nShe went on: 'Graham was on tour for 11 months a year. There are so many examples of his inherent thoughtlessness - he was away when I had an ectopic pregnancy; he watched a football match while I gave birth to Henry; he was in bed with some student when Henry was five weeks old and he was absent for Amelia's birth. I could go on forever.\n\nShe added: 'I don't hate Graham. I'm just sad it ended like it did. I hope he finds happiness because it is important to the children that Daddy is happy.\n\n'I also hope he finds someone he loves and can be faithful. But to be honest, I won't hold my breath.'\n\nBut he did find love again.\n\nHe met his second wife Amanda, with her encouragement he returned to cricket again, much to the joy of his own fans.\n\nAfter returning for his beloved Surrey, he was recalled by England for the final test of the summer against South Africa where he scored 124 runs.\n\nHe was close to tears as the home crowd gave him a standing ovation.\n\n'There were times when I thought I wasn't going to play again and more importantly I had to wipe away the memory of how I walked away from cricket last year,' he said afterwards.\n\n'I didn't want to leave cricket like that, and you couldn't have written it better to get a century on your home ground.'\n\nGraham Thorpe married first wife Nicola (pictured) in 1995 but they separated in 2002\n\nGraham Thorpe holds a beer with Mark Butcher on April 3, 2004\n\nGraham Thorpe celebrates winning the Test series on June 13, 2004\n\nEngland batting coach Graham Thorpe and Joe Root on August 20, 2019\n\nRunning the gamut from stylish newcomer to grizzled veteran, Thorpe - who has died aged 55 - proved himself a dependably elite performer in an environment where chaos and collapse never seemed far away.\n\nDuring a period when Australian dominance was at its relentless peak, the fact that Thorpe averaged more against the Baggy Greens than his career mark (45.74 against 44.66) spoke volumes of his ability to rise to a challenge.\n\nOff the field, the battles were often even more intense. While operating in the full glare of international sport, Thorpe struggled with depression, divorce and drinking, culminating in a tumultuous winter in 2002 that saw him walk away from the game at what could have been his peak.\n\nThere would be a celebratory second act with England, featuring an emotional comeback century at his lifelong home ground of the Oval, and a third when he became a key figure in the international coaching set-up.\n\nHe is survived by wife Amanda and four children, Henry, Amelia, Kitty and Emma.\n\nBorn on August 1, 1969 in the market town of Farnham, little more than an hour from The Oval, Thorpe was ahead of his years on a cricket pitch and remembered being drafted by local side Wrecclesham's Under-17s while still only eight years old.\n\nAlthough he would have to wait to get a bat in his hands, he recalled taking a catch - an early indicator of the safe hands that would make him a regular in the slip cordon and bring over 600 professional catches.\n\nHe was spotted early by Surrey, who picked him up as an under-11 and never let him go, even when Brentford Football Club came calling with the offer of trials.\n\nDespite showing enough promise to be selected by England Schools as a ball-playing link between defence and midfield, Thorpe would go on to choose the summer sport and later became one of the country's most accomplished players of spin. Once a sweeper, always a sweeper.\n\nThorpe would go on to become England's best left-handed batter since David Gower and enjoyed an unlikely torch-passing moment on his first-class debut against Leicestershire when he took Gower's wicket with his soon-to-be phased out medium-pacers.\n\nHe was a regular feature on the nascent England 'A' circuit for four years before finally graduating to the senior side, initially in one-day internationals and then, unforgettably, the Test arena.\n\nSelected at Trent Bridge for the third match of the 1993 Ashes and dismissed by the combative Merv Hughes in the first innings, he struck an undefeated 114 in the second to become England's first debutant centurion since Frank Hayes 20 years earlier.\n\nHe was one of four players to receive his cap in Nottingham and, while he would stick around for another 99, Mark Lathwell, Mark Ilott and Martin McCague managed a total of 10 appearances. Few stayed the course as long as Thorpe, but fewer still had such an ironclad claim.\n\nAlthough his conversion rate between 50 and 100 left room for improvement - he could and should have retired with considerably more than 16 tons - his quality brooked no argument.\n\nBut the demands of touring and a faltering marriage to first wife Nicky, played out in excruciating detail through the newspapers, saw him retire from ODIs in 2002 before committing, then withdrawing, from that winter's tour of Australia.\n\nHe was able to find enough peace to regain his place for the final Test against South Africa, greeted as a returning hero as he made 124 in front of an adoring South London crowd.\n\nThorpe's final act as a player did not extend as far as the fabled 2005 Ashes - he was dropped for the series in favour of Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen and retired thereafter - but by then he had already become just the eighth Englishman to reach 100 Test caps, securing a proud legacy along the way.\n\nHe stayed in the game with a move to New South Wales, where he worked with a young Steve Smith and David Warner, and returned to work with England between 2010 and 2022.\n\nThorpe took charge of his country in the familiar surroundings of the Sydney Cricket Ground after Chris Silverwood was laid low by coronavirus, securing a nailbiting draw to avoid a seemingly inevitable whitewash.\n\nHis final act with the team was to film an early hours get together between the two sides that ended with a call to the police and was leaked to the media.\n\nIt was a reminder that, in addition to being brilliant with bat in hand, Thorpe had always been one of England's most reassuringly human athletes.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail

The statement continued.\n\n'He made outstanding contributions to the Club as a cricketer, and as a man, and he will be so sorely missed.'\n\nThe left-handed batsman was renowned as one of the finest English players in recent history. He played exactly 100 Tests and scored 16 centuries before retiring in 2005.\n\nDuring his playing career, Thorpe averaged an impressive 44.7 runs in Test matches. His highest score was 200 not out and the talented middle-order batsmen also played 77 One Day Internationals.\n\nOne of his most memorable Test innings came in 2000 against Pakistan in Karachi. After a final day implosion from the hosts, Thorpe produced an unbeaten 64 in near darkness towards the end of his innings to lead England to their first series win in Pakistan for 39 years, and Pakistan's first loss at the National Stadium in 35 years.\n\n'I think literally five to ten minutes after we came off, it was pitch black,' Thorpe told Cricket Monthly . 'From the dressing room, coming back on to the balcony, it was pitch black.\n\n'We opened up bottles of lemonade, because we couldn't drink in Pakistan. We were on a flight back to Dubai that evening, where we did have a few Guinnesses. There was about a two-hour turnaround from the end of the game, back to the hotel and on to a flight that night.'\n\nThorpe racked up more than 2,000 runs in the shorter format of the game and his intelligence and leadership allowed a smooth transition into coaching when he retired from playing in 2006.\n\nHe went on to begin a coaching career in Australia, where he worked with the likes of Steve Smith and David Warner at New South Wales, before joining the England and Wales Cricket Board as a batting coach.\n\nHe worked as assistant with the senior side under Trevor Bayliss and Chris Silverwood, stepping up to lead the team in this winter's Sydney Test against Australia due to Silverwood's coronavirus diagnosis.\n\nThe ECB also released a statement after the shock news of Thorpe's death. A post from the body on X read: 'It is with great sadness that we share the news that Graham Thorpe, MBE, has passed away. There seem to be no appropriate words to describe the deep shock we feel at Graham's death.'\n\nHis position as England assistant coach looked untenable after the conclusion of the Ashes, when police were called to the team hotel in Hobart while he was smoking a cigar during a rooftop drinking session inside the premises that lasted until 6am.\n\nIt was an unfortunate ending to Thorpe's role in the England coaching set-up and he is still held in enormously high regard among players and fans.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"},

At times, it seemed only an intense nature and occasionally troubled private life could stand in his way.\n\nA record of 6,744 Test runs at 44, with 16 hundreds, as well as 2,380 at 37 in one-day internationals, confirmed his quality. But it was the manner in which he made them, as much as their volume, that marked him out as an England great.\n\nBorn in Farnham, Surrey, in 1969, Thorpe was playing for neighbouring Wrecclesham men's team at the age of 13. At 16, his county came calling. And when it became clear that a potential career as a 'nip-your-ankles midfielder' was going nowhere - despite fleeting interest from Brentford - he threw in his lot with cricket.\n\nFormer England cricketer Graham Thorpe has died at the age of 55\n\nAs a player, Thorpe is widely considered as one of English cricket's finest ever middle order batsmen - here he is pictured playing against New Zealand in Christchurch in 2002\n\nThorpe was most recently England's batting coach, but was sacked after the 4-0 Ashes series defeat in 2022\n\nFor a while, England A tours threatened to be the best of it. But the selectors had spotted something. Parachuted into the third Ashes Test at Trent Bridge in 1993, and with England 2-0 down and facing ridicule, Thorpe responded to being bounced out cheaply by Merv Hughes in the first innings with an unbeaten 114 in the second.\n\nHe was the first England batsman to score a Test century on debut since Frank Hayes, 20 years earlier.\n\nHundreds, it's true, were not easy to come by: between Nottingham and back-to-back centuries in New Zealand in 1996-97, Thorpe managed just one in Tests, at Perth. But he was establishing a reputation as a selfless counter-attacker, typified by three successive seventies at home to South Africa in 1994.\n\nHis one-legged swivel-pull, made more elegant by his left-handedness, became one of the signature shots of England's mainly troubled decade.\n\nNever was his versatility put to better use than during a pair of unexpected victories in Pakistan and Sri Lanka in 2000-01. In the first Test at Lahore, he nudged and nurdled 118 off 301 balls, hitting only two fours.\n\nIn the third at Karachi, he took charge of the famous run-chase in the dark, making an unbeaten 64 to seal a 1-0 win. The sight of him and Hussain running off, arm in arm, remained one of the images of the era.\n\nIn September 2017, Thorpe was presented with a silver cap to commemorate his 100 Tests\n\nThorpe and Andrew Strauss celebrate England winning their first Test match against South Africa in Port Elizabeth in 2004\n\nThorpe, pictured here alongside Nasser Hussain (right) after clinching a defining victory in the near dark in Pakistan in 2000, is regarded as one of the best batsmen of his generation\n\nIn the 1993 Ashes, Thorpe made a magnificent unbeaten 114 to help England draw against Australia at Trent Bridge, where the crowd gave him a standing ovation\n\nTHORPE'S ENGLAND STATS:\n\nTESTS:\n\nMatches - 100\n\nInnings - 179\n\nRuns - 6744\n\nHigh score - 200 (not out)\n\nAverage - 44.7\n\n100s - 16\n\n50s - 39\n\nONE DAY INTERNATIONALS:\n\nMatches - 82\n\nInnings - 77\n\nRuns - 2380\n\nHigh score - 89\n\nAverage - 37\n\n100s - 0\n\n50s - 31\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWeeks later, on a bad-tempered tour of Sri Lanka, Thorpe brilliantly kept Muralitharan at bay, scoring 59 and 46 in the series-levelling win at Kandy, then 113 and 32 - both unbeaten - as England won the decider in Colombo. Wisden said the century 'confirmed his arrival as a world-class batsman, as prepared to counter-attack as dig in, composed against pace or spin'. Without him, Atherton's team might have lost 3-0.\n\nThere were more highlights to come, including an unbeaten double-hundred at Christchurch, before - approaching the age of 36 - he was dropped ahead of the 2005 Ashes. Kevin Pietersen had arrived on the scene, and England wanted to bed in Ian Bell.\n\nThe final few years of Thorpe's career combined skill and suffering in almost equal measure. Late in 2001, he left a tour of India because his marriage to Nicky was disintegrating.\n\nA comeback at home to India in 2002 ended quickly, for the same reason. Atherton later noted that 'of all the players I played with, he was the one whose state of mind most affected his play'.\n\nA bitter divorce followed in 2003, and formed the bulk of his 2005 autobiography Rising from the Ashes. It was not a light read. He spoke openly of the solace he sought in drink; friends feared his England career was over. But the separation helped clear his mind for a final flourish.\n\nThorpe made 124 on his comeback to set up a raucous series-levelling win against South Africa at The Oval, his home ground, and in 2004 produced the year of his life under the leadership of Michael Vaughan: 951 runs at an average of 73, with four centuries. Soon after, he went out somewhere close to the top. Only 14 men made more Test runs for England.\n\nThe left-hander, pictured here playing against Pakistan in 2000, was a key man for years\n\nThorpe was open about the struggles he faced when he split from his wife Nicky (left)\n\nThorpe and Joe Root together, after England's stunning World Cup final victory over New Zealand at Lord's back in 2019\n\nThorpe took over as Afghanistan head coach following his England departure before falling seriously ill\n\nAs Stewart, his long-time England and Surrey colleague, put it, Thorpe was 'so good he could get a hundred with his eyes shut at county level'.\n\nA career in coaching followed. He was appointed England's lead batting coach in 2010, and worked with the team until he was among those sacked after the 4-0 defeat in Australia in 2022.\n\nHe had long since remarried, to Amanda, and two years ago appeared set for the next stage of his life as head coach of Afghanistan when he was taken ill. Instead, the game is mourning one of the most watchable batsmen of the last 30 years.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

In a statement, chairman Oli Slipper described him as one of Surrey's \"great sons\".\n\n\"He is a Surrey legend and brought great pride to the club by wearing both the Three Feathers and the Three Lions,\" the statement continued.\n\n'He has made an extraordinary contribution to the club as a cricketer and as a person and we will miss him immensely.'\n\nThe left-handed batsman was known as one of the best English players in recent history, playing exactly 100 Tests and scoring 16 centuries before retiring in 2005.\n\nDuring his playing career, Thorpe averaged an impressive 44.7 runs in Test matches. His highest score was 200 not out and the talented middle-order batsmen also played 77 One Day Internationals.\n\nOne of his most memorable Test innings came against Pakistan in Karachi in 2000. After imploding on the hosts' final day, Thorpe produced an unbeaten 64 in near darkness towards the end of his innings to lead England to their first series win in Pakistan in 39 years, and Pakistan's first loss at the National Stadium in 35 years.\n\n\"I think literally five to ten minutes after we got on the field it was pitch black,\" Thorpe told Cricket Monthly. \"From the dressing room, when we got back on the balcony, it was pitch black.\n\n\"We opened bottles of lemonade because in Pakistan we weren't allowed to drink. That night we were on a flight back to Dubai, where we had a few Guinnesses. There was about two hours between the end of the game, back to the hotel and a flight that night.\"\n\nThorpe scored over 2,000 runs in the shorter format of the game and his intelligence and leadership ensured he made a smooth transition into coaching when he retired from football in 2006.\n\nHe began his coaching career in Australia, working with players such as Steve Smith and David Warner at New South Wales, before joining the England and Wales Cricket Board as a batting coach.\n\nHe worked as a first-team assistant under Trevor Bayliss and Chris Silverwood and led the team in the Sydney Test against Australia this winter due to Silverwood being diagnosed with coronavirus.\n\nThe ECB also released a statement following the shocking news of Thorpe's death. A message from the agency on X read: 'It is with great sadness that we share the news that Graham Thorpe, MBE, has passed away.

They were the twin pillars of all his finest innings, including an unbeaten 64 that he made to secure the \"win in the dark\" over Pakistan at Karachi in 2000, one of England's greatest victories overseas.\n\nThorpe often saved his best for a crisis, and this was one. Pakistan had never lost a Test match in that city, so tried everything to frustrate their opponents, including cynical time-wasting on the final afternoon. But the left-handed Thorpe kept his calm amid the squabbles and procrastinations, and with a sure but deft touch saw England home long after the city's crows had returned to roost.\n\nAt the time Thorpe, who has died suddenly aged 55, made light of the challenge, not least of being able to see a small red ball in near darkness, the use of floodlights not being standard back then. \"It was like playing for Wrecclesham in the Flora Doris Trophy,\" he said afterwards, referring to an evening league in Surrey in which he had played as a teenager and where car headlights would sometimes illuminate the final overs.\n\nOnly 17 male cricketers have so far won 100 Test caps for England, and Thorpe, who made his 100th and final appearance against Bangladesh in 2005, was probably the least well known of them - which is probably how he liked it. Yet it should not, perhaps, have been that way, as he was arguably England's best batter between David Gower and Kevin Pietersen, if very different from both in style and approach.\n\nResolute rather than flash, Thorpe valued dependability over artistry, which made him a popular teammate. Like another great left-hander, the Australian Allan Border, he had a stout defence with a few trusty shots that he stuck with. Not for him the thrill of the high-tariff switch hit or scoop.\n\nHe could be fiery, emotionally, with a tendency to brood over matters that others would let go - and he had several running spats with journalists. On one occasion he refused to conduct a press conference until one writer he had taken issue with had left the room. Yet, with bat in hand his focus was absolute and nothing could distract him.\n\nMichael Vaughan was England captain for Thorpe's final Test. With the Ashes due to be contested a few weeks later, Vaughan wanted players unscarred by previous encounters with Australia, who at that stage had held the Ashes for 16 years. So in came Pietersen and out went Thorpe, despite averaging 101 in his last three Tests. Vaughan backed bravado to trump experience, which it did when England won the series 2-1.\n\nTo reach 100 Test caps, in addition to the 82 Thorpe won for England's one-day team, demands a consistency of performance that separates the driven from the merely talented. Ever the thinker, Thorpe quickly worked out that if he was to thrive at international level he needed to be good against express pace and quality spin, two types of bowling not widely present in county cricket. He set his mind and practice regimes accordingly, even going as far as to deliberately roughen pitches in the nets so that they would turn, a habit that did not endear him to groundsmen.\n\nHis tally of 6,744 Test runs at an average of 44.66 with 16 hundreds suggests his plan succeeded. That, though, was just the cream of a fine career that also saw him clock up 17 years of county cricket for Surrey, with whom he won nine trophies, including three county championship titles.\n\nIt was against high calibre spin, on a pitch made to turn from the start, that Thorpe provided arguably his best Test contribution in 2001. He scored 113 and 32 against a strong Sri Lanka side that included Muttiah Muralitharan, the world record holder for Test wickets. In Colombo's sapping heat and humidity he was not dismissed in either innings as England scraped home by four wickets. To underline his brilliance, the next highest score from the 17 other England batters to reach the crease was 26. For sheer skill those innings compare favourably to Graham Gooch's unbeaten 154 against West Indies on a tricky pitch at Headingley in 1991.\n\nGraham was born in Farnham, Surrey, to Toni and her husband, Geoff. He attended Weydon school in Farnham, where he gained six O-levels before completing a PE diploma at Farnham college.\n\nHe turned out for Wrecclesham cricket club and then, with his father and brothers, Ian and Alan, for Farnham, where his mother did the scoring. He also played football for Farnham Town boys, alongside his soon-to-be Surrey teammate Martin Bicknell. A talented midfielder, he impressed enough to be picked for the England Schools Under-15 team, and reckoned he was the only player in the squad not to have already signed to an elite club such as Chelsea or Arsenal. As Bicknell put it: \"Growing up, Thorpey was simply the best cricketer and footballer in every age-group team.\"\n\nHe joined Surrey in 1988 as an 18-year-old, making his first-class debut against Leicestershire the same year. In that match he batted at eight and bowled second change (right-arm medium). His maiden wicket was Gower, a fellow left-hander whom he admired greatly. Thorpe might have developed into a proper all-rounder but persistent back problems saw his bowling slide from useful to occasional.\n\nHis organised, unfussy batting soon caught the eye of Keith Fletcher, Essex's former captain turned coach of the England A team, who insisted Thorpe be included on that team's 1990 tour to Kenya and Zimbabwe. A shrewd judge of a player, Fletcher saw his instincts borne out when three years later Thorpe made his Test debut against Australia at Trent Bridge in 1993.\n\nEngland fielded three other debutants that day - Mark Lathwell, Mark Ilott and Martin McCague - who went on to win 10 caps between them. Thorpe managed 10 times that many, making a hundred and winning the man-of-the-match award on his first outing.\n\nDespite that fine start against Australia, he never played in an Ashes winning team, unlike the players immediately after him. Over the span of his 100 caps England won 38 Tests and lost 29, drawing the remainder. He played under five England Test captains, including his friend Nasser Hussain.\n\nFollowing his retirement from cricket at the end of 2005 he began to coach, first with New South Wales in Australia and then Surrey 2nd XI. After that he became the national lead batting coach for the England and Wales Cricket Board, based at Loughborough, where his experience of top-level cricket, great knowledge about batting and communication skills made him a popular mentor. In 2006 he was appointed MBE for services to cricket. Later on he became England's batting coach, a role from which he was sacked in early 2022 after repeated batting failures saw England lose the Ashes 4-0.\n\nNot everyone found him an easygoing coach, as a young Ben Stokes discovered before he had played for England. Thorpe wanted a way, during practice, of curbing his charge's headstrong excesses without crushing his spirit. His ploy centred on making Stokes sell his wicket more dearly, which he achieved by making the player leave the net every time he got out. Stokes would then have to remove all his batting gear and put it on again before being allowed to resume. The penny soon dropped when Stokes spent most of his 20-minute slot buckling and unbuckling his pads.\n\nIn 1995 Thorpe married Nicola McDowell, with whom he had a son, Henry, and a daughter, Amelia. The marriage ended in divorce. With his second wife, Amanda (nee Duncan), he had a daughter, Emma, and a stepdaughter, Kitty. Amanda and his children survive him, as does his father.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

While operating in the full glare of international sport, Thorpe struggled with depression, divorce and drinking, culminating in a tumultuous winter in 2002 that saw him walk away from the game at what could have been his peak.\n\nAs he poignantly wrote in his autobiography, Rising from the Ashes: \"There came a time when I would have given back all my Test runs and Test caps just to be happy again.\"\n\nThere would be a celebratory second act with England, featuring an emotional comeback century at his lifelong home ground of the Oval, and a third when he became a key figure in the international coaching set-up.\n\nGraham Thorpe in action for Surrey (Steve Parkin/PA).\n\nHe is survived by wife Amanda and four children, Henry, Amelia, Kitty and Emma.\n\nBorn on August 1, 1969 in the market town of Farnham, little more than an hour from The Oval, Thorpe was ahead of his years on a cricket pitch and remembered being drafted by local side Wrecclesham's Under-17s while still only eight years old.\n\nAlthough he would have to wait to get a bat in his hands, he recalled taking a catch - an early indicator of the safe hands that would make him a regular in the slip cordon and bring over 600 professional catches.\n\nHe was spotted early by Surrey, who picked him up as an under-11 and never let him go, even when Brentford Football Club came calling with the offer of trials.\n\nDespite showing enough promise to be selected by England Schools as a ball-playing link between defence and midfield, Thorpe would go on to choose the summer sport and later became one of the country's most accomplished players of spin. Once a sweeper, always a sweeper.\n\nGraham Thorpe (second left, front row) ahead of his England Test debut against Australia at Trent Bridge (David Jones/PA).\n\nThorpe would go on to become England's best left-handed batter since David Gower and enjoyed an unlikely torch-passing moment on his first-class debut against Leicestershire when he took Gower's wicket with his soon-to-be phased out medium-pacers.\n\nHe was a regular feature on the nascent England 'A' circuit for four years before finally graduating to the senior side, initially in one-day internationals and then, unforgettably, the Test arena.\n\nSelected at Trent Bridge for the third match of the 1993 Ashes and dismissed by the combative Merv Hughes in the first innings, he struck an undefeated 114 in the second to become England's first debutant centurion since Frank Hayes 20 years earlier.\n\nHe was one of four players to receive his cap in Nottingham and, while he would stick around for another 99, Mark Lathwell, Mark Ilott and Martin McCague managed a total of 10 appearances. Few stayed the course as long as Thorpe, but fewer still had such an ironclad claim.\n\nAlthough his conversion rate between 50 and 100 left room for improvement - he could and should have retired with considerably more than 16 tons - his quality brooked no argument.\n\nGraham Thorpe celebrates a century against the West Indies in Barbados (Rebecca Naden/PA).\n\nThere was a first overseas century on the notoriously menacing Gabba pitch in Perth, another in Barbados against the might of Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh and a heroic 64 not out in the fading light of Karachi to seal England's first series win in Pakistan for 39 years.\n\nBut the demands of touring and a faltering marriage to first wife Nicky, played out in excruciating detail through the newspapers, saw him retire from ODIs in 2002 before committing, then withdrawing, from that winter's tour of Australia.\n\nHe was able to find enough peace to regain his place for the final Test against South Africa, greeted as a returning hero as he made 124 in front of an adoring South London crowd.\n\nThorpe's final act as a player did not extend as far as the fabled 2005 Ashes - he was dropped for the series in favour of Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen and retired thereafter - but by then he had already become just the eighth Englishman to reach 100 Test caps, securing a proud legacy along the way.\n\nGraham Thorpe talks with Joe Root during the 2021/22 Ashes (Jason O\u00b4Brien/PA).\n\nHe stayed in the game with a move to New South Wales, where he worked with a young Steve Smith and David Warner, and returned to work with England between 2010 and 2022.\n\nThorpe took charge of his country in the familiar surroundings of the Sydney Cricket Ground after Chris Silverwood was laid low by coronavirus, securing a nailbiting draw to avoid a seemingly inevitable whitewash.\n\nHis final act with the team was to film an early hours get together between the two sides that ended with a call to the police and was leaked to the media.\n\nIt was a reminder that, in addition to being brilliant with bat in hand, Thorpe had always been one of England's most reassuringly human athletes.", "source": {"uri":

Thorpe was admitted to hospital in 2022 having fallen seriously ill at the time with the prognosis unclear at that stage. England & Wales Cricket Boar (ECB) and Surrey Cricket confirmed the tragic news in an official statement.\n\nThe left-handed batter played 182 times for England across Tests and ODI's in a 13-year international career (100 Tests & 82ODIs). Thorpe also served as batting coach for England's senior men's team. During his playing career, the Farnham-born cricketer scored 6744 Test runs, with 16 hundreds at an average of 44.66. He also capped 82 times in the one-day internationals, accumulating 2380 runs, with 21 half centuries.\n\nThorpe has played many knocks over the years, and here we take a look at the five most prominent test innings played by the southpaw.\n\n#5. 114 vs Australia, Nottingham, July 1995\n\nThorpe made his international debut against Australia in the third test of the Ashes at Trent Bridge in July 1993. Although the left-handed batsman was dismissed for a low score in the first innings, he came back to score an unbeaten 114 of 280 balls in the second innings, hitting 11 boundaries. He became England's first debut centurion since Frank Hayes 20 years earlier.\n\n#4. 124 vs South Africa, The Oval, September 2003\n\nAfter taking an indefinite break from cricket due to personal reasons in 2002, Thorpe returned to the England side for the final Test of the summer at the Oval in 2003. He scored 124 runs in the first innings. In a composed stile, he punched the air after reaching the three figures. That innings marked the start of a resurgence for Thorpe in the later years of his career.\n\n#3. 138 vs Pakistan, Manchester, May 2001\n\nIn the second test against Pakistan in 2001, Thorpe came into the crease early on after both the opener's were dismissed by the pace duo of Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram. However, hinge along with Michael Vaughan stitched together a partnership of more than 200 runs, before be run out by Akram. Thorpe made 138 runs, including 17 boundaries and a maximum.\n\n#2. 138 vs Australia, Birmingham, June 1997\n\nThe first test of the 1997 Ashes series saw Australian batting unit folded for a paltry 118. In response, England's top three were dismissed for a combined total of just 36 runs. But Thorpe (138) along with Nasser Hussain (207) helped the three Lions secure an immense lead of 380 runs before declaring. England went on to win the match by 9 wickets.\n\n#1. 200 vs New Zealand, Christchurch, March 2002\n\nThorpe's highest Test score came in 2002 when he was the man of the match in England's first Test against New Zealand in Christchurch. This came at an unusually quick rate of 231 balls and the second innings knock helped the The Three Lions set up a 98-run win over the Blackcaps.", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com",

Apart from representing Surrey in the domestic circuit from 1988 to 2005, he also played 82 One-Day Internationals (ODIs) for England, amassing 2,380 runs at an average of 37.18, including 21 half-centuries, as per IANS.\n\n\"Heartbreaking to see Thorpey has passed away.

Thorpe was appointed batting coach in 2013 for the senior England men's white-ball squad, which went on to win the 2019 ODI World Cup in their own country.\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, Thorpe assisted Chris Silverwood as an assistant coach and even filled in as temporary head coach for England's Twenty20 international series against Pakistan. Thrope was fired from his position after England lost the Ashes 0-4. In March 2022, he was named Afghanistan's new head coach, but he became gravely ill and was unable to accept the position.\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) expressed their profound sorrow over his unexpected passing.\n\nReuters\n\n\"There seem to be no appropriate words to describe the deep shock we feel at Graham's death,\" the ECB remarked, honoring his legacy both as a player and a coach.\n\nThorpe, renowned for his skillful batting, played 100 Test matches for England between 1993 and 2005, amassing 6,744 runs with an average of 44.66, and notching up 16 centuries. His prowess extended to 82 one-day internationals.\n\nPost-retirement in 2005, Thorpe had an influential stint in coaching, contributing significantly to England's cricket until 2022. His eventual plans to coach the Afghanistan national team were curtailed owing to undisclosed illness.\n\nBefore his passing, Thorpe had commended Indian cricket star Virat Kohli, calling him \"one of the best.\" His praise came in the lead-up to the 2021 England tour of India, a critical series for both teams with implications for the World Test Championship final.\n\n\"We know that he is a fantastic player and he has shown that for many years now. Virat is in one of that batting orders which understands home conditions very well,\" Thorpe had stated.\n\nTIL\n\nThe series began with England clinching the opening match in Chennai, but India quickly turned the tables to win the subsequent three games, thus securing a spot in the WTC finals. Despite Kohli's total of 172 runs across the series and an average of 28.67, the spotlight also fell on the controversial pitch conditions, sparking widespread debates.\n\nNews of Thorpe's demise prompted an outpouring of tributes from across the cricket community, including a heartfelt post by England's Test captain Ben Stokes.\n\nThe sentiment of loss was also strongly felt on Reddit, particularly in the r/Cricket subreddit, where fans expressed their shock and sadness.\n\nAlso Read: 'How hopeless can someone be?': Redditors vent frustration over Sanju Samson's T20I struggles\n\nOne user reminisced, \"My favourite player growing up in the 90s/00s.

Here we look back at his career.\n\nIn an era of English cricket often remembered for its struggles, Graham Thorpe stood out as a beacon of talent and class. The 90s might be a decade most England fans would rather forget if it weren't for the emergence of Thorpe.\n\nThe Surrey talent, burst onto the scene in 1993 with an Ashes century on his Test debut and retired 12 years later with a hundred caps to his name. His longevity was remarkable during a time when team selection seemed haphazard at best. The left-hander played various roles throughout his career at the top level.\n\nRead more: 'Deep shock' as ex-England cricket legend 'one of best batters of generation' dies at age of 55\n\nRead more: Man in his 20s killed and another in serious condition after crash\n\nFrom being a stylish newcomer to becoming a seasoned veteran, Thorpe, who has sadly passed away at the age of 55, proved himself a consistently elite performer amidst frequent chaos and collapse. During a time when Australia's dominance was unyielding, Thorpe's average against the Baggy Greens exceeded his career average (45.74 against 44.66), demonstrating his ability to rise to the occasion.\n\nOff the pitch, he faced even greater battles. While under the intense scrutiny of international sport, Thorpe grappled with depression, divorce, and alcoholism, leading to a turbulent winter in 2002 that saw him step back from cricket at what could have been his prime.\n\nAs he movingly penned in his autobiography, Rising from the Ashes: \"There came a time when I would have given back all my Test runs and Test caps just to be happy again.\" There was a triumphant second act with England, featuring a poignant comeback century at his lifelong home ground of the Oval, and a third when he became an integral part of the international coaching set-up.\n\nHe leaves behind his wife Amanda and four children, Henry, Amelia, Kitty and Emma. Born on August 1, 1969 in the market town of Farnham, Thorpe was a cricket prodigy. He recalls being drafted by local side Wrecclesham's Under-17s while still only eight years old.\n\nAlthough he had to wait to get a bat in his hands, he remembered taking a catch an early sign of the safe hands that would make him a regular in the slip cordon and bring over 600 professional catches. Surrey spotted him early, picking him up as an under-11 and never letting him go, even when Brentford Football Club came calling with the offer of trials.\n\nDespite showing enough promise to be selected by England Schools as a ball-playing link between defence and midfield, Thorpe chose cricket and later became one of the country's most skilled players of spin. Once a sweeper, always a sweeper.\n\nThorpe went on to become England's best left-handed batter since David Gower and enjoyed an unlikely torch-passing moment on his first-class debut against Leicestershire when he took Gower's wicket with his soon-to-be phased out medium-pacers.\n\nHe was a staple on the emerging England 'A' circuit for four years before finally making his way to the senior side, initially in one-day internationals and then, memorably, the Test arena. Chosen at Trent Bridge for the third match of the 1993 Ashes and dismissed by the feisty Merv Hughes in the first innings, he scored an unbeaten 114 in the second to become England's first debutant centurion since Frank Hayes 20 years prior.\n\nHe was one of four players to receive his cap in Nottingham and, while he would go on to make another 99 appearances, Mark Lathwell, Mark Ilott and Martin McCague managed a total of 10 appearances. Few lasted as long as Thorpe, but even fewer had such a solid claim.\n\nAlthough his conversion rate from 50 to 100 could have been better he could and should have retired with significantly more than 16 tons his quality was undeniable. There was a first overseas century on the notoriously intimidating Gabba pitch in Perth, another in Barbados against the formidable Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh and a heroic 64 not out in the fading light of Karachi to secure England's first series win in Pakistan for 39 years.\n\nHowever, the pressures of touring and a failing marriage to his first wife Nicky, which was painfully publicised through the newspapers, led him to retire from ODIs in 2002 before committing, then withdrawing, from that winter's tour of Australia. He managed to find enough tranquillity to reclaim his spot for the final Test against South Africa, where he was hailed as a hero upon his return, scoring 124 in front of a devoted crowd in South London.\n\nThorpe's last performance as a player didn't reach the legendary 2005 Ashes he was replaced by Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen for the series and subsequently retired but by that point, he had already joined the exclusive club of just eight Englishmen to earn 100 Test caps, leaving behind a proud legacy.\n\nHe remained involved in cricket with a move to New South Wales, where he mentored young talents like Steve Smith and David Warner, before returning to work with England from 2010 to 2022. When Chris Silverwood was sidelined by coronavirus, Thorpe stepped up to lead his country at the familiar Sydney Cricket Ground, managing to secure a thrilling draw to prevent what seemed like an inevitable whitewash.\n\nHis last act with the team involved filming an early morning gathering between the two sides, which ended with a call to the police and subsequent media leak. This served as a reminder that, aside from his exceptional batting skills, Thorpe has always been one of England's most relatable human athletes.\n\nGet more news from SurreyLive straight to your

Only the genius of TV cameras allowed us to see what was going on, but that was a good example of his grit, determination and will to win.\n\n\"He was very talented and what bears that out are his figures against all comers.\n\n\"His first innings was a hundred against Australia in the Ashes at Trent Bridge in 93. So, he took his chance very quickly, established himself very quickly and then showed how good he was in all conditions.\"\n\nShaun Udal played alongside Thorpe for England, but also remembered the excitement which surrounded the left-handed batter during his junior years.\n\nThorpe spent 17 years with Surrey as a player and returned to the club as batting coach in 2008 before his various coaching roles with England.\n\n\"He was such a tenacious, talented and determined cricketer. Even coming up through the age groups at 10 or 11, he was always the star man,\" former Hampshire and England spinner Udal remembered.\n\n\"As a player, he was undoubtedly one of the best we have produced, against all oppositions, in all circumstances and in all conditions.\n\n\"A hundred on debut against Australia, it is just such a shame, but he was a fantastic player and fantastic cricketer.\n\n\"He is one of the best we've ever produced and his stats stand up against the best. If you were in a crisis, he was the man you wanted to be batting at four or five. Whether it be on a turning pitch in Sri Lanka or a fast, bouncy one in Australia, he was your man.\n\n\"He was so determined to do well for his country and was a lovely man, very kind-hearted and generous with his time.\"\n\nMichael Vaughan also shared a dressing room with Thorpe, and the former England skipper wrote on X: \"RIP Thorpey.\n\n\"Thanks for all the advice throughout my career, you were a great player and a brilliant team-mate.

In a statement, chair Oli Slipper described him as one of Surrey's 'great sons'.\n\n'He is a legend of Surrey and brought great pride to the Club wearing both the Three Feathers and the Three Lions.' The statement continued.\n\n'He made outstanding contributions to the Club as a cricketer, and as a man, and he will be so sorely missed.'\n\nThe left-handed batsman was renowned as one of the finest English players in recent history. He played exactly 100 Tests and scored 16 centuries before retiring in 2005.\n\nDuring his playing career, Thorpe averaged an impressive 44.7 runs in Test matches. His highest score was 200 not out and the talented middle-order batsmen also played 77 One Day Internationals.\n\nOne of his most memorable Test innings came in 2000 against Pakistan in Karachi. After a final day implosion from the hosts, Thorpe produced an unbeaten 64 in near darkness towards the end of his innings to lead England to their first series win in Pakistan for 39 years, and Pakistan's first loss at the National Stadium in 35 years.\n\n'I think literally five to ten minutes after we came off, it was pitch black,' Thorpe told Cricket Monthly . 'From the dressing room, coming back on to the balcony, it was pitch black.\n\n'We opened up bottles of lemonade, because we couldn't drink in Pakistan. We were on a flight back to Dubai that evening, where we did have a few Guinnesses. There was about a two-hour turnaround from the end of the game, back to the hotel and on to a flight that night.'\n\nThorpe racked up more than 2,000 runs in the shorter format of the game and his

Thorpe, who mostly batted in the middle order for the English team at the highest level, made his international debut against arch-rivals Australia during an ODI match in Manchester on May 19, 1993.\n\nHe played a total of 82 50-over matches for the English team and scored 2380 runs in 77 innings. He was part of the English team that participated in the 1996 and 1999 ODI World Cups. His last ODI appearance for the Three Lions was against Sri Lanka at Headingley in Leeds during the famous Natwest series in 2002, which India won under Sourav Ganguly's leadership.\n\nDuring his nine-year-long ODI career, Thorpe scored 21 half-centuries for England but was never able to reach the triple-figure mark. The unfortunate feat, however, helped him create a batting record for England, which is still in tact after 22 years.\n\nBy not being able to score a century in his ODI career, Thorpe tops the list of batters with the most runs in ODIs for England without a hundred. Legendary Ian Botham is second on the list with 2113 runs in 116 ODIs and is followed by former England Ashes winning captain Michael Vaughan, who finished his career with 1982 runs in 86 matches.\n\nThorpe made his Test debut for England under Graham Gooch's leadership during the 1993 Ashes series against Allan Border-led Australia. He was included in the playing XI for the third Test, which was played in Nottingham from July 1 to 5. Thorpe came out to bat No. 6 in the first inning but was only able to score six runs from 13 balls. However, in the second inning, he showed his class by remaining unbeaten on 114 runs from 280 balls.\n\nDuring his 12-year-long Test career, Thorpe played 100 Tests and scored 6744 runs. He smashed 16 centuries and 39 fifties in 179 innings. His last red-ball match for the English team was against Bangladesh at Chester-le-Street in June 2005. He remained unbeaten on 66 runs from 85 balls in the first inning of the match, which the Michael Vaughan-led side won by a margin of an inning and 27 runs.\n\nAfter retiring from international cricket, Thorpe became the batting coach of England's white-ball teams in 2013. He also served as England's interim head coach during the T20I series against Pakistan in 2020 and during the fourth Test of the 2021-22 Ashes series in Australia. He was dismissed from his role after England's 0-4 defeat.\n\nHe was named as Afghanistan's head coach in March 2022 but fell seriously ill before beginning the role.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com",

Yet what he helped to achieve for subsequent England cricketers off the field was no less important than what he did on it.\n\nIn the 1990s, when Thorpe emerged from Surrey's team, the attitude of the England powers-that-be was feudal. The Test and County Cricket Board was the body in charge, now the England and Wales Cricket Board, and their attitude was simple: we are the masters and you, the players, are the servants. Duty of care did not exist then. The ECB deserves credit for subsequently upping its game, and the Professional Cricketers' Association too.\n\nPlayers were not allowed to take their wives, partners or children on some England tours: for instance the tours of both Zimbabwe and New Zealand in 1996-97. On that tour, when John Barclay was the tour manager and Mike Atherton the captain, the players were forbidden to see their loved ones from late November, through Christmas and New Year in Harare, and through their warm-up games and three-Test series and one-day internationals in New Zealand, until they finished there in early March. \"England spent a dreary Christmas minus their families (another poor decision by the tour planners),\" Wisden noted succinctly.\n\nHow were the players expected to have any emotional life or mental health? The answer is they weren't. And Thorpe was the most vocal in resenting this oppression, which had to be done behind the scenes otherwise the players would have lost their England places. Typically he would worry away at his bat-handle and rubber-grips and tell you about his emotional upheavals.\n\nHe protested publicly, too, at the way the England players were treated. Before the start of the 1999 World Cup in England, he refused to attend a team function in Canterbury. The professionalism with which England organised that World Cup can be judged from the fact that the international teams director, Simon Pack, flew out to Brisbane to negotiate with the England captain Alec Stewart on the afternoon before the first Test. The capacity for empathy with England cricketers was non-existent.\n\nWisden does not chronicle such statistics but it is a safe generalisation that the marriages of most players in that era ended in divorce. From the time that Duncan Fletcher took over as head coach in 1999, and cared about his players, the marriages of most England cricketers did not end in divorce.\n\nGiven this background it is no surprise that Thorpe's private life was so entangled. In his autobiography he summarised it: \"When I look back to how things were a few years ago - after I'd tried to retire from the game and was cracking up, refusing to go out, getting paranoiac, desperately missing my children, battered by journalists and bills from the divorce lawyers... it seems incredible that things turned round the way they did, both in my personal life and in cricket.\"\n\nAs a cricketer Thorpe first made his name as a right-arm medium-pacer for Surrey. He was naturally right-handed, but decided to bat left-handed for his Farnham club. He rose through the ranks swiftly, and later told me what had completed his readiness for Test cricket: he had learned how to play pace on the England A tour of the West Indies in 1992-93, when Courtney Walsh and Kenny Benjamin were steaming in, and how to play spin on a turning pitch at the outground of Southend, when Essex's John Childs and Peter Such were ripping it. And he became a complete Test batsman.\n\nHis finest tour was that of Sri Lanka in 2000-01, and arguably the finest of his 100 Tests came in Colombo. The three-match series stood at 1-1; the pitch for the third game was, not unexpectedly, prepared with Muttiah Muralitharan, Sri Lanka's world record-breaking off-spinner, mind. Thorpe was man of the match, being a master at working spinners for ones and twos, scoring an unbeaten 113 out of 249 when no other England player reached 30, and in such humidity that he spent that night on a drip in hospital.\n\nHe was not finished there, either. England were set only 74 but the pitch was nearly what was called a minefield. Muralitharan and Sanath Jayasuriya, Sri Lanka's spinners, fired the ball through the dusty surface. England, so near a prestigious prize, because Sri Lanka were so hard to beat at home, promptly collapsed - or rather everyone except Thorpe. Nobody else could manage 14 runs. Thorpe, not fully rehydrated, was padded up and sent out and scored an unbeaten 32 to carry England over the line by four wickets.\n\nHe missed the England tours of South Africa in 1999-2000 and of Australia in 2002-03 for personal reasons, his first marriage ending during the latter tour. England were lucky that new, more enlightened, less medieval men took charge: in 2003 Thorpe came back, with a century against South Africa at the Oval, and more fine batting which saw him averaging 56 in the last stage of his career. His final two Tests came at the start of the 2005 season against Bangladesh, after which Kevin Pietersen replaced him at number five against Australia.\n\nUnderstanding so much about the vicissitudes of batting and life, Thorpe made a fine academy coach at Loughborough, then as the England batting coach. After he had been dismissed from that job, following the 4-0 series defeat in Australia, he had signed up for one scarcely less arduous, as coach of Afghanistan. Tough, durable, defiant, the Afghans would have recognised a man of similar qualities.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [],

While operating in the full glare of international sport, Thorpe struggled with depression, divorce and drinking, culminating in a tumultuous winter in 2002 that saw him walk away from the game at what could have been his peak.\n\nAs he poignantly wrote in his autobiography, Rising from the Ashes: \"There came a time when I would have given back all my Test runs and Test caps just to be happy again.\"\n\nThere would be a celebratory second act with England, featuring an emotional comeback century at his lifelong home ground of the Oval, and a third when he became a key figure in the international coaching set-up.\n\nHe is survived by wife Amanda and four children, Henry, Amelia, Kitty and Emma.\n\nBorn on August 1, 1969 in the market town of Farnham, little more than an hour from The Oval, Thorpe was ahead of his years on a cricket pitch and remembered being drafted by local side Wrecclesham's Under-17s while still only eight years old.\n\nAlthough he would have to wait to get a bat in his hands, he recalled taking a catch - an early indicator of the safe hands that would make him a regular in the slip cordon and bring over 600 professional catches.\n\nHe was spotted early by Surrey, who picked him up as an under-11 and never let him go, even when Brentford Football Club came calling with the offer of trials.\n\nDespite showing enough promise to be selected by England Schools as a ball-playing link between defence and midfield, Thorpe would go on to choose the summer sport and later became one of the country's most accomplished players of spin. Once a sweeper, always a sweeper.\n\nThorpe would go on to become England's best left-handed batter since David Gower and enjoyed an unlikely torch-passing moment on his first-class debut against Leicestershire when he took Gower's wicket with his soon-to-be phased out medium-pacers.\n\nHe was a regular feature on the nascent England 'A' circuit for four years before finally graduating to the senior side, initially in one-day internationals and then, unforgettably, the Test arena.\n\nSelected at Trent Bridge for the third match of the 1993 Ashes and dismissed by the combative Merv Hughes in the first innings, he struck an undefeated 114 in the second to become England's first debutant centurion since Frank Hayes 20 years earlier.\n\nHe was one of four players to receive his cap in Nottingham and, while he would stick around for another 99, Mark Lathwell, Mark Ilott and Martin McCague managed a total of 10 appearances. Few stayed the course as long as Thorpe, but fewer still had such an ironclad claim.\n\nAlthough his conversion rate between 50 and 100 left room for improvement - he could and should have retired with considerably more than 16 tons - his quality brooked no argument.\n\nThere was a first overseas century on the notoriously menacing Gabba pitch in Perth, another in Barbados against the might of Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh and a heroic 64 not out in the fading light of Karachi to seal England's first series win in Pakistan for 39 years.\n\nBut the demands of touring and a faltering marriage to first wife Nicky, played out in excruciating detail through the newspapers, saw him retire from ODIs in 2002 before committing, then withdrawing, from that winter's tour of Australia.\n\nHe was able to find enough peace to regain his place for the final Test against South Africa, greeted as a returning hero as he made 124 in front of an adoring South London crowd.\n\nThorpe's final act as a player did not extend as far as the fabled 2005 Ashes - he was dropped for the series in favour of Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen and retired thereafter - but by then he had already become just the eighth Englishman to reach 100 Test caps, securing a proud legacy along the way.\n\nHe stayed in the game with a move to New South Wales, where he worked with a young Steve Smith and David Warner, and returned to work with England between 2010 and 2022.\n\nThorpe took charge of his country in the familiar surroundings of the Sydney Cricket Ground after Chris Silverwood was laid low by coronavirus, securing a nailbiting draw to avoid a seemingly inevitable whitewash.\n\nHis final act with the team was to film an early hours get together between the two sides that ended with a call to the police and was leaked to the media.\n\nIt was a reminder that, in addition to being brilliant with bat in hand, Thorpe had always been one of England's most

The match was drawn and Thorpe scored an unbeaten 114 in the second innings, becoming the first England player to notch a century on his debut since Frank Hayes against the West Indies in", "source": {"uri": "thetimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "thetimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Thorpe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graham Thorpe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ashes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Ashes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Gatting", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Gatting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Warne", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shane Warne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Hayes_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank Hayes (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leg spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Bridge", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Bridge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Ftimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2Fa2b05818-0efa-4a2e-8069-683bf80ac1f8.jpg?crop=1802%2C1014%2C0%2C101&resize=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790854", "eventUri": "eng-9790854", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

The chances of India taking the honours in this Test seemed minimal. They had just been beaten in a little over two days by Derbyshire, and a downbeat Azharuddin viewed the Lord's pitch with a great deal of suspicion. Sourav Ganguly made a century on debut and Rahul Dravid fell short of his hundred by just one scoring stroke. Had Dravid succeeded, it would have been the first instance of two debutant centurions in the same team in Test history. Only two Test newcomers (Harry Graham of Australia in 1893 and John Hampshire of England in 1969) had previously attained this distinction at the game's HQ. The match also marked the final Test appearance of celebrated umpire Dickie Bird. On opening morning, ruled the England captain out lbw in the very first over, and made his last decision, in his 66th Test, when he gave Russell - the Man of the Match - out leg-before in the final session.\n\nThe lefthander who played in that match is shockingly no more. Some time back he was in news for wrong reasons following an early-hours drinking session with players from both teams in which he smoked a cigar inside the team hotel and triggered the arrival of the Tasmanian police. The man then 52 was the subject of a complaint at the Crowne Plaza in Hobart at 6am. It came to light only after he filmed four police officers shutting down a post-series social with Joe Root, the England captain, and Jimmy Anderson, as well as Australia's Nathan Lyon, Alex Carey and Travis Head.\n\nGraham Thorpe, the former England batter, was reported \"seriously ill\" in hospital, a couple of years back according to the Professional Cricketers' Association and is now no more.\n\nGraham Thorpe, played 100 Tests for England between 1993 and 2005, averaging 44.66 with 16 centuries. He was later head coach of Afghanistan following a decade of involvement within England's coaching set-up, which came to an end after this winter's 4-0 Ashes loss in Australia. After a century on debut against Australia at Trent Bridge, Thorpe soon established himself as one of the central figures of England's Test team in the mid-1990s and early 2000s, with his selfless counterattacking style helping the team to emerge from the doldrums to become, by the time of his final Test against Bangladesh in June 2005, a side ready to compete on an equal footing with Ricky Ponting's Australia in that summer's legendary Ashes series.\n\nThorpe's own zenith came in the winter of 2000-01, when he was instrumental in England's back-to-back series wins in Pakistan and Sri Lanka - to this day one of the team's finest achievements.", "source": {"uri": "en.paperblog.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Paperblog"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

During an illustrious career, Thorpe notched up 100 Test caps and carved out a reputation for his batting prowess, notably with a splendid double century against New Zealand in 2002.\n\nHis lengthy service was majorly with Surrey, where he represented his home county across 15 years. Post-retirement, his expertise was channelled into coaching and commentary roles.\n\nThe cricket world learned of Thorpe's health woes back in 2022, when the Professional Cricketers' Association asked for privacy on behalf of Thorpe's family: \"Graham Thorpe has recently fallen seriously ill and is currently in hospital receiving treatment,\" they stated publicly.\n\nUncertain about his outlook at the time, the PCA beseeched: \"His prognosis is unclear at this stage and we ask for privacy for him and his family at this time. Our thoughts are with Graham and his family.\"\n\nThe floodgates have opened with heartfelt tributes pouring in for Thorpe, who had been on the brink of coaching Afghanistan in 2022 until illness struck. Figures from Surrey CCC and erstwhile teammates have been particularly vocal in their respects.\n\nOli Slipper, chair of Surrey CCC, expressed the club's deep sorrow: \"Graham is one of the great sons of Surrey and there is an overwhelming sadness that he will not walk through the gates of the Oval again. He is a legend of Surrey and brought great pride to the club wearing both the Three Feathers and the Three Lions.\"\n\nSlipper continued, commemorating Thorpe's legacy: \"He made outstanding contributions to the club as a cricketer, and as a man, and he will be so sorely missed.\"\n\nAnnouncing Thorpe's passing, a statement from the ECB read: \"It is with great sadness that the ECB shares the news that Graham Thorpe, MBE, has passed away. There seem to be no appropriate words to describe the deep shock we feel at Graham's death.\n\n\"More than one of England's finest-ever batters, he was a beloved member of the cricket family and revered by fans all over the world. His skill was unquestioned, and his abilities and achievements across a 13-year international career brought so much happiness to his teammates and England and Surrey CCC supporters alike. Later, as a coach, he guided the best England Men's talent to some incredible victories across all formats of the game.\n\n\"Our thoughts are with his wife Amanda, his children, father Geoff, and all of his family and friends during this unimaginably difficult time. We will always remember Graham for his extraordinary contributions to the sport.\"\n\nEngland captain Ben Stokes and former skipper Michael Vaughan were among the players to post tributes. \"RIP Thorpey... Thanks for all the advice throughout my career,\" Vaughan wrote.\n\n\"You were a great player and a brilliant team-mate. You have gone far too young but you leave as an England cricket legend..

So, he took his chance very quickly, established himself very quickly and then showed how good he was in all conditions.\"\n\nShaun Udal played alongside Thorpe for England, but also remembered the excitement which surrounded the left-handed batter during his junior years.\n\nThorpe spent 17 years with Surrey as a player and returned to the club as batting coach in 2008 before his various coaching roles with England.\n\n\"He was such a tenacious, talented and determined cricketer. Even coming up through the age groups at 10 or 11, he was always the star man,\" former Hampshire and England spinner Udal remembered.\n\n\"As a player, he was undoubtedly one of the best we have produced, against all oppositions, in all circumstances and in all conditions.\n\n\"A hundred on debut against Australia, it is just such a shame, but he was a fantastic player and fantastic cricketer.\n\n\"He is one of the best we've ever produced and his stats stand up against the best. If you were in a crisis, he was the man you wanted to be batting at four or five. Whether it be on a turning pitch in Sri Lanka or a fast, bouncy one in Australia, he was your man.\n\n\"He was so determined to do well for his country and was a lovely man, very kind-hearted and generous with his time.\"\n\nMichael Vaughan also shared a dressingroom with Thorpe, and the former England skipper wrote on X: \"RIP Thorpey. Thanks for all the advice throughout my career, you were a great player and a brilliant team-mate. You have gone far too young but you leave as an England cricket legend.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Thorpe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graham Thorpe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Duckett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Duckett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Bridge", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Bridge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stokes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Stokes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Broad", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stuart Broad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Root", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Root"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_Udal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shaun Udal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gower", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Gower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ashes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Ashes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karachi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karachi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Vaughan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Vaughan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampshire_County_Cricket_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hampshire County Cricket Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/J4YVQHZOKORNP6CU36YPRX57YI.jpg?smart=true&auth=a07d0f7ecb3c1833b69a1b3d725867792e1171adbefa28d8cb64b57e7b27bcfa&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790854", "eventUri": "eng-9790854", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 460559912, "relevance": 2}

The Lola actress, born in January 1995, is the daughter of Nelson Peltz and Claudia Heffner Peltz. The billionaire investor and former model have been married for over 30 years and have seven other children together. During an interview with Byrdie in February 2024, Nicola opened up about how much she\u2019s inspired by her parent\u2019s marriage, as well as that of her husband Brooklyn Beckham\u2019s parents, David and Victoria Beckham. \u201cAnyone who has been married for a long time, it\u2019s such a beautiful thing,\u201d she said. \u201cMy parents have been together for maybe 40 years? And David and Victoria have been together since Brooklyn was a baby, which is like 25 years. My parents, their love inspires me every day. It sounds cheesy, but that\u2019s how I feel.\u201d Nicole also told the outlet how much she values her tight-knit relationship with her parents and that she often travels to their home in Florida to spend time with them and her siblings. \u201cFamily is everything to me, and I mean that with my whole heart,\u201d she said. \u201cI go to Florida any chance I get, and we stay at my parents\u2019 house. It honestly makes me so happy to wake up and have my siblings around. It\u2019s really hard to get us all in the same place because there are so many of us. When we\u2019re all together, it\u2019s so fun.\u201d So, who are Nicola Peltz Beckham\u2019s parents? Here\u2019s everything to know about Nelson Peltz and Claudia Heffner Peltz. Nelson and Claudia married in 1985 Nelson and Claudia tied the knot in 1985. While not much information is known about their nuptials, Nicola gave some insight into her parents\u2019 over 30-year relationship during a March 2023 interview with Cosmopolitan. \u201cMy parents have been together more than 40 years, and they always make fun of each other. My dad is just so cute. When my mom leaves the room, he\u2019s always just like, \u2018She\u2019s so beautiful,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cThey still act like young kids in love. Literally, they\u2019re always making out, to the point where my brother\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m closing my eyes. Stop making out.\u2019 They\u2019re so in love, and being able to grow up with that is so beautiful. I would never settle for anything other than that.\u201d They have eight children together Nelson and Claudia are the parents of eight children: Matthew, Will, Brad, Brittany, Diesel, Nicola, Zachary and Gregory. Nicola is the third youngest of her siblings, born on Jan. 9, 1995. The Peltz siblings have adopted a range of careers, from sports to interior design. However, Nicola isn\u2019t the only performer in her family. Her older brother Will is also a model and actor who has appeared in films like Sierra Burgess Is a Loser, In Time and Unfriended.

Nicola\u2019s two older brothers, Brad and Diesel, are in the tech industry.

Nelson is a billionaire investor Before building a business empire, Nelson was a student at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, per Business Insider. He eventually dropped out of college and started working for his family\u2019s food distribution company, where he helped expand the business. \u201cI just didn\u2019t get to class that much and, when I did get to class, I couldn\u2019t figure out when I was going to use accounting and finance and economics,\u201d Nelson said about dropping out of college in a lecture at the University of Miami in September 2023. \u201cI was way too immature to be in a place like that.\u201d In 2005, Nelson co-founded an investment firm, Trian Fund Management. He previously held seats on the board of directors of H.J. Heinz Company and Mondel\u0113z International, Inc., per Sysco. Since 2007, Nelson has been the non-executive chairman of Wendy\u2019s and also works as the company\u2019s director, per the brand.

They tried to convince Nicola not to act Nicola has starred in several hit TV shows and movies, including Bates Motel and Transformers: Age of Extinction, but her parents tried to dissuade her from becoming an actress. During an interview with Coveteur in September 2019, Nicola shared how she convinced her parents to let her act at a young age. \u201cI grew up playing ice hockey, and my dad really wanted me to focus on playing ice hockey, he thought it was so cool. I was center-right and right-wing,\u201d she said. \u201cThen, when I was 11 years old, I asked my mom if I could try acting \u2014 it started because I loved my drama class. My parents were very against it [at first]. They didn\u2019t get it.\u201d Nicola continued, \u201cWe lived an hour away from Manhattan, and I convinced my mom to bring me to one manager. She was like, \u2018Listen, if they take you, great. If they don\u2019t, do not bring it up to me until you\u2019re 18 years old.\u2019 So I begged the woman to take me. I think she just felt so bad for me that she took me on as a client. My first audition, I ended up booking, and it was a play at the Manhattan Theatre Club called Blackbird.\u201d After scoring a role in Blackbird, Nicola told Grazia in another interview that her parents warmed up to the idea of her becoming an actress. \u201cI think my parents saw how much I really, really enjoyed it, how much I loved it, and how hard I worked at it, and that\u2019s all they really care about,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, they\u2019re really supportive.\u201d Claudia gives Nicola style advice Speaking with Byrdie in February 2024, Nicola revealed that she doesn\u2019t work with a stylist and instead gets advice from Claudia about her outfits. \u201cI\u2019ll give my mom three options and ask her what I should wear, or she\u2019ll sometimes send me what she sees and likes,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel lucky to have relationships with Victoria [Beckham] and Valentino and some other brands, so I can just ask them to send me clothes. But it\u2019s very different from having a stylist.\u201d Claudia also weighed in on Nicola\u2019s bridal attire for her April 2022 nuptials to Brooklyn. The actress told Grazia that her mom and friend Leslie Fremar were a part of the design process when she worked with mother-in-law Victoria on a wedding dress before she turned to Valentino. \"I thought, 'Oh, this is going to be so fun. One of my best friends and my mom.' We connected to start designing the dress, and then a few days went by and I didn't hear anything,\" she said. \"Victoria called my mom and said her atelier couldn't make it. So, I spoke to my mom and Leslie, and I was like, 'Well, unfortunately, this can't happen, so what's the next step?' I've been a fan of Valentino and their couture for so long. I was really lucky to be able to travel to [the atelier] to try on the dress.\u201d Nelson had a legal battle with two of Nicola\u2019s wedding planners Ahead of Nicola\u2019s wedding to Brooklyn, Nelson filed a lawsuit against two of the couple's wedding planners in December 2022. The planners, Nicole Braghin and Arianna Grijalba, were hired six weeks before the wedding and fired after nine days on the job. In the lawsuit, Nelson claimed he never got his $159,000 deposit back and raised concerns about \u201ctheir experience, expertise, and capability of planning the wedding.\" Braghin and Grijalba countersued the billionaire for breach of contract and alleged that Claudia hid the real cost of the wedding from her husband. Speaking with Cosmopolitan in March 2023, Nicola didn\u2019t directly address the lawsuit but shared how she wished people wouldn't judge her. \"I just wish people knew me before they judged me,\" she said. \"And it sucks, because I wish I could respond to every person, being like, 'That's not true. That's not true. That's not true.' But then obviously, you have to block it out. You can't let everything affect you. Otherwise, it would be a spiral.\" In September 2023, Nelson settled his lawsuit with Braghin and Grijalba. As part of the settlement, the planners\u2019 employer, Plan Design Events, made a donation in Nicola and Brooklyn\u2019s name to the CARE Ukraine Crisis Fund. They keep their family life private Despite having a high-profile daughter, Nelson and Claudia prefer to keep their family life out of the spotlight. During her 2022 interview with Grazia, Nicola said she views her parents as \u201canti-Hollywood.\u201d \u201cMy family is not in the limelight. I don\u2019t see them like that at all,\u201d she explained. \u201cI come from a hockey family. All my brothers play hockey and my parents are, I guess, anti-Hollywood. They didn\u2019t grow up in L.A. or anything.\u201d Nicola also opened up about how her family keeps her grounded as her career as an actress and model continues to grow. \u201cIt\u2019s funny to be the first person in your family to venture off and try something new,\u201d she said. \u201cMy six brothers are happy for me, but they just look at me as their sister. My family keeps me very, very grounded.\u201d They supported Nicola at the premiere of Lola in February 2024 Though they may prefer life outside of Hollywood, Nelson and Claudia were on hand to support Nicola at the premiere of Lola in February 2024. The actress wrote, directed and starred in the drama film. Nicola shared several photos from the premiere on Instagram, including a shot of her entire family at the after-party and a moment with her mom while she was getting ready. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in February 2024, Nicola said she was grateful her family made the trip to support her. \u201cI have six brothers and one sister, so to just wrangle my family alone under one roof is nearly impossible,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cFor everyone to come out and support me meant the absolute world.\u201d The actress also revealed that Claudia was constantly on set with her during the filming of Lola. \u201cMy mom was with me every single day on set. I kidnapped her and made her come to L.A. and be with me, and I couldn\u2019t have done it without her,\u201d she said.", "summary": "Nicola Peltz Beckham is one of eight children born to Nelson Peltz and Claudia Heffner Peltz", "url": "https://people.com/all-about-nicola-peltz-parents-8610708", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/6GF5klimBKOJ4UIzAy1X8jzcoEk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1117x686:1119x688)/nicola-peltz-parents-9-e2259cbfd1dd490c8415d5e193d1c3c4.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:00:00", "author": "Ariana Quihuiz", "authors": ["Ariana Quihuiz"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.283}

The rice plants still shine a radiant green but Bao, puffing on a cigarette, told AFP that the local farmers are beginning to worry about how much longer they can go without rain. Recent years have brought a long list of extreme weather events to China, including destructive floods and record-breaking heatwaves that experts say are made more frequent by global climate change. Even as parts of central China were hit by drought, heavy rains and landslides across the south killed four people and left more than a dozen missing this week. The weeks-long dry spell striking central China has led many farmers to hold off on planting as agricultural authorities warn of damage to crops. A short drive down the road from Bao\u2019s home, 70-year-old reservoir manager Liu told AFP that the area hadn\u2019t seen any significant rain since April. \u201cThe drought conditions currently are very severe,\u201d said Liu, who gave only his surname, as he stood on the bank of the reservoir, the unusually low level of which was emphasised by a ring of stained concrete. Liu\u2019s reservoir serves as an important water source for the surrounding area, where farmers grow crops such as rice and corn. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t rain there\u2019ll be a loss of the reservoir, and those farmers\u2019 rice paddy fields \u2014 they will have to be saved,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it really doesn\u2019t rain, (the crops) will all die.\u201d \u2018All withered\u2019 Nearby, a 59-year-old woman farmer surnamed Wang arranged bushels of Chinese mugwort, a fragrant herb used in traditional medicine, along the side of the road. \u201cLook at it, it\u2019s all withered,\u201d Wang said. \u201cThe bottom half is dead already. There are a few sprouts at the top but they\u2019re also about to dry up.\u201d Across the road, Wang showed AFP a patch of crumbling dry soil where corn typically grows. In a stroke of bitter irony, a sprinkling of measly raindrops fell for a couple of minutes, quickly evaporating on the scorching ground before the pale clouds dissipated beneath the blinding sun. Wang said she hoped authorities could harness the power of technology to help local farmers through the drought. \u201cWith advanced technology and artificial rainfall, there\u2019d be some hope for us,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if there\u2019s really no rain, average folks like us will face total crop failure,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s just how it is.\u201d Support HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report | Apps Help safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team", "summary": "<figure><img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/China-drought-1024x576.jpg\" class=\"attachment-rss-image-size size-rss-image-size wp-post-image\" alt=\"China drought\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/China-drought-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/China-drought-1050x591.jpg 1050w, https://hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/China-drought-768x432.jpg 768w, https://hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/China-drought-400x225.jpg 400w, https://hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/China-drought-706x397.jpg 706w, https://hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/China-drought-800x450.jpg 800w, https://hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/China-drought.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 34.9rem) calc(100vw - 2rem), (max-width: 53rem) calc(8 * (100vw / 12)), (min-width: 53rem) calc(6 * (100vw / 12)), 100vw\" /></figure>By Peter Catterall Farmer Bao Mingchen gestured to a dry pipe wher", "url": "https://hongkongfp.com/2024/06/23/in-central-china-farmers-face-total-crop-failure-amid-punishing-drought/", "image": "https://hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/China-drought.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:30:00", "author": "AFP", "authors": ["AFP"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "HK", "sentiment": -0.124}

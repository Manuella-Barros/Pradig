Rupert Murdoch, the executive chairman of 21st Century Fox, speaks with the president several times a week, sources at both the White House and 21st Century Fox have told CNNMoney.\n\n21st Century Fox is also the parent company of Fox News, which has been aggressively pro-Trump on its most-watched shows.\n\nThe younger Murdoch began his letter by saying he was writing \"in a personal capacity, as a concerned citizen and a father,\" but he went on to highlight how his business had tried to contribute to a diverse and tolerant society.\n\n\"Diverse storytellers, and stories, can make a difference, and that diversity, around the world, is a crucial strength and an animating force in my business,\" he wrote. \"Often times not everyone agrees with the stories and positions that emerge from this, and that can be difficult.

Rupert Murdoch, the executive chairman of 21st Century Fox, speaks with the president several times a week, sources at both the White House and 21st Century Fox have told CNNMoney.\n\n21st Century Fox is also the parent company of Fox News, which has been aggressively pro-Trump on its most-watched shows.\n\nThe younger Murdoch began his letter by saying he was writing \"in a personal capacity, as a concerned citizen and a father,\" but he went on to highlight how his business had tried to contribute to a diverse and tolerant society.\n\n\"Diverse storytellers, and stories, can make a difference, and that diversity, around the world, is a crucial strength and an animating force in my business,\" he wrote. \"Often times not everyone agrees with the stories and positions that emerge from this, and that can be difficult.

Often times not everyone agrees with the stories and positions that emerge from this, and that can be difficult. Certainly no company can be perfect. But I'm proud of the powerful art that can emerge, and I'm grateful to all of my colleagues who make this happen. From the potent and compelling narrative of \"12 Years a Slave\", to the streets of Pakistan and the bravery of an extraordinary young woman that we saw in \"He Named Me Malala\", to name just a few, we've never been afraid to help storytellers and artists say important things - hard things, too.\n\nTo further demonstrate our commitment, Kathryn and I are donating 1 million dollars to the Anti-Defamation League, and I encourage you to give what you think is right as well. We hardly ever talk about our charitable giving, but in this case I wanted to tell you and encourage you to be generous too. Many of you are supporters of the Anti-Defamation League already - now is a great time to give more. The ADL is an extraordinary force for vigilance and strength in the face of bigotry - you can learn more here:https://www.adl.org.\n\nMy very best to you and with all my gratitude,\n\nJRM", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Women", "wgt": 100, "id": 121, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Women"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100, "id": 161, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "wgt": 100, "id": 232, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "wgt": 100, "id": 552, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "wgt": 100, "id": 705, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Storytelling", "wgt": 100, "id": 1370, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Storytelling"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "178"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "200134"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302718", "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302813", "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302940", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "302942", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302944", "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302966", "label": {"eng": "Violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303057", "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303514", "label": {"eng": "Citizenship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "304050", "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_Century_Fox", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304193", "label": {"eng": "21st Century Fox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304262", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigotry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310173", "label": {"eng": "Bigotry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "318256", "label": {"eng": "Ku Klux Klan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "318687", "label": {"eng": "Anti-Defamation League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Murdoch", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "325050", "label": {"eng": "James Murdoch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "357315", "label": {"eng": "Swastika"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "394340", "label": {"eng": "White nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_Years_a_Slave_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "418413", "label": {"eng": "12 Years a Slave (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_Named_Me_Malala", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1428310", "label": {"eng": "He Named Me Malala"}}]}

But what we watched this last week in Charlottesville and the reaction to it by the President of the United States concern all of us as Americans and free people.\n\nThese events remind us all why vigilance against hate and bigotry is an eternal obligation -- a necessary discipline for the preservation of our way of life and our ideals.

Democrats, Republicans, and others must all agree on this, and it compromises nothing for them to do so.\n\nDiverse storytellers, and stories, can make a difference, and that diversity, around the world, is a crucial strength and an animating force in my business. Often times not everyone agrees with the stories and positions that emerge from this, and that can be difficult. Certainly no company can be perfect. But I'm proud of the powerful art that can emerge, and I'm grateful to all of my colleagues who make this happen. From the potent and compelling narrative of \"12 Years a Slave\", to the streets of Pakistan and the bravery of an extraordinary young woman that we saw in \"He Named Me Malala\", to name just a few, we've never been afraid to help storytellers and artists say important things - hard things, too.\n\nTo further demonstrate our commitment, Kathryn and I are donating 1 million dollars to the Anti-Defamation League, and I encourage you to give what you think is right as well. We hardly ever talk about our charitable giving, but in this case I wanted to tell you and encourage you to be generous too. Many of you are supporters of the Anti-Defamation League already - now is a great time to give more. The ADL is an extraordinary force for vigilance and strength in the face of bigotry - you can learn more here: https://www.adl.org.

It has not been my habit to widely offer running commentary on current affairs, nor to presume to weigh in on the events of a given day save those that might be of particular or specific concern to 21CF and my colleagues,\" he wrote.\n\n\"But what we watched this last week in Charlottesville and the reaction to it by the President of the United States concern all of us as Americans and free people.\"\n\nHe added: \"These events remind us all why vigilance against hate and bigotry is an eternal obligation - a necessary discipline for the preservation of our way of life and our ideals. The presence of hate in our society was appallingly laid bare as we watched swastikas brandished on the streets of Charlottesville and acts of brutal terrorism and violence perpetrated by a racist mob.\n\n\"I can't even believe I have to write this: standing up to Nazis is essential; there are no good Nazis. Or Klansmen, or terrorists. Democrats, Republicans, and others must all agree on this, and it compromises nothing for them to do so.\"\n\nMurdoch said that he and his wife, Kathryn, plan to donate $US1 million to the Anti-Defamation League, America's biggest organisation fighting anti-Semitism and other forms or hate, and was urging others to follow suit.\n\n\"We hardly ever talk about our charitable giving, but in this case I wanted to tell you and encourage you to be generous too. Many of you are supporters of the Anti-Defamation League already - now is a great time to give more,\" he wrote.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League has been outspoken against Trump since early in his campaign, including tracking an uptick in white supremacists supporting him as he declined repeatedly to forcefully denounce them or disavow their support.\n\nThe New York Times\n\nThe story 'No good Nazis': James Murdoch takes $1.3m stand against Trump first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label":

Or Klansmen, or terrorists.'\n\nFox CEO James Murdoch slammed Donald Trump in an email to colleagues, saying 'Charlottesville and the reaction to it by the President... concern[s] all of us'\n\nMurodch said that contrary to Trump's own remarks on Tuesday, 'there are no good Nazis. Or Klansmen, or terrorists.' His dad, Rupert Murdoch, founded Fox and is close friends with Trump\n\nMurdoch prefaced his email by saying that he wasn't given to political comments, but that Trump's remarks had tipped his hand.\n\n'The presence of hate in our society was appallingly laid bare as we watched swastikas brandished on the streets of Charlottesville and acts of brutal terrorism and violence perpetrated by a racist mob,' he wrote.\n\n'Democrats, Republicans, and others must all agree [that there are no good Nazis],' he added, 'and it compromises nothing for them to do so.'\n\nHe called for his audience to take part in the 'eternal obligation' to be vigilant against hatred and bigotry, calling it 'a necessary discipline for the preservation of our way of life and our ideals.'\n\nHe concluded: 'To further demonstrate our commitment, Kathryn and I are donating 1 million dollars to the Anti-Defamation League, and I encourage you to give what you think is right as well.\n\n'We hardly ever talk about our charitable giving, but in this case I wanted to tell you and encourage you to be generous too.'\n\nTrump blamed both white supremacists and antifascists after a neo-Nazi drove into a crowd of liberal protesters in Charlottesville on Saturday, killing a woman and injuring 19 others\n\nOn Friday, white supremacists (pictured) marched on UVA while wielding torches and chanting antisemitic slogans, and allegedly beat up students on the campus\n\nJAMES MURDOCH'S EMAIL IN FULL\n\nSubject: Personal note from James Murdoch re: ADL\n\nFriends,\n\nI'm writing to you in a personal capacity, as a concerned citizen and a father.\n\nIt has not been my habit to widely offer running commentary on current affairs, nor to presume to weigh in on the events of a given day save those that might be of particular or specific concern to 21CF and my colleagues.\n\nBut what we watched this last week in Charlottesville and the reaction to it by the President of the United States concern all of us as Americans and free people.\n\nThese events remind us all why vigilance against hate and bigotry is an eternal obligation - a necessary discipline for the preservation of our way of life and our ideals.\n\nThe presence of hate in our society was appallingly laid bare as we watched swastikas brandished on the streets of Charlottesville and acts of brutal terrorism and violence perpetrated by a racist mob.\n\nI can't even believe I have to write this: standing up to Nazis is essential; there are no good Nazis. Or Klansmen, or terrorists.\n\nDemocrats, Republicans, and others must all agree on this, and it compromises nothing for them to do so.\n\nDiverse storytellers, and stories, can make a difference, and that diversity, around the world, is a crucial strength and an animating force in my business.\n\nOften times not everyone agrees with the stories and positions that emerge from this, and that can be difficult. Certainly no company can be perfect.\n\nBut I'm proud of the powerful art that can emerge, and I'm grateful to all of my colleagues who make this happen.\n\nFrom the potent and compelling narrative of '12 Years a Slave', to the streets of Pakistan and the bravery of an extraordinary young woman that we saw in 'He Named Me Malala', to name just a few, we've never been afraid to help storytellers and artists say important things - hard things, too.\n\nTo further demonstrate our commitment, Kathryn and I are donating 1 million dollars to the Anti-Defamation League, and I encourage you to give what you think is right as well.\n\nWe hardly ever talk about our charitable giving, but in this case I wanted to tell you and encourage you to be generous too.\n\nMany of you are supporters of the Anti-Defamation League already - now is a great time to give more.\n\nThe ADL is an extraordinary force for vigilance and strength in the face of bigotry - you can learn more here: https://www.adl.org.\n\nMy very best to you and with all my gratitude,\n\nJRM\n\nMurdoch's vociferous opposition to Trump's remarks is surprising, given his father's closeness to the president and the broadly pro-Trump tenor of their flagship news channel.\n\nAlthough he's not completely alone at Fox. In the immediate aftermath of Trump's remarks on Tuesday, Fox Specialists host Kat Timpf was visibly upset.\n\n'I'm wondering if it's actually real life what I just watched,' she said.\n\n'It shouldn't be some bold statement to say a gathering full of white supremacist Nazis doesn't have good people in it. Those are all bad people. Period.'\n\n'And the fact that it's controversial - I don't know if I should just laugh... I have too much eye makeup on to start crying right now. It's disgusting.'\n\nJuan Williams and Charles Krauthammer were among the other Fox hosts who slammed the president.\n\nBut Fox's biggest pundits came out swinging in defense of the president, with Sean Hannity saying that Trump was 'right' when he told the press he had wanted to wait for the facts to roll in before condemning KKK members and neo-Nazis.\n\nTrump said on Tuesday that there were 'very fine people' among the Friday crowd, which reportedly chanted 'Jews will not replace us' as they marched\n\nOn Saturday, the white supremacist groups came armed with shields - some adorned with Celtic crosses, a symbol used by white power groups - and batons\n\n'Now President Trump, when you think about it, was right,' Hannity said, 'and we need to learn from the mistakes of Barack Obama.\n\n'Nobody, especially the President of the United States, should ever rush to judgment and make a situation worse.'\n\nTucker Carlson, meanwhile, offered up a confused commentary in which he said slavery was evil, but also common in the old world, pointing out that 'Plato, Muhammad and the Aztecs' all had slaves.\n\nHe also mirrored Trump's other comments by likening the the antifascist groups to neo-Nazis, saying: 'They seem every bit as race-obsessed and angry as the people they're fighting. But no one acknowledges that for some reason.'\n\nIn the aftermath of the Charlottesville violence, there has been renewed call for the removal of Confederate statues across the US, with several having been spontaneously taken down overnight.\n\nTrump himself has sparked further ire by comparing statues of Robert E Lee and 'Stonewall' Jackson to those of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.\n\nIn the wake of the Charlottesville violence there have been increased calls for the removal of Confederate monuments across the country, with many having already been taken down",

The presence of hate in our society was appallingly laid bare as we watched swastikas brandished on the streets of Charlottesville and acts of brutal terrorism and violence perpetrated by a racist mob.\"\n\nMurdoch adds: \"I can't even believe I have to write this: standing up to Nazis is essential; there are no good Nazis. Or Klansmen, or terrorists. Democrats, Republicans, and others must all agree on this, and it compromises nothing for them to do so.\"\n\nHe goes on to say that he and his wife, Kathryn, are donating $1m to the Anti-Defamation League in the wake of the tragedy, which left one civil rights activist dead.\n\nBusiness leaders have been abandoning Trump since his bellicose press conference when he blamed Saturday's violence in Charlottesville on \"both sides\" and claimed that among the white supremacists involved there were \"very fine people\". On Thursday it emerged that the presidential advisory council on infrastructure will disband along with two panels that Trump hastily scrapped on Wednesday when faced with mass resignations. Some senior Republicans, including Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, have also turned against him.\n\nThe relationship between Trump, 71, and 86-year-old Rupert Murdoch, the current chairman and acting CEO of Fox News, goes back decades.

Many CEOs decided their support for President Trump ended at aligning with neo-Nazis, and on Thursday a surprising name was added to that list: James Murdoch, the chief executive of 21st Century Fox and son of Trump ally Rupert Murdoch.\n\nIn an email addressed to \"friends,\" Murdoch explained that the violence in Charlottesville, and the president's response, inspired him to donate $1 million to the Anti-Defamation League:\n\nI'm writing to you in a personal capacity, as a concerned citizen and a father. It has not been my habit to widely offer running commentary on current affairs, nor to presume to weigh in on the events of a given day save those that might be of particular or specific concern to 21CF and my colleagues. But what we watched this last week in Charlottesville and the reaction to it by the President of the United States concern all of us as Americans and free people.\n\nThese events remind us all why vigilance against hate and bigotry is an eternal obligation -- a necessary discipline for the preservation of our way of life and our ideals. The presence of hate in our society was appallingly laid bare as we watched swastikas brandished on the streets of Charlottesville and acts of brutal terrorism and violence perpetrated by a racist mob. I can't even believe I have to write this: standing up to Nazis is essential; there are no good Nazis. Or Klansmen, or terrorists. Democrats, Republicans, and others must all agree on this, and it compromises nothing for them to do so.\n\nMurdoch goes on to note that \"Diverse storytellers, and stories, can make a difference,\" and diversity is key to his business. He mentions two examples of works he's proud to say his company had a hand in: 12 Years a Slave and He Named Me Malala. 21st Century Fox is also the parent company of Fox News, which has been working hard to normalize Trump's response to Charlottesville.\n\nJames and his wife Kathryn, who worked for the Clinton Climate Initiative, are said to be embarrassed by aspects of Fox News. James and his brother Lachlan were reportedly behind the ouster of Bill O'Reilly and Roger Ailes, and there's been speculation that they might change the network's tone as they assume control from their father.\n\nSources NYT", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100, "id": 63, "label": "dmoz/Society/Work"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100, "id": 268, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100, "id": 594, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "wgt": 100, "id": 705, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "200134"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302685", "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302718", "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302813", "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News_Channel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "302938", "label": {"eng": "Fox News Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302940", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "302944", "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303057", "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303514", "label": {"eng": "Citizenship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303670", "label": {"eng": "Executive (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "304050", "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_Century_Fox", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "304193", "label": {"eng": "21st Century Fox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304262", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305262", "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305969", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Murdoch", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "314336", "label": {"eng": "Rupert Murdoch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_Foundation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "318108", "label": {"eng": "Clinton Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "318256", "label": {"eng": "Ku Klux Klan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "318687", "label": {"eng": "Anti-Defamation League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Murdoch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "325050", "label": {"eng": "James Murdoch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "357315", "label": {"eng": "Swastika"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_Years_a_Slave_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "418413", "label": {"eng": "12 Years a Slave (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_Named_Me_Malala", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1428310", "label": {"eng": "He Named Me Malala"}}]}

One white nationalist, James Fields, allegedly ploughed his car into a crowd of anti-fascist protesters killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer.\n\nAs acknowledged by the same Murdoch Jr., it's not his custom to publicly comment on current affairs. But what happened in Charlottesville \"and the reaction to it by the President of the United States concern all of us as Americans and free people.\"\n\n\"I can't even believe I have to write this: standing up to Nazis is essential; there are no good Nazis.

It has not been my habit to widely offer running commentary on current affairs, nor to presume to weigh in on the events of a given day save those that might be of particular or specific concern to 21CF and my colleagues. But what we watched this last week in Charlottesville and the reaction to it by the President of the United States concern all of us as Americans and free people.\n\nThese events remind us all why vigilance against hate and bigotry is an eternal obligation -- a necessary discipline for the preservation of our way of life and our ideals. The presence of hate in our society was appallingly laid bare as we watched swastikas brandished on the streets of Charlottesville and acts of brutal terrorism and violence perpetrated by a racist mob. I can't even believe I have to write this: standing up to Nazis is essential; there are no good Nazis. Or Klansmen, or terrorists. Democrats, Republicans, and others must all agree on this, and it compromises nothing for them to do so.\n\nDiverse storytellers, and stories, can make a difference, and that diversity, around the world, is a crucial strength and an animating force in my business. Often times not everyone agrees with the stories and positions that emerge from this, and that can be difficult. Certainly no company can be perfect. But I'm proud of the powerful art that can emerge, and I'm grateful to all of my colleagues who make this happen. From the potent and compelling narrative of \"12 Years a Slave\", to the streets of Pakistan and the bravery of an extraordinary young woman that we saw in \"He Named Me Malala\", to name just a few, we've never been afraid to help storytellers and artists say important things -

Earlier this month, Murdoch and his brother Lachlan, executive chairman, said they were committed to making Fox a more diverse organization following a series of sexual harassment scandals, one of which led to the departure of its top-rated host Bill O'Reilly.\n\nThe letter and ADL donation also add to moves by executives at top American companies to distance themselves from Trump, who said the violence at Charlottesville should be blamed on both sides, and that there were \"very fine people\" on both sides.

Trump provoked further scrutiny by doubling down on his comments at a Tuesday news conference in which he vehemently argued that \"both sides\" shared blamed for Saturday's events.\n\nIn his memo, Murdoch said the week's events had shed light on the existence of hatred in the United States.\n\n\"The presence of hate in our society was appallingly laid bare as we watched swastikas brandished on

Some senior Republicans, including Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, have also turned against him.\n\nThe relationship between Mr Trump (71) and 86-year-old Rupert Murdoch, the current chairman and acting CEO of Fox News, goes back decades. Earlier this year the Australian-born media mogul was ranked highest in a New York Times list of Mr Trump's top advisers outside the White House, someone the president speaks to \"on the phone every week\".\n\nFox News has remained loyal to Mr Trump through scandal after scandal, although even some of its hosts have spoken out over the Charlottesville fallout. The network has been rocked by a slew of sexual misconduct lawsuits against various presenters and executives. It also ran a fabricated a story about the circumstances surrounding the death of Democratic party aide Seth Rich.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "wgt": 100, "id": 232, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100, "id": 268, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "wgt": 100, "id": 705, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "type": "loc", "id": "197456"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "200134"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302718", "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302813", "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News_Channel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302938", "label": {"eng": "Fox News Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302940", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302944", "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302966", "label": {"eng": "Violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "303051", "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303057", "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303471", "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "303936", "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "304050", "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_Century_Fox", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "304193", "label": {"eng": "21st Century Fox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304262", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305842", "label": {"eng": "Chairman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305969", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "308296", "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigotry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310173", "label": {"eng": "Bigotry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "310713", "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Murdoch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "314336", "label": {"eng": "Rupert Murdoch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "318256", "label": {"eng": "Ku Klux Klan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "318687", "label": {"eng": "Anti-Defamation League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_proprietor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "323157", "label": {"eng": "Media proprietor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Murdoch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "325050", "label": {"eng": "James Murdoch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "357315", "label": {"eng": "Swastika"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Corker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "372229", "label": {"eng": "Bob Corker"}}]}

Fox News has been a staunch defender of Trump's presidency. In addition, Rupert Murdoch, James Murdoch's 86-year-old father and the company's founder, has become an informal advisor to the president.\n\n\"I can't even believe I have to write this: standing up to Nazis is essential; there are no good Nazis. Or Klansmen, or terrorists. Democrats, Republicans, and others must all agree on this, and it compromises nothing for them to do so,\" Murdoch wrote.\n\nHis missive comes in the wake of several other CEOs quitting Trump's business councils and publicly admonishing him for not taking a tougher stand against extremism.\n\nTrump was widely criticized for blaming \"both sides\" in the deadly violence that followed a Friday night march in which some white nationalists chanted anti-Jewish statements. Murdoch said that he and his wife, Kathryn, had made a $1-million donation to the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nResignations from Trump's business councils began on Monday and snowballed until Trump said he was disbanding the manufacturing and economic advisory councils Wednesday morning. Many of the executives cited their personal beliefs -- and not just business reasons -- as the impetus for their action.\n\nKenneth Frazier, the CEO of pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. and one of corporate America's leading black executives, was the first to quit on Monday.\n\n\"America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,\" Frazier said. \"As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.\"\n\nManagement and brand experts said the business leaders were trying to distance themselves and their companies from Trump.\n\n\"There's not enough spin in the world to justify [Trump's] position on this,\" Marlene Towns, a professor at Georgetown's McDonough School of Business, told The Times on Wednesday.\n\n\"Generally, it's a bad idea to align your brand with the KKK and white nationalists. You don't need a PhD in marketing to arrive at that conclusion,\" she added.\n\nMurdoch's position continues a generational change at 21st Century Fox. It was James Murdoch and his older brother, Lachlan Murdoch, who serves as co-chairman of Fox and sister company News Corp., who pressed for the firing of Roger Ailes, the once-powerful founder and architect of Fox News, in July 2016 amid allegations of widespread sexual harassment at the news unit. (Ailes died in May.)\n\n\"Diverse storytellers, and stories, can make a difference, and that diversity, around the world, is a crucial strength and an animating force in my business,\" James Murdoch wrote. \"Often times not everyone agrees with the stories and positions that emerge from this, and that can be difficult. Certainly no company can be perfect. But I'm proud of the powerful art that can emerge, and I'm grateful to all of my colleagues who make this happen.\"\n\nHe mentioned Fox's Los Angeles-based 20th Century Fox film unit, which distributed \"12 Years a Slave,\" and Fox Searchlight's \"He Named Me Malala,\" about a young Pakistani woman.\n\nmeg.james@latimes.com\n\n@MegJamesLAT", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri":

Two factions, one protesting the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee, the other anti-fascists and their supporters, squared off. That conflict ultimately resulted in one death and 19 injuries. Trump said in the aftermath that \"both sides\" were to blame, remarks that many in the business and entertainment community have condemned as too even-handed.\n\nMurdoch responded with an email to friends that was picked up by several news organizations. In the email, he decried the \"brutal terrorism and violence perpetrated by a racist mob.\" He continued: \"I can't even believe I have to write this: standing up to Nazis is essential; there are no good Nazis. Or Klansmen, or terrorists. Democrats, Republicans, and others must all agree on this, and it compromises nothing for them to do so.\"\n\nThe email isn't the first time the younger Murdochs have taken issue with President Trump's actions.

(Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for National Geographic)\n\nJames Murdoch, chief executive of 21st Century Fox, has pledged to donate $1 million to the Anti-Defamation League, according to an email he sent to friends. He told them, \"What we watched this last week in Charlottesville and the reaction to it by the President of the United States concern all of us as Americans and free people.\" He continued: \"These events remind us all why vigilance against hate and bigotry is an eternal obligation -- a necessary discipline for the preservation of our way of life and our ideals. The presence of hate in our society was appallingly laid bare as we watched swastikas brandished on the streets of Charlottesville and acts of brutal terrorism and violence perpetrated by a racist mob.\" In pointed criticism of President Trump, he went on: \"I can't even believe I have to write this: standing up to Nazis is essential; there are no good Nazis. Or Klansmen, or terrorists. Democrats, Republicans, and others must all agree on this, and it compromises nothing for them to do so.\"\n\nThe sentiment is lovely, and the money is certainly appreciated by those fighting anti-Semitism and bigotry, but the email reeks of hypocrisy, to be blunt. Murdoch seems blissfully unaware of -- or in denial about -- his family's role in creating the Trump phenomenon, fueling the rise of a xenophobic, racist demagogue and continuing to fan the flames of his noxious populism, which has brought us to where we are.\n\nIn April, I suggested that Murdoch, his brother and father might do the country a great service by revamping Fox's news operation:\n\nFox News could cease being the unofficial mouthpiece of the Trump administration, offering the president softball interviews and an echo chamber for his worldview (e.g., illegal immigrants are all criminals, America is out to get Christians). When President Trump makes 180-degree turns on a slew of issues, the Fox News hosts shouldn't be darting and dashing to catch up or denying that the president has reversed himself. Fox News should treat the president's invented conspiracy theories as, well, invented conspiracy theories. In short, it need not be a right-wing, populist echo chamber in service of the administration, regurgitating the same themes and vilifying the same figures night after night.\n\nJames Murdoch, whose father might be the most successful American immigrant ever, can lay off the hysteria about illegal immigration and massive voter fraud (another Trump fictional story line). It's irresponsible, racist and false to portray native-born Americans as victims of a tidal wave of immigration.\n\nIn tone, Fox News can drop the ideological bully-boy routine. (The Los Angeles Times editorial board writes: \"Fox announced that it was filling the vacuum left by [Bill] O'Reilly's departure with Tucker Carlson, another combative host whose specialty appears to be making guests he disagrees with squirm. This conversation-as-blood-sport approach goes back at least to 'The McLaughlin Group' and 'Crossfire,' two political talk shows that spiced up substantive discussions with contentiousness, but it became a prime-time staple in the O'Reilly era.\")\n\nAs I said then, Fox does not need to be a \"a cheesy propaganda outfit that exploits women and sows xenophobia and white resentment.\" Unfortunately, Fox News hosts seem to have doubled down on exactly that formula, peddling the Seth Rich conspiracy, taking Trump's characterization of Charlottesville seriously and continuing to attack legitimate news organizations with the same terms (e.g. liars, \"fake news,\" enemies of the country) that the president and Stephen K. Bannon utter. Fox News remains obsessed with illegal immigration and white grievance. Its anti-anti-Trump invective fills the nighttime lineup.\n\nInstead of giving the ADL what amounts to pocket change for James Murdoch, why doesn't he clean up his own news operation? Fox News has, more than any other outlet, popularized birtherism, Trumpism and white grievance-mongering, creating an alternative universe for white, older, working-class voters whom Trump whipped into a frenzy. That might cost more than $1 million, but at least Murdoch could sleep well at night, look at himself in the mirror and tell his family that he is a patriot, not a guy who's making a mint tearing apart the country.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict",

The event saw anti-far-right protester Heather Heyer, 32, killed after she was struck by a car allegedly driven by a white nationalist.\n\nTrump, who counts former Breitbart News executive chairman Steve Bannon as one of his closest aides, initially condemned the violence on \"both sides\". The Republican grandee later focused on the KKK and neo-Nazis, branding them \"thugs\".\n\nBut Trump's second statement was effectively deemed too little, too late as a string of CEOs resigned from his Manufacturing Council. The move forced Trump to disband the group and his Strategy & Policy Forum after he attacked Ken Frazier, the boss of pharmaceuticals giant Merck, on Twitter.\n\n\"Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council,he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!,\" the US president told his more than 36 million followers. Murdoch, meanwhile, reportedly criticised Trump in a letter seen by The New York Times.\n\n\"I can't even believe I have to write this: standing up to Nazis is essential; there are no good Nazis. Or Klansmen, or terrorists. Democrats, Republicans, and others must all agree on this, and it compromises nothing for them to do so,\" Murdoch wrote.

O'Reilly has denied all the claims against him, whilst 21st Century Fox announced that he would not be returning to Fox News in April.\n\n\"It is tremendously disheartening that we part ways due to completely unfounded claims,\" O'Reilly said. \"But that is the unfortunate reality many of us in the public eye must live with today.\"", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri":

I ask forgiveness. This malignant racism has lingered far too long. In white churches across America, we have told ourselves that we have made great strides, but this has proven untrue.\n\n'As white Christian leaders and pastors, we must also acknowledge our unintended but clear complicity in this.'\n\nHe wrote as James Murdoch, the CEO of Twenty-First Century Fox and the younger son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, chair of Fox, circulated an email pledging a $1 million donation to the Anti-Defamation League.\n\n'What we watched this last week in Charlottesville and the reaction to it by the President of the United States concern all of us as Americans and free people,' Murdoch says in a note seen by Yahoo Finance.\n\nMurdoch makes his comments in the wake of President Donald Trump's comments stating that 'both sides' were to blame.\n\nMurdoch says: 'I can't even believe I have to write this: standing up to Nazis is essential; there are no good Nazis. Or Klansmen, or terrorists. Democrats, Republicans, and others must all agree on this, and it compromises nothing for them to do so.'\n\nHe and his wife Kathryn rarely discuss their generous philanthropy.\n\n'But in this case I wanted to tell you and encourage you to be generous too. Many of you are supporters of the Anti-Defamation League already - now is a great time to give more,' he writes in the note.\n\nWorld Relief says in its Charlottesville statement that as an organisation that embraces and promotes diversity and service to all, it 'grieves the affront that racism is to the dignity of all'.\n\n'For over 70 years, World Relief has empowered the church to serve the most vulnerable with passion and a sense of deep privilege. World Relief renews that commitment today recognizing the challenge is greater in the United States than previously understood.'\n\nArbeiter continues in his letter: 'We will do so in our practical ministry and through our relationships. We will do so in our advocacy for just laws and our rejection of unjust systems that perpetuate poverty, exclusion and bigotry. And we will do so in our partnership with thousands of pastors in our network and beyond, calling them to also act with renewed moral clarity and courage.'\n\nTim Breene, CEO of World Relief, said: 'The foundation of our work throughout the world is a belief in the dignity of each person as made in the image of God. Our defense of this dignity is not new. Rather, this letter reflects the long-held values of our World Relief staff as lived out in practical ways over many decades. However, in this moment of national consequence we wanted to go on record and declare once again who we are.'\n\nWorld Relief works in 20 countries worldwide through disaster response, health and child development, economic development and peacebuilding and has offices in the United States that specialise in refugee and immigration services.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "wgt": 100, "id": 17, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "wgt": 100, "id": 705, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "200134"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302718", "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302813", "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302940", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "302942", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302944", "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303057", "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303176", "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "304050", "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_Century_Fox", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "304193", "label": {"eng": "21st Century Fox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304262", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "304270", "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304283", "label": {"eng": "Christian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304971", "label": {"eng": "Evangelicalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "308747", "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dignity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310166", "label": {"eng": "Dignity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigotry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310173", "label": {"eng": "Bigotry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "313742", "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Murdoch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "314336", "label": {"eng": "Rupert Murdoch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "318256", "label": {"eng": "Ku Klux Klan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "318687", "label": {"eng": "Anti-Defamation League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_proprietor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "323157", "label": {"eng": "Media proprietor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Murdoch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "325050", "label": {"eng": "James Murdoch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "366353", "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!

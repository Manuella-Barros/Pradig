Here's what we know.\n\nAlberto brings heavy rainfall, flooding to South Texas\n\nThe first named storm in the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season made landfall in Mexico, near the U.S. border, sometime between 4 a.m. and 7 a.m. local time, according to the National Hurricane Center. Along with sustained winds near 45 mph, the storm is forecast to dump up to 20 inches across parts of northeast Mexico with nearly a foot of rain expected throughout southern Texas.\n\nSuch high rainfall totals will likely produce \"considerable flash flooding and urban flooding\" as well as possible mudslides across northern Mexico, the NHC said.\n\nAfter making landfall, Alberto is expected to diminish in strength, though it could still produce life-threatening weather conditions.\n\nAlberto began drenching southern Texas on Wednesday, triggering widespread coastal flooding that left Surfside Beach, a city along the Texas Gulf Coast south of Houston, under several feet of water. The storm also lashed Mexico with heavy rain, and caused the deaths of at least three minors, Nuevo Leon state Governor Samuel Garcia told local media without providing details.\n\nAcross southern Texas, the combination of storm surge and high tide is raising alarms on Thursday as floodwaters could reach up to 4 feet along the coast. The deepest waters will breach the shore along the Texas coast just to the north of Mexico, where the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous waves, according to NHC.\n\nLife-threatening surf and rip current conditions are among the central threats for the Gulf Coast of Texas through Friday. In deep South Texas, multiple counties were under a tornado watch as forecasters warned that a possible tornado or two could spin up through the morning.\n\nAll tropical storm watches and warnings have been discontinued all the U.S. Gulf Coast, and heavy rain and gusty winds are beginning to subside for South Texas.\n\nAcross the Coastal Bend of Texas, the National Weather Service reported a few gusts of wind above 50 mph and rainfall totals of about 2 to 7 inches.\n\n\"Between 4-8 inches of rain can fall across a widespread area from south of Houston to far northeastern Mexico from Monday to Thursday night, while rainfall totals as high as 8-12 inches can occur over South Texas and the higher elevations of northern Mexico,\" according to AccuWeather.\n\nPeople are also reading: Storm tracker: See latest details, possible path as tropical storm warning issued in Texas\n\nAlberto makes landfall in Mexico\n\nTropical Storm Alberto made landfall in Mexico early Thursday morning and is expected to move farther inland, according to the latest report by the NHC.

He also activated three platoons of the Texas National Guard, including more than 40 personnel, 20 vehicles and Chinook helicopters.\n\nWatches and warnings in Texas\n\nNHC has issued a tropical storm warning for the Texas coast from San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande.

On Monday afternoon, the National Hurricane Center issued an advisory for potential Tropical Cyclone One.\n\nHeavy, potentially flooding rain is expected across the western Gulf Coast, the National Hurricane Center said, with as much as 15 inches possible. The heavy rainfall and flash flooding threat is predicted to intensify into Tuesday morning, according to National Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan.\n\nA tropical storm watch has been issued for the Texas coast from Port O'Connor southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande. The watch means tropical storm conditions are possible within the area, generally within 48 hours.\n\n\"There's a potential for flooding and flash flooding over the next several days with heavy rainfall already starting to move into portions of the Gulf Coast,\" Brennan said in an update Monday afternoon. \"This threat of flooding is going to continue as we move through the week.\"\n\nThe system's maximum sustained winds remained near 40 mph with higher gusts as of 11 p.m. EST Monday. The National Hurricane Center described the system as \"quite large\" with tropical storm-force winds extending outward up to 290 miles to the northeast of the center.\n\nThe hurricane center has forecast the system to become a tropical storm by Wednesday and advised residents along the western and northwestern Gulf coasts to closely monitor it.\n\nBy 11 p.m. Monday, the system was moving near 7 mph toward the north, according to the hurricane center. It was expected to turn toward the west-northwest by Tuesday night or Wednesday, and \"the system is likely to approach the western Gulf coast late Wednesday,\" the hurricane center said in a late Monday advisory.\n\nIt's one of two separate tropical systems - the other is in the Atlantic Ocean - that are forecast to strengthen this week and each could have an impact on portions of the southern U.S., forecasters said Monday.\n\nAlberto will be the first named storm of what's expected to be a doozy of an Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nTropical storm in the Gulf?\n\nThe Gulf system is forecast to strengthen into a tropical depression, then a tropical storm right before making landfall along the northern Gulf Coast of Mexico, AccuWeather said. Once its sustained winds reach 39 mph, it will become Tropical Storm Alberto.\n\nAlthough the center of the storm will likely make landfall in Mexico on Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center warned that heavy rainfall is still expected to spread over portions of the northwestern coast of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico by the middle of the week. In addition, gale warnings have been issued for portions of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nAccuWeather senior meteorologist Dan Pydynowski explained that \"even if the tropical storm falls short of reaching tropical storm status, a plume of rich, deep tropical moisture is expected to surge into Mexico, Texas and Louisiana into the middle of the week.\"\n\nWeather Channel meteorologist Jim Cantore warned that \"double-digit rainfall totals (are) likely along the coastal counties of Texas and potentially Houston.\" Flash flooding is a possibility in some parts of Texas, including in Brownsville, Corpus Christi, Houston and San Antonio, according to Weather.com.\n\nAn Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to investigate the system later Monday.\n\nBusy season ahead: The 2024 NOAA hurricane season forecast is unlike any other. See the record predictions.\n\nAtlantic system also bears watching\n\nForecasters on Monday were also keeping watch on a budding tropical system in the Atlantic Ocean. The system, which was several hundred miles east of the Bahamas on Monday, \"is forecast to approach the coast of the southeast United States on Thursday or Friday,\" the Hurricane Center said.\n\n\"This appears to be a quick-moving and compact low-pressure area that will be moving westward into northeastern Florida or perhaps as far north as southeastern Georgia on Thursday,\" Pydynowski said.\n\nLocations from Melbourne, Florida, to Charleston, South Carolina, will be at risk for heavy rain from the storm.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Jacksonville, Florida, warned of \"numerous to widespread showers and embedded heavy storms pushing onshore at times with strong gusty winds as the main threat.\"\n\nAn 'extraordinary' year is possible\n\nOnce Alberto forms, it will be the start of what's expected to be a very active year for storms. NOAA Director Rick Spinrad said last month that the Atlantic hurricane season is shaping up to be \"extraordinary,\" with an \"85% chance for an above-average year.\"\n\nThe record for most named storms in a season is 30, set in 2020. A typical year averages about 14 tropical storms, seven of which spin into hurricanes, based on weather records spanning from 1991 to 2020.\n\nContributing: Cheryl McCloud and Kim Luciani, USA TODAY

The system is likely too far north to impact South Florida.\n\nThere's also a disturbance in the same area of the Gulf of Mexico as Alberto that could become a tropical depression this weekend. As of 8 a.m. Thursday, it had a 50% chance of developing in the next seven days and a 10% chance it the next two days.\n\nMeanwhile, Tropical Storm Alberto, the first named storm of the 2024 hurricane season, is expected to make landfall early Thursday south of the U.S. border with Mexico.\n\nAs of 8 a.m. Thursday, the storm was 255 miles south of Brownsville, Texas, and 25 miles west of Tampico, Mexico, traveling west at 13 mph, with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph.\n\nOnce inland, Alberto is forecast to weaken quickly and likely dissipate over Mexico by Thursday night, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nAlberto is a large, slow-moving tropical storm, with tropical-storm-force winds extending outward up to 250 miles north of the center.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center has issued a tropical storm warning for the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\nThe storm had caused coastal flooding near Galveston, Texas, where storm surge was expected to reach 2 to 4 feet, depending on tide. There was even some street flooding in Louisiana.\n\nRain in Texas is expected to diminish Thursday, with an inch or less expected, the NHC said.\n\nInland in Mexico rainfall could continue to be significant and potentially dangerous, given the mountainous terrain in some of the region.\n\nRainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico are possible, with maximum totals of 20 inches in areas with higher terrain, the NHC said. Flash flooding and mudslides are potential hazards.\n\nThe 2024 hurricane season, which officially began June 1, is expected to be extremely active.\n\nIn its annual May outlook, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that the 2024 hurricane season has an 85% chance of being above normal, with 17 to 25 named storms with minimum sustained winds of 39 mph, and eight to 13 hurricanes. An average year has 14 named storms and seven hurricanes.\n\nIn addition, NOAA has forecast four to seven major hurricanes for 2024, meaning those that are Category 3 or above.\n\nExperts at Colorado State University stated in their 2024 forecast that the U.S. East Coast, including Florida, had a 34% chance of a major hurricane making landfall this year. The average from 1880-2020 was 21%.\n\nForecasters say that the record-warm water temperatures that now cover much of the Atlantic Ocean will continue into peak hurricane season from August to October. That warm water fuels hurricanes. By early June, the tropical Atlantic was already as hot as it usually is in mid-August -- peak hurricane season.\n\nHurricane season officially ends Nov. 30.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

(Scripps News)\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said that a system packing heavy rains and gusty winds formed into a tropical storm on Wednesday, marking the first named storm of what is expected to be a busy 2024 hurricane season.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto had top sustained winds of 40 mph with higher gusts. It was located 185 miles east of Tampico, Mexico, and moving to the west at 9 mph, as of 10 a.m. CT Wednesday. Forecasters expected Alberto to come ashore early Thursday as a tropical storm just south of the U.S. and Mexico border.\n\nTropical storm warnings were issued as far north as San Luis Pass, Texas, and as far south as Tecolutla, Mexico. Tropical storm warnings mean tropical storm force conditions are expected within the next 36 hours.\n\nIn addition to gusty winds, the National Hurricane Center says 5 to 10 inches of rain could fall across northeast Mexico into South Texas.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said a storm surge of 2-4 feet is expected for much of the Texas coast. A water rise of 1-3 feet is possible along the Louisiana coast.\n\nForecasters also warned that tornadoes are possible for South Texas on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nLast month, NOAA issued its projection for the upcoming Atlantic hurricane season. The agency predicts 17 to 25 systems will become at least tropical storms in 2024, with eight to 13 hurricanes and four to seven major hurricanes. If the forecast holds true, 2024 could be one of the busiest Atlantic hurricane seasons ever.\n\nNOAA also said systems like Alberto often end up becoming the most dangerous storms.

Landfall could come early Thursday morning, forecasters said.\n\nAlberto's effects are being felt far away into Texas, which is expected to get lot of rain and storm surge flooding from the storm. Parts of the Texas and Mexico coasts are under tropical storm warnings:\n\nAs of 1 p.m. CDT Wednesday, Tropical Storm Alberto was located about 295 miles south-southeast of Brownsville, Texas, and was moving westward at 9 mph.\n\nAlberto had sustained winds of 40 mph, making it a minimal tropical storm. The hurricane center said Alberto could strengthen some before coming ashore in Mexico early Thursday morning. It is not expected to become a hurricane.\n\nThe hurricane center added that Alberto is a large tropical storm, with tropical-storm-force winds extending outward up to 415 miles north of the center.\n\nAlberto is expected to be a rainmaker above all else. The hurricane center said the storm could drop 5 to 10 inches of rain on parts of Texas and Mexico over the next few days. Some areas in Mexico could get up to 20 inches of rain.\n\nThat much rain could cause deadly flash flooding and mudslides.\n\nTropical storm warnings stretched along the western Gulf Coast. In Texas a tropical storm warning stretched from San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande. The northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla was also under a warning.\n\nThe hurricane center said a few tornadoes will also be possible in parts of Texas as Alberto's rain bands move onshore.\n\nThe hurricane center was also keeping tabs on two additional spots for potential tropical development -- and one of them is also in the Gulf near Alberto.\n\nForecasters said an area of low pressure is expected to develop this weekend over the southern Gulf. Alberto will be long gone by that point, but the new disturbance has a 30 percent chance of becoming a tropical depression in the next week.\n\nThe hurricane center thinks the new disturbance will track to the north or northwest.\n\nA second area to watch is in the western Atlantic near the Bahamas. It has only a 20 percent chance of becoming a depression but is expected to move in the direction of the U.S. southeast Atlantic coast (Florida, Georgia, Carolinas).", "source": {"uri": "al.com",

The latter could affect coastal northern Florida on Friday.\n\nOnce inland, Alberto is forecast to weaken quickly and likely dissipate over Mexico by Thursday or Thursday night, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nAlberto is a large, slow-moving tropical storm, with tropical-storm-force winds extending outward up to 275 miles north of the center.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center has issued a tropical storm warning for the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\nThe storm was causing coastal flooding near Galveston, Texas, 500 miles away from its likely landfall in Mexico. Storm surge there is expected to reach 2 to 4 feet, depending on tide. There was even some street flooding in Louisiana.\n\nA few tornadoes are also possible Thursday night in lower South Texas and southeast areas of the state, the NHC said.\n\nForecasters urged people to not focus solely on the storm's forecast track.\n\n\"The disturbance is very large with rainfall, coastal flooding, and wind impacts likely to occur far from the center along the coasts of Texas and northeastern Mexico,\" the hurricane center said.\n\nInland in Mexico and South Texas, rainfall could be significant and potentially dangerous, given the mountainous terrain in some of the region.\n\nRainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico into South Texas are possible, with maximum totals of 20 inches in areas of Mexico with higher terrain, the NHC said Wednesday night. Flash flooding and mudslides are potential hazards.\n\nA disturbance in the same area of the Gulf of Mexico as Alberto could become a tropical depression this weekend. As of 2 a.m. Thursday, it has a 50% chance of developing in the next seven days and a 10% chance it the next two days.\n\nMeanwhile, forecasters are watching an area of storminess several hundred miles east of the northern Bahamas that could approach northeastern Florida or southern Georgia early Friday.\n\nAs of 2 a.m. Thursday, it has a 30% chance of development over the next two days, with some slow development possible thereafter while the system moves west-northwest..\n\nThe system is likely too far north to impact South Florida.\n\nThe 2024 hurricane season, which officially began June 1, is expected to be extremely active.\n\nIn its annual May outlook, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that the 2024 hurricane season has an 85% chance of being above normal, with 17 to 25 named storms with minimum sustained winds of 39 mph, and eight to 13 hurricanes. An average year has 14 named storms and seven hurricanes.\n\nIn addition, NOAA has forecast four to seven major hurricanes for 2024, meaning those that are Category 3 or above.\n\nExperts at Colorado State University stated in their 2024 forecast that the U.S. East Coast, including Florida, had a 34% chance of a major hurricane making landfall this year. The average from 1880-2020 was 21%.\n\nForecasters say that the record-warm water temperatures that now cover much of the Atlantic Ocean will continue into peak hurricane season from August to October. That warm water fuels hurricanes. By early June, the tropical Atlantic was already as hot as it usually is in mid-August -- peak hurricane season.\n\nHurricane season officially ends Nov. 30.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

Here's what we know.\n\nThe first named storm in the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season made landfall in Mexico, near the U.S. border, sometime between 4 a.m. and 7 a.m. local time, according to the National Hurricane Center. Along with sustained winds near 45 mph, the storm is forecast to dump up to 20 inches across parts of northeast Mexico with nearly a foot of rain expected throughout southern Texas.\n\nSuch high rainfall totals will likely produce \"considerable flash flooding and urban flooding\" as well as possible mudslides across northern Mexico, the NHC said.\n\nAfter making landfall, Alberto is expected to diminish in strength, though it could still produce life-threatening weather conditions.\n\nAlberto began drenching southern Texas on Wednesday, triggering widespread coastal flooding that left Surfside Beach, a city along the Texas Gulf Coast south of Houston, under several feet of water. The storm also lashed Mexico with heavy rain, and caused the deaths of at least three minors, Nuevo Leon state Governor Samuel Garcia told local media without providing details.\n\nAcross southern Texas, the combination of storm surge and high tide is raising alarms on Thursday as floodwaters could reach up to 4 feet along the coast. The deepest waters will breach the shore along the Texas coast just to the north of Mexico, where the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous waves, according to NHC.\n\nLife-threatening surf and rip current conditions are among the central threats for the Gulf Coast of Texas through Friday. In deep South Texas, multiple counties were under a tornado watch as forecasters warned that a possible tornado or two could spin up through the morning.\n\nAll tropical storm watches and warnings have been discontinued all the U.S. Gulf Coast, and heavy rain and gusty winds are beginning to subside for South Texas.\n\nAcross the Coastal Bend of Texas, the National Weather Service reported a few gusts of wind above 50 mph and rainfall totals of about 2 to 7 inches.\n\n\"Between 4-8 inches of rain can fall across a widespread area from south of Houston to far northeastern Mexico from Monday to Thursday night, while rainfall totals as high as 8-12 inches can occur over South Texas and the higher elevations of northern Mexico,\" according to AccuWeather.\n\nPeople are also reading: Storm tracker: See latest details, possible path as tropical storm warning issued in Texas\n\nTropical Storm Alberto made landfall in Mexico early Thursday morning and is expected to move farther inland, according to the latest report by the NHC. A tropical storm warning has been issued for a portion of the northeastern Mexico coast.\n\nHere's a quick breakdown of conditions, as of 7 a.m. Thursday:\n\nTexas governor Greg Abbott issued a disaster proclamation for 51 counties Wednesday evening, as winds and flooding from the tropical storm continue hitting the state's coast. He also activated three platoons of the Texas National Guard, including more than 40 personnel, 20 vehicles and Chinook helicopters.\n\nNHC has issued a tropical storm warning for the Texas coast from San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande. A warning was also issued for the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\nOn Wednesday the NHC named the system in the Gulf, making it the first named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season.\n\n-- USA TODAY reporters Christopher Cann and Cheryl McCloud contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

Storm surge there is expected to reach 2 to 4 feet, depending on tide.\n\nForecasters urged people to not focus solely on the storm's forecast track.\n\nThe hurricane center has expanded the tropical storm warning north, to San Luis Pass near Houston.\n\n\"The disturbance is very large with rainfall, coastal flooding, and wind impacts likely to occur far from the center along the coasts of Texas and northeastern Mexico,\" the hurricane center said.\n\nInland in Mexico and South Texas, rainfall could be significant and potentially dangerous, given the mountainous terrain in some of the region.\n\nRainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico into South Texas are possible, with maximum totals of 15 inches. Flash flooding and mudslides are potential hazards.\n\nSeparate from the potential tropical storm, forecasters are also watching two other potential systems, one of which could affect Florida.\n\nAs of 8 a.m. Wednesday, a disturbance in the same area of the Gulf of Mexico as the potential tropical storm had a 30% chance of forming in the next seven days. It is expected to move slowly west-northwest or northwest and is expected to develop over the southwestern Gulf over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, forecasters are watching an area of storminess several hundred miles east of the central Bahamas and could approach the southern U.S. East Coast, potentially including Florida, late this week.\n\nIt has a 20% chance of development over the next seven days, with some slow development possible thereafter while the system moves westward or west-northwestward.\n\nThe 2024 hurricane season, which officially began June 1, is expected to be extremely active. Monday's watch was the first of the 2024 hurricane season, which forecasters say will be a strong one.\n\nIn its annual May outlook, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that the 2024 hurricane season has an 85% chance of being above normal, with 17 to 25 named storms with minimum sustained winds of 39 mph, and eight to 13 hurricanes. An average year has 14 named storms and seven hurricanes.\n\nIn addition, NOAA has forecast four to seven major hurricanes for 2024, meaning those that are Category 3 or above.\n\nExperts at Colorado State University stated in their 2024 forecast that the U.S. East Coast, including Florida, had a 34% chance of a major hurricane making landfall this year. The average from 1880-2020 was 21%.\n\nForecasters say that the record-warm water temperatures that now cover much of the Atlantic Ocean will continue into peak hurricane season from August to October. That warm water fuels hurricanes. By early June, the tropical Atlantic was already as hot as it usually is in mid-August -- peak hurricane season.\n\nHurricane season officially ends Nov. 30.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

Forecasters said it won't affect Florida.\n\nMeanwhile, a disturbance in the Atlantic has a 20% chance of developing in the next seven days and has a trajectory that will affect North Florida. The system is likely to bring rain to North Florida. Forecasters said South Florida will have a wet week regardless of where the Atlantic disturbance travels.\n\nAs of 8 a.m. Tuesday, the Gulf storm was 295 miles southeast of Brownsville, Texas, moving west-northwest at 8 mph, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. Forecasters are concerned about rainfall amounts, particularly in areas north of the center of the storm.\n\nIt is expected to strengthen and make landfall late Wednesday or early Thursday as a tropical storm in northeastern Mexico, with tropical storm force winds, and significant rainfall, extending into the U.S.\n\nThe NHC has expanded the tropical storm warning north, to San Luis Pass near Houston.\n\nThe warnings reach south to the mouth of the Rio Grande River. The government of Mexico also has issued a tropical storm warning for the northeastern coast of Mexico, south to Puerto de Altamira.\n\nThe hurricane center said the disturbance is \"quite large\" and has tropical-storm-force winds extending outward, up to 415 miles to the northeast of the center, toward South Texas.\n\nThe system is expected to continue making its turn to the west Tuesday night, and will reach the Gulf coast of Mexico by Wednesday night.\n\nForecasters urged people to not focus solely on the storm's forecast track.\n\n\"The disturbance is very large with rainfall, coastal flooding, and wind impacts likely to occur far from the center along the coasts of Texas and northeastern Mexico,\" the hurricane center said.\n\nRainfall could be significant and potentially dangerous, given the mountainous terrain in some of the region.\n\nRainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico into South Texas are possible, with maximum totals of 15 inches. Flash flooding and mudslides are potential hazards.\n\nStorm surge also is a concern, particularly along the flatter areas of the Texas coast. Galveston Bay could see 2 to 4 feet of surge.\n\nSeparate from the potential tropical storm, forecasters are also watching two other potential systems, one of which could affect Florida.\n\nAs of 8 a.m. Wednesday, a disturbance in the same area of the Gulf of Mexico as the potential tropical storm had a 30% chance of forming in the next seven days. It is expected to move slowly west-northwest or northwest and is expected to develop over the southwestern Gulf over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, forecasters are watching an area of storminess that several hundred miles east of the central Bahamas and could approach the southern U.S. East Coast, potentially including Florida, late this week.\n\nIt has a 20% chance of development over the next seven days, with some slow development possible thereafter while the system moves westward or west-northwestward.\n\nThe 2024 hurricane season, which officially began June 1, is expected to be extremely active. Monday's watch was the first of the 2024 hurricane season, which forecasters say will be a strong one.\n\nIn its annual May outlook, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that the 2024 hurricane season has an 85% chance of being above normal, with 17 to 25 named storms with minimum sustained winds of 39 mph, and eight to 13 hurricanes. An average year has 14 named storms and seven hurricanes.\n\nIn addition, NOAA has forecast four to seven major hurricanes for 2024, meaning those that are Category 3 or above.\n\nExperts at Colorado State University stated in their 2024 forecast that the U.S. East Coast, including Florida, had a 34% chance of a major hurricane making landfall this year. The average from 1880-2020 was 21%.\n\nForecasters say that the record-warm water temperatures that now cover much of the Atlantic Ocean will continue into peak hurricane season from August to October. That warm water fuels hurricanes. By early June, the tropical Atlantic was already as hot as it usually is in mid-August -- peak hurricane season.\n\n(Sun Sentinel staff writer Robin Webb contributed to this report.)", "source":

Alberto will be the first tropical storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season and is expected to make landfall in Mexico between late Wednesday and early Thursday morning.\n\nIn recent days, the disturbance has intensified significantly, prompting the National Weather Service to issue a tropical storm warning for several areas along Coastal Texas early Tuesday morning before expanding the warning to include a broader range of Texas later in the afternoon.\n\nThe warning now stretches across nearly the entirety of the state's coastline from San Luis Pass near Galveston to the mouth of the Rio Grande.\n\nMore: Tropical system brings heavy rain, flood threat to Corpus Christi, south Texas\n\nWhy is the tropical disturbance not yet a storm?\n\nCurrently, the NHC has dubbed the tropical event \"Potential Tropical Cyclone One,\" which allows the NHC to issue advisories, watches and warnings for the system that hasn't yet formed into a tropical storm but poses a threat.\n\nTo become a tropical storm, maximum sustained winds must reach at least 39 mph, and the disturbance reportedly has maximum sustained speeds of 40 mph. However, the cyclone has yet to have a \"well-defined center of circulation,\" which is another determining factor.\n\nWhen will Track Potential Tropical Cyclone One make landfall?\n\nNHC warned that the system is very large, with tropical-storm-force winds extending outward up to 415 miles to the north of the center, increasing significantly from an advisory Tuesday morning that cited 290 miles outward.\n\n\"A generally westward motion with an increase in forward speed is expected during the next day or so, and the system is forecast to reach the coast of northeastern Mexico by late tonight or early Thursday,\" the latest advisory stated.\n\nAlready, the storm has brought significant rainfall to Texas. Those in South Texas and along the coast can expect to see continuing impact, which will include flooding rain, coastal flooding, gusty winds and high surf and rip currents, through Thursday.\n\nThe storm is expected to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico into South Texas, with maximum totals of 15 inches possible, according to the NHC.\n\nWatches and warnings issued in Texas\n\nNHC has issued a tropical storm warning for the Texas coast from San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande.

The hurricane center uses only the top four or five highest performing models to help make its forecasts.\n\nContributing: Cheryl McCloud, USA TODAY Network-Florida", "source": {"uri": "commercialappeal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Commercial Appeal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Alberto_(1994)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical Storm Alberto (1994)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone warnings and watches"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf Coast of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_flooding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coastal flooding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Coastal_Bend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas Coastal Bend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AccuWeather", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AccuWeather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic hurricane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_Christi,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corpus Christi, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Corpus Christi, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip_current", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rip current"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownsville,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brownsville, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brownsville, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Flowers/Fresh_Cut", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Flowers/Fresh Cut", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 15}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/20/PTCN/74153987007-5-am-tropical-storm-alberto-cone-june-20-2024.png?auto=webp&crop=895,502,x0,y166&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659946", "eventUri": "eng-9659946", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

The National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported that the storm, developing over the southern Gulf of Mexico, was expected to reach land as a potential tropical cyclone.\n\nIf the storm strengthens, it will become the season's first named storm: Tropical Storm Alberto. As of Tuesday night, the system was centered approximately 365 miles southeast of Brownsville, Texas, and was predicted to become a tropical storm by Wednesday. It was forecasted to make landfall on Mexico's Gulf Coast by Wednesday night. The NHC estimated an 80% chance of the system becoming a tropical storm within the next two days.\n\nThe tropical storm warning covers coastal Texas from San Luis Pass to the mouth of the Rio Grande and extends along the Gulf Coast of Mexico. The storm is expected to affect large parts of Central America with rainfall. Forecasts on Tuesday night indicated maximum sustained winds near 40 miles per hour, expected to increase over the next 36 hours. Downpours and coastal flooding were predicted over the coming days.\n\nIn Texas, moderate coastal flooding was anticipated to begin along the coast as early as Tuesday, worsening through midweek. The situation was expected to escalate on Wednesday in the tropical storm warning area, potentially causing flash flooding and urban flooding as rivers overflow. Northeastern Mexico could experience mudslides.\n\nAt 4 a.m. CT on Tuesday, the NHC upgraded the season's first tropical storm watch to a tropical storm warning. By 7 a.m., Mexico's government issued a tropical storm warning for the northeastern coast, south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Puerto de Altamira, replacing the earlier watch.\n\nThe storm was moving northwest at 7 mph over the Gulf on Tuesday evening, with a projected westward turn overnight into Wednesday, before reaching northeastern Mexico by Wednesday night. Forecasts indicated that regions in northeastern Mexico and southern Texas could receive 5 to 10 inches of rainfall, with the possibility of more severe inundation in certain areas. Peak storm surge occurring in tandem with high tide could lead to flooding up to 4 feet above ground along the Gulf Coast in Texas and Mexico. The deepest water was predicted near the storm's landfall location and to its north, with storm surge likely accompanied by large, dangerous waves. These conditions are expected to create life-threatening surf and rip currents.\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1 and will run through the end of November. Most storm activity typically occurs from mid-August to mid-October. The terms \"hurricane\" and \"tropical cyclone\" refer to the same type of storm, with \"tropical cyclone\" serving as a broad classification for rotating, low-level cloud systems and thunderstorms over tropical or subtropical waters, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nA tropical cyclone becomes a tropical storm once its maximum wind speeds exceed 39 mph. When sustained winds reach 74 mph or higher, it is classified as a hurricane. As communities along the Gulf Coast prepare for the potential impacts of Tropical Storm Alberto, the importance of understanding and respecting these powerful natural phenomena cannot be overstated.",

Winds were peaking around 40 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami. For Alberto to become a hurricane, sustained winds of 73 mph would have to happen, which isn't likely before the storm moves onto land, forecasters said.\n\n\"Rapid weakening is expected once the center moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico\" on Thursday, the NHC said.\n\nIt's the first real winds of the tropical season, with more assuredly on the way in the upcoming peak months. Some forecasts have even predicted more than double the number of average named storms for the 2024 season, citing a rising La Ni\u00f1a and water temperatures in the runway between Africa and the Gulf of Mexico that are 3.6 to 7 degrees warmer than normal.\n\nFederal forecasters last month predicted an \"extraordinary\" season with as many as 25 named storms possible -- the highest number of named storms the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has predicted.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.\n\nAn early June storm dumped more than 20 inches of rain on parts of South Florida, stranding numerous motorists on flooded streets throughout Broward and Miami-Dade counties. That storm, despite producing a tornado in Martin County, did not have any sustained wind associated with it and never reached name status.\n\nCoastal flooding, not wind, likely biggest threat with Alberto\n\nAlberto was moving west on Wednesday at a slow 9 mph pace. Tropical storm warnings were in effect from the Texas coast at San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande, and from the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\nThe storm is expected to make landfall in northeastern Mexico on Thursday morning with rain and wind reaching Texas and coastal Louisiana, according to the NHC.\n\nAlberto isn't packing a big punch, but it is a relatively large storm, with tropical-storm-force winds extending up to 415 miles north of the center. The hurricane center said heavy rainfall from the storm will reach large regions of Central America, north across northeastern Mexico and into South Texas.\n\nOfficials said the peak storm surge could reach up to 2 to 4 feet, including around Galveston Bay in Texas.\n\nNick Carr, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service (NWS) in Miami, said flooding on the coast will be the biggest threat with Alberto.\n\n\"The wind will be nothing to write home about with this storm,\" he said. \"It's kind of a sprawling, disorganized system that is funneling a lot of water toward the northern part of Mexico and the southern part of Texas. It's a very sloppy, early-season system.\"\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott has activated three platoons of the Lone Star State's National Guard, including more than 40 personnel, 20 vehicles and Chinook helicopters.\n\n\"Texans in at-risk areas are urged to remain vigilant, monitor weather conditions and take necessary precautions to keep themselves and their loved ones safe,\" Abbott said in a statement.\n\nFor now, the coastal city of Houston is not in any significant threat of flooding, but a tropical storm warning does cover coastal counties from just south of Galveston to the U.S.-Mexico border. Tropical storm-force winds with 50-mph gusts are likely along the coast.\n\n\"This rainfall will likely produce considerable flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed river flooding,\" the hurricane center said. \"Life-threatening flooding and mudslides are likely in and near areas of high terrain across the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas, including the cities of Monterrey and Ciudad Victoria.\"\n\nAlberto's arrival on the day before the official first day of summer is a somewhat late start to the season. The last time a storm formed this late into June was 2014 when Arthur formed June 30.\n\nSystem in Atlantic will bring some heavy surf and possible showers to South Florida\n\nMeanwhile, closer to home, an area of showers and thunderstorms a few hundred miles east of the Bahamas is still in the developmental stages. The system, with a surface trough of low pressure, is in environmental conditions that the hurricane center calls \"marginally conducive for some gradual development during the next few days while it moves westward or west-northwestward.\"\n\nThe system is forecast to approach the coast of the southeastern U.S. by Friday, but should veer north of South Florida and move closer to Jacksonville and southern Georgia.\n\nDevelopment chances are low, only 10% to 20% through the next two to seven days. Still, the system could bring some more rainfall to South Florida on Friday and throughout the weekend, but nothing more than an average June weekend in Palm Beach County.\n\nHURRICANE SEASON 2024: Colorado State University updates its seasonal hurricane forecast\n\nJUNE FLOODING: See dramatic images from flash flood, flooding in South Florida, including Fort Lauderdale\n\n2024 HURRICANE SEASON: Five tips to stay sane and safe in face of frightful forecast\n\nAs the southern states deal with rain and wind, much of the nation continues to struggle with record-breaking heat. More than 90 million Americans faced excessive heat watches, warnings or advisories Wednesday, mostly in the Upper Midwest and Northeast.\n\nThe heat could continue in those spots, with \"some monthly

Storm surge there is expected to reach 2 to 4 feet, depending on tide. There was even some street flooding in Louisiana.\n\nForecasters urged people to not focus solely on the storm's forecast track.\n\nThe hurricane center has expanded the tropical storm warning north, to San Luis Pass near Houston.\n\n\"The disturbance is very large with rainfall, coastal flooding, and wind impacts likely to occur far from the center along the coasts of Texas and northeastern Mexico,\" the hurricane center said.\n\nInland in Mexico and South Texas, rainfall could be significant and potentially dangerous, given the mountainous terrain in some of the region.\n\nRainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico into South Texas are possible, with maximum totals of 15 inches. Flash flooding and mudslides are potential hazards.\n\nAs of 2 p.m. Wednesday, a disturbance in the same area of the Gulf of Mexico as Alberto had a 30% chance of forming in the next seven days. It is expected to move slowly northwest and develop over the southwestern Gulf over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, forecasters are watching an area of storminess several hundred miles east of the central Bahamas that could approach the southern U.S. East Coast, potentially including Florida, late this week.\n\nIt has a 20% chance of development over the next two days, with some slow development possible thereafter while the system moves westward or west-northwestward. Forecasters expect the system to reach the east coast by Friday.\n\nThe system is likely to stay north of South Florida, and impact coastal areas farther up the coast.\n\nThe 2024 hurricane season, which officially began June 1, is expected to be extremely active. Monday's watch was the first of the 2024 hurricane season, which forecasters say will be a strong one.\n\nIn its annual May outlook, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that the 2024 hurricane season has an 85% chance of being above normal, with 17 to 25 named storms with minimum sustained winds of 39 mph, and eight to 13 hurricanes. An average year has 14 named storms and seven hurricanes.\n\nIn addition, NOAA has forecast four to seven major hurricanes for 2024, meaning those that are Category 3 or above.\n\nExperts at Colorado State University stated in their 2024 forecast that the U.S. East Coast, including Florida, had a 34% chance of a major hurricane making landfall this year. The average from 1880-2020 was 21%.\n\nForecasters say that the record-warm water temperatures that now cover much of the Atlantic Ocean will continue into peak hurricane season from August to October. That warm water fuels hurricanes. By early June, the tropical Atlantic was already as hot as it usually is in mid-August -- peak hurricane season.\n\n(Sun Sentinel staff writer Robin Webb contributed to this report.)", "source":

Flash flooding and mudslides are potential hazards.\n\nStorm surge also is a concern, particularly along the flatter areas of the Texas coast. Galveston Bay could see 2 to 4 feet of surge.\n\nSeparate from the potential tropical storm, forecasters are also watching two other potential systems, one of which could affect Florida.\n\nAs of 8 a.m. Wednesday, a disturbance in the same area of the Gulf of Mexico as the potential tropical storm had a 30% chance of forming in the next seven days.

Meteorologists are now monitoring the storm and have placed tropical storm warnings on areas that the Alberto is expected to hit.\n\nAccording to AccuWeather, activity has increased in the Atlantic as \"warm waters across portions of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico have helped to promote prime conditions for tropical development this week.\"\n\nMexico is directly in the path of Tropical Storm Alberto's eye, but nearby Texas is also expected to get a taste of the storm's wrath. It is expected to make landfall in northeastern Mexico early Thursday morning, with the most affected areas being the Texas Gulf Coast and the northeastern coast of Mexico. Meteorologists have warned that tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning area within 36 hours.\n\n\"Abnormally warm waters and a pocket of relatively low wind shear located in the Bay of Campeche allowed for Alberto to gain enough organization on Wednesday to be upgraded to tropical storm status,\" explained AccuWeather Meteorologist and Lead Hurricane Forecaster Alex DaSilva.\n\nUsually, the first named storm of the Atlantic Hurricane Season forms around June 20. Tropical Storm Alberto became a tropical storm around June 19, which means that this season is progressing right on schedule.\n\nAs Tropical Storm Alberto approaches land, areas around the gulf coasts of Texas and Mexico are expected to receive rain and a lot of it, together with some strong winds and maybe even some flooding.\n\nREAD MORE: New Atlantic Hurricane Season Could Spell A Lot More Hurricanes This Year\n\nThe Weather Channel stated that Texas can expect some \"Flooding rain, coastal flooding, gusty winds, high surf, rip currents, and isolated tornadoes.\" Meanwhile, Mexico is also expected to experience the same but with the added danger of mudslides.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto may strengthen slightly before it makes landfall, and its impact will extend far from the center. The storm is expected to continue moving westward with winds of 39 miles per hour (mph) or greater in the warning areas, which include Brownsville and Corpus Christi.\n\nHeavy rains are expected along the Rio Grande and the Big Bend region, with rains expected to reach areas such as Austin, San Antonio, and Houston. So far, no hurricane warning has been issued.\n\nAs for Mexico, several governors whose states are on the storm's paths are already bracing themselves as the heavy rains could bring in mudslides and flash flooding. The most affected states may be Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo Leon.\n\nTamaulipas Gov. Am\u00e9rico Villarreal has announced on X that schools across the state will remain closed between Wednesday and Friday, while Tamaulipas Civil Protection Coordinator Luis Gerardo Gonzalez announced that they have 333 shelters distributed throughout the state at each municipality and they will open upa more shelters as the hurricane moves.\n\nREAD NEXT: Texas Floods: Young Boy Dead as Search and

Storm surge there is expected to reach 2 to 4 feet, depending on tide.\n\nForecasters urged people to not focus solely on the storm's forecast track.\n\nThe hurricane center has expanded the tropical storm warning north, to San Luis Pass near Houston.\n\n\"The disturbance is very large with rainfall, coastal flooding, and wind impacts likely to occur far from the center along the coasts of Texas and northeastern Mexico,\" the hurricane center said.\n\nInland in Mexico and South Texas, rainfall could be significant and potentially dangerous, given the mountainous terrain in some of the region.\n\nRainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico into South Texas are possible, with maximum totals of 15 inches. Flash flooding and mudslides are potential hazards.\n\nAdditional systems\n\nAs of 8 a.m. Wednesday, a disturbance in the same area of the Gulf of Mexico as Alberto had a 30% chance of forming in the next seven days. It is expected to move slowly northwest and is expected to develop over the southwestern Gulf over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, forecasters are watching an area of storminess several hundred miles east of the central Bahamas and could approach the southern U.S. East Coast, potentially including Florida, late this week.\n\nIt has a 20% chance of development over the next seven days, with some slow development possible thereafter while the system moves westward or west-northwestward.\n\nThe systems is likely to stay north of South Florida, and impact coastal areas farther up the coast.\n\nThe 2024 hurricane season, which officially began June 1, is expected to be extremely active. Monday's watch was the first of the 2024 hurricane season, which forecasters say will be a strong one.\n\nIn its annual May outlook, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that the 2024 hurricane season has an 85% chance of being above normal, with 17 to 25 named storms with minimum sustained winds of 39 mph, and eight to 13 hurricanes. An average year has 14 named storms and seven hurricanes.\n\nIn addition, NOAA has forecast four to seven major hurricanes for 2024, meaning those that are Category 3 or above.\n\nExperts at Colorado State University stated in their 2024 forecast that the U.S. East Coast, including Florida, had a 34% chance of a major hurricane making landfall this year. The average from 1880-2020 was 21%.\n\nForecasters say that the record-warm water temperatures that now cover much of the Atlantic Ocean will continue into peak hurricane season from August to October. That warm water fuels hurricanes. By early June, the tropical Atlantic was already as hot as it usually is in mid-August -- peak hurricane season.\n\n(Sun Sentinel staff writer Robin Webb contributed to this report.)", "source":

The storm is forecast to reach the coast of northeastern Mexico by late Wednesday or early Thursday, according to the latest advisory from the National Hurricane Center.\n\nMeanwhile, the NHC is tracking two more disturbances in the Gulf of Mexico and the southwestern Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida.\n\nHeavy rain from Potential Tropical Cyclone One is already impacting parts of southern Mexico and northern portions of Central America, and portions of Texas are starting to feel it, the NHC said. The system is moving west-northwest and is expected to move further west and pick up speed Wednesday.\n\nTropical storm warnings have been issued for the Texas coast from San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande and for the northeastern coast of Mexico.\n\nForecasters predict considerable flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed river flooding, including potentially life-threatening flooding and mudslides in and near areas of higher terrain across the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas. Swells generated by the disturbance will affect the coast of Louisiana and Texas as well as northeastern Mexico through early Thursday. These swells are likely to cause life threatening surf and rip current conditions.\n\n\u27a4 Track all active storms\n\nMeanwhile, forecasters still have their eyes on a low-pressure area off the east coast of Florida with a low chance of development.\n\n\"This appears to be a quick-moving and compact low-pressure area that will be moving westward into northeastern Florida or perhaps as far north as southeastern Georgia on Thursday,\" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Pydynowski said. The storm's speed limits its development potential but it still could bring more rain, gusty winds and dangerous surf to the southeast Atlantic coast, forecasters said.\n\nAnother broad area of low pressure is forecast to develop over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico this weekend, the NHC said and it could gradually develop through early next week.\n\nSpecial note on the NHC cone: The forecast track shows the most likely path of the center of the storm. It does not illustrate the full width of the storm or its impacts, and the center of the storm is likely to travel outside the cone up to 33% of the time.\n\nForecast, impact: Potential Tropical Cyclone One expected to strengthen before landfall. See spaghetti models\n\nSpaghetti models for Potential Tropical Cyclone One\n\n\u27a4 Track Potential Tropical Cyclone One\n\nSpecial note about spaghetti models: Illustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal. The hurricane center uses only the top four or five highest performing models to help make its forecasts.\n\nWhat is out there and how likely are they to strengthen?\n\nSouthwestern Atlantic:\n\nAn area of showers and thunderstorms located several hundred miles east of the Bahamas is associated with a surface trough of low pressure interacting with an upper-level trough. Environmental conditions are marginally conducive for some gradual development of this system during the next few days while it moves westward or west-northwestward. The system is forecast to approach the coast of the southeastern United States by the latter part of this week.\n\nSouthwestern Gulf of Mexico:\n\nAnother broad area of low pressure is forecast to develop over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico this weekend. Environmental conditions are expected to be conducive for gradual development of this system through early next week while it moves slowly west-northwestward or northwestward.\n\nWho is likely to be impacted?\n\nPotential Tropical Cyclone One is expected to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico into South Texas, with maximum totals of 15 inches possible. This rainfall will likely produce considerable flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed river flooding. Mudslides are also possible in areas of higher terrain across northeast Mexico.\n\nTropical storm conditions are expected within the warning area Wednesday. A couple of tornadoes are possible Wednesday into the evening across parts of Deep South Texas and Southeast Texas. Swells generated by the disturbance will affect the coast of Texas and northeastern Mexico through early Thursday.\n\nForecasters urge all residents to continue monitoring the tropics and to always be prepared. That advice is particularly important for what is expected to be a very active hurricane season.\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30.\n\nWhen is the peak of hurricane season?\n\nThe peak of the season is Sept. 10, with the most activity happening between mid-August and mid-October, according to the Hurricane Center.\n\nNational Hurricane Center map: What are forecasters watching now?\n\nSystems currently being monitored by the National Hurricane Center include:\n\nInteractive map: Hurricanes, tropical storms that have passed near your city\n\nWe will continue to update our tropical weather coverage daily.

The storm is forecast to reach the coast of northeastern Mexico by late Wednesday or early Thursday, according to the latest advisory from the National Hurricane Center.\n\nHeavy rain from this system is already impacting parts of southern Mexico and northern portions of Central America, and portions of Texas are starting to feel it, the NHC said. The system is moving west-northwest and is expected to move further west and pick up speed Wednesday.\n\nTropical storm warnings have been issued for the Texas coast from San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande and for the northeastern coast of Mexico.\n\nForecasters predict considerable flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed river flooding, including potentially life-threatening flooding and mudslides in and near areas of higher terrain across the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas. Swells generated by the disturbance will affect the coast of Louisiana and Texas as well as northeastern Mexico through early Thursday. These swells are likely to cause life threatening surf and rip current conditions.\n\nMeanwhile, forecasters still have their eyes on a low-pressure area off the east coast of Florida with a low chance of development.\n\n\"This appears to be a quick-moving and compact low-pressure area that will be moving westward into northeastern Florida or perhaps as far north as southeastern Georgia on Thursday,\" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Pydynowski said. The storm's speed limits its development potential but it still could bring more rain, gusty winds and dangerous surf to the southeast Atlantic coast, forecasters said.\n\nSpecial note on the NHC cone: The forecast track shows the most likely path of the center of the storm. It does not illustrate the full width of the storm or its impacts, and the center of the storm is likely to travel outside the cone up to 33% of the time.\n\nForecast, impact:Potential Tropical Cyclone One expected to strengthen before landfall. See spaghetti models\n\nSpaghetti models for Potential Tropical Cyclone One\n\n\u27a4 Track Potential Tropical Cyclone One\n\nSpecial note about spaghetti models: Illustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal. The hurricane center uses only the top four or five highest performing models to help make its forecasts.\n\nWhat is out there and how likely are they to strengthen?\n\nSouthwestern Atlantic:\n\nAn area of showers and thunderstorms located several hundred miles east of the Bahamas is associated with a surface trough of low pressure interacting with an upper-level trough. Environmental conditions are marginally conducive for some gradual development of this system during the next few days while it moves westward or west-northwestward. The system is forecast to approach the coast of the southeastern United States by the latter part of this week.\n\nSouthwestern Gulf of Mexico:\n\nAnother broad area of low pressure is forecast to develop over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico this weekend. Environmental conditions are expected to be conducive for gradual development of this system through early next week while it moves slowly west-northwestward or northwestward.\n\nWho is likely to be impacted?\n\nPotential Tropical Cyclone One is expected to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico into South Texas, with maximum totals of 15 inches possible. This rainfall will likely produce considerable flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed river flooding. Mudslides are also possible in areas of higher terrain across northeast Mexico.\n\nTropical storm conditions are expected within the warning area Wednesday. A couple of tornadoes are possible Wednesday into the evening across parts of Deep South Texas and Southeast Texas. Swells generated by the disturbance will affect the coast of Texas and northeastern Mexico through early Thursday.\n\nForecasters urge all residents to continue monitoring the tropics and to always be prepared. That advice is particularly important for what is expected to be a very active hurricane season.\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30.\n\nWhen is the peak of hurricane season?\n\nThe peak of the season is Sept. 10, with the most activity happening between mid-August and mid-October, according to the Hurricane Center.\n\nNational Hurricane Center map: What are forecasters watching now?\n\nSystems currently being monitored by the National Hurricane Center include:\n\nInteractive map: Hurricanes, tropical storms that have passed near your city\n\nWe will continue to update our tropical weather coverage daily.

There is a tropical disturbance in the Bay of Campeche that is likely to become a tropical depression or a tropical storm by sometime Wednesday. If the disturbance strengthens to a tropical storm, it will get the name \"Alberto\", which is the 1st named storm of the 2024 Hurricane Season.\n\nRight now the disturbance is called a Potential Tropical Cyclone. Which means it has a very good chance of becoming a tropical depression or storm soon. This also allows the National Hurricane Center to issue a forecast cone or track along with watches or warnings.\n\nThe center of the storm will track into Mexico between Tampico and Brownsville, Texas late Wednesday night into early Thursday morning.\n\nHowever, areas well away from the center of the storm will see heavy rainfall and even storm surge.\n\nHeavy rain will be the main concern with this system. Even if it never forms into tropical storm, heavy rain and possible flooding will be headed to parts of Texas and Mexico.\n\nHighest rainfall totals Wednesday into Thursday will be in South Texas and northern Mexico where 7 to 10 inches of rainfall is possible. Totals taper off farther north, but areas between San Antonio and Corpus Christi can expect between 4 to 7 inches. Along and south of I-10 will see the highest of the rainfall totals.\n\nRounds of heavy rain and high rainfall totals could cause flooding issues in those areas.\n\nEven though the center of the storm will pass well south of most of the Texas Coast, storm surge is possible for areas along the coast. Mostly between 1 to 3 feet, but areas in and around Galveston could see surge from around 2 to 4 feet.\n\nFor this reason along with the chance for gusty winds, a Tropical Storm Warning has been issued for most of the Texas coastline.\n\nWe won't see much from this storm. A few passing showers are possible Wednesday along with some increased cloud cover. That cloud cover will actually be beneficial as it will help keep the afternoon summer heat in check.", "source": {"uri": "wfaa.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFAA-TV Channel 8"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_scales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone scales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Campeche", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bay of Campeche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_surge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Storm surge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownsville,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brownsville, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brownsville, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_10", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interstate 10"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone warnings and watches"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_Christi,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corpus Christi, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Corpus Christi, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Surge_Protectors", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Surge Protectors", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Flowers/Fresh_Cut", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Flowers/Fresh Cut", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 27}], "image": "https://media.wfaa.com/assets/WFAA/images/f3bce473-9df7-48f0-899e-c7c5676cf43e/20240619T015333/f3bce473-9df7-48f0-899e-c7c5676cf43e_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659946", "eventUri": "eng-9659946", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 41, "textEnd": 49}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Gulf system could become 1st tropical storm", "body": "Forecasters say a tropical system is likely to develop in the Gulf of Mexico this week as hurricane season kicks off.\n\nThe tropics are heating up, with the National Hurricane Center keeping an eye on two disturbances in addition to Potential Tropical Cyclone One, according to the latest advisory from the National Hurricane Center.\n\nTropical storm warnings are in effect for portions of Texas ahead of Potential Tropical Cyclone One, which is expected to become a tropical storm before making landfall late Wednesday.\n\nThe large storm -- which has tropical-storm-force winds extending 290 miles northeast from the center -- could be a rainmaker, bringing 5-10 inches of rain and up to 15 inches to some locations, according to the National Hurricane Center. AccuWeather predicted some areas could see up to 30 inches.\n\nIf it does become a tropical storm, it'll become the first named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, Alberto. To become a tropical storm, maximum sustained winds must reach at least 39 mph.\n\nFuture Tropical Storm Alberto? Potential Tropical Cyclone One expected to strengthen before landfall. See spaghetti models\n\nThe National Hurricane Center also is monitoring two other systems: a disturbance east of Florida with a low chance for development and another area in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico close to where Potential Tropical Cyclone One is.\n\nSpecial note on the NHC cone: The forecast track shows the most likely path of the center of the storm. It does not illustrate the full width of the storm or its impacts, and the center of the storm is likely to travel outside the cone up to 33% of the time.\n\nForecast, impact: Potential Tropical Cyclone One expected to strengthen before landfall. See spaghetti models\n\nSpaghetti models for Potential Tropical Cyclone One\n\n\u27a4 Track Potential Tropical Cyclone One\n\nSpecial note about spaghetti models: Illustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal. The hurricane center uses only the top four or five highest performing models to help make its forecasts.\n\nWhat is out there and how likely are they to strengthen?\n\nSouthwestern Atlantic: An area of cloudiness and showers located several hundred miles east of the Bahamas is associated with a surface trough and an upper-level area of low pressure.\n\nEnvironmental conditions could be conducive for some gradual development of this system during the next few days while it moves west or west-northwest. The system is forecast to approach the coast of the southeastern United States on Friday.\n\nSouthwestern Gulf of Mexico: Another broad area of low pressure is forecast to develop over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico this weekend.\n\nEnvironmental conditions are expected to be conducive for gradual development of this system early next week while it moves slowly north or northwest.\n\n\"With warm waters and low shear still present in the southern Gulf of Mexico and northwestern Caribbean next weekend, yet another opportunity for tropical development may present itself,\" said AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Pydynowski.\n\nDepending on environmental conditions, \"any moisture from this area may again funnel into the Gulf Coast for the last week of June,\" AccuWeather said.\n\nWho is likely to be impacted?\n\nPotential Tropical Cyclone One: This system is expected to strengthen and is likely to become a tropical storm by Wednesday before approaching the western Gulf Coast late Wednesday. Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning area by Wednesday.\n\nPotential Tropical Cyclone One is expected to bring 5 to 10 inches of rain across South Texas and into northeastern Mexico, with up to 15 inches possible, NHC forecasters said. AccuWeather forecasters said up to 30 inches may be possible in some locations.\n\nThe Weather Channel meteorologist Jim Cantore warned \"double digit rainfall totals likely along the coastal counties of TX and potentially Houston.\"\n\nAtlantic: \"This appears to be a quick-moving and compact low-pressure area that will be moving westward into northeastern Florida or perhaps as far north as southeastern Georgia on Thursday,\" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Pydynowski said.\n\nA stronger storm could bring gusty winds, especially to coastal locations. A less organized storm would bring rough surf and downpours from the northern Bahamas to the Southeast Atlantic coast, AccuWeather said.\n\nGulf of Mexico: \"Depending on the wind pattern in the atmosphere, any moisture from this area may again funnel into the Gulf Coast for the last week of June,\" according to AccuWeather. \"Given the expected rain in the coming week, the risk for localized flooding may increase.\"\n\nForecasters urge all residents to continue monitoring the tropics and to always be prepared. That advice is particularly important for what is expected to be a very active hurricane season.\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30.\n\nWhen is the peak of hurricane season?\n\nThe peak of the season is Sept. 10, with the most activity happening between mid-August and mid-October, according to the Hurricane Center.\n\nNational Hurricane Center map: What are forecasters watching now?\n\nSystems currently being monitored by the National Hurricane Center include:\n\nInteractive map: Hurricanes, tropical storms that have passed near your city\n\nWe will continue to update our tropical weather coverage daily.

It is expected to develop over the southwestern Gulf over the weekend and move slowly west-northwest or northwest.\n\nMeanwhile, forecasters are watching an area of storminess several hundred miles east of the northwestern Bahamas that could approach the southern U.S. East Coast, potentially including Florida, late this week.\n\nAs of 8 a.m. Thursday, it has a 40% chance of development over the next two days, with some slow development possible thereafter while the system moves west-northwestward. Forecasters expect the system to reach the east coast by Friday.\n\nThe system is likely to stay north of South Florida, and impact coastal areas farther up the coast.\n\n\"For the most part we really aren't expecting any significant impacts to South Florida from this system,\" a forecaster for the National Weather Service Miami said Thursday.\n\nAlberto should weaken quickly, and likely dissipate over Mexico later Thursday, the hurricane center said in its 11 a.m. update. However, it continues to bring flooding and rain to areas of Texas and Mexico.\n\n\"Alberto remains a large system and continues to produce moderate coastal flooding across portions of southern Texas, given the onshore wind flow,\" forecasters said. \"Heavy rainfall associated with Alberto will continue to impact northeastern Mexico throughout the day today, with considerable flash and urban flooding likely.\"\n\nThe National Hurricane Center has discontinued all tropical storm warnings in Mexico. It had previously issued a warning stretching from the Mexico border north along the Gulf Coast to near Houston.\n\nThe storm was causing coastal flooding near Galveston, Texas, 500 miles away from its likely landfall in Mexico. Storm surge there is expected to reach 2 to 4 feet, depending on tide. There was even some street flooding in Louisiana.\n\nA few tornadoes are also possible Thursday night in lower South Texas and southeast areas of the state, the NHC said.\n\nInland in Mexico and South Texas, rainfall could be significant and potentially dangerous, given the mountainous terrain in some of the region.\n\nRainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico into South Texas were possible, with maximum totals of 20 inches in areas of Mexico with higher terrain, the NHC said Wednesday night. Flash flooding and mudslides are potential hazards.\n\nThe 2024 hurricane season, which officially began June 1, is expected to be extremely active.\n\nIn its annual May outlook, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that the 2024 hurricane season has an 85% chance of being above normal, with 17 to 25 named storms with minimum sustained winds of 39 mph, and eight to 13 hurricanes. An average year has 14 named storms and seven hurricanes.\n\nIn addition, NOAA has forecast four to seven major hurricanes for 2024, meaning those that are Category 3 or above.\n\nExperts at Colorado State University stated in their 2024 forecast that the U.S. East Coast, including Florida, had a 34% chance of a major hurricane making landfall this year. The average from 1880-2020 was 21%.\n\nForecasters say that the record-warm water temperatures that now cover much of the Atlantic Ocean will continue into peak hurricane season from August to October. That warm water fuels hurricanes.

The latter could affect coastal northern Florida on Friday.\n\nOnce inland, Alberto is forecast to weaken quickly and likely dissipate over Mexico by Thursday night, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nAlberto is a large, slow-moving tropical storm, with tropical-storm-force winds extending outward up to 275 miles north of the center.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center has issued a tropical storm warning for the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\nThe storm had caused coastal flooding near Galveston, Texas, where storm surge was expected to reach 2 to 4 feet, depending on tide. There was even some street flooding in Louisiana.\n\nRain in Texas is expected to diminish Thursday, with an inch or less expected, the NHC said.\n\nInland in Mexico rainfall could continue to be significant and potentially dangerous, given the mountainous terrain in some of the region.\n\nRainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico are possible, with maximum totals of 20 inches in areas with higher terrain, the NHC said. Flash flooding and mudslides are potential hazards.\n\nA disturbance in the same area of the Gulf of Mexico as Alberto could become a tropical depression this weekend. As of 2 a.m. Thursday, it has a 50% chance of developing in the next seven days and a 10% chance it the next two days.\n\nMeanwhile, forecasters are watching an area of storminess several hundred miles east of the northern Bahamas that could approach northeastern Florida or southern Georgia early Friday.\n\nAs of 2 a.m. Thursday, it has a 30% chance of development over the next two days, with some slow development possible thereafter while the system moves west-northwest..\n\nThe system is likely too far north to impact South Florida.\n\nThe 2024 hurricane season, which officially began June 1, is expected to be extremely active.\n\nIn its annual May outlook, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that the 2024 hurricane season has an 85% chance of being above normal, with 17 to 25 named storms with minimum sustained winds of 39 mph, and eight to 13 hurricanes. An average year has 14 named storms and seven hurricanes.\n\nIn addition, NOAA has forecast four to seven major hurricanes for 2024, meaning those that are Category 3 or above.\n\nExperts at Colorado State University stated in their 2024 forecast that the U.S. East Coast, including Florida, had a 34% chance of a major hurricane making landfall this year. The average from 1880-2020 was 21%.\n\nForecasters say that the record-warm water temperatures that now cover much of the Atlantic Ocean will continue into peak hurricane season from August to October. That warm water fuels hurricanes. By early June, the tropical Atlantic was already as hot as it usually is in mid-August -- peak hurricane season.\n\nHurricane season officially ends Nov. 30.", "source": {"uri": "sun-sentinel.com",

It would be named Alberto.\n\nForecasters said it could bring heavy rains, coastal flooding and gusty winds to the Texas and northeastern Mexico coasts through Thursday. Alberto is likely to reach the Mexican coast late Wednesday or early Thursday.\n\nA Tropical Storm Warning was issued for the Texas coast from the San Luis Pass south to the mouth of the Rio Grande and the northeastern coast of Mexico from the Rio Grande mouth to Puerto de Altamira.\n\nRainfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches are possible across northeast Mexico into southern Texas, with maximum totals of 15 inches, and they'd probably result in \"considerable flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed river flooding. Mudslides are also possible in areas of higher terrain across northeast Mexico,\" meteorologists said. A storm surge as high as four feet might hit parts of the Texas coast.\n\nThe disturbance was \"quite large\" early Wednesday, the hurricane center noted, with tropical-storm-force winds extending up to 415 miles to the north of the system's center.\n\nAs of 4 a.m. CDT, the center was some 315 miles southeast of Brownsville, Texas and moving west-northwest at 8 mph with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph.\n\nThe hurricane center upgraded what had been the season's first tropical storm watch to a tropical storm warning at 4 a.m. CT on Tuesday. Three hours later, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for the parts of the country's northeastern coast, south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Puerto de Altamira, replacing the tropical storm watch previously in effect there. The difference accounts for timing -- forecasters will generally issue a \"watch\" when tropical storm conditions are possible in the impacted area within roughly 48 hours, and a \"warning\" when the conditions become more imminent, about 36 hours out.\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season officially began June 1 and runs through the end of November, with most storm activity typically happening during the later months of that window, between mid-August and mid-October. The terms hurricane and tropical cyclone can refer to the same kind of storm, with meteorologists using tropical cyclone as a broad classification that includes any weather phenomenon where rotating, low-level cloud systems and thunderstorms develop over tropical or subtropical waters, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nA tropical cyclone is categorized more specifically as a tropical storm once its maximum wind speeds exceed 39 mph. When sustained winds reach 74 mph or higher, it becomes a hurricane.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone warnings and watches"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_delta", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "River delta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Luis_Pass_(Galveston_Island)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Luis Pass (Galveston Island)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_flooding", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coastal flooding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_flooding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Urban flooding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_surge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Storm surge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownsville,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brownsville, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brownsville, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subtropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maximum sustained wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic hurricane"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Flowers/Fresh_Cut", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Flowers/Fresh Cut", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/19/bb4c2c05-a0a5-4882-ae65-0f952b9b487c/thumbnail/1200x630/df1040f958e8f5192e507fb541035f5c/possible-tropical-storm-alberto-061824-gulf-of-mexico.jpg?v=5842509bb796a146f9b20d3e8b03dac6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659946", "eventUri": "eng-9659946", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 2083, "textEnd": 2089}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

The hurricane center expects it to also track slowly to the north or northwest, and the weather service said it could stay to the south of Alabama.\n\nHowever, forecasters will be keeping a close eye on it in case that changes.\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season began June 1 and will last until Nov. 30.

With winds of 50 mph and moving west at 13 mph, the storm is expected to soon make landfall, and will impact Mexico and south Texas.\n\nHeavy rain, coastal, flooding and gusty rain will continue to threaten portions of southeast Louisiana, but these indirect symptoms of Alberto should slow down by Saturday.\n\nSecond disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico\n\nNHC forecasters have been monitoring another disturbance in the Gulf since Tuesday and predict that it will form over southeastern Mexico and northern Central America Friday. The disturbance could gradually develop as it moves over the Bay of Campeche Saturday, then form into a tropical storm once it's in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe system has a 20% chance of developing into a tropical storm within the next 2 days. The chance of formation within the next week is 50%, a 20% jump compared to yesterday's forecast.\n\nThere is another disturbance in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean that continues to create disorganized showers and thunderstorms.

Alberto is the first named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nThe storm is set to bring heavy rain, coastal flooding, and tropical storm force winds are likely along the Texas coast, according to the U.S. National Weather Service.\n\nA Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for the Texas coast from San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla. Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area by Wednesday.\n\nAlberto is forecast to bring heavy rain and coastal flooding to much of the western Gulf Coast.

If something does develop, it likely stays to our north and doesn't impact us.\n\nThere could be more moisture moving this way, however, so rain chances increase a bit later this week.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts the hurricane season that began June 1 and runs through Nov. 30 is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms.

He said some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nTamaulipas Gov. Am\u00e9rico Villarreal said Wednesday on X, formerly Twitter, that schools across the state will remain closed from Wednesday through Friday.\n\nThe storm was moving west at 9 mph. Tropical storm warnings were in effect from the Texas coast at San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande and from the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\n\"Rapid weakening is expected once the center moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico\"today, the center said.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday, the NWS said, there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nNOAA predicts the hurricane season that began June 1 and runs through Nov. 30 is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.\n\nBrennan said the first named system in the Atlantic on average comes on June 20, so Alberto is \"about right on schedule.\"\n\nIn the Village of Surfside Beach, located on a barrier island on the Texas coast about 65 miles south of Houston, Mayor Gregg Bisso said Wednesday that rains had already left about 2 feet of water on streets on the west end of the island, making them impassable.\n\n\"We're on a barrier island and there's no place for the rain to go, plus the extremely high tides, everything is just hanging right there and it's flooding all the streets,\" Bisso said, adding that double red flags have been placed on the beach to warn people that no one should be in the water because of the extreme rip tides.\n\n\"Those conditions were extremely bad out there yesterday, and today,\" he said.\n\nAll of the homes on the island are elevated anywhere from 10-14 feet above the ground, so they don't expect homes to flood and evacuations were not ordered.\n\n\"We're just waiting for the rains to stop and the tide to go down,\" he said.\n\nBrennan said there will be dangerous rip currents from the storm and drivers should watch out for road closures and turn around if they see water covering roadways.\n\nA no-name storm earlier in June dumped more than 20 inches of rain on parts of South Florida, stranding numerous motorists on flooded streets and pushing water into some homes in low-lying areas.\n\n\"People underestimate the power of water and they sometimes don't always take rainfall and the threats that come with it seriously, especially if you are driving in an area and you see water covering the road, you don't want to drive into it,\" Brennan said. \"You don't know how deep the water is. The road may be washed out. it doesn't take but just a few inches of water that are moving to move your car.\"\n\nRoy Quiroz and his wife, Minda, cross a flooded section of The Strand near Kempner Street as rain falls Wednesday, June 19, 2024, in Galveston, Texas.

It is expected to develop over the southwestern Gulf over the weekend and move slowly west-northwest or northwest.\n\nMeanwhile, forecasters are watching an area of storminess several hundred miles east of the northwestern Bahamas that could approach the southern U.S. East Coast, potentially including Florida, late this week.\n\nAs of 8 a.m. Thursday, it has a 40% chance of development over the next two days, with some slow development possible thereafter while the system moves west-northwestward. Forecasters expect the system to reach the east coast by Friday.\n\nThe system is likely to stay north of South Florida, and impact coastal areas farther up the coast.\n\n\"For the most part we really aren't expecting any significant impacts to South Florida from this system,\" a forecaster for the National Weather Service Miami said Thursday.\n\nFirst named storm of season\n\nAlberto should weaken quickly, and likely dissipate over Mexico later Thursday, the hurricane center said in its 11 a.m. update. However, it continues to bring flooding and rain to areas of Texas and Mexico.\n\n\"Alberto remains a large system and continues to produce moderate coastal flooding across portions of southern Texas, given the onshore wind flow,\" forecasters said. \"Heavy rainfall associated with Alberto will continue to impact northeastern Mexico throughout the day today, with considerable flash and urban flooding likely.\"\n\nThe National Hurricane Center has discontinued all tropical storm warnings in Mexico. It had previously issued a warning stretching from the Mexico border north along the Gulf Coast to near Houston.\n\nThe storm was causing coastal flooding near Galveston, Texas, 500 miles away from its likely landfall in Mexico. Storm surge there is expected to reach 2 to 4 feet, depending on tide. There was even some street flooding in Louisiana.\n\nA few tornadoes are also possible Thursday night in lower South Texas and southeast areas of the state, the NHC said.\n\nInland in Mexico and South Texas, rainfall could be significant and potentially dangerous, given the mountainous terrain in some of the region.\n\nRainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico into South Texas were possible, with maximum totals of 20 inches in areas of Mexico with higher terrain, the NHC said Wednesday night. Flash flooding and mudslides are potential hazards.\n\n2024 season\n\nThe 2024 hurricane season, which officially began June 1, is expected to be extremely active.\n\nIn its annual May outlook, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that the 2024 hurricane season has an 85% chance of being above normal, with 17 to 25 named storms with minimum sustained winds of 39 mph, and eight to 13 hurricanes. An average year has 14 named storms and seven hurricanes.\n\nIn addition, NOAA has forecast four to seven major hurricanes for 2024, meaning those that are Category 3 or above.\n\nExperts at Colorado State University stated in their 2024 forecast that the U.S. East Coast, including Florida, had a 34% chance of a major hurricane making landfall this year. The average from 1880-2020 was 21%.\n\nForecasters say that the record-warm water temperatures that now cover much of the Atlantic Ocean will continue into peak hurricane season from August to October. That warm water fuels hurricanes. By early June, the tropical Atlantic was already as hot as it usually is in mid-August -- peak hurricane season.\n\nHurricane season officially ends Nov. 30.\n\n\u00a92024 South Florida Sun Sentinel.

Flooding rain, coastal flooding, rip currents and high surf will affect much of the western Gulf coast, from Texas to Mexico.\n\nThis system has been dubbed Potential Tropical Cyclone One by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). This naming procedure allows the NHC to issue advisories, watches and warnings and a forecast path for a system that hasn't yet developed but poses a threat of tropical-storm-force winds to land areas within 48 hours.\n\nThe disturbance is centered more than 400 miles southeast of Brownsville, Texas, and is moving to the north.\n\nIf the system organizes into a tropical storm, it would be named Alberto. The NHC predicts the system will organize into a tropical storm sometime late Tuesday or early Wednesday.\n\nThis system will gain some modest strength before tracking into eastern Mexico Wednesday evening. However, impacts will arrive well ahead of that landfall, and they will spread far to the system's north across Texas.\n\nA tropical storm warning has been issued for the Texas coast from Port O'Connor southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande. A tropical storm warning also extends southward from there into northeast Mexico.\n\nThis means tropical storm conditions (winds 39 mph or greater) are expected in the warning area within 36 hours, or in this case by Wednesday.\n\nHeavy rainfall in Texas and northeast Mexico will be the most widespread impact from this system regardless of how well organized it becomes. Totals from South Texas into northeast Mexico could be 5 to 10 inches, with locally higher amounts possible.\n\nFlash flooding is a possibility in coastal and South Texas, including in Brownsville, Corpus Christi, Houston and San Antonio. Flooding and mudslides are likely across eastern Mexico, as well.\n\nPersistent east winds to the north of the system will continue to generate swells that push toward the Texas and Mexico coasts.\n\nMinor to moderate coastal flooding is expected beginning Tuesday and lasting through midweek, especially at times of high tide. Storm surge could peak at 2 to 4 feet along a part of the upper Texas coast, including Galveston Bay, if the peak surge coincides with high tide.", "source": {"uri": "endtimeheadlines.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "End Time Headlines"}, "authors": [{"uri": "end_time_headlines@endtimeheadlines.org", "name": "End Time Headlines", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone warnings and watches"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_flooding", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coastal flooding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip_current", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rip current"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_O'Connor,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Port O'Connor, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Port O'Connor, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownsville,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brownsville, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brownsville, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Galveston Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_surge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Storm surge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flash flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_Christi,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corpus Christi, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Corpus Christi, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Lindenmayer_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Lindenmayer Systems", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Flowers/Fresh_Cut", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Flowers/Fresh Cut", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://endtimeheadlines.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/shutterstock_2395636407.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659946", "eventUri": "eng-9659946", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Tropical storm warnings were in effect from the Texas coast at San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande and from the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\n\"Rapid weakening is expected once the centre moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico\" on Thursday, the NHC said.\n\nThe US National Weather Service (NWS) said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday, the NWS said, there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts the hurricane season, which began June 1 and runs through November 30, is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms.

The storm is expected to continue inland as the day goes on.\n\nThe storm is moving at a rate of about 13 miles per hour, the hurricane center said in a briefing, with maximum sustained winds of 45 miles per hour. As of late Thursday morning, Tropical Storm Alberto was about 25 miles west of Tampico, Mexico, and 255 miles south of Brownsville, Texas. Rain was falling on both sides of the border.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto is expected to dissipate as it moves across Mexico, the NHC said, forecasting that the storm will disappear sometime Thursday or overnight.\n\nFifty-one Texas counties are under a disaster declaration as the storm moves across Mexico.\n\nMaps from the National Hurricane Center show Alberto dropping rain across Mexico and parts of Texas. Photos and videos show flooded streets in the region. Wind and flooding conditions are expected to improve throughout the day, especially in Galveston and Corpus Christi.\n\nParts of Mexico near Tamaulipas may see between 12 and 16 inches of rain, according to the NHC. Broader swaths of the country, including much of the Veracruz and Oaxaca regions, are forecast to see up to four inches of rainfall.\n\nIn the United States, the worst rain was expected near Laredo, Texas. The border city is in a region forecast to receive up to four inches of rain. Other parts of the state, including areas near Corpus Christi and San Antonio, may see up to two inches of rainfall.\n\nOther parts of Texas were prepared for storm surge and flooding. Much of the border and southeastern coast of Texas have at least a 5% chance of flash flooding, according to the NHC. In the Roswell area, there is at least a 15% risk of such flooding.\n\nAlong Texas' eastern coast, areas are bracing for storm surge of at least a foot. Between Sargent and the mouth of the Rio Grande, the NHC forecast a storm surge of between one and three feet. Similar storm surge is expected between Sabine Pass and the Vermilion/Cameron Parish Line.

Tropical Storm Alberto has formed in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico, the first named storm of what is forecast to be a busy hurricane season. (Jason Fochtman/Houston Chronicle via AP)Source: post\n\nMEXICO CITY (AP) -- Tropical Storm Alberto formed on Wednesday in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico, the first named storm of what is forecast to be a busy hurricane season.\n\nAlberto, which is bringing strong winds, heavy rainfall and some flooding along the coasts of Texas and Mexico, is expected to make landfall in northern Mexico on Thursday.\n\n\"The heavy rainfall and the water, as usual, is the biggest story in tropical storms,\" said Michael Brennan, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Hurricane Center.\n\nAlberto was located 185 miles (about 300 kilometers) east of Tampico, Mexico and 295 miles (about 480 kilometers) south-southeast of Brownsville, Texas. It had top sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. A tropical storm is defined by sustained winds of between 39 and 73 mph (62 and 117 kph), and above that the system becomes a hurricane.\n\nBrennan said that winds could get up to 45 mph (72 kph) to 50 mph (80 kph) before the storm makes landfall.\n\nAs much as 5 inches (13 centimeters) to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, Brennan said. He said some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nAt the Hotel Miramar Inn in Tampico, Mexico, near where Alberto was expected to come ashore, front desk attendant Diana Flores said the wind was gusty, but still not strong, and the rain hadn't started yet. \"There are people in the restaurant and on the beach,\" Flores said early Wednesday.\n\nOuter bands of rain lashed parts of Tamaulipas state in the northeast corner of Mexico overnight.\n\nThe storm was moving west at 9 mph (15 kph). Tropical storm warnings were in effect from the Texas coast at San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande and from the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\n\"Rapid weakening is expected once the center moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico\" on Thursday, the center said.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday, the NWS said, there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nNOAA predicts the hurricane season that began June 1 and runs through Nov. 30 is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.\n\nBrennan said that the first named system in the Atlantic on average comes on June 20, so Alberto is \"about right on schedule.\"\n\nA no-name storm earlier in June dumped more than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain on parts of South Florida, stranding numerous motorists on flooded streets and pushing water into some homes in low-lying areas.\n\nBrennan said there will be dangerous rip currents from the storm and drivers should watch out for road closures and turn around if they see water covering roadways.\n\n\"People underestimate the power of water and they sometimes don't always take rainfall and the threats that come with it seriously, especially if you are driving in an area and you see water covering the road, you don't want to drive into it,\" Brennan said. \"You don't know how deep the water is. The road may be washed out. it doesn't take but just a few inches of water that are moving to move your car.\"", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"},

Storm surge there is expected to reach 2 to 4 feet, depending on tide.\n\nForecasters urged people to not focus solely on the storm's forecast track.\n\nThe hurricane center has expanded the tropical storm warning north, to San Luis Pass near Houston.\n\n\"The disturbance is very large with rainfall, coastal flooding, and wind impacts likely to occur far from the center along the coasts of Texas and northeastern Mexico,\" the hurricane center said.\n\nInland in Mexico and South Texas, rainfall could be significant and potentially dangerous, given the mountainous terrain in some of the region.\n\nRainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico into South Texas are possible, with maximum totals of 15 inches. Flash flooding and mudslides are potential hazards.\n\nAdditional systems\n\nAs of 8 a.m. Wednesday, a disturbance in the same area of the Gulf of Mexico as Alberto had a 30% chance of forming in the next seven days. It is expected to move slowly northwest and is expected to develop over the southwestern Gulf over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, forecasters are watching an area of storminess several hundred miles east of the central Bahamas and could approach the southern U.S. East Coast, potentially including Florida, late this week.\n\nIt has a 20% chance of development over the next seven days, with some slow development possible thereafter while the system moves westward or west-northwestward.\n\nThe systems is likely to stay north of South Florida, and impact coastal areas farther up the coast.\n\nThe 2024 hurricane season, which officially began June 1, is expected to be extremely active. Monday's watch was the first of the 2024 hurricane season, which forecasters say will be a strong one.\n\nIn its annual May outlook, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that the 2024 hurricane season has an 85% chance of being above normal, with 17 to 25 named storms with minimum sustained winds of 39 mph, and eight to 13 hurricanes. An average year has 14 named storms and seven hurricanes.\n\nIn addition, NOAA has forecast four to seven major hurricanes for 2024, meaning those that are Category 3 or above.\n\nExperts at Colorado State University stated in their 2024 forecast that the U.S. East Coast, including Florida, had a 34% chance of a major hurricane making landfall this year. The average from 1880-2020 was 21%.\n\nForecasters say that the record-warm water temperatures that now cover much of the Atlantic Ocean will continue into peak hurricane season from August to October. That warm water fuels hurricanes. By early June, the tropical Atlantic was already as hot as it usually is in mid-August -- peak hurricane season.\n\nHurricane season officially ends Nov. 30.\n\n-------\n\n(Sun Sentinel staff writer Robin Webb contributed to this report.)\n\n-------\n\n\u00a92024 South Florida Sun Sentinel.

Tropical Storm Alberto, the first named storm of the hurricane season, is expected to bring heavy flooding with up to 15 inches to Texas and Louisiana in the next 48 hours.\n\nA \"large disturbance is producing heavy rains and gusty winds in southern Mexico, Central America and surrounding waters,\" the National Hurricane Center's Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch wrote Monday in a post on X.\n\n\"Several days of heavy rainfall are expected and these rains are likely to cause life-threatening flooding and flash flooding.\"\n\nOn Monday afternoon, the National Hurricane Center designated the storm a Potential Tropical Cyclone One. The low pressure system was producing 40 mph winds in the Bay of Campeche. A tropical depression is forecast to form by midweek and is expected to hit the northern coast of Mexico by Thursday.\n\n\"All eyes are on Potential Tropical Cyclone One! Regardless of formation, heavy to excessive rainfall will be possible for portions of the Western Gulf Coast over the next several days,\" the National Weather Service warned Monday afternoon.\n\n\"There is now a high, 70%, probability of formation of a tropical depression/storm in the Bay of Campeche. Regardless of tropical development, periods of heavy rainfall are expected this week in southeast Texas, especially near and along the coast,\" the National Weather Service wrote in a post on X.\n\nA second storm is forming this week in the Atlantic Ocean, east of the Bahamas, and is \"forecast to approach the coast of the southeast United States on Thursday or Friday,\" according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\"This appears to be a quick-moving and compact low-pressure area that will be moving westward into northeastern Florida or perhaps as far north as southeastern Georgia on Thursday,\" according to AccuWeather senior meteorologist Dan Pydynowski.\n\nThe storm in the Atlantic has a 30% chance of becoming a tropical depression in the next seven days.\n\n\"While the exact details still remain very uncertain due to differences in guidance, the potential for heavy downpours for the middle to the end of the week will lead to the potential for localized flooding concerns to return to portions of South Florida,\" said NWS meteorologists.\n\nThis week's tropical storms are just the start of this year's Atlantic hurricane season, which officially began June 1 and is forecast to become one of the most active on record, according to AccuWeather.\n\n\"The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is forecast to feature well above the historical average number of tropical storms, hurricanes, major hurricanes and direct U.S. impacts,\" said AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Forecaster Alex DaSilva.\n\n\"There is a 10-15% chance of 30 or more storms this year,\" he added. \"All indications are pointing toward a very active Atlantic Hurricane season in 2024.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The season started June 1 and runs through Nov. 30, with many forecasters from different weather agencies all predicting a highly active season.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, the hurricane center described the storm system in the Gulf as \"quite large with tropical-storm-force winds extending outward up to 290 miles to the northeast of the center.\"\n\nThe hurricane center issued a tropical storm warning for the Texas coast, from Port O'Connor southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande, as well as for the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Puerto de Altamira.\n\nThe warning means tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.\n\nForecasters say the storm system could generate rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico into South Texas, with as much as 15 inches of rain possible.\n\n\"This rainfall will likely produce flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed river flooding,\" the hurricane center advisory says. \"Mudslides are also possible in areas of higher terrain across northeast Mexico.\"\n\n\u00a92024 Advance Local Media LLC.

A tropical storm warning remained in effect for the Gulf coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla. (Tropical storm warnings have been dropped for Texas.)\n\nAs of 7 a.m. CDT Thursday, the center of Tropical Storm Alberto was located about 25 miles west of Tampico, Mexico, and was moving west at 13 mph. Alberto's winds had dropped from a peak of 50 mph to 45 mph, the hurricane center said.\n\nThe hurricane center said rain from Alberto is expected to ease off over southern Texas today, but northeast Mexico could continued to see tropical downpours. Five to 10 inches of rain will be possible in that area, with some areas getting up to 20 inches.\n\nThat could prompt flash flooding, mudslides in higher terrain and river flooding in Mexico, forecasters said.\n\nA tornado or two could be possible this morning in parts of south Texas, the hurricane center said, but a tornado watch in that area was allowed to expire at 7 a.m. Thursday.\n\nThe hurricane center was also watching a disturbance in the western Atlantic on Thursday morning, and it was expected to move toward the Atlantic coasts of Florida and Georgia today and Friday.\n\nThe hurricane center said the disturbance was disorganized on Thursday morning, and there's a chance it could become a depression before it reaches the U.S.\n\nThe hurricane center said a reconnaissance aircraft would take a look at the disturbance today:\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season began June 1 and lasts until Nov. 30. It is widely anticipated to be a very active season, with 17-25 named storms possible.", "source": {"uri": "al.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "al"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Alberto_(1994)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tropical Storm Alberto (1994)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gulf Coast of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pressure_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Low-pressure area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Campeche", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bay of Campeche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flash flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone warnings and watches"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucat\u00e1n_Peninsula", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reconnaissance aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tornado watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic hurricane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 21}], "image": "https://www.al.com/resizer/v2/TX4RKKPPKZHJVAXI76F4QEOU7M.png?auth=4a3bec15a0f013633717d5de3bf16e7f307b448e1a907617a986995ca6f7f514&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659946", "eventUri": "eng-9659946", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 2547, "textEnd": 2553}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-30", "textStart": 2570, "textEnd": 2577}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

The storm is forecast to reach the coast of northeastern Mexico by late Wednesday or early Thursday, according to the latest advisory from the National Hurricane Center.\n\nHeavy rain from this system is already impacting parts of southern Mexico and northern portions of Central America, and portions of Texas are starting to feel it, the NHC said. The system is moving west-northwest and is expected to move further west and pick up speed Wednesday.\n\nTropical storm warnings have been issued for the Texas coast from San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande and for the northeastern coast of Mexico.\n\nForecasters predict considerable flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed river flooding, including potentially life-threatening flooding and mudslides in and near areas of higher terrain across the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas. Swells generated by the disturbance will affect the coast of Louisiana and Texas as well as northeastern Mexico through early Thursday. These swells are likely to cause life threatening surf and rip current conditions.\n\nMeanwhile, forecasters still have their eyes on a low-pressure area off the east coast of Florida with a low chance of development.\n\n\"This appears to be a quick-moving and compact low-pressure area that will be moving westward into northeastern Florida or perhaps as far north as southeastern Georgia on Thursday,\" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Pydynowski said. The storm's speed limits its development potential but it still could bring more rain, gusty winds and dangerous surf to the southeast Atlantic coast, forecasters said.\n\nSpecial note on the NHC cone: The forecast track shows the most likely path of the center of the storm. It does not illustrate the full width of the storm or its impacts, and the center of the storm is likely to travel outside the cone up to 33% of the time.\n\nForecast, impact: Potential Tropical Cyclone One expected to strengthen before landfall. See spaghetti models\n\n\u27a4 Track Potential Tropical Cyclone One\n\nSpecial note about spaghetti models: Illustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal. The hurricane center uses only the top four or five highest performing models to help make its forecasts.\n\nSouthwestern Atlantic:\n\nAn area of showers and thunderstorms located several hundred miles east of the Bahamas is associated with a surface trough of low pressure interacting with an upper-level trough. Environmental conditions are marginally conducive for some gradual development of this system during the next few days while it moves westward or west-northwestward. The system is forecast to approach the coast of the southeastern United States by the latter part of this week.\n\nSouthwestern Gulf of Mexico:\n\nAnother broad area of low pressure is forecast to develop over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico this weekend. Environmental conditions are expected to be conducive for gradual development of this system through early next week while it moves slowly west-northwestward or northwestward.\n\nPotential Tropical Cyclone One is expected to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico into South Texas, with maximum totals of 15 inches possible. This rainfall will likely produce considerable flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed river flooding. Mudslides are also possible in areas of higher terrain across northeast Mexico.\n\nTropical storm conditions are expected within the warning area Wednesday. A couple of tornadoes are possible Wednesday into the evening across parts of Deep South Texas and Southeast Texas. Swells generated by the disturbance will affect the coast of Texas and northeastern Mexico through early Thursday.\n\nForecasters urge all residents to continue monitoring the tropics and to always be prepared. That advice is particularly important for what is expected to be a very active hurricane season.\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30.\n\nThe peak of the season is Sept. 10, with the most activity happening between mid-August and mid-October, according to the Hurricane Center.\n\nSystems currently being monitored by the National Hurricane Center include:\n\nWe will continue to update our tropical weather coverage daily.

Alberto is also expected to affect parts of northeastern Mexico, where officials have warned of potential mudslides around the cities of Monterrey and Ciudad Victoria.\n\nThe NHC has issued multiple tropical storm warnings across the Texas coast from San Luis Pass near Galveston to the mouth of the Rio Grande River. Authorities are cautioning the storm surge from Alberto could reach as high as 4 feet.\n\nThe Texas cities of Galveston and Surfside Beach were already seeing flooding as of 12 p.m. EDT Wednesday.

It had top sustained winds of 40 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. A tropical storm is defined by sustained winds of between 39 and 73 mph, and above that the system becomes a hurricane.\n\nThe storm was moving west at 9 mph.

Tropical Storm Alberto has formed in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico, the first named storm of what is forecast to be a busy hurricane season.\n\nBy Jamie Stengle and Maiana Mart\u00ednez Barba, Associated Press\n\nWednesday, June 19, 2024 | 4:48 p.m.\n\nMEXICO CITY -- Tropical Storm Alberto formed on Wednesday in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico, the first named storm of what is forecast to be a busy hurricane season.\n\nAlberto, which is bringing strong winds, heavy rainfall and some flooding along the coasts of Texas and Mexico, is expected to make landfall in northern Mexico on Thursday.\n\n\"The heavy rainfall and the water, as usual, is the biggest story in tropical storms,\" said Michael Brennan, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Wednesday afternoon that Alberto was located about 170 miles (270 kilometers) east of Tampico, Mexico, and about 305 miles (495 kilometers) south-southeast of Brownsville, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph). The storm is moving west-southwest at 9 miles per hour.\n\nThe center of the storm was expected to reach the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande by early Thursday morning.\n\nBrennan said that winds could get up to 45 mph (72 kph) to 50 mph (80 kph) before the storm makes landfall.\n\nAs much as 5 inches (13 centimeters) to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, Brennan said. He said some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nTamaulipas Gov. Am\u00e9rico Villarreal said Wednesday on X, formerly Twitter, that schools across the state will remain closed between Wednesday and Friday.\n\nThe coordinator of civil protection in the state of Tamaulipas, Luis Gerardo Gonzalez, said they have 333 shelters distributed throughout the state at each municipality. \"As the storm moves, we will be opening up more shelters.\"\n\nThe coordinator also said the rains would be very beneficial to the state, \"to help in the crisis we are going through with lack of water.\"\n\nAuthorities urged residents to be aware of the alerts the state and municipal civil protections are sharing. They anticipate the storm arriving overnight with communities closest to the coast most affected.\n\nTropical storm warnings were in effect from the Texas coast at San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande and from the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\n\"Rapid weakening is expected once the center moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico\" on Thursday, the center said.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday, the NWS said, there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nNOAA predicts the hurricane season that began June 1 and runs through Nov. 30 is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.\n\nBrennan said there will be dangerous rip currents from the storm and drivers should watch out for road closures and turn around if they see water covering roadways.\n\nAreas along the Texas coast were seeing some road flooding and dangerous rip currents Wednesday, and waterspouts have been spotted offshore. \"We've seen a few brief spin-ups and some waterspouts out there,\" said Tyler Castillo, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Corpus Christi.\n\nTim Cady, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Houston, said they'll be keeping an eye on coastal flooding as high tide approaches Thursday morning.\n\n\"When we have these strong onshore winds combined with the high tide, that can result in coastal inundation, particularly in our lower-lying coastal areas,\" Cady said.\n\nA no-name storm earlier in June dumped more than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain on parts of South Florida, stranding numerous motorists on flooded streets and pushing water into some homes in low-lying areas.\n\n\"People underestimate the power of water and they sometimes don't always take rainfall and the threats that come with it seriously, especially if you are driving in an area and you see water covering the road, you don't want to drive into it,\" Brennan said. \"You don't know how deep the water is. The road may be washed out.\"\n\n___ Stengle contributed to this report from Dallas.

A tropical storm is defined by sustained winds of between 39 and 73 mph, and above that the system becomes a hurricane.\n\nBrennan said that winds could get up to 45 mph to 50 mph before the storm makes landfall.\n\nAs much as 5 inches to 10 inches of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, Brennan said. He said some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nAt the Hotel Miramar Inn in Tampico, Mexico, near where Alberto was expected to come ashore, front desk attendant Diana Flores said the wind was gusty, but still not strong, and the rain hadn't started yet. \"There are people in the restaurant and on the beach,\" Flores said early Wednesday.\n\nOuter bands of rain lashed parts of Tamaulipas state in the northeast corner of Mexico overnight.\n\nThe storm was moving west at 9 mph. Tropical storm warnings were in effect from the Texas coast at San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande and from the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\n\"Rapid weakening is expected once the center moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico\" on Thursday, the center said.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday, the NWS said, there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nNOAA predicts the hurricane season that began June 1 and runs through Nov. 30 is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.\n\nBrennan said that the first named system in the Atlantic on average comes on June 20, so Alberto is \"about right on schedule.\"\n\nA no-name storm earlier in June dumped more than 20 inches of rain on parts of South Florida, stranding numerous motorists on flooded streets and pushing water into some homes in low-lying areas.\n\nBrennan said there will be dangerous rip currents from the storm and drivers should watch out for road closures and turn around if they see water covering roadways.\n\n\"People underestimate the power of water and they sometimes don't always take rainfall and the threats that come with it seriously, especially if you are driving in an area and you see water covering the road, you don't want to drive into it,\" Brennan said. \"You don't know how deep the water is. The road may be washed out. it doesn't take but just a few inches of water that are moving to move your car.\"", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stars and Stripes"},

Authorities in Mexico reported three deaths from its rains.\n\nAlberto, which is bringing strong winds, heavy rainfall and some flooding along the coasts of Texas and Mexico, is expected to make landfall in northern Mexico early Thursday.\n\n\"The heavy rainfall and the water, as usual, is the biggest story in tropical storms,\" said Michael Brennan, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Hurricane Center.\n\nCivil protection authorities in the northern state of Nuevo Leon said one man died in the La Silla river in the city of Monterrey, the state capital. They also said that two minors died from electric shocks in the municipality of Allende. Local media reported that the minors were riding a bicycle in the rain.\n\nNuevo Leon Gov. Samuel Garc\u00eda wrote on his account on social media platform X that metro and public transportation services would be suspended in Monterrey from Wednesday night until midday Thursday when Alberto had passed.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said late Wednesday that Alberto was located about 135 miles (220 kilometers) east of Tampico, Mexico, and about 320 miles (510 kilometers) south-southeast of Brownsville, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph). The storm was moving west at 9 miles per hour.\n\nThe center of the storm was expected to reach the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande by Thursday morning.\n\nAs much as 5 inches (13 centimeters) to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, Brennan said. He said some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nThe municipal government of Tampico, a port city in Tamaulipas state, announced Wednesday afternoon that authorities had activated a command center in coordination with the water, electricity and oil companies.\n\nMany residents were excited about the prospect of heavy showers, as Tamaulipas and most of Mexico has been dealing with extreme droughts.\n\n\"We have been needing this water that we're now getting, thank God. Let's hope that we only get water,\" said Blanca Coronel Moral, a resident of Tampico. \"Our lagoon, which gives us drinking water, is completely dry.\"\n\nTamaulipas Gov. Am\u00e9rico Villarreal said Wednesday on X that schools across the state will remain closed between Wednesday and Friday.\n\nThe coordinator of civil protection in Tamaulipas, Luis Gerardo Gonzalez, said they have 333 shelters distributed throughout the state at each municipality. \"As the storm moves, we will be opening up more shelters.\"\n\nAuthorities urged residents to be aware of the alerts the state and municipal civil protections are sharing. They anticipate the storm arriving overnight with communities closest to the coast most affected.\n\nTropical storm warnings were in effect from the Texas coast at San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande and from the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\n\"Rapid weakening is expected once the center moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico\" on Thursday, the center said.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain.

Texas coast were seeing some road flooding and dangerous rip currents Wednesday, and waterspouts have been spotted offshore. \"We've seen a few brief spin-ups and some waterspouts out there,\" said Tyler Castillo, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Corpus Christi.\n\nTim Cady, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Houston, said they'll be keeping an eye on coastal flooding as high tide approaches Thursday morning.\n\n\"When we have these strong onshore winds combined with the high tide, that can result in coastal inundation, particularly in our

On that date, federal troops arrived in Galveston, Texas to announce that over 250,000 enslaved black people were free. On the same date, the first named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season formed, and ironically, it is also affecting Galveston. Here's what you need to know about Tropical Storm Alberto.\n\nAccording to the National Hurricane Center, tropical storm warnings have been issued for, \"The Texas coast from San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande.... the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\" Tropical Storm Alberto was expected to continue a westward track. The NHC discussion goes on to say, \"On the forecast track, the center of Alberto will reach the coast of northeastern Mexico early Thursday morning. Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. Some slight strengthening is forecast today or tonight before the center of Alberto reaches land.\"\n\nEven prior to becoming a named storm, Galveston, Texas and other locations along the Texas coast were experiencing significant flooding. Peak water levels could reach 2 to 4 feet above normal levels in places like Galveston Bay and Sabine Pass. Alberto is expected to weaken by Thursday night, but it is a storm with a large footprint. Tropical-storm-force winds could be found as much as 415 miles north of the center. Parts of south Texas and northeast Mexico could also experience 5 to 10 inches of rainfall and as much as 20 inches over higher terrain. Flooding (river, urban, and flash) and mudslides are likely hazards for the region. Dangerous tornadoes and rip currents, even far from the center, are also possible.\n\nSo how unusual is Alberto from a climatological standpoint? Actually, there is nothing particularly unusual about the timing and location at all. The first named storm of the year typically forms around June 20th, according to NOAA records spanning the period 1991 to 2022. The first hurricane typically forms around August 11th, and the first major storm (Category 3 or greater) is expected at the beginning of September. Most seasonal predictions call for an extremely active hurricane season because of extremely warm sea surface temperatures and the transition to a La Nina.\n\nAs for location, NOAA has analyzed tropical cyclone points of origin from 1851 to 2015. During the middle of June, storms typically form in the eastern Pacific, Gulf of Mexico, or Bay of Campeche. Tropical Storm Alberto was no exception as it formed near the Bay of Campeche and southern Gulf of Mexico. The National Hurricane Center ended its discussion by warning, \"Users are reminded not to focus on the exact forecast track of this system. Alberto is very large with rainfall, coastal flooding, and wind impacts likely to occur far from the center along the coasts of Texas and northeastern Mexico.\"", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Alberto_(1994)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tropical Storm Alberto (1994)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_delta", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "River delta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Luis_Pass_(Galveston_Island)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Luis Pass (Galveston Island)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone warnings and watches"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic hurricane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Galveston Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabine_Pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sabine Pass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maximum sustained wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_flooding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coastal flooding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip_current", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rip current"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Ni\u00f1a", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Ni\u00f1a"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sea surface temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Flowers/Fresh_Cut", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Flowers/Fresh Cut", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6673078b59e2f425a922cdfc/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659946", "eventUri": "eng-9659946", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 1940, "textEnd": 1949}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-11", "textStart": 2054, "textEnd": 2065}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Tropical Storm Alberto formed on Wednesday in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico, the first named storm of the hurricane season.\n\nTAMPICO, Mexico (AP) -- Tropical Storm Alberto formed on Wednesday in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico, the first named storm of what is forecast to be a busy hurricane season.\n\nAlberto, which is bringing strong winds, heavy rainfall and some flooding along the coasts of Texas and Mexico, is expected to make landfall in northern Mexico early Thursday.\n\n\"The heavy rainfall and the water, as usual, is the biggest story in tropical storms,\" said Michael Brennan, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said late Wednesday that Alberto was located about 135 miles (220 kilometers) east of Tampico, Mexico, and about 320 miles (510 kilometers) south-southeast of Brownsville, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph). The storm was moving west at 9 miles per hour.\n\nThe center of the storm was expected to reach the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande by Thursday morning.\n\nAs much as 5 inches (13 centimeters) to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, Brennan said. He said some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nThe municipal government of Tampico, a port city in Tamaulipas state, announced Wednesday afternoon that authorities had activated a command center in coordination with the water, electricity and oil companies.\n\nMany residents were excited about the prospect of heavy showers, as Tamaulipas and most of Mexico has been dealing with extreme droughts.\n\n\"We have been needing this water that we're now getting, thank God. Let's hope that we only get water,\" said Blanca Coronel Moral, a resident of Tampico. \"Our lagoon, which gives us drinking water, is completely dry.\"\n\nTamaulipas Gov. Am\u00e9rico Villarreal said Wednesday on X that schools across the state will remain closed between Wednesday and Friday.\n\nThe coordinator of civil protection in Tamaulipas, Luis Gerardo Gonzalez, said they have 333 shelters distributed throughout the state at each municipality. \"As the storm moves, we will be opening up more shelters.\"\n\nAuthorities urged residents to be aware of the alerts the state and municipal civil protections are sharing. They anticipate the storm arriving overnight with communities closest to the coast most affected.\n\nTropical storm warnings were in effect from the Texas coast at San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande and from the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\n\"Rapid weakening is expected once the center moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico\" on Thursday, the center said.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday, the NWS said, there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nNOAA predicts the hurricane season that began June 1 and runs through Nov. 30 is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.\n\nBrennan said there will be dangerous rip currents from the storm and drivers should watch out for road closures and turn around if they see water covering roadways.\n\nAreas along the Texas coast were seeing some road flooding and dangerous rip currents Wednesday, and waterspouts have been spotted offshore. \"We've seen a few brief spin-ups and some waterspouts out there,\" said Tyler Castillo, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Corpus Christi.\n\nTim Cady, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Houston, said they'll be keeping an eye on coastal flooding as high tide approaches Thursday morning.\n\n\"When we have these strong onshore winds combined with the high tide, that can result in coastal inundation, particularly in our lower-lying coastal areas,\" Cady said.\n\nA no-name storm earlier in June dumped more than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain on parts of South Florida, stranding numerous motorists on flooded streets and pushing water into some homes in low-lying areas.\n\n\"People underestimate the power of water and they sometimes don't always take rainfall and the threats that come with it seriously, especially if you are driving in an area and you see water covering the road, you don't want to drive into it,\" Brennan said.\n\n___ AP journalists Jamie Stengle in Dallas and Julie Walker in New

A tropical storm's winds range from 39 to 73 mph, while stronger winds classify the system as a hurricane.\n\nThe storm progressed westward at 9 mph, triggering tropical storm warnings from the Texas coast at San Luis Pass to the Rio Grande's mouth, continuing to Mexico's northeastern coast. Forecasters predicted slight strengthening before Alberto's center reaches land on Thursday, expecting rapid weakening and dissipation over Mexico.\n\nForecasters warned of 5 to 10 inches of rain across northeast Mexico and South Texas, with maximums of 20 inches in high-terrain areas of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas. Flash flooding and possible mudslides are significant concerns. The US National Weather Service highlighted flooding risks in southern coastal Texas, predicting over eight inches of rain by Saturday, along with potential tornadoes and waterspouts.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration anticipates an above-average hurricane season, projecting 17 to 25 named storms, 13 hurricanes, and up to four major hurricanes.\n\n(This story has not been

(National Weather Service Lake Charles)\n\nTropical Storm Alberto formed on Wednesday in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico, the first named storm of the hurricane season.\n\nAlberto, which is bringing strong winds, heavy rainfall and some flooding along the coasts of Texas and Mexico, is expected to make landfall in northern Mexico Thursday.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Wednesday afternoon that Alberto was located about 170 miles east of Tampico, Mexico, and about 305 miles south-southeast of Brownsville, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. The storm is moving west-southwest at 9 miles per hour.\n\nJoe Rua, a meteorolgist with the National Weather Service's Lake Charles office, said Southwest Louisiana will see some indirect impacts, mainly coastal flood issues and hazardous seas.\n\n\"The large wind field and fetch of easterly winds will continue to pile water up along the coast, with the most significant coastal flooding along the southeast Texas and Southwest Louisiana coast that will likely extend up into the north end of Sabine and Calcasieu Lakes,\" Rua said. \"The coastal flood hazards will extend through 1 p.m. Thursday.\"\n\nHe said hazardous seas will continue into Thursday for all the coastal waters with seas from 5 to 13 feet.\n\nRua said there is the potential for another broad low to form in the southwest Gulf of Mexico over the weekend that has a 30 percent chance of Tropical Cyclone formation through the next 7 days.\n\n\"However, at this time no impacts are expected from this system as a strong area of high pressure is forecast to build across the northern Gulf Coast,\" he said.\n\nMichael Brennan, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Hurricane Center, said the center of Alberto was expected to reach the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande by early Thursday.\n\nBrennan said that winds could get up to 45 mph to 50 mph before the storm makes landfall.\n\nAs much as 5 inches to 10 inches of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, Brennan said. He said some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nTropical storm warnings were in effect from the Texas coast at San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande and from the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\n\"Rapid weakening is expected once the center moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico\" Thursday, the center said.\n\nNOAA predicts the hurricane season that began June 1 and runs through Nov. 30 is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms.

The storm was developing over the southern Gulf of Mexico and expected to reach land as a potential tropical cyclone, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nIf the storm becomes strong enough it will become the first named storm of the season: Tropical Storm Alberto.\n\nThe tropical storm warning covers coastal Texas areas from Port O'Connor to the mouth of the Rio Grande and extends downward along the Gulf Coast of Mexico. Rainfall linked to the potential tropical cyclone was expected to affect large parts of Central America, too.\n\nAlthough a map released by the National Hurricane Center showed the storm system striking coastal areas just after midnight on Thursday, meteorologists noted that the impacts would likely be felt on land sooner than that. The latest forecasts indicated that the system would likely increase in strength over the next 36 hours before becoming a tropical storm.\n\n\"The disturbance is very large with rainfall, coastal flooding, and wind impacts likely to occur far from the center along the coasts of Texas and northeastern Mexico,\" the hurricane center said in a Tuesday advisory.\n\nIn Texas, the hurricane center said moderate coastal flooding could begin along the coast as soon as Tuesday morning and continue through the middle of the week. The situation was forecast to worsen on Wednesday for people in the tropical storm warning area.\n\nThe annual Atlantic Hurricane Season officially began on June 1 and will run through the end of November, with most storm activity typically happening during the later months of that window, between mid-August and mid-October.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center upgraded what had been the current season's first tropical storm watch to a tropical storm warning at 4 a.m. CT on Tuesday. The difference accounts for timing -- forecasters will generally issue a \"watch\" when tropical storm conditions are possible in the impacted area within roughly 36 hours, and a \"warning\" when the conditions become more imminent, about 24 hours out.\n\nPete and Chasten Buttigieg on fatherhood\n\nNew Jersey diner owner, who is blind, dishes out friendship and inspiration\n\nMom creates camp for kids with chronic pancreatitis", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emily_mae_czachor@aol.com", "name": "Emily Mae Czachor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone warnings and watches"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_flooding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coastal flooding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Alberto_(1994)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropical Storm Alberto (1994)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Coast_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf Coast of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_O'Connor,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Port O'Connor, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Port O'Connor, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Flowers/Fresh_Cut", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Flowers/Fresh Cut", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 27}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8T3jLtyyWgCozjkmVxF4sQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NzY-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_cbs_news_articles_189/803094623019aaa3b28e1ba23f2574c1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659946", "eventUri": "eng-9659946", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 1760, "textEnd": 1766}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-06-", "textStart": 96, "textEnd": 103}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

It had top sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. A tropical storm is defined by sustained winds of between 39 and 73 mph (62 and 117 kph), and above that the system becomes a hurricane.\n\nBrennan said that winds could get up to 45 mph (72 kph) to 50 mph (80 kph) before the storm makes landfall.\n\nAs much as 5 inches (13 centimeters) to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, Brennan said. He said some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nAt the Hotel Miramar Inn in Tampico, Mexico, near where Alberto was expected to come ashore, front desk attendant Diana Flores said the wind was gusty, but still not strong, and the rain hadn't started yet. \"There are people in the restaurant and on the beach,\" Flores said early Wednesday.\n\nOuter bands of rain lashed parts of Tamaulipas state in the northeast corner of Mexico overnight.\n\nThe storm was moving west at 9 mph (15 kph). Tropical storm warnings were in effect from the Texas coast at San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande and from the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\n\"Rapid weakening is expected once the center moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico\" on Thursday, the center said.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday, the NWS said, there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nNOAA predicts the hurricane season that began June 1 and runs through Nov. 30 is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.\n\nBrennan said that the first named system in the Atlantic on average comes on June 20, so Alberto is \"about right on schedule.\"\n\nA no-name storm earlier in June dumped more than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain on parts of South Florida, stranding numerous motorists on flooded streets and pushing water into some homes in low-lying areas.\n\nBrennan said there will be dangerous rip currents from the storm and drivers should watch out for road closures and turn around if they see water covering roadways.\n\n\"People underestimate the power of water and they sometimes don't always take rainfall and the threats that come with it seriously, especially if you are driving in an area and you see water covering the road, you don't want to drive into it,\" Brennan said. \"You don't know how deep the water is. The road may be washed out. it doesn't take but just a few inches of water that are moving to move your car.\"", "source": {"uri": "fox61.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "fox61.com"}, "authors":

Along with sustained winds near 45 mph, the storm is forecast to dump up to 20 inches across parts of northeast Mexico with nearly a foot of rain expected throughout southern Texas.\n\nSuch high rainfall totals will likely produce \"considerable flash flooding and urban flooding\" as well as possible mudslides across northern Mexico, the NHC said.\n\nAfter making landfall, Alberto is expected to diminish in strength, though it could still produce life-threatening weather conditions.\n\nAlberto began drenching southern Texas on Wednesday, triggering widespread coastal flooding that left Surfside Beach, a city along the Texas Gulf Coast south of Houston, under several feet of water. The storm also lashed Mexico with heavy rain, and caused the deaths of at least three minors, Nuevo Leon state Governor Samuel Garcia told local media without providing details.\n\nAcross southern Texas, the combination of storm surge and high tide is raising alarms on Thursday as floodwaters could reach up to 4 feet along the coast. The deepest waters will breach the shore along the Texas coast just to the north of Mexico, where the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous waves, according to NHC.\n\nLife-threatening surf and rip current conditions are among the central threats for the Gulf Coast of Texas through Friday. In deep South Texas, multiple counties were under a tornado watch as forecasters warned that a possible tornado or two could spin up through the morning.\n\nFlood advisories were also active. Multiple south-central counties received 1 and 3 inches of rain by 2 a.m. Thursday, the weather service office in Corpus Christy said, adding: \"Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.\"\n\nGov. Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration for 51 counties and activated three platoons of the Texas National Guard, including more than 40 personnel, 20 vehicles and Chinook helicopters.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto is kicking off what experts have said will be a busy storm season. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Director Rick Spinrad said last month that the Atlantic hurricane season is shaping up to be \"extraordinary,\" with an \"85% chance for an

On that track, the NHC expects Tropical Storm Alberto to reach the northeastern coast of Mexico early Thursday morning.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto has maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, and some slight strengthening is expected Wednesday or Wednesday night before the storm makes landfall.\n\nOnce it does, rapid weakening is expected, and Alberto will likely dissipate over Mexico on Thursday or Thursday night.\n\nA Tropical Storm Warning has been issued for the Texas coast from Port O'Connor to the mouth of the Rio Grande. A Tropical Storm Warning has also been issued for parts of Mexico's coast from the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\nFlood alerts have been issued along the Gulf Coast from the U.S.-Mexico border to the Mississippi-Alabama border due to the threat of heavy rain as well as the combination of storm surge and high tide.\n\nThe Flood Watches extend the length of the Texas coastline from Brownsville through Corpus Christi and into the Galveston area.\n\nInland communities will be impacted as well, and the Flood Watches extend into Laredo and Zapata.\n\nCoastal flood alerts have also been issued and extend from the U.S.-Mexico border to the Mississippi-Alabama border.\n\nCoastal Flood Warnings are in effect from Port Mansfield to Port Lavaca, Galveston and Sabine Pass in Texas.\n\nCoastal Flood Advisories extend farther east and include communities along the Louisiana coast, as well as Gulfport and Biloxi in Mississippi.\n\nThe NHC says that the combination of storm surge and high tide will cause areas of the coastline that normally remain dry to be flooded by rising water moving inland from the shoreline.\n\nThe map below shows the height water could reach if the peak storm surge occurs at the time of high tide:\n\nTropical Storm Alberto is expected to dump a lot of rain across portions of Texas and northern Mexico.\n\nThe NHC said rainfall totals of 5-10 inches are possible in South Texas and northeastern Mexico, with some locally higher amounts of 15 inches possible.\n\n\"This rainfall will likely produce considerable flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed river flooding,\" the NHC said.\n\nIn addition, mudslides are possible in the higher terrain of northeastern Mexico.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Along with sustained winds near 45 mph, the storm is forecast to dump up to 20 inches across parts of northeast Mexico with nearly a foot of rain expected throughout southern Texas.\n\nSuch high rainfall totals will likely produce \"considerable flash flooding and urban flooding\" as well as possible mudslides across northern Mexico, the NHC said.\n\nAfter making landfall, Alberto is expected to diminish in strength, though it could still produce life-threatening weather conditions.\n\nAlberto began drenching southern Texas on Wednesday, triggering widespread coastal flooding that left Surfside Beach, a city along the Texas Gulf Coast south of Houston, under several feet of water. The storm also lashed Mexico with heavy rain, and caused the deaths of at least three minors, Nuevo Leon state Governor Samuel Garcia told local media without providing details.\n\nAcross southern Texas, the combination of storm surge and high tide is raising alarms on Thursday as floodwaters could reach up to 4 feet along the coast. The deepest waters will breach the shore along the Texas coast just to the north of Mexico, where the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous waves, according to NHC.\n\nLife-threatening surf and rip current conditions are among the central threats for the Gulf Coast of Texas through Friday. In deep South Texas, multiple counties were under a tornado watch as forecasters warned that a possible tornado or two could spin up through the morning.\n\nFlood advisories were also active. Multiple south-central counties received 1 and 3 inches of rain by 2 a.m. Thursday, the weather service office in Corpus Christy said, adding: \"Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.\"\n\nGov. Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration for 51 counties and activated three platoons of the Texas National Guard, including more than 40 personnel, 20 vehicles and Chinook helicopters.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto is kicking off what experts have said will be a busy storm season. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Director Rick Spinrad said last month that the Atlantic hurricane season is shaping up to be \"extraordinary,\" with an \"85% chance for an above-average year.\"\n\nTropical Storm Alberto tracker\n\nContributing: Reuters; Doyle Rice, John Bacon, Kirsten Crow, USA TODAY\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Tropical Storm

Authorities in Mexico reported three deaths from its rains.\n\nAlberto, which is bringing strong winds, heavy rainfall and some flooding along the coasts of Texas and Mexico, is expected to make landfall in northern Mexico early Thursday.\n\n\"The heavy rainfall and the water, as usual, is the biggest story in tropical storms,\" said Michael Brennan, director of the U. S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s National Hurricane Center.\n\nCivil protection authorities in the northern state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n said one man died in the La Silla river in the city of Monterrey, the state capital. They also said that two minors died from electric shocks in the municipality of Allende. Local media reported that the minors were riding a bicycle in the rain.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said late Wednesday that Alberto was located about 135 miles (220 kilometers) east of Tampico, Mexico, and about 320 miles (510 kilometers) south-southeast of Brownsville, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph). The storm was moving west at nine miles per hour.\n\nThe center of the storm was expected to reach the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande by Thursday morning.\n\nAs much as 5 inches (13 centimeters) to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, Brennan said. He said some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Le\u00f3n.\n\nMany residents were excited about the prospect of heavy showers, as Tamaulipas and most of Mexico has been dealing with extreme droughts.\n\n\"We have been needing this water that we're now getting, thank God. Let's hope that we only get water,\" said Blanca Coronel Moral, a resident of Tampico. \"Our lagoon, which gives us drinking water, is completely dry.\"\n\nTropical storm warnings were in effect from the Texas coast at San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande and from the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla. Extensive coastal flooding has been reported at beaches and coastlines in southern Texas.\n\n\"Rapid weakening is expected once the center moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico\" on Thursday, the center said.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday, the NWS said, there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nAreas along the Texas coast were seeing some road flooding and dangerous rip currents Wednesday. \"We've seen a few brief spin-ups and some waterspouts out there,\" said Tyler Castillo, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Corpus Christi.\n\nTim Cady, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Houston, said they'll be keeping an eye on coastal flooding as high tide approaches Thursday morning.\n\n\"When we have these strong onshore winds combined with the high tide, that can result in coastal inundation, particularly in our lower-lying coastal areas,\" Cady said.\n\nNOAA predicts the hurricane season that began June 1 and runs through November 30 is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast predicts as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.", "source": {"uri": "english.elpais.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EL PA\u00cdS"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The storm was moving west at 9 miles per hour.\n\nThe center of the storm was expected to reach the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande by Thursday morning.\n\nAs much as 5 inches (13 centimeters) to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, Brennan said. He said some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nThe municipal government of Tampico, a port city in Tamaulipas state, announced Wednesday afternoon that authorities had activated a command center in coordination with the water, electricity and oil companies.\n\nMany residents were excited about the prospect of heavy showers, as Tamaulipas and most of Mexico has been dealing with extreme droughts.\n\n\"We have been needing this water that we're now getting, thank God. Let's hope that we only get water,\" said Blanca Coronel Moral, a resident of Tampico. \"Our lagoon, which gives us drinking water, is completely dry.\"\n\nTamaulipas Gov. Am\u00e9rico Villarreal said Wednesday on X that schools across the state will remain closed between Wednesday and Friday.\n\nThe coordinator of civil protection in Tamaulipas, Luis Gerardo Gonzalez, said they have 333 shelters distributed throughout the state at each municipality. \"As the storm moves, we will be opening up more shelters.\"\n\nAuthorities urged residents to be aware of the alerts the state and municipal civil protections are sharing. They anticipate the storm arriving overnight with communities closest to the coast most affected.\n\nTropical storm warnings were in effect from the Texas coast at San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande and from the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\n\"Rapid weakening is expected once the center moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico\" on Thursday, the center said.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday, the NWS said, there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nNOAA predicts the hurricane season that began June 1 and runs through Nov. 30 is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.\n\nBrennan said there will be dangerous rip currents from the storm and drivers should watch out for road closures and turn around if they see water covering roadways.\n\nAreas along the Texas coast were seeing some road flooding and dangerous rip currents Wednesday, and waterspouts have been spotted offshore. \"We've seen a few brief spin-ups and some waterspouts out there,\" said Tyler Castillo, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Corpus Christi.\n\nTim Cady, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Houston, said they'll be keeping an eye on coastal flooding as high tide approaches Thursday morning.\n\n\"When we have these strong onshore winds combined with the high tide, that can result in coastal inundation, particularly in our lower-lying coastal areas,\" Cady said.\n\nA no-name storm earlier in June dumped more than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain on parts of South Florida, stranding numerous motorists on flooded streets and pushing water into some homes in low-lying areas.\n\n\"People underestimate the power of water and they sometimes don't always take rainfall and the threats that come with it seriously, especially if you are driving in an area and you see water covering the road, you don't want to drive into it,\" Brennan said.\n\n___ AP journalists Jamie Stengle in Dallas and Julie Walker in New

wind speed, which is generally the criteria used by NOAA to classify a developing system as a tropical storm.\n\nPotential Tropical Cyclone One has had sustained winds of 40 mph for the last several advisories, which is the general criteria used to classify a system as a tropical storm.\n\n\"A tropical cyclone in which the maximum sustained surface wind speed -- using the U.S., 1-minute average

developed.\"\n\nWithout that well-defined center of circulation, along with sustained winds of at least 39 mph, the system remains a potential tropical storm, according to the National Weather Service Miami.\n\nAt 11 a.m. Tuesday, an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft was surveying the system's wind field to assess its structure to see if it can now be classified as a tropical storm.\n\nWhy does the Hurricane Center issue advisories if it isn't a tropical storm?\n\nAdvisories are issued for potential storms based on how close they are to land.\n\nPotential Tropical Cyclone One currently is expected be a tropical storm by Wednesday and to make landfall along the Gulf Coast late Wednesday.\n\nThat would give residents in the storm's path little time to react to advisories and warnings

(National Weather Service Lake Charles)\n\nTropical Storm Alberto formed on Wednesday in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico, the first named storm of what is forecast to be a busy hurricane season.\n\nAlberto, which is bringing strong winds, heavy rainfall and some flooding along the coasts of Texas and Mexico, is expected to make landfall in northern Mexico on Thursday.\n\n\"The heavy rainfall and the water, as usual, is the biggest story in tropical storms,\" said Michael Brennan, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Hurricane Center.\n\nAlberto was located 185 miles (about 300 kilometers) east of Tampico, Mexico and 295 miles (about 480 kilometers) south-southeast of Brownsville, Texas. It had top sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. A tropical storm is defined by sustained winds of between 39 and 73 mph (62 and 117 kph), and above that the system becomes a hurricane.\n\nBrennan said that winds could get up to 45 mph (72 kph) to 50 mph (80 kph) before the storm makes landfall.\n\nAs much as 5 inches (13 centimeters) to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, Brennan said. He said some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nAt the Hotel Miramar Inn in Tampico, Mexico, near where Alberto was expected to come ashore, front desk attendant Diana Flores said the wind was gusty, but still not strong, and the rain hadn't started yet. \"There are people in the restaurant and on the beach,\" Flores said early Wednesday.\n\nOuter bands of rain lashed parts of Tamaulipas state in the northeast corner of Mexico overnight.\n\nThe storm was moving west at 9 mph (15 kph). Tropical storm warnings were in effect from the Texas coast at San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande and from the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\n\"Rapid weakening is expected once the center moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico\" on Thursday, the center said.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday, the NWS said, there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nNOAA predicts the hurricane season that began June 1 and runs through Nov. 30 is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.\n\nBrennan said that the first named system in the Atlantic on average comes on June 20, so Alberto is \"about right on schedule.\"\n\nA no-name storm earlier in June dumped more than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain on parts of South Florida, stranding numerous motorists on flooded streets and pushing water into some homes in low-lying areas.\n\nBrennan said there will be dangerous rip currents from the storm and drivers should watch out for road closures and turn around if they see water covering roadways.\n\n\"People underestimate the power of water and they sometimes don't always take rainfall and the threats that come with it seriously, especially if you are driving in an area and you see water covering the road, you don't want to drive into it,\" Brennan said. \"You don't know how deep the water is. The road may be washed out. it doesn't take but just a few inches of water that are moving to move your car.\"", "source": {"uri": "americanpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lake Charles

The storm is moving west-southwest at 9 miles per hour.\n\nThe center of the storm was expected to reach the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande by Thursday morning.\n\nBrennan said that winds could get up to 45 mph (72 kph) to 50 mph (80 kph) before the storm makes landfall.\n\nAs much as 5 inches (13 centimeters) to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, Brennan said.

They anticipate the storm arriving overnight with communities closest to the coast most affected.\n\nThe municipal government of Tampico, a port city in Tamaulipas state, announced this afternoon that they have activated a Command Center in coordination with the water, electricity and oil companies.\n\nTampico has been dealing with extreme droughts. \"We have been needing this water that we're now getting, thank God.

Texas coast were seeing some road flooding and dangerous rip currents Wednesday, and waterspouts have been spotted offshore. \"We've seen a few brief spin-ups and some waterspouts out there,\" said Tyler Castillo, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Corpus Christi.\n\nTim Cady, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Houston, said they'll be keeping an eye on coastal flooding as high tide approaches Thursday morning.\n\n\"When we have these strong onshore winds combined with the high tide, that can result in coastal inundation, particularly in our

The storm, which has been slowly building, has the chance to be the very first named storm of the 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season. Alberto is the first name on the list should it become a tropical storm.\n\nWhile this storm is still on track to move into Mexico by Wednesday overnight it has the chance of bringing plenty of needed rain to South Texas with a potential rainfall total of 7-10 inches of rain closer to the coast.\n\nWhile the actual strength of the storm is still yet to be determined, the coastal area of The Rio Grande Valley has been placed in a Tropical Storm Watch which means we could see tropical storm force winds within the next 48 hours.\n\nThe RGV has also been placed in a Flood Watch from Tuesday through Thursday as heavy rain is expected to be the biggest impact to the region.\n\nShowers and thunderstorms are expected to continue throughout the week and into the weekend well after the storm has made landfall.

However, that isn't stopping the United States from feeling Alberto's effects.\n\nHours before the storm was expected to make landfall on Thursday, officials in both Mexico and in Texas were monitoring water levels as heavy rainfall started to come down.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center has been tracking Alberto as it developed and crossed the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\"We could see it strengthened a little bit. Right now, the peak winds are about 40mph, that could get up to 45 or 50mph before landfall, but it really only has less than 24 hours before the center moves inland over Mexico,\" Michael Brennan, Director of the National Hurricane Center said. \"But that, that really doesn't have much, much to do with what the impacts are going to look like on the Texas coast for example. The heavy rainfall is going to occur regardless of what those peak winds are.\n\nThe large storm has tropical winds extending around 415 miles from its center. While Alberto made landfall in Mexico early Thursday morning, Texas is still feeling the effects.\n\nParts of the Lone Star State have seen more than their monthly expected rainfall amounts in less than a day, with some areas getting over a foot of rain as officials warn of possible flash floods.\n\n\"We are already seeing impacts along the Texas coast in terms of, you know, some strong winds or some coastal flooding this morning, heavy rainfall, flood watches and warnings in effect,\" Brennan continued.\n\nPeople have been warned to avoid beaches as conditions are still hazardous with up to three feet of coastal flooding, rip currents and low visibility.\n\nFurther inland, the effects from the storm were still noticeable as officials prepared dozens of high-water trucks and boats to ready for possible water rescues as roads and homes flood.\n\nAt least three deaths have been attributed to the storm in Mexico due to electrified waters and fast currents.\n\nBack in Texas, tornado warnings were issued.\n\nFor as much damage as the storm has caused, many drought-impacted areas of Mexico and Texas are grateful for the rain.\n\nOfficials predict Alberto is only the start of what's expected to be a very busy hurricane season.\n\nThey're estimating as many as 25 named storms and seven major hurricanes may develop through November.\n\nStay informed!

Storm surge has already topped 4 feet at San Luis Pass, in Texas, just south of Galveston Island.\n\nThe National Hurricane Centre and Central Pacific Hurricane Centre are also tracking a storm currently located several hundred miles east of the Bahamas, sharing in an update: \"Environmental conditions are marginally conducive for some gradual development of this system during the next few days while it moves westward or west-northwestward. The system is forecast to approach the coast of the southeastern United States by the latter part of this week.\"\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the state Division of Emergency Management to put the Texas State Emergency Operations Center to a readiness of level 2, meaning it began 24-hour operations: \"As we prepare for severe tropical weather, Texas is activating all personnel and resources needed to support Texans and communities that will be potentially impacted by excessive rain and flooding.\"\n\nEditorial

Authorities in Mexico reported three deaths from its rains.\n\nAlberto, which is bringing strong winds, heavy rainfall and some flooding along the coasts of Texas and Mexico, is expected to make landfall in northern Mexico early Thursday.\n\n\"The heavy rainfall and the water, as usual, is the biggest story in tropical storms,\" said Michael Brennan, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Hurricane Center.\n\nCivil protection authorities in the northern state of Nuevo Leon said one man died in the La Silla river in the city of Monterrey, the state capital. They also said that two minors died from electric shocks in the municipality of Allende. Local media reported that the minors were riding a bicycle in the rain.\n\nNuevo Leon Gov. Samuel Garc\u00eda wrote on his account on social media platform X that metro and public transportation services would be suspended in Monterrey from Wednesday night until midday Thursday when Alberto had passed.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said late Wednesday that Alberto was located about 135 miles (220 kilometers) east of Tampico, Mexico, and about 320 miles (510 kilometers) south-southeast of Brownsville, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph). The storm was moving west at 9 miles per hour.\n\nThe center of the storm was expected to reach the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande by Thursday morning.\n\nAs much as 5 inches (13 centimeters) to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, Brennan said. He said some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nThe municipal government of Tampico, a port city in Tamaulipas state, announced Wednesday afternoon that authorities had activated a command center in coordination with the water, electricity and oil companies.\n\nMany residents were excited about the prospect of heavy showers, as Tamaulipas and most of Mexico has been dealing with extreme droughts.\n\n\"We have been needing this water that we're now getting, thank God. Let's hope that we only get water,\" said Blanca Coronel Moral, a resident of Tampico. \"Our lagoon, which gives us drinking water, is completely dry.\"\n\nTamaulipas Gov. Am\u00e9rico Villarreal said Wednesday on X that schools across the state will remain closed between Wednesday and Friday.\n\nThe coordinator of civil protection in Tamaulipas, Luis Gerardo Gonzalez, said they have 333 shelters distributed throughout the state at each municipality. \"As the storm moves, we will be opening up more shelters.\"\n\nAuthorities urged residents to be aware of the alerts the state and municipal civil protections are sharing. They anticipate the storm arriving overnight with communities closest to the coast most affected.\n\nTropical storm warnings were in effect from the Texas coast at San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande and from the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\n\"Rapid weakening is expected once the center moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico\" on Thursday, the center said.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday, the NWS said, there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nNOAA predicts the hurricane season that began June 1 and runs through Nov. 30 is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.\n\nBrennan said there will be dangerous rip currents from the storm and drivers should watch out for road closures and turn around if they see water covering roadways.\n\nAreas along the Texas coast were seeing some road flooding and dangerous rip currents Wednesday, and waterspouts have been spotted offshore. \"We've seen a few brief spin-ups and some waterspouts out there,\" said Tyler Castillo, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Corpus Christi.\n\nTim Cady, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Houston, said they'll be keeping an eye on coastal flooding as high tide approaches Thursday morning.\n\n\"When we have these strong onshore winds combined with the high tide, that can result in coastal inundation, particularly in our lower-lying coastal areas,\" Cady said.\n\n___ AP journalists Jamie Stengle in Dallas and Julie Walker in New York contributed to this report.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to

He said some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nTamaulipas Gov. Am\u00e9rico Villarreal said Wednesday on X, formerly Twitter, that schools across the state will remain closed between Wednesday and Friday.\n\nThe storm was moving west at 9 mph (15 kph). Tropical storm warnings were in effect from the Texas coast at San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande and from the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\n\"Rapid weakening is expected once the center moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico\" on Thursday, the center said.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday, the NWS said, there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nNOAA predicts the hurricane season that began June 1 and runs through Nov. 30 is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.\n\nBrennan said that the first named system in the Atlantic on average comes on June 20, so Alberto is \"about right on schedule.\"\n\nIn the Village of Surfside Beach, located on a barrier island on the Texas coast about 65 miles (104 kilometers) south of Houston, Mayor Gregg Bisso said Wednesday that rains had already left about 2 feet of water on streets on the west end of the island, making them impassable.\n\n\"We're on a barrier island and there's no place for the rain to go, plus the extremely high tides, everything is just hanging right there and it's flooding all the streets,\" Bisso said, adding that double red flags have been placed on the beach to warn people that no one should be in the water because of the extreme rip tides.\n\n\"Those conditions were extremely bad out there yesterday, and today,\" he said.\n\nAll of the homes on the island are elevated anywhere from 10 to 14 feet above the ground, so they don't expect homes to flood and evacuations were not ordered.\n\n\"We're just waiting for the rains to stop and the tide to go down,\" he said.\n\nBrennan said there will be dangerous rip currents from the storm and drivers should watch out for road closures and turn around if they see water covering roadways.\n\nA no-name storm earlier in June dumped more than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain on parts of South Florida, stranding numerous motorists on flooded streets and pushing water into some homes in low-lying areas.\n\n\"People underestimate the power of water and they sometimes don't always take rainfall and the threats that come with it seriously, especially if you are driving in an area and you see water covering the road, you don't want to drive into it,\" Brennan said. \"You don't know how deep the water is. The road may be washed out. it doesn't take but just a few inches of water that are moving to move your car.\"", "source": {"uri": "weareiowa.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Local 5 -

The storm was moving west at 9 miles per hour.\n\nThe center of the storm was expected to reach the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande by Thursday morning.\n\nAs much as 5 inches (13 centimeters) to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, Brennan said. He said some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nThe municipal government of Tampico, a port city in Tamaulipas state, announced Wednesday afternoon that authorities had activated a command center in coordination with the water, electricity and oil companies.\n\nMany residents were excited about the prospect of heavy showers, as Tamaulipas and most of Mexico has been dealing with extreme droughts.\n\n\"We have been needing this water that we're now getting, thank God. Let's hope that we only get water,\" said Blanca Coronel Moral, a resident of Tampico. \"Our lagoon, which gives us drinking water, is completely dry.\"\n\nTamaulipas Gov. Am\u00e9rico Villarreal said Wednesday on X that schools across the state will remain closed between Wednesday and Friday.\n\nThe coordinator of civil protection in Tamaulipas, Luis Gerardo Gonzalez, said they have 333 shelters distributed throughout the state at each municipality. \"As the storm moves, we will be opening up more shelters.\"\n\nAuthorities urged residents to be aware of the alerts the state and municipal civil protections are sharing. They anticipate the storm arriving overnight with communities closest to the coast most affected.\n\nTropical storm warnings were in effect from the Texas coast at San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande and from the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\n\"Rapid weakening is expected once the center moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico\" on Thursday, the center said.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday, the NWS said, there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas.

Texas coast were seeing some road flooding and dangerous rip currents Wednesday, and waterspouts have been spotted offshore. \"We've seen a few brief spin-ups and some waterspouts out there,\" said Tyler Castillo, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Corpus Christi.\n\nTim Cady, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Houston, said they'll be keeping an eye on coastal flooding as high tide approaches Thursday morning.\n\n\"When we have these strong onshore winds combined with the high tide, that can result in coastal inundation, particularly in our

It will unload torrential rainfall and considerably ramp up the flood threat, not just in the US, but also in parts of Mexico and Central America.\n\nAs the name suggests, Potential Tropical Cyclone One isn't quite a tropical storm yet, but is expected to become one and poses a threat to the areas in the tropical storm warning over the next 48 hours.\n\nThe system had 40 mph winds Tuesday morning - strong enough that if it does develop a coherent circulation, it would be named Tropical Storm Alberto. It's forecast to by late Tuesday or Wednesday before approaching the northern coast of Mexico on Wednesday night.\n\nRELATED: NOAA predicts above-normal 2024 Atlantic hurricane season\n\nThe system's strength will be limited by its short time over water, but it's main threat of significant rain and flooding will not: multiple days of gushing rainfall for parts of Central America, southern Mexico and the US western Gulf Coast.\n\nHeavy rain was already ongoing Monday in parts of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras as the gyre churned. Double-digit rainfall totals are possible in these areas by Thursday. Rain is needed desperately in parts of Mexico and Central America that are bone-dry after weeks of unrelenting heat. But day after day of heavy rain will quickly overwhelm parched soils unable to absorb water as fast as it falls, resulting in dangerous flooding.\n\nDeep tropical moisture was also fueling storms as far north as the US's western Gulf Coast. Double-digit rainfall totals are likely in portions of coastal and southern Texas by the weekend, while other portions of the Gulf Coast could pick up several inches through midweek.\n\nA level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place for the Texas coast Tuesday and much of South Texas on Wednesday.\n\nBy Wednesday, the air over the Gulf Coast will be loaded up with \"incredible amounts of moisture\" which could \"easily\" produce flash flooding, the Weather Prediction Center warned Monday.\n\nHeavy rain isn't the most welcome sight along some parts of the US Gulf Coast. June has been drier after a drenching spring, but the soil and area rivers are still holding on to plenty of water in eastern Texas and western Louisiana.\n\nAnother tropical threat is stirring in the Atlantic as development gets underway in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nAn area of showers and thunderstorms a few hundred miles east of the Bahamas could be the starting point for a potential tropical system later this week. Right now, the National Hurricane Center gives it a low chance of developing into a tropical system.\n\nMultiple atmospheric factors must align for the area of stormy weather to get its act together, but the opportunity for development exists over the next few days as it slowly pushes westward.\n\nALSO SEE: El Ni\u00f1o has come to an end | Here's what to expect in the coming months\n\nIf something tropical does develop, it could approach the southeastern US by Thursday or Friday and be steered south of the heat dome roasting areas farther north. It's unclear exactly which areas could be impacted, but anywhere from Florida to the Carolinas should keep a close eye on the forecast as it comes into focus in the coming days.\n\nDrenching rain

Totals from South Texas into northeast Mexico could be 5 to 10 inches, with locally higher amounts possible.\n\nCLICK HERE for more.", "source": {"uri": "kadn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KADN News 15"}, "authors": [{"uri": "weather_channel@kadn.com", "name": "Weather Channel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Alberto_(1994)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical Storm Alberto (1994)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weather_Channel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Weather Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_flooding", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coastal flooding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip_current", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rip current"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfside_Beach,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surfside Beach, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surfside Beach, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone warnings and watches"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownsville,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brownsville, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brownsville, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Luis_Pass_(Galveston_Island)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Luis Pass (Galveston Island)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Texas"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy_and_Forecasting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy and Forecasting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Flowers/Fresh_Cut", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Flowers/Fresh Cut", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 29}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kadn.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/be/5bec4fb8-2e45-11ef-8a97-5f6e2a079e1c/6672ef1be2894.preview.png?crop=964%2C506%2C0%2C16&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659946", "eventUri": "eng-9659946", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 527, "textEnd": 534}], "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Once it hits Mexico, it is expected weaken rapidly as it moves inland.\n\nThe center of Alberto was about 120 miles east-southeast of Tampico, Mexico, and around 290 miles south-southeast of Brownsville, Texas, at 1 a.m. Central Standard Time, the hurricane center said Thursday. It was traveling west at about 9 mph.\n\nMexico's civil protection coordination agency said late Wednesday on social media that rain was beginning to fall in Tampico, and warned people to stay inside, stay safe, and not drive during the storm.\n\nA tropical storm warning is in effect for the northeastern coast of Mexico, as well as the Texas coast from the mouth of the Rio Grande up to San Luis Pass, which is near Houston. High winds and as much as 10 to 15 inches of rain are expected in Corpus Christi.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration for 51 Texas counties \"to ensure Texans and at-risk regions have the resources and personnel needed to respond to this storm,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe National Weather Service said moderate coastal flooding was observed across the Texas Gulf Coast as the storm approached Mexico.\n\nDustin Leeds and Kristine Martin, of Houston, were on vacation in Freeport, Texas, and woke up Wednesday to floodwaters that were thigh-high.\n\nMartin woke up at around 5:30 a.m. after having heard heavy rain: \"I opened the blinds and was like, 'Huh, the ocean looks closer,'\" she joked.\n\nResidents seemed to be taking it in stride. Homes are raised in the area because of flood risk, and many people had moved their cars to safety in advance.\n\n\"Everybody's still in their homes. There's two other families in houses right around us that were just -- they were hanging out, living their best life,\" Leeds said.\n\nA storm surge of 2 to 4 feet is possible from Sargent, Texas, to the Sabine Pass.\n\nThere could also be a few tornadoes in deep South Texas overnight Wednesday into Thursday, the weather service said.\n\nOn Thursday, the storm's center is forecast to move west into Mexico then weaken, most likely dissipating by Thursday night, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nSome parts of Mexico, including Coahuila, Nuevo Le\u00f3n and Tamaulipas, could get maximum totals of 20 inches of rain, the hurricane center said.\n\nThe Texas A&M Forest Service has mobilized four teams comprising 100 personnel and 24 vehicles, while the Texas National Guard has three platoons of more than 40 personnel in total, alongside 20 vehicles, including Chinook helicopters.\n\nThe weather service advised people in areas affected by the storm to have five to seven days' supplies of food, water and other necessities on hand.\n\nMore than 82 million people were under some form of heat advisory Wednesday.

The NHC also forecast maximum rainfall totals around 20 inches across the higher terrain of some Mexican states.\n\nConsiderable flash and urban flooding are possible, as well as mudslides in areas of higher terrain in Mexico.\n\nThe NHC expects the tropical storm to dissipate soon after making its way inland on Thursday.\n\nElsewhere, about 250 miles east of the Bahamas, a disorganized system of shower and thunderstorm activity has a 30 percent chance of formation through the next 48 hours and a 30 percent chance of formation through the next 7 days.\n\nThe NHC lists environmental conditions as only marginally conducive for any development due to nearby dry air.\n\nOnce Alberto moves out of the southwest Gulf of Mexico, another broad area of low pressure is forecast to form on Friday. The system is expected to form near the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico.\n\nThe system could become a tropical depression over the Gulf this weekend while it moves slowly west-northward or northwestward, according to the NHC.

stated the National Hurricane Center at 10am CDT on Thursday.\n\nIt is expected to make landfall in Mexico on Wednesday night, and bring heavy to the northeastern part of the country as well as south Texas and parts of Central America.\n\n'The rainfall will likely produce considerable flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed river flooding,' stated the center.\n\nThat includes moderate coast flooding along much of the Lone Star State's coast through Thursday.\n\nOn Wednesday, tropical storm conditions were expected on parts of the Texas coast south of San Luis Pass.\n\nMeanwhile, life-threatening flooding and mudslides were forecast for high terrain areas in the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas, as well as the cities of Ciudad Victoria and Monterrey.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott on Tuesday night ordered the state's Division of Emergency Management to put the emergency center on level 2 readiness, activating 24-hour operations.\n\n'As we prepare for severe tropical weather, Texas is activating all personnel and resources needed to support Texans and communities that will be potentially impacted by excessive rain and flooding,' stated Abbott.\n\nThe National Weather Service has advised residents in areas under the warning to have five to seven days' worth of water, food and other supplies.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto comes just a week after the first tropical disturbance of the season brought rare flash floods to South Florida and drowned streets and forced some people to abandon their vehicles.\n\nThis hurricane season has been predicted to be extremely active.\n\nAs Texas faces Tropical Storm Alberto, about 71million Americans in other parts of the country were under heat advisories or warnings on Wednesday.",

The storm is moving west-southwest at 9 miles per hour.\n\nRelated Story: Power Outages Could Linger for Days After Storms Batter Texas Again, Leaving 1 ...\n\nThe center of the storm was expected to reach the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande by early Thursday morning.\n\nBrennan said that winds could get up to 45 mph (72 kph) to 50 mph (80 kph) before the storm makes landfall.\n\nAs much as 5 inches (13 centimeters) to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, Brennan said. He said some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nTamaulipas Gov. Am\u00e9rico Villarreal said Wednesday on X, formerly Twitter, that schools across the state will remain closed between Wednesday and Friday.\n\nRelated Story: Storm Damage Forces Removal of US-Built Gaza Pier for Repairs\n\nThe coordinator of civil protection in the state of Tamaulipas, Luis Gerardo Gonzalez, said they have 333 shelters distributed throughout the state at each municipality. \"As the storm moves, we will be opening up more shelters.\"\n\nThe coordinator also said the rains would be very beneficial to the state, \"to help in the crisis we are going through with lack of water.\"\n\nAuthorities urged residents to be aware of the alerts the state and municipal civil protections are sharing. They anticipate the storm arriving overnight with communities closest to the coast most affected.\n\nTropical storm warnings were in effect from the Texas coast at San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande and from the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\n\"Rapid weakening is expected once the center moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico\" on Thursday, the center said.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday, the NWS said, there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas.

The storm is moving west-southwest at 9 miles per hour.\n\nThe center of the storm was expected to reach the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande by Thursday morning.\n\nBrennan said that winds could get up to 45 mph (72 kph) to 50 mph (80 kph) before the storm makes landfall.\n\nAs much as 5 inches (13 centimeters) to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, Brennan said. He said some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nTamaulipas Gov. Am\u00e9rico Villarreal said Wednesday on X that schools across the state will remain closed between Wednesday and Friday.\n\nThe coordinator of civil protection in Tamaulipas, Luis Gerardo Gonzalez, said they have 333 shelters distributed throughout the state at each municipality. \"As the storm moves, we will be opening up more shelters.\"\n\nAuthorities urged residents to be aware of the alerts the state and municipal civil protections are sharing. They anticipate the storm arriving overnight with communities closest to the coast most affected.\n\nThe municipal government of Tampico, a port city in Tamaulipas state, announced this afternoon that they have activated a Command Center in coordination with the water, electricity and oil companies.\n\nTampico has been dealing with extreme droughts. \"We have been needing this water that we're now getting, thank God. Let's hope that we only get water,\" said Blanca Coronel Moral, a resident of Tampico. \"Our lagoon, which gives us drinking water, is completely dry.\"\n\nTropical storm warnings were in effect from the Texas coast at San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande and from the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\n\"Rapid weakening is expected once the center moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico\" on Thursday, the center said.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday, the NWS said, there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nNOAA predicts the hurricane season that began June 1 and runs through Nov. 30 is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.\n\nBrennan said there will be dangerous rip currents from the storm and drivers should watch out for road closures and turn around if they see water covering roadways.\n\nAreas along the Texas coast were seeing some road flooding and dangerous rip currents Wednesday, and waterspouts have been spotted offshore. \"We've seen a few brief spin-ups and some waterspouts out there,\" said Tyler Castillo, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Corpus Christi.\n\nTim Cady, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Houston, said they'll be keeping an eye on coastal flooding as high tide approaches Thursday morning.\n\n\"When we have these strong onshore winds combined with the high tide, that can result in coastal inundation, particularly in our lower-lying coastal areas,\" Cady said.\n\nA no-name storm earlier in June dumped more than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain on parts of South Florida, stranding numerous motorists on flooded streets and pushing water into some homes in low-lying areas.\n\n\"People underestimate the power of water and they sometimes don't always take rainfall and the threats that come with it seriously, especially if you are driving in an area and you see water covering the road, you don't want to drive into it,\" Brennan said.\n\n___ AP journalists Jamie Stengle in Dallas and Julie Walker in New York contributed to this report.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000.

Some strengthening is expected before it reaches shore, but then, forecasters say, it will likely weaken quickly as it moves inland. Alberto should dissipate over Mexico by Thursday night, the Hurricane Center says.\n\nWill Alberto affect North Carolina?\n\nThough Alberto is a big storm, with tropical-storm-force winds extending 415 miles from its center, the storm is tracking to the west and is not expected to have significant effects in North Carolina.\n\nIs it unusual to have a tropical storm in June?\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30, and while storms can be expected any time during that window, the National Hurricane Center says storms form in June about once every other year on average.\n\nMost June storms form in the northwest Caribbean Sea or in the Gulf of Mexico, the Hurricane Center says. Historically, storms that form in June in the Caribbean typically track toward Texas or Louisiana, the Hurricane Center says.\n\nHas NC ever been hit by a hurricane in June?\n\nSince 1851, several tropical depressions and storms have had effects on North Carolina in June, but no hurricane has made landfall in the state during that month.\n\nEmergency management officials say June is the perfect time to gather hurricane supplies so that if more severe storms come later in the season, you'll be ready.\n\nIt's expected to be a busy season\n\nForecasters have said that because of excessively warm water in the Atlantic and the effects of a La Ni\u00f1a weather pattern expected to develop by August, the 2024 hurricane season could be one of the busiest ever.\n\nForecasters at at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center have said there is an 85% chance of an above-normal season and only a 5% chance of a below-normal season.\n\n\u25aa 4 to 7 of the hurricanes will be \"major,\" meaning they'll fall into Category 3, 4 or 5, with winds of 111 mph or higher.\n\nNOAA's predictions are in line with the 2024 hurricane forecast Colorado State

It had top sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. A tropical storm is defined by sustained winds of between 39 and 73 mph (62 and 117 kph), and above that the system becomes a hurricane.\n\nBrennan said that winds could get up to 45 mph (72 kph) to 50 mph (80 kph) before the storm makes landfall.\n\nAs much as 5 inches (13 centimeters) to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, Brennan said. He said some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nAt the Hotel Miramar Inn in Tampico, Mexico, near where Alberto was expected to come ashore, front desk attendant Diana Flores said the wind was gusty, but still not strong, and the rain hadn't started yet. \"There are people in the restaurant and on the beach,\" Flores said early Wednesday.\n\nOuter bands of rain lashed parts of Tamaulipas state in the northeast corner of Mexico overnight.\n\nThe storm was moving west at 9 mph (15 kph). Tropical storm warnings were in effect from the Texas coast at San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande and from the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\n\"Rapid weakening is expected once the center moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico\" on Thursday, the center said.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday, the NWS said, there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nNOAA predicts the hurricane season that began June 1 and runs through Nov. 30 is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.\n\nBrennan said that the first named system in the Atlantic on average comes on June 20, so Alberto is \"about right on schedule.\"\n\nA no-name storm earlier in June dumped more than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain on parts of South Florida, stranding numerous motorists on flooded streets and pushing water into some homes in low-lying areas.\n\nBrennan said there will be dangerous rip currents from the storm and drivers should watch out for road closures and turn around if they see water covering roadways.\n\n\"People underestimate the power of water and they sometimes don't always take rainfall and the threats that come with it seriously, especially if you are driving in an area and you see water covering the road, you don't want to drive into it,\" Brennan said. \"You don't know how deep the water is. The road may be washed out. it doesn't take but just a few inches of water that are moving to move your car.\"\n\n___ Stengle contributed to this report from Dallas.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet

A westward motion with an increase in forward speed is expected through Thursday. On the forecast track, the centre of Alberto will reach the coast of northeastern Mexico early Thursday morning.\n\nSome slight strengthening is forecast today or tonight before the centre of Alberto reaches land. Rapid weakening is expected once the centre moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico Thursday or Thursday night.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto is expected to produce rainfall totals of 125 millimetres to 250 millimetres across northeast Mexico into southern Texas. Maximum totals around 500 millimetres are possible across the higher terrain of the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas.\n\nThe rainfall will likely produce considerable flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed river flooding. Mudslides are also possible in areas of higher terrain across northeast Mexico.\n\nThe storm surge could soar as high as 1.21 metres along parts of the Texas coastline, if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide.\n\nThe storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 0.30 metres to 0.91 metres above normal tide levels along the immediate coast of northeastern Mexico, in areas of onshore winds north of where the centre makes landfall. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.\n\nColorado State University's initial outlook for 2024 called for about 23 named tropical storms, including 11 hurricanes and five major hurricanes.\n\nA normal hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean produces about 14 named tropical storms. Seven of those named storms typically grow into hurricanes, three of which strengthen into major hurricanes with winds of about 180 km/h or stronger.\n\nIf the prediction comes to pass, this would make for one of the most active Atlantic hurricane seasons ever observed behind 2020, 2005, and 2021.\n\nThumbnail courtesy of NOAA.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

(FOX Carolina) - Tropical Storm Alberto has become the first named storm of the 2024 hurricane season. It's one of three systems in the tropics we are keeping an eye on.\n\nAlberto formed late Wednesday morning after struggling to get a well defined center of circulation. It's been producing tropical storm force winds over a wide area, nearly 300 miles from the center over the last day or so.\n\nThe storm is shortly lived as it makes landfall Wednesday night along the coast of Mexico. Once it makes landfall, it quickly dissipates into a remnant low over the mountainous areas of Mexico.\n\nA Tropical Storm Warning is in effect over portions of northeastern Mexico and the Texas coast. Rainfall, coastal flooding and wind impacts are expected to continue Thursday. Heavy rains are a big concern with 5'' to 10'' expected and isolated areas up to 15'' from Houston down into Central Mexico along with coastal flooding.\n\nWe are also watching an area of storms several hundred miles east of the Bahamas. Conditions could allow for development over the next few days as it moves west, west-northwest and forecasted to head towards the US on Friday. There's a low 20% chance of formation through the next 7 days. Right now this system doesn't look to bring big impacts to the Carolinas, but could bring some coastal showers late week along with a choppy surf and a higher risk for rip currents.\n\nAnother area of broad low pressure is expected to develop over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico over the weekend, nearly in the same area as Potential Tropical Cyclone One. Right now, conditions don't look favorable for much development but it's worth watching into early next week.\n\nDuring the month of June, it's typical to get these \"homegrown\" systems: lows that develop in the Gulf of Mexico or just off the Atlantic coast.

Busy hurricane season.\n\nAlberto is expected to make landfall in northern Mexico on Thursday, bringing strong winds, heavy rain and some flooding to the Texas and Mexican coasts.\n\n\"A lot of rain and water, as usual, is the biggest story in tropical storms,\" said Michael Brennan, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Wednesday afternoon that Alberto was about 170 miles (270 kilometers) east of Tampico, Mexico, and about 305 miles (495 kilometers) southeast of Brownsville, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). ) The storm is moving west-southwest at 9 mph.\n\nThe storm's center was expected to reach Mexico's northeastern coast south of the mouth of the Rio Grande early Thursday morning.\n\nBrennan said sustained winds of 45 mph (72 kph) to 50 mph (80 kph) were possible before the storm made landfall.\n\nSome areas along the Texas coast are expected to get 5 inches (13 centimeters) to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain, with more isolated totals possible, Brennan said. Up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain could fall in some higher elevations of Mexico, causing mudslides, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo Le\u00f3n.\n\nTamaulipas Gov. Americo Villarreal said Wednesday on X, previously Twitter, that schools across the state will be closed between Wednesday and Friday.\n\nLuis Gerardo Gonzalez, civil defense coordinator in the state of Tamaulipas, said 333 shelters have been distributed across the state in each municipality. \"As the storm moves in, we will open more shelters.\"\n\nThe coordinator also said that the rains would be very beneficial for the state \"to help the crisis we are facing due to scarcity of water.\"\n\nOfficials urged residents to be aware of warnings shared by state and municipal civil defense. They expect the storm to arrive overnight, with communities closest to the coast hardest hit.\n\nTropical storm warnings were in effect from the Texas coast at San Luis Pass south to the mouth of the Rio Grande, and from the northeast coast of Mexico from the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\n\"Rapid weakening is expected as the center moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico,\" the center said.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main danger from heavy rain is flash flooding for the southern Texas coast. On Wednesday, the NWS said there was a \"high probability\" of flash flooding in coastal South Texas. Tornadoes or floods are possible.\n\nNOAA predicts an above-average hurricane season that begins June 1 and runs through November 30, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of which are hurricanes and three are major hurricanes.\n\nBrennan said there will be dangerous rip currents from the storm, and drivers should watch for road closures and turn back if they see roads covered in water.\n\nAreas along the Texas coast saw some road flooding and dangerous rip currents Wednesday, and coastal flooding was observed. \"We've seen some brief spin-ups and some water bodies,\" said Tyler Castillo, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Corpus Christi.\n\nTim Cady, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Houston, said they are keeping an eye on coastal flooding as high tide approaches Thursday morning.\n\n\"When these strong onshore winds combine with a high tide, it can cause coastal flooding, especially in our low-lying coastal areas,\" Caddy said.\n\nA A storm without a name As much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain fell on parts of South Florida earlier in June, stranding many motorists on flooded streets and pushing water into some homes in low-lying areas.\n\n\"People underestimate the power of water, and sometimes they don't always take the rainfall and the threats that come with it seriously, especially if you're driving in an area and you see water blocking the road, you don't want to drive in it,\" Brennan said. \"You never know how deep the water is. The road may be washed away.\"\n\nStengle contributed to this report from ___ Dallas.

The state government enacted a large-scale emergency response in anticipation of widespread flooding.\n\nThe National Weather Center office in Houston said at 4:30 a.m. CT (5:30 a.m. ET) that there had already been reports of coastal flooding as rain moves inland.\n\n\"The disturbance is very large, with rainfall, coastal flooding and wind impacts likely to occur far from the center along the coasts of Texas and northeastern Mexico,\" the National Hurricane Center said in an update.\n\nThe hurricane center also said early Wednesday that life-threatening mudslides were likely in higher areas of northern Mexico, including around the cities of Monterrey and Ciudad Victoria.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the state Division of Emergency Management to put the Texas State Emergency Operations Center to a readiness of level 2, meaning it began 24-hour operations.\n\n\"As we prepare for severe tropical weather, Texas is activating all personnel and resources needed to support Texans and communities that will be potentially impacted by excessive rain and flooding,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe Texas A&M Forest Service has mobilized four teams comprising of 100 personnel and 24 vehicles, while the Texas National Guard has three platoons of more than 40 personnel in total, alongside 20 vehicles, including Chinook helicopters.\n\nThe weather service told people in the affected areas to have five to seven days' supplies of food, water and other necessities.\n\nThe storm warning came as 71 million people were under some form of heat advisory or warning Wednesday, as a severe heat wave is set to last through Friday.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news",

Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center said the storm formed about 295 miles south-southeast of Brownsville, Tex., as torrential downpours were moving ashore in South Texas and northeastern Mexico.\n\nThe storm is expected to make landfall in northeastern Mexico on Thursday morning while its effects will be felt as far north as coastal Louisiana.\n\nIt's the United States' first taste of tropical trouble, but experts are calling for a long, busy season with many more threats on the way.\n\nWhile approaching the coast of northeastern Mexico, the storm was also pushing a surge of ocean water ashore, leading to coastal flooding along the South Texas coast early Wednesday. Social media video showed water inundating coastal communities, including Surfside Beach to the south of Galveston, flowing over roads and underneath elevated homes while overwhelming storm drains.\n\nForecasters at the National Hurricane Center said the peak storm surge could reach up to 2 to 4 feet, including around Galveston Bay.\n\nFlood watches blanket South Texas and the Rio Grande Valley, and stretch along the coastline to Cameron Parish, La. The alerts no longer include Houston, since the heaviest rains should stay primarily south of the metro.\n\nA tropical storm warning does, however, cover coastal counties from just south of Galveston to the U.S.-Mexico border, and incudes Rockport, Corpus Christi and Brownsville. Tropical storm-force winds with 50-mph gusts are probable along the shoreline.\n\nRockport was gusting to 36 mph around 7 a.m. Central time, and Padre Island to 39 mph. Rainfall totals have been light thus far, with Brownsville leading the pack at 0.95 inches. That said, the core of the deep tropical moisture, and subsequent downpours, will soon arrive.\n\nAs of 10 a.m. Central time, Alberto had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph and was moving west at 8 mph. The Hurricane Center said Alberto is a large tropical storm with tropical-storm-force winds extending up to 415 miles north of the center.\n\nScattered downpours were pivoting ashore in South Texas and will become more numerous and intense as the day wears on. The heaviest rains will last from noon to midnight in southern regions, and probably won't make it much north of San Antonio or Victoria.\n\nA widespread 4 to 8 inches is likely in South Texas, with localized totals over 10 inches possible. Downpours will taper to intermittent showers by early Thursday.\n\nA near record-moist air mass will be in place, allowing for intense rainfall rates. A weather balloon launched Wednesday morning from Brownsville recorded 2.78 inches of moisture present from the bottom to the top of the atmosphere. That's just shy of the 2.93-inch record set on July 17, 1996.\n\nSome of the storm's most serious flooding is probable in northeast Mexico and Central America.\n\n\"Life-threatening flooding and mudslides are likely in and near areas of higher terrain across the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas, including the cities of Monterrey and Ciudad Victoria,\" the Hurricane Center wrote.\n\nHowever, some of the rainfall in Mexico will be quite beneficial, as the area has been enduring serious drought.\n\nRains from a large, swirling area of showers and thunderstorms across the southwest Gulf of Mexico and Central America, known as the Central American Gyre, have produced disastrous flooding in parts Guatemala and El Salvador, causing at least 14 fatalities, according to the Associated Press. This same gyre spawned Alberto and could give rise to another storm in the Gulf of Mexico next week.\n\nIt's still looking like 40- to 50-mph gusts will be possible along the immediate coastline from Houston-Galveston southward, with lesser but still blustery winds expected inland.\n\nThe onshore flow will push water against the coast, leading to a surge of up to 2 to 4 feet in the most prone areas and 1 to 3 feet elsewhere. Because of the system's sprawling circulation, the surge was forecast to affect areas hundreds of miles from its center, as far away as the western coast of Louisiana.\n\nWhen tropical cyclones and disturbances hit land, sporadic tornadoes sometimes occur ahead, and to the right, of the center. Since South Texas will be in the \"front right quadrant\" of the system, a subtle change of low-level winds with height, known as wind shear, could support an isolated tornado risk.\n\nThe National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center has advertised a Level 1 out of 5 Marginal risk for severe weather.", "source": {"uri": "matzav.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "matzav.com"}, "authors": [],

(WCSC) - The entire South Carolina coast is under a high risk of rip currents through Wednesday night.\n\nThe risk extends from Georgia through South Carolina and into Coastal Pinder and Coastal New Hanover Counties in North Carolina from 8 a.m. into the evening.\n\nClick here to download the free Live 5 First Alert Weather app.\n\nLive 5 First Alert Meteorologist Joey Sovine says Wednesday should be considered a \"no-swim day\" because of the heightened risk of rip currents.\n\nRip currents can pose a life-threatening risk by sweeping even the best swimmers away from shore and into deeper water.\n\nIf you must go into the water, swim near a lifeguard. If you are caught in a rip current, relax and float: Do not swim against the current. If you are able, swim in a direction following the shoreline. If you are unable to escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.\n\nBut because some beaches do not have lifeguards and because of the higher risk, lifeguards on duty could potentially be working to help someone else.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center is monitoring Potential Tropical Cyclone One for development into a tropical depression or a tropical storm sometime Wednesday shortly before it reaches the Mexico coast.\n\nAs of 8 a.m., the system was about 295 miles southeast of Brownsville, Texas with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. It was moving to the west-northwest at 8 mph with a minimum central pressure of 29.44 inches or 997 mb.\n\nWATCH OUR HURRICANE SPECIAL: 'Ahead of the storm': Hurricane Season 2024\n\nThough a tropical storm has maximum sustained winds of at least 39 mph, Potential Tropical Cyclone One has not been named as a tropical storm so far because forecasters have not yet spotted sufficient rotation to qualify it as a tropical storm. When it is officially declared a tropical storm, it will take the name Alberto, the first on this year's list.\n\nIt was expected to bring heavy rains, coastal flooding and gusty winds to the coasts of Texas and Northeastern Mexico through Thursday.\n\nA Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for the Texas coast from San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande; and the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Puerto de Altamira.\n\nA Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area.\n\nAn area closer to the Lowcountry, however, has a lower chance of tropical development. A group of thunderstorms located several hundred miles east of the Bahamas is associated with a surface trough of low pressure.\n\nIts chances of development into a tropical depression over the next seven days remain at just 20% as it slowly moves toward the southeastern United States.\n\nLive 5 First Alert Meteorologist Joey Sovine says the chance of showers by the end of the week could increase as the system moves closer to the coast, even if it does not take on tropical characteristics.\n\nHurricane season began on June 1 and continues through Nov. 30.\n\nLast month, the National Hurricane Center released what it called the most active pre-season forecast in the agency's history, which calls for a \"hyperactive\" season.\n\nThe official forecast calls for between 17 and 25 named storms, with between eight and 13 reaching hurricane status. Of those, between four and seven are expected to become major hurricanes, meaning they reach Category 3 strength or greater.", "source": {"uri": "live5news.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Historically, storms that form in June in the Caribbean typically track toward Texas or Louisiana, the Hurricane Center says.\n\nSince 1851, several tropical depressions and storms have had effects on North Carolina in June, but no hurricane has made landfall in the state during that month.\n\nEmergency management officials say June is the perfect time to gather hurricane supplies so that if more severe storms come later in the season, you'll be ready.\n\nForecasters have said that because of excessively warm water in the Atlantic and the effects of a La Ni\u00f1a weather pattern expected to

It had top sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. A tropical storm is defined by sustained winds of between 39 and 73 mph (62 and 117 kph), and above that the system becomes a hurricane.\n\nThe storm was moving west at 9 mph (15 kph). Tropical storm warnings were in effect from the Texas coast at San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande and from the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla. Some slight strengthening is forecast for Wednesday before the center of Alberto reaches land on Thursday, the center said.\n\n\"Rapid weakening is expected once the center moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico\" on Thursday, the center said.\n\nThe storm is expected to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches (about 13 to 25 centimeters) across northeast Mexico into South Texas. Maximum totals around 20 inches (51 centimeters) are possible across the higher terrain of the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas. Flash flooding is likely, and mudslides are possible in some areas, the center said.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. Eight inches (20 centimeters) of rain or more could fall by Saturday morning. On Wednesday, the NWS said, there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nElexus Reddout and her father, Jeremy, enjoy the waves between Murdoch's and Pleasure Pier Wednesday, June 19, 2024, in Galveston, Texas.

The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.\n\nBrennan said that the first named system in the Atlantic on average comes on June 20, so Alberto is \"about right on schedule\".\n\nIn the Village of Surfside Beach, located on a barrier island on the Texas coast about 104km south of Houston, Mayor Gregg Bisso said that rains had already left about 60cm of water on streets on the west end of the island, making them impassable.\n\n\"We're on a barrier island and there's no place for the rain to go, plus the extremely high tides, everything is just hanging right there and it's flooding all the streets,\" Bisso said, adding that double red flags have been placed on the beach to warn people that no one should be in the water because of the extreme rip tides.\n\n\"Those conditions were extremely bad out there yesterday, and today,\" he said.\n\nAll of the homes on the island are elevated anywhere from 3m to 4m above the ground, so they don't expect homes to flood and evacuations were not ordered.\n\n\"We're just waiting for the rains to stop and the tide to go down,\" he said.\n\nBrennan said there will be dangerous rip currents from the storm and drivers should watch out for road closures and turn around if they see water covering roadways.\n\nA no-name storm earlier in June dumped more than 50cm of rain on parts of South Florida, stranding numerous motorists on flooded streets and pushing water into some homes in low-lying areas.\n\n\"People underestimate the power of water and they sometimes don't always take rainfall and the threats that come with it seriously, especially if you are driving in an area and you see water covering the road, you don't want to drive into it,\" Brennan said. \"You don't know how deep the water is. The road may be washed out. It doesn't take but just a few inches of water that are moving to move your car.\"", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Along with sustained winds near 45 mph, the storm is forecast to dump up to 20 inches across parts of northeast Mexico with nearly a foot of rain expected throughout southern Texas.\n\nSuch high rainfall totals will likely produce \"considerable flash flooding and urban flooding\" as well as possible mudslides across northern Mexico, the NHC said.\n\nAfter making landfall, Alberto is expected to diminish in strength, though it could still produce life-threatening weather conditions.\n\nAlberto began drenching southern Texas on Wednesday, triggering widespread coastal flooding that left Surfside Beach, a city along the Texas Gulf Coast south of Houston, under several feet of water. The storm also lashed Mexico with heavy rain, and caused the deaths of at least three minors, Nuevo Leon state Governor Samuel Garcia told local media without providing details.\n\nAcross southern Texas, the combination of storm surge and high tide is raising alarms on Thursday as floodwaters could reach up to 4 feet along the coast. The deepest waters will breach the shore along the Texas coast just to the north of Mexico, where the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous waves, according to NHC.\n\nLife-threatening surf and rip current conditions are among the central threats for the Gulf Coast of Texas through Friday. In deep South Texas, multiple counties were under a tornado watch as forecasters warned that a possible tornado or two could spin up through the morning.\n\nFlood advisories were also active. Multiple south-central counties received 1 and 3 inches of rain by 2 a.m. Thursday, the weather service office in Corpus Christy said, adding: \"Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.\"\n\nGov. Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration for 51 counties and activated three platoons of the Texas National Guard, including more than 40 personnel, 20 vehicles and Chinook helicopters.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto is kicking off what experts have said will be a busy storm season. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Director Rick Spinrad said last month that the Atlantic hurricane season is shaping up to be \"extraordinary,\" with an \"85% chance for an above-average year.\"\n\nContributing: Reuters; Doyle Rice, John Bacon, Kirsten Crow, USA TODAY", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

Maximum totals around 20 inches are possible across the higher terrain of the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas. This rainfall will likely produce considerable flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed river flooding. Mudslides are also possible in areas of higher terrain across northeast Mexico.\"\n\nThe NHC also warns of the potential for a small storm surge, as follows:\n\n- Sargent, TX to Sabine Pass, TX...2-4 ft\n\n- Galveston Bay...2-4 ft\n\n- Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to Sargent, TX...1-3 ft\n\n- Sabine Pass, TX to Vermilion/Cameron Parish Line, LA...1-3 ft\n\nAt those surge levels inundation would be expected to be minor, to non-existent except for in particularly low-lying waterfront areas.\n\nThe slower the start to the season, the more frequent the storm formation and activity we might expect to see in the peak of the hurricane season, which could lead to more challenges for those tracking and analysing storms for their potential impacts on portfolios of insurance and reinsurance risks.\n\nWhile we're highlighting this first storm of the season in an article, we're unlikely to cover them all through the months ahead and will only provide coverage where impacts are seen as possible that could threaten insurance and reinsurance, as well as catastrophe bond or ILS, market losses.\n\nBut you can always keep track of the 2024 Atlantic tropical storm and hurricane season on

A combination of weather factors will still make life difficult for some areas of the southwestern Gulf Coast.\n\nTexas will face the worst of it, with a lot of rainfall and flash flooding possible.

The system is the first tropical storm of what many experts have predicted will be a very active hurricane season.\n\nAccording to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), the storm's maximum sustained winds in Mexico were documented at 50 miles per hour. However, the NHC stressed that people near the storm shouldn't focus on the forecast path, as the storm is very large and could bring impacts such as rainfall, flooding, and wind far from its center, including in Texas.\n\nAfter a heavy day of rain on Wednesday, Brownsville, Texas, saw more than 4 inches of rain in some spots, exceeding its average monthly rainfall of 3.86 inches. According to the NWS office in Brownsville, some lingering rain was expected on Thursday, with around half an inch forecast for Brownsville and 1.5 inches forecast in surrounding areas.\n\nNewsweek reached out to NWS Brownsville by phone for comment.\n\n\"Rainfall associated with Tropical Storm Alberto will begin to diminish today across southern Texas,\" the NHC said. \"Rainfall associated with Alberto, however, will continue to impact large regions of Central America, north across northeastern Mexico. This rainfall will likely produce considerable flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed river flooding.\"\n\nAs of Thursday morning at around 7:20 a.m. Eastern time, there were some lingering weather advisories in place in southern Texas related to the tropical storm, including a tornado watch, a flood warning, and a tropical storm warning, among others.\n\n\"Even with Alberto making landfall, some hazards are still expected to linger through today and possibly into tomorrow,\" the NWS tropical storm warning said. \"Beach and marine conditions are expected to remain hazardous through today and tomorrow. This includes coastal flooding up to 3 feet, deadly rip current, high surf, and isolated gusty winds and low visibilities in isolated heavy showers and thunderstorms. Another 2-4 inches of rainfall is also possible today.\"\n\nThe heavy rainfall could benefit Texas's drought, which is documented as severe for more than 93 percent of Cameron County where Brownsville is located.

The high surf advisory stretches until 11 p.m. Thursday.\n\nThe NWS also warned for beach erosion especially during high tide around 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Volusia County is still recovering from major erosion created during hurricanes Ian and Nicole in 2022.\n\nThe heavy wave action also prompted a small craft advisory from Flagler Beach to Jupiter Inlet in effect until Friday morning with winds gusting up to 35 mph and seas at 6 to 9 feet.\n\n\"Models continue to disagree on the exact location and timing of this feature moving onshore,\" reads the NWS forecast. \"However, they generally agree that it will be somewhere over north Florida/southern Georgia. Fortunately, models continue to support little in the way of development, keeping the feature as an open wave.\"\n\nBreezy conditions are still expected, and while some areas may see more rainfall, the overall totals for the region are forecast to remain under 1 inch of rain.\n\nThe NHC, though, has its time busy with what is still Potential Tropical Cyclone One in the western Gulf of Mexico, a system projected to form into the season's first tropical storm later today, which would give it the name Tropical Storm Alberto.\n\nAs of 8 a.m., the system was located about 235 miles east-southeast of La Pesca, Mexico and 295 miles southeast of Brownsville, Texas with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph moving west-northwest at 8 mph.\n\n\"A generally westward motion with an increase in forward speed is expected during the next day or so, and the system is forecast to reach the coast of northeastern Mexico by late tonight or early Thursday,\" NHC forecasters said.\n\nIts tropical-storm-force winds extend out 415 miles to the north of the center and already a Texas weather station in Matagorda Bay recorded sustained winds of 38 mph with a gust up to 47 mph. The NHC warns that some tornado activity is possible across parts of Deep South Texas and Southeast Texas.\n\nA tropical storm warning remains in effect for the Texas coast from San Luis Pass south to the mouth of the Rio Grande River and into Mexico south to Puerto de Alamira.\n\nRainfall from the system is projected to be from 5 to 10 inches with some areas getting up to 15 inches that could produce flash and urban flooding along with more river flooding across the region as well as potentially producing mudslides in some areas of high terrain across northeast Mexico.\n\nStorm surge is projected to be between 2-4 feet from Sargent, Texas to Sabine Pass, Texas as well as in Galveston Bay, and from 1-3 feet from the mouth of the Rio Grande to Sargent and from Sabine Pass north to the Vermilion-Cameron Parish line in Louisiana.\n\nThe NHC is also keeping track of another broad area of low pressure that is forecast to develop over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico this weekend.\n\n\"Environmental conditions are expected to be conducive for gradual development of this system through early next week while it moves slowly west-northwestward or northwestward,\" forecasters said.\n\nThe NHC gives it a 30% chance to develop into a tropical depression or storm in the next seven days.", "source": {"uri": "orlandosentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Water levels could reach heights of two to four feet.\"\n\nRegarding the winds, tropical storm conditions and possible tornadoes are expected today and tonight in parts of deep southern Texas and southeastern Texas.\n\nIn a notice posted on its website, the NHC warned that this is a \"large system with impacts extending far from the center in the form of rainfall, coastal flooding, and tropical storm conditions in parts of Texas and Mexico.\" If it evolves into a cyclone, the disturbance will be named Alberto.\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 2024, with concerning forecasts indicating it could be the most active in the last 30 years.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the United States reminded that the hurricane season will run from June 1 to November 30.\n\nAlthough NOAA reported that \"the tropics will remain relatively quiet for at least the next 7 days,\" in its annual pre-season report at the end of May, NOAA warned that this season is expected to be the most active in the past three decades, with between 17 and 25 storms with winds exceeding 62 kilometers per hour.", "source": {"uri": "cubaheadlines.com",

Although it has now weakened into a tropical depression, the storm's aftermath continues to pose challenges for the affected regions.\n\nImpact of Alberto on Texas and Mexico\n\nOn Thursday morning, Tropical Storm Alberto made landfall in northeastern Mexico. As the storm moved west, it weakened into a tropical depression, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC). The intense rainfall from Alberto led to catastrophic flooding in southern Texas and caused fatalities in Mexico.\n\nDeadly Floods in Mexico\n\nIn Mexico, the storm claimed the lives of at least three people. Reports indicate that a man drowned in a river in Monterrey, and two minors died in the Allende municipality while riding a bicycle in the rain. The heavy rain has also caused widespread disruption, with the NHC forecasting up to 20 inches of rain in some Mexican states, including Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas.\n\nSevere Rainfall in Texas\n\nSouthern Texas experienced significant rainfall and flooding on Wednesday, with conditions expected to improve by Thursday. The intense rain from Alberto led Texas Governor Greg Abbott to issue a severe weather disaster declaration for 50 counties, including Galveston, Jackson, and Uvalde. This declaration underscores the severity of the storm's impact on the region.\n\nManaging the Aftermath\n\nAs Tropical Storm Alberto transitions into a tropical depression, communities in Texas and Mexico are left to manage the extensive damage caused by the flooding.

It will unload torrential rainfall and considerably ramp up the flood threat, not just in the US, but also in parts of Mexico and Central America.\n\nAs the name suggests, Potential Tropical Cyclone One isn't quite a tropical storm yet, but is expected to become one and poses a threat to the areas in the tropical storm warning over the next 48 hours.\n\nThe system had 40 mph winds Tuesday morning - strong enough that if it does develop a coherent circulation, it would be named Tropical Storm Alberto. It's forecast to by late Tuesday or Wednesday before approaching the northern coast of Mexico on Wednesday night.\n\nThe system's strength will be limited by its short time over water, but it's main threat of significant rain and flooding will not: multiple days of gushing rainfall for parts of Central America, southern Mexico and the US western Gulf Coast.\n\nHeavy rain was already ongoing Monday in parts of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras as the gyre churned. Double-digit rainfall totals are possible in these areas by Thursday. Rain is needed desperately in parts of Mexico and Central America that are bone-dry after weeks of unrelenting heat. But day after day of heavy rain will quickly overwhelm parched soils unable to absorb water as fast as it falls, resulting in dangerous flooding.\n\nDeep tropical moisture was also fueling storms as far north as the US's western Gulf Coast. Double-digit rainfall totals are likely in portions of coastal and southern Texas by the weekend, while other portions of the Gulf Coast could pick up several inches through midweek.\n\nA level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place for the Texas coast Tuesday and much of South Texas on Wednesday.\n\nBy Wednesday, the air over the Gulf Coast will be loaded up with \"incredible amounts of moisture\" which could \"easily\" produce flash flooding, the Weather Prediction Center warned Monday.\n\nHeavy rain isn't the most welcome sight along some parts of the US Gulf Coast. June has been drier after a drenching spring, but the soil and area rivers are still holding on to plenty of water in eastern Texas and western Louisiana.\n\nAnother tropical threat could take shape\n\nAnother tropical threat is stirring in the Atlantic as development gets underway in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nAn area of showers and thunderstorms a few hundred miles east of the Bahamas could be the starting point for a potential tropical system later this week. Right now, the National Hurricane Center gives it a low chance of developing into a tropical system.\n\nMultiple atmospheric factors must align for the area of stormy weather to get its act together, but the opportunity for development exists over the next few days as it slowly pushes westward.\n\nIf something tropical does develop, it could approach the southeastern US by Thursday or Friday and be steered south of the heat dome roasting areas farther north. It's unclear exactly which areas could be impacted, but anywhere from Florida to the Carolinas should keep a close eye on the forecast as it comes into focus in the coming days.\n\nDrenching rain could soak parts of the Southeast coast and rough seas are possible from the Bahamas to the mid-Atlantic coasts regardless of development.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

As many as 13 of those storms are expected to become hurricanes with winds of 74 mph or higher, including four to seven major hurricanes with winds exceeding 111 mph.\n\nThe agency calculates its hurricane season predictions based on several factors, including near-record warm water temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean, La Nina conditions in the Pacific, and lower trade winds in the Atlantic.\n\nIt has also utilized artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to assist in its predictions.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abbott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abbott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_and_rescue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search and rescue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf Coast of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_delta", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "River delta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wastewater", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wastewater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_flooding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Urban flooding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_flooding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coastal flooding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_winds", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trade winds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Ni\u00f1a", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Ni\u00f1a"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2020/07/26/Hurricane-Hanna-begins-to-make-landfall-700x420.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659946", "eventUri": "eng-9659946", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

This system has a low chance to develop into a named storm. However, forecasters continue to monitor it as it moves west northwest toward the southeastern United States.\n\nThe area of showers and storms is currently located several hundred miles east of the Bahamas.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has predicted a \"hyperactive\" hurricane season this year with between 17 and 25 named storms. NOAA's forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes, with four of them being major hurricanes.\n\nThose numbers are well above the average Atlantic hurricane season which has 14 named storms, seven of

rising waters moving inland from the shoreline,\" the advisory explains.\n\nIf the surge occurs during high tide, the water level is expected to rise to the higher end of the range estimation. \"Elevated water levels will likely be accompanied by large and destructive waves,\" the NHC warned.\n\nThe NHC also warned, \"A couple of tornadoes are possible today and tonight\n\nacross parts of

weather, Texas is activating all personnel and resources needed to support Texans and communities that will be potentially impacted by excessive rain and flooding,\" the governor said in the press release.\n\nThe NHC advisory predicts \"some slight strengthening in forecast today or tonight before the center of Alberto reaches land,\" which is expected Thursday morning. \"Rapid weakening is expected once the center moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico Thursday or Thursday night,\" the advisory explained.\n\nAtlantic hurricane season takes place from June 1 to the

Early season activity, or lack thereof, is no indication of how the remainder of the season will play out.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center on Monday designated a disturbance in the southwest Gulf of Mexico as Potential Tropical Cyclone One. This means that the system is not meteorologically tropical but is expected to become a tropical storm and impact land shortly.\n\nThe storm is expected to become a tropical and make landfall in eastern Mexico. Heavy rain is expected to extend into Texas and Louisiana.\n\nA second disturbance is expected to develop east of Florida and north of the Bahamas.\n\nThis is being born of non-tropical origins, off of a dying cold front that is now east of Bermuda.\n\nWith a strong area of high pressure anchored over New England, this system will be forced back west toward Florida or the southeast U.S. This will likely be a sloppy, hybrid storm which should cap the intensity of the storm. Still, rain chances will go up for parts of the southeast coast for the weekend.\n\nA secondary system could develop in the southwest Gulf of Mexico behind Potential Tropical Cyclone One. This is the yellow area highlighted on the map above near where the disturbance designated as Potential Tropical Cyclone One is as of Tuesday morning.\n\nIt's too early to tell where the system could track but at this time, it appears as if it will favor the north or west Gulf Coast.\n\nThe first name of the 2024 hurricane season is Alberto.

It is moving west at about 9 miles per hour, and expected to accelerate before reaching the coast of northeastern Mexico early Thursday morning.\n\nUntil then, parts of Texas can expect heavy rainfall, coastal flooding and forceful winds. And some areas are already inundated, as of midday Wednesday.\n\nTexas Public Radio reports that emergency management officials in Corpus Christi distributed sandbags to residents on Tuesday, in time for the winds and heavy rainfall that began early Wednesday, before Alberto even got its name.\n\nThe National Weather Service office for Austin and San Antonio said the first bands of rain associated with Alberto had reached the coast before 7:30 a.m. local time and were moving inland, with rain expected to impact the I-35 corridor by early afternoon.\n\nThe NWS office in Corpus Christi said at 10 a.m. local time that the area was already experiencing \"some of the heavier rains associated with the system,\" with 6 to 8 inches of rain expected across the southern Coastal Bend.\n\nCoastal communities like Galveston and Surfside Beach were already flooded as of Wednesday morning, with local news reports and social media posts showing water submerging roads and threatening to reach even houses raised on stilts.\n\nForecasters warn Alberto could produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico into South Texas, with maximum totals as high as 20 inches -- and a threat of ensuing mudslides -- possible in areas of Mexico with higher terrain.\n\nThe storm surge, combined with high tide cycles, could reach as high as 2 to 4 feet in places like Sargent and Galveston Bay. Tornadoes are also possible across parts of Deep South Texas and Southeast Texas during the day and into Wednesday evening.\n\nNational Hurricane Center Director Mike Brennan said in a late morning video update that the area in the middle of the Texas coast -- near Corpus Christi north of Brownsville -- is likely to see the heaviest rainfall, with as many as 3 or 4 inches of rain per hour falling for hours in some locations.\n\nAs a result, a combination of flash flood and coastal flooding warnings are in effect along essentially the entire Texas coast, from Galveston to Brownsville.\n\nBrennan urged residents not to drive into submerged streets, noting that it only takes a few inches of moving water to sweep a vehicle away.\n\n\"Please don't drive around barricades,\" he said. \"Turn around, don't drown. Don't become a statistic driving into a flooded roadway.\"\n\nBrennan said conditions along the Texas coast will gradually start to improve during the day Thursday. Forecasters expect Alberto to dissipate over Mexico by the end of the day.\n\n\"But we still got at least another 24 hours of relatively hazardous conditions,\" he said. \"So make sure you have multiple ways to get emergency information.\"", "source": {"uri": "ctpublic.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Connecticut Public"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_treisman@ctpublic.org", "name":

This could cause significant flash flooding and mudslides in higher terrain areas and affect coastal water levels with storm surges.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto Advisory Number 9 NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL AL012024\n\n400 PM CDT Wed Jun 19 2024 ...ALBERTO'S CENTER EXPECTED TO REACH THE COAST OF Mexico EARLY\n\nTHURSDAY... ...HEAVY RAINS, COASTAL FLOODING, AND GUSTY WINDS FORECAST TO\n\nCONTINUE ALONG THE COASTS OF TEXAS AND NORTHEASTERN Mexico THROUGH THURSDAY...\n\nABOUT 305 MI...495 KM SSE OF BROWNSVILLE TEXAS MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H\n\nPRESENT MOVEMENT...WSW OR 250 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...995 MB...29.39 INCHES\n\nSUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT: A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for... * the Texas coast from San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the\n\nRio Grande * the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\nA Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area.\n\nFor storm information specific to your area in the United States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please monitor\n\nproducts issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office. For storm information specific to your area outside of the\n\nUnited States, please monitor products issued by your national meteorological service.\n\nDISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK ----------------------\n\nAt 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Alberto was located near latitude 21.9 North, longitude 95.3 West. Alberto is\n\nmoving toward the west-southwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), but a westward motion is expected to resume soon and continue for the\n\nnext day or so. On this track, the center of Alberto is expected to reach the Gulf coast of Mexico early Thursday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. Some slight strengthening is possible this evening or tonight before\n\nthe center of Alberto reaches land. Weakening is expected once the center moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico\n\nThursday or Thursday night. Alberto is a large tropical storm, with tropical-storm-force winds\n\nextending outward up to 415 miles (665 km) north of the center. The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.39 inches).\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND ----------------------\n\nKey messages for Alberto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC.\n\nRAINFALL: Tropical Storm Alberto is expected to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico into South Texas.\n\nMaximum totals around 20 inches are possible across the higher terrain of the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and\n\nTamaulipas. This rainfall will likely produce considerable flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed river flooding. Mudslides\n\nare also possible in areas of higher terrain across northeast Mexico.\n\nFor a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding associated with Alberto, please see the National Weather Service\n\nStorm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk\n\ngraphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and\n\nthe tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water could\n\nreach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nSargent, TX to Sabine Pass, TX...2-4 ft Galveston Bay...2-4 ft\n\nMouth of the Rio Grande, TX to Sargent, TX...1-3 ft Sabine Pass, TX to Vermilion/Cameron Parish Line, LA...1-3 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be\n\naccompanied by large and dangerous waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,\n\nand can vary greatly over short distances. For information specific to your area, please see products issued by your local\n\nNational Weather Service forecast office. For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,\n\nplease see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.\n\nStorm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast of northeastern\n\nMexico in areas of onshore winds north of where the center makes landfall. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large\n\nand destructive waves. WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning\n\narea through early Thursday. TORNADOES: A few tornadoes are possible this afternoon through\n\ntonight across parts of Deep South Texas and Southeast Texas. SURF: Swells generated by Alberto will affect the coast of Texas\n\nand northeastern Mexico through Friday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\n\nPlease consult products from your local weather office.

He said some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nTamaulipas Gov. Am\u00e9rico Villarreal said Wednesday on X, formerly Twitter, that schools across the state will remain closed between Wednesday and Friday.\n\nThe storm was moving west at 9 mph . Tropical storm warnings were in effect from the Texas coast at San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande and from the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\n\"Rapid weakening is expected once the center moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico\" on Thursday, the center said.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday, the NWS said, there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nNOAA predicts the hurricane season that began June 1 and runs through Nov. 30 is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.\n\nBrennan said that the first named system in the Atlantic on average comes on June 20, so Alberto is \"about right on schedule.\"\n\nIn the Village of Surfside Beach, located on a barrier island on the Texas coast about 65 miles south of Houston, Mayor Gregg Bisso said Wednesday that rains had already left about 2 feet of water on streets on the west end of the island, making them impassable.\n\n\"We're on a barrier island and there's no place for the rain to go, plus the extremely high tides, everything is just hanging right there and it's flooding all the streets,\" Bisso said, adding that double red flags have been placed on the beach to warn people that no one should be in the water because of the extreme rip tides.\n\n\"Those conditions were extremely bad out there yesterday, and today,\" he said.\n\nAll of the homes on the island are elevated anywhere from 10 to 14 feet above the ground, so they don't expect homes to flood and evacuations were not ordered.\n\n\"We're just waiting for the rains to stop and the tide to go down,\" he said.\n\nBrennan said there will be dangerous rip currents from the storm and drivers should watch out for road closures and turn around if they see water covering roadways.\n\nA no-name storm earlier in June dumped more than 20 inches of rain on parts of South Florida, stranding numerous motorists on flooded streets and pushing water into some homes in low-lying areas.\n\n\"People underestimate the power of water and they sometimes don't always take rainfall and the threats that come with it seriously, especially if you are driving in an area and you see water covering the road, you don't want to drive into it,\" Brennan said. \"You don't know how deep the water is. The road may be washed out. it doesn't take but just a few inches of water that are moving to move your car.\"\n\n___ Stengle contributed to this report from Dallas. journalist Julie Walker

A tropical storm is defined by sustained winds of between 39 and 73 mph (62 and 117 kph), and above that the system becomes a hurricane.\n\nThe storm was moving west at 9 mph (15 kph). Tropical storm warnings were in effect from the Texas coast at San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande and from the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla. Some slight strengthening is forecast for Wednesday before the centre of Alberto reaches land on Thursday, the centre said.\n\nAlso Read | Indian Millionaires Migration 2024: About 4,300 Millionaire To Leave India This Year and Go to Other Countries, Says Report.\n\n\"Rapid weakening is expected once the centre moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico\" on Thursday, the centre said.\n\nThe storm is expected to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches (about 13 to 25 centimetres) across northeast Mexico into South Texas. Maximum totals around 20 inches (51 centimetres) are possible across the higher terrain of the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas. Flash flooding is likely, and mudslides are possible in some areas, the centre said.\n\nThe US National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. Eight inches (20 centimetres) of rain or more could fall by Saturday morning. On Wednesday, the NWS said, there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts the hurricane season that began June 1 and runs through November 30 is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.\n\nA no-name storm earlier in June dumped more than 20 inches (50 centimetres) of rain on parts of South Florida, stranding numerous motorists on flooded streets and pushing water into some homes in low-lying areas.

Meanwhile, the season's first named storm, Tropical Storm Alberto, lost steam after moving inland while drenching Mexico and Texas.\n\nThe Atlantic system as of the NHC's 8 a.m. tropical outlook remains a small area of low pressure located about 150 miles east of the northernmost Bahamas with disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity.\n\n\"While environmental conditions are only marginally conducive due to nearby dry air, further development of this system could lead to the development of a tropical depression while the low moves west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph and approaches the northeastern coast of Florida or the Georgia coast early on Friday,\" said NHC Warning Coordination Meteorologist Robbie Berg.\n\nAn Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft is slated to fly out to the system in the afternoon.\n\nThe NHC gives it a 40% chance of development in the next two to seven days.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a high surf advisory that runs into Friday with breaking waves of 5 to 7 feet in the surf zone with a high rip current risk along coastal Central and Northeast Florida beaches.\n\n\"Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water,\" warned the NWS.\n\nErosion will be greatest at high tide around 7 p.m. and 7 a.m., the NWS stated. Volusia County beaches are still recovering from major washout that occurred during both Hurricane Ian and Hurricane Nicole in 2022.\n\nThe NWS also has a small craft advisory in place from Jupiter Inlet north to the Altamaha Sound, Georgia that runs through late Friday for northeast Florida and through Friday morning for Central Florida.\n\nWaves of 7 to 10 feet are expected offshore with 25-30 mph winds and gusts up to 35 mph farther north along Florida's coast.\n\nRain chances are highest in Brevard and Volusia counties in Central Florida as the low approaches with some thunderstorm activity, the NWS stated.\n\nAs far as Tropical Storm Alberto goes, the system gained some wind speed as it dumped rainfall over Mexico and Texas but fell back in strength to become Tropical Depression Alberto by late morning.\n\nIn its 11 a.m. advisory, the center of Alberto was located inland about 95 miles west of Tampico, Mexico and 280 miles south-southwest of Brownsville, Texas with sustained winds of 35 mph moving west at 18 mph. It had earlier Thursday maintained winds of 45 mph when it was a tropical storm.\n\nAll tropical storm warnings have ceased and the system is expected to diminish further throughout Thursday.\n\nRainfall is still an issue in Mexico with 5 to 10 inches expected with some areas in higher terrain of inland Mexico getting up to 20 inches. Rain in Texas, though, dropped off quickly Thursday morning with only another 1 inch expected in some southern parts of the state.\n\nThe NHC is also tracking a broad area of low pressure that is forecast to form over southeastern Mexico and northern Central America on Friday.\n\n\"Environmental conditions appear conducive for gradual development after this system moves over the Bay of Campeche on Saturday, and a tropicaldepression could form over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico this weekend while it moves slowly west-northwestward or northwestward,\" forecasters said.\n\nThe NHC gives it a 20% chance of formation over the next two days and 50% in the next seven.\n\nAfter Alberto, the next named system for the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season would be Beryl.", "source": {"uri":

A turn toward the west-northwest is anticipated Tuesday night or Wednesday, with the system likely approaching the western Gulf Coast late Wednesday.\n\nGradual strengthening is possible, and the disturbance is forecast to develop into a tropical storm by Wednesday. If it becomes better organized, as expected, it will most likely be named Tropical Storm Alberto. Tropical-storm-force winds extend up to 290 miles northeast of the center.\n\nA Tropical Storm Watch has been issued for the Texas coast from Port O'Connor southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande. Additionally, the government of Mexico has issued a Tropical Storm Watch for the northeastern coast of Mexico, south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Boca de Catan.\n\nResidents along the coasts of Texas and northeastern Mexico are advised to monitor this system's progress, as additional watches and warnings may be issued tonight and Tuesday.\n\nSummary of Watches and Warnings:\n\n- A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for the Texas coast from Port O'Connor southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande.\n\n- A Tropical Storm Watch is also in effect for the northeastern coast of Mexico, south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Boca de Catan.\n\nA Tropical Storm Watch indicates that tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.\n\nForecasters are also monitoring a rare area of low pressure in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean, several hundred miles east of Florida and the Bahamas.\n\nFOX 35 Storm Team Meteorologist Brooks Garner said the low is trying to develop along an old cold front in the western Atlantic. Garner said that could be the seed for a future tropical or subtropical system, set to make a run for Florida late this week.\n\nAccording to the NHC, it has a 30% chance of forming over the next seven days.\n\nThere's also an upper level low atop of that developing tropical system, which Garner said is the opposite of what the systems need to further develop. (They need high-pressure aloft.)\n\nThe current setup will obstruct any chance of rapid advancement of this system. This will keep the system much weaker than the earlier appeared potential from over the weekend, when the threat first became apparent.\n\nIf the area were to develop, such an event would be \"extremely rare\" for June, said FOX 35 Storm Team Meteorologist Noah Bergren. \"Historically, only three storms have made landfall from the east in June,\" he added. \"The most recent was Tropical Storm Danny in 2021, which hit South Carolina.\"\n\nRELATED: 'Extremely rare' tropical system could form off Florida's Atlantic Coast midweek\n\nThis unusual weather pattern is caused by a massive heat dome over New England, which creates an east-to-west flow over the southwest Atlantic Ocean.\n\nRegardless of development, the tropical activity will cause breezy conditions on Thursday and Friday in Central Florida, with a higher chance for rain, potentially rough surf and slightly higher than normal tides.", "source": {"uri": "fox35orlando.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 35

Heavy rains, coastal flooding, and gusty winds are expected along the Texas and northeastern Mexico coasts. Alberto is likely to make landfall in northeastern Mexico by early Thursday, bringing potential for flash floods and mudslides.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto Intermediate Advisory Number 8A NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL AL012024\n\n100 PM CDT Wed Jun 19 2024 ...ALBERTO MOVING WESTWARD OVER THE WESTERN Gulf of Mexico...\n\n...HEAVY RAINS, COASTAL FLOODING, AND GUSTY WINDS FORECAST ALONG THE COASTS OF TEXAS AND NORTHEASTERN Mexico THROUGH THURSDAY...\n\nABOUT 295 MI...475 KM SSE OF BROWNSVILLE TEXAS MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H\n\nPRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 270 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...995 MB...29.39 INCHES\n\nSUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT: A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for... * the Texas coast from San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the\n\nRio Grande * the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\nA Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area.\n\nFor storm information specific to your area in the United States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please monitor\n\nproducts issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office. For storm information specific to your area outside of the\n\nUnited States, please monitor products issued by your national meteorological service.\n\nDISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK ----------------------\n\nAt 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Alberto was located near latitude 22.2 North, longitude 95.1 West. Alberto is\n\nmoving toward the west near 9 mph (15 km/h). A westward motion with an increase in forward speed is expected through Thursday. On the\n\nforecast track, the center of Alberto will reach the coast of northeastern Mexico early Thursday morning.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. Some slight strengthening is forecast today or tonight before\n\nthe center of Alberto reaches land. Rapid weakening is expected once the center moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate\n\nover Mexico Thursday or Thursday night. Alberto is a large tropical storm, with tropical-storm-force winds\n\nextending outward up to 415 miles (665 km) north of the center. The estimated minimum central pressure is 995 mb (29.39 inches).\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND ----------------------\n\nKey messages for Alberto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC.\n\nRAINFALL: Tropical Storm Alberto is expected to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico into South Texas.\n\nMaximum totals around 20 inches are possible across the higher terrain of the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and\n\nTamaulipas. This rainfall will likely produce considerable flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed river flooding. Mudslides\n\nare also possible in areas of higher terrain across northeast Mexico.\n\nFor a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding associated with Alberto, please see the National Weather Service\n\nStorm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk\n\ngraphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and\n\nthe tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water could\n\nreach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nSargent, TX to Sabine Pass, TX...2-4 ft Galveston Bay...2-4 ft\n\nMouth of the Rio Grande, TX to Sargent, TX...1-3 ft Sabine Pass, TX to Vermilion/Cameron Parish Line, LA...1-3 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be\n\naccompanied by large and dangerous waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,\n\nand can vary greatly over short distances. For information specific to your area, please see products issued by your local\n\nNational Weather Service forecast office. For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,\n\nplease see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.\n\nStorm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate coast of northeastern\n\nMexico in areas of onshore winds north of where the center makes landfall. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large\n\nand destructive waves. WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning\n\narea today through early Thursday. TORNADOES: A couple of tornadoes are possible today and tonight\n\nacross parts of Deep South Texas and Southeast Texas. SURF: Swells generated by Alberto will affect the coast of Texas\n\nand northeastern Mexico through Friday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\n\nPlease consult products from your local weather office.

By mid-morning, the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression as it traveled about 18 mph and packed 35-mph winds through central Mexico.\n\nDespite being downgraded, the National Hurrican Center warned Alberto still poses a threat to the region, due to heavy rain that can cause flooding and mudslides.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday issued a severe weather disaster declaration for 51 counties in anticipation of the heavy rainfall, coastal flooding and tropical force winds the storm was likely to produce.\n\n\"I urge Texans in at risk-areas to remain weather aware and heed the guidance of state and local officials to keep themselves and their families safe,\" Abbott said Wednesday.\n\nThe National Weather Service on Thursday reported winds above 50 mph in the Galveston Bay area and and rainfall totals of about 2 to 7 inches across the coastal bend.\n\nAccuWeather predicted rainfall totals of about 8 to 12 inches for the Big Bend area of Texas, and winds could reach speeds of up to 60 mph.\n\nStorm surge along the coast of northeastern Mexico, Texas and western Louisiana peaked at 1 to 3 feet, according to AccuWeather, but the Houston and Galveston areas could see up to 6 feet in some low-lying areas until conditions ease into Friday.\n\nFootage from CNN on Thursday morning showed the coastal town of Surfside Beach in Texas besieged by high waves crashing over a seawall and flooding residential areas.\n\nSurfside Mayor Gregg Bisso said the cleanup effort is on hold after the high water levels made it unsafe, but recovery will resume once the water has subsided enough.\n\nThe city also limited access to Follet's Island's west end where about 100 homes were left without power in the wake of the storm. Only residents, contractors and people with rental agreements can access that side of the island.\n\nAccess to the beach is also prohibited.\n\n\"We haven't even been able to get down on the beach yet to take a look at it, to see what it's what it looks like, see how much damage we've had to our dunes and things like that,\" Bisso said. \"As we get down there, we'll be able to assess the situation a lot better.\"\n\nIn San Antonio, CPS Energy said about 1,400 of its 938,000 customers were left without power on Thursday morning.\n\nThe White House on Thursday said President Joe Biden was briefed on Alberto, as well as on wildfires in the southwest United States and extreme heat across the rest of the country.\n\nIn Mexico, meanwhile, there were four confirmed deaths related to Alberto as of Thursday.\n\nOfficials in the northeastern state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n said a man died early Thursday morning when he was trying to repair a window on his home.\n\nSevere weather conditions caused by Alberto also claimed the lives of three minors on Wednesday. One 16-year-old boy drowned in Monterrey when he entered the La Silla River to try to retrieve a ball.\n\nThe other two minors were killed by electrocution from a light pole while riding their bikes in Pino Su\u00e1rez.\n\nResidents in northeastern Mexico, however, see Alberto as also bringing much needed rain to the region, which for over a year has suffered from severe drought.\n\nErick Te\u00f3dulo Cavazos Cavazos, director of Civil Protection of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, told local media on Thursday that rains from Alberto are resupplying dams such as La Boca and El Cuchillo.\n\n\"We have to wait for the figures from El Cuchillo, but everything that comes from the Santa Catarina River and the La Silla River goes to El Cuchillo,\" he said. \"We also had a dam that was in a water crisis in the entire Linares region, in the municipality of Cerro Prieto, water is entering.\"\n\nAccuWeather also is keeping an eye on a possible second tropical storm system that could form this weekend and once again hammer notheastern Mexico and southern Texas.\n\n\"There is a moderate chance for development from June 21-23 across a similar area in the Gulf of Mexico,\" said AccuWeather Meteorologist Andrew Kienzle. \"This feature will need to be watched for possible impacts on the Gulf coasts of the United States and Mexico this weekend into early next week.\"", "source": {"uri":

It brings torrential rains, coastal flooding, and strong winds across northeastern Mexico and southern Texas. The storm is predicted to dissipate by Thursday, with possible intensification into a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto, the first named storm of 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the western Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said on Wednesday, bringing coastal flooding across the southern U.S. coast. The \"very large\" storm was located about 180 miles (290 km) east of Tampico, Mexico, packing maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph), the Miami-based forecaster said.\n\nAlberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico as early as Thursday night, after bringing torrential rainfall, coastal flooding and strong winds from the center along north-eastern Mexico and the south Texas coast. The NHC warned of likely \"life-threatening flooding and mudslides\" across north-eastern Mexico, including Monterrey, Mexico's third-biggest city in Nuevo Leon state.\n\n\"We don't rule out that Tropical Storm Alberto could intensify to a Category 1 hurricane\", Alejandra Mendez, who heads Mexico's SMN national meteorological service, told a news conference, citing water temperatures above 31\u00b0C (88\u00b0F). Hurricanes have sustained wind speeds of at least 119 kph.\n\nMendez added the storm was interacting with formations in the Pacific, which will together bring rains over large parts of Central America, a region that is still facing strong rainfall that left some 11 people dead in El Salvador over the weekend, due to landslides and road accidents. The storm has gathered up humidity from both the Gulf and the Pacific Ocean, Mendez said, and should bring much-needed rain over swathes of Mexico, which has suffered from an extended drought that has drained the country's dams.\n\nSome dams, especially in the north-eastern Tamaulipas state, are as little as 8% full. Nuevo Leon state Governor Samuel Garcia said people should avoid leaving the house when it is raining and workers were ready to address possible impacts on the electricity grid, water and sewage systems.\n\nIn the United States as far as Louisiana, videos showed flooded coastal towns and water smashing into sea walls, while in Tamaulipas, videos shared on social media showed ominous gray skies as forecasters warned Alberto could bring waves as high as 20 feet (6 meters). Across the Gulf on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, local news outlets filmed strong winds and heavy rainfall, after authorities recorded as much as 192 millimeters in the last day.\n\nThe NHC predicted \"moderate coastal flooding\" along much of the Texan coast through Thursday, while Mexican forecasters expect further weekend rains in the south from another formation over the Caribbean. Forecasters have warned that this year's Atlantic hurricane season will likely be highly active due to impacts from the La Nina weather pattern and warmer ocean waters.\n\n(This story has not been

It could become a tropical depression over the weekend, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe next named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season will be Beryl.\n\nSpecial note on the NHC cone: The forecast track shows the most likely path of the center of the storm. It does not illustrate the full width of the storm or its impacts, and the center of the storm is likely to travel outside the cone up to 33% of the time.\n\nSpecial note about spaghetti models: Illustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal. The hurricane center uses only the top four or five highest performing models to help make its forecasts.\n\nWhat is out there and how likely are they to strengthen?\n\nInvest 92L: A small area of low pressure located about 150 miles east of the northernmost Bahamas continues to produce disorganized showers and thunderstorms.\n\nWhile environmental conditions are only marginally conducive due to nearby dry air, further development of this system could lead to the development of a tropical depression while the low moves west-northwest at 10 to 15 mph and approaches the northeastern coast of Florida or the Georgia coast early on Friday.\n\nAn Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft is scheduled to investigate this system this afternoon, if necessary.\n\nSouthwestern Gulf of Mexico: A broad area of low pressure is forecast to form over southeastern Mexico and northern Central America on Friday.\n\nEnvironmental conditions appear conducive for gradual development after this system moves over the Bay of Campeche on Saturday, and a tropical depression could form over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico thisweekend while it moves slowly west-northwest or northwest.\n\nWho is likely to be impacted?\n\nInvest 92L: \"Regardless of development, this feature can bring high seas, gusty winds and areas of heavy rain and thunderstorms to the Southeast coast,\" said Kienzle.\n\nFrom late Thursday to Saturday, 1-2 inches of rain can generally fall along the Southeast coastal regions, particularly across southeastern Georgia.\n\nSouthwestern Gulf of Mexico: This system could become a tropical depression over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico over the weekend as it moves slowly west-northwest or northwest, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\"There is a moderate chance for development from June 21-23 across a similar area in the Gulf of Mexico,\" according to AccuWeather.\n\n\"This feature will need to be watched for possible impacts on the Gulf coasts of the United States and Mexico this weekend into early next week,\" Kienzle said.\n\nForecasters urge all residents to continue monitoring the tropics and to always be prepared. That advice is particularly important for what is expected to be a very active hurricane season.\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30.\n\nWhen is the peak of hurricane season?\n\nThe peak of the season is Sept. 10, with the most activity happening between mid-August and mid-October, according to the Hurricane Center.\n\nNational Hurricane Center map: What are forecasters watching now?\n\nSystems currently being monitored by the National Hurricane Center include:\n\nInteractive map: Hurricanes, tropical storms that have passed near your city\n\nWe will continue to update our tropical weather coverage daily.

(WCSC) - Tropical Storm Alberto has formed in the Gulf of Mexico, becoming the first named storm of this year's Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nWATCH OUR HURRICANE SPECIAL: 'Ahead of the storm': Hurricane Season 2024\n\nAt 11 a.m., Alberto was located about 295 miles south-southeast of Brownsville, Texas; and about 185 miles east of Tamplico, Mexico. It has maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, and was moving to the west at 9 mph.\n\nOn the forecast track, the center of Alberto will reach the coast of northeastern Mexico early Thursday morning.\n\nA Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for the Texas coast from San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande; and the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Puerto de Altamira.\n\nIt was expected to bring heavy rains, coastal flooding and gusty winds to the coasts of Texas and Northeastern Mexico through Thursday.\n\nA Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area.\n\nThe entire South Carolina coast is under a high risk of rip currents through Wednesday night. The risk extends from Georgia through South Carolina and into Coastal Pinder and Coastal New Hanover Counties in North Carolina from 8 a.m. into the evening.\n\nClick here to download the free Live 5 First Alert Weather app.\n\nLive 5 First Alert Meteorologist Joey Sovine says Wednesday should be considered a \"no-swim day\" because of the heightened risk of rip currents.\n\nRip currents can pose a life-threatening risk by sweeping even the best swimmers away from shore and into deeper water.\n\nIf you must go into the water, swim near a lifeguard. If you are caught in a rip current, relax and float: Do not swim against the current. If you are able, swim in a direction following the shoreline. If you are unable to escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.\n\nBut because some beaches do not have lifeguards and because of the higher risk, lifeguards on duty could potentially be working to help someone else.\n\nAn area closer to the Lowcountry, however, has a lower chance of tropical development. A group of thunderstorms located several hundred miles east of the Bahamas is associated with a surface trough of low pressure.\n\nIts chances of development into a tropical depression over the next seven days remain at just 20% as it slowly moves toward the southeastern United States.\n\nLive 5 First Alert Meteorologist Joey Sovine says the chance of showers by the end of the week could increase as the system moves closer to the coast, even if it does not take on tropical characteristics.\n\nHurricane season began on June 1 and continues through Nov. 30.\n\nLast month, the National Hurricane Center released what it called the most active pre-season forecast in the agency's history, which calls for a \"hyperactive\" season.\n\nThe official forecast calls for between 17 and 25 named storms, with between eight and 13 reaching hurricane status. Of those, between four and seven are expected to become major hurricanes, meaning they reach Category 3 strength or greater.", "source": {"uri": "live5news.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The system identified early Tuesday as \"potential tropical cyclone one\" is growing in the Gulf, and right now it is set to make landfall on the western Gulf of Mexico coast. While that forms, there is another system to our east that is being watched by the National Hurricane Center. For now, there's nothing to worry about. But forecasters have predicted an extremely active hurricane season, and just a few weeks into the season, it's already shaping up to be busy.\n\nThis is the early Tuesday morning advisory from the National Hurricane Center:\n\nBULLETIN Potential Tropical Cyclone One Advisory Number 3 NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL AL012024 400 AM CDT Tue Jun 18 2024\n\n... TROPICAL STORM WARNING ISSUED FOR A PORTION OF THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO COAST...\n\nSUMMARY OF 400 AM CDT...0900 UTC... INFORMATION -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - LOCATION...21.3N 93.0W ABOUT 350 MI...565 KM ESE OF LA PESCA MEXICO ABOUT 420 MI...680 KM SE OF BROWNSVILLE TEXAS MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H PRESENT MOVEMENT... N OR 360 DEGREES AT 6 MPH...9 KM/H MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES\n\nWATCHES AND WARNINGS -- -- -- -- -- -- - CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:\n\nThe Tropical Storm Watch for the Texas coast from Port O'Connor southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande has been changed to a Tropical Storm Warning.\n\nA Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.\n\nA Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.\n\nFor storm information specific to your area in the United States, including possible inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office. For storm information specific to your area outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by your national meteorological service.\n\nDISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the disturbance was centered near latitude 21.3 North, longitude 93.0 West. The system is moving toward the north near 6 mph (9 km/h). A gradual turn toward the west-northwest and west is expected is expected tonight and Wednesday, and the system is likely to approach the western Gulf coast late Wednesday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds remain near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. Some increase in strength is likely during the next 36 hours, and the disturbance is forecast to become a tropical storm by Wednesday.\n\nThe disturbance is quite large with tropical-storm-force winds extending outward up to 290 miles (465 km) to the northeast of the center.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone One can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC.\n\nRAINFALL: Potential Tropical Cyclone One is expected to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico into South Texas, with maximum totals of 15 inches possible. This rainfall will likely produce flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed river flooding. Mudslides are also possible in areas of higher terrain across northeast Mexico.\n\nFor a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding associated with Potential Tropical Cyclone One, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml? rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml? ero\n\nSTORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nSargent, TX to Sabine Pass, TX...2-4 ft Galveston Bay...2-4 ft Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to Sargent, TX...1-3 ft Sabine Pass, TX to Vermilion/Cameron Parish Line, LA...1-3 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances. For information specific to your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office.\n\nFor a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml? peakSurge.\n\nIn Mexico, minor coastal flooding is possible north of where the center of the system crosses the coast in areas of onshore winds.\n\nWIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning area by Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "bocanewsnow.com", "dataType": "news",

Emiliano Rodr\u00edguez Mega reported from Mexico City.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto, the first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, brought intense rain and coastal flooding to parts of Texas and northeastern Mexico on Wednesday, hours before it was expected to make landfall.\n\nOfficials in Mexico were monitoring the levels of dams, rivers and streams and were also cleaning drainage points to prevent potential flooding.\n\nIn Texas, officials warned of flooded roads in the Houston area early Wednesday afternoon. The tide was rushing beneath the elevated houses in some coastal cities, such as Surfside Beach, about 40 miles south of Galveston, by Wednesday morning. The city closed its beach earlier this week and warned visitors to stay away as the flooding worsened.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center warned that Alberto was a large storm, with tropical-force winds extending about 415 miles north of its center in the Gulf of Mexico as it moved west toward northeastern Mexico.

Alberto currently has sustained winds of 40 mph and a central pressure of 995 millibars.\n\nAlberto is moving westward at 9 mph and is expected to continue this path, reaching northeastern Mexico by Thursday morning. The storm may strengthen slightly, with a peak intensity of around 45 mph before landfall. Rapid weakening is forecast after landfall, with the storm likely dissipating over Mexico's mountainous terrain by Friday.\n\nRegardless of its exact track, Alberto is expected to bring heavy rainfall, moderate coastal flooding, and tropical-storm-force winds to areas far from its center. Tropical storm conditions are expected today along portions of the Texas coast south of San Luis Pass and along parts of northeastern Mexico within the Tropical Storm Warning area.\n\nHeavy rainfall is anticipated to affect large regions of Central America, northeastern Mexico, and South Texas. For Louisiana and Mississippi, isolated to scattered heavy downpours are possible as Alberto's outer bands move across the region. Any storms that develop are expected to be brief.\n\nA Wind Advisory is in effect for southeast Louisiana, including areas south of the I-12 corridor, near area tidal lakes and along the coast.\n\nExpect strong east winds of 20 to 25 mph, with gusts up to 40 mph possible, from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Wednesday. The National Weather Service recommends securing any loose items and reminds residents to be cautious when travelling, especially in high profile vehicles.\n\nModerate coastal flooding is likely along much of the coasts of Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and Mexico through Thursday.

The alerts no longer include Houston, since the heaviest rains should stay primarily south of the metro.\n\nA tropical storm warning does, however, cover coastal counties from just south of Galveston to the U.S.-Mexico border, and incudes Rockport, Corpus Christi and Brownsville. While the system may not organize enough to earn the name Alberto, tropical storm-force winds with 50-mph gusts are still probable along the shoreline.\n\nRockport was gusting to 36 mph around 7 a.m. Central time, and Padre Island to 39 mph. Rainfall totals have been light thus far, with Brownsville leading the pack at 0.95 inches. That said, the core of the deep tropical moisture, and subsequent downpours, will soon arrive.\n\nAs of 7 a.m. Central time, Potential Tropical Cyclone 1 -- the designation used by the National Hurricane Center to describe a system that is bringing tropical storm effects without having the requisite structure for a name -- was centered just under 300 miles southeast of Brownsville. It was moving west-northwest at 8 mph.\n\nThe system may not become a tropical storm. Instead, a broad swirl of disturbed weather, including showers and thunderstorms, is present across the southwestern Gulf of Mexico, the western Caribbean Sea and Central America. Initially it was believed that some of the more diffuse circulation would tighten up in the Bay of Campeche and become a tropical storm that would hit Mexico.\n\nSatellite and aircraft observations do indicate that the broader low-pressure system is in the process of developing a more well-defined center of circulation. Shower and thunderstorm activity hasn't filled in around that nascent center, however.\n\nScattered downpours were pivoting ashore in South Texas, and will become more numerous and intense as the day wears on. The heaviest rains will last from noon to midnight in southern regions, and probably won't make it much north of San Antonio or Victoria.\n\nA widespread 4 to 8 inches is likely in South Texas, with localized totals over 10 inches possible. Downpours will taper to intermittent showers by early Thursday.\n\nA near record-moist air mass will be in place, allowing for intense rainfall rates. A weather balloon launched Wednesday morning from Brownsville recorded 2.78 inches of moisture present from the bottom to the top of the atmosphere. That's just shy of the 2.93-inch record set on July 17, 1996.\n\nSome of the storm's most serious flooding is probable in northeast Mexico and Central America.\n\n\"Life-threatening flooding and mudslides are likely in and near areas of higher terrain across the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas, including the cities of Monterrey and Ciudad Victoria,\" the Hurricane Center wrote.\n\nHowever, some of the rainfall in Mexico will be quite beneficial, as the area has been enduring serious drought.\n\nRains from a large, swirling area of showers and thunderstorms across the southwest Gulf of Mexico and Central America, known as the Central American Gyre, have produced disastrous flooding in parts Guatemala and El Salvador, causing at least 14 fatalities, according to the Associated Press. This same gyre spawned the potential tropical storm heading into Mexico and could give rise another in the Gulf of Mexico next week.\n\nIt's still looking like 40- to 50-mph gusts will be possible along the immediate coastline from Houston-Galveston southward, with lesser but still blustery winds expected inland.\n\nThe onshore flow will push water against the coast, leading to a surge of up to 2 to 4 feet in the most prone areas and 1 to 3 feet elsewhere. Because of the system's sprawling circulation, the surge was forecast to affect areas hundreds of miles from its center, as far away as the western shore of Louisiana.\n\nWith landfalling tropical cyclones and disturbances, sporadic tornadoes sometimes occur ahead, and to the right, of the center. Since South Texas will be in the \"front right quadrant\" of the system, a subtle change of low-level winds with height, known as wind shear, could support an isolated tornado risk.\n\nThe National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center has advertised a Level 1 out of 5 Marginal risk for severe weather.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"},

Meanwhile, the season's first named storm, Tropical Storm Alberto, was drenching Mexico and Texas as it moved inland.\n\nThe Atlantic system as of the NHC's 8 a.m. tropical outlook remains a small area of low pressure located about 150 miles east of the northernmost Bahamas with disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity.\n\n\"While environmental conditions are only marginally conducive due to nearby dry air, further development of this system could lead to the development of a tropical depression while the low moves west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph and approaches the northeastern coast of Florida or the Georgia coastearly on Friday,\" said NHC Warning Coordination Meteorologist Robbie Berg.\n\nAn Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft is slated to fly out to the system in the afternoon.\n\nThe NHC gives it a 40% chance of development in the next two to seven days.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a high surf advisory that runs into Friday with breaking waves of 5 to 7 feet in the surf zone with a high rip current risk along coastal Central and Northeast Florida beaches.\n\n\"Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water,\" warned the NWS.\n\nErosion will be greatest at high tide around 7 p.m. and 7 a.m., the NWS stated. Volusia County beaches are still recovering from major washout that occurred during both Hurricane Ian and Hurricane Nicole in 2022.\n\nThe NWS also has a small craft advisory in place from Jupiter Inlet north to the Altamaha Sound, Georgia that runs through late Friday for northeast Florida and through Friday morning for Central Florida.\n\nWaves of 7 to 10 feet are expected offshore with 25-30 mph winds and gusts up to 35 mph farther north along Florida's coast.\n\nRain chances are highest in Brevard and Volusia counties in Central Florida as the low approaches with some thunderstorm activity, the NWS stated.\n\nAs far as Tropical Storm Alberto goes, the system gained some wind speed as it dumped rainfall over Mexico and Texas.\n\nIn its 8 a.m. advisory, the center of Alberto was located inland about 25 miles west of Tampico, Mexico and 255 miles south of Brownsville, Texas with sustained winds of 45 mph moving west at 13 mph.\n\nA tropical storm warning remains in effect for the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande down to Tecolutla, but the system is expected to weaken as it moves further inland and dissipate by Thursday night.\n\nTropical-storm-force winds extend out 250 miles from the center and rainfall of 5 to 10 inches is expected with some areas in higher terrain of inland Mexico getting up to 20 inches, although rain in Texas is dropping off quickly with only another 1 inch expected in some southern parts of the state.\n\nThe NHC still warns that there could be some tornado activity across the most southern portions of Texas on Thursday.\n\nThe NHC is also tracking a broad area of low pressure that is forecast to form over southeastern Mexico and northern Central America on Friday.\n\n\"Environmental conditions appear conducive for gradual development after this system moves over the Bay of Campeche on Saturday, and a tropicaldepression could form over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico this weekend while it moves slowly west-northwestward or northwestward,\" forecasters said.\n\nThe NHC gives it a 20% chance of formation over the next two days and 50% in the next seven.\n\nAfter Alberto, the next named system for the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season would be Beryl.", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "m.arcamax.com"}, "authors":

It had top sustained winds of 40 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. A tropical storm is defined by sustained winds of between 39 and 73 mph, and above that the system becomes a hurricane.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nIowa DCI: Wall Lake trucker David Schultz's death 'not a homicide' Jefferson, S.D. dad shares secret to fatherhood on Father's Day celebration Lost and found: How Arnolds Park got a miniature train back after more than 50 years Perley to step down as Thompson CEO; Beaulieu to take over Man dies in standoff with authorities in Sac County Former Sioux City hotel under renovation, to become high-rise senior housing this year Omaha ballpark seeks to ban two Texas A&M fans who were kicked out of College World Series game Tyson Foods heir suspended as CFO after second alcohol-related arrest Boat speed rule imposed on Okoboji lakes in wake of heavy rains, storms that also led to wastewater discharges Sioux City man pleads not guilty of manslaughter Our Opinion: WITCC settlement in human trafficking case raises more questions Marriage licenses for Woodbury County for June 17, 2024 Chainsaw sculptures among latest upgrades to Sioux City's historic Hubbard Park Top area softball performers: RSM last unbeaten team; Mentzer, Moreau swinging hot bats Man pleads not guilty in Sioux City fatal hit and run\n\nBrennan said that winds could get up to 45 mph to 50 mph before the storm makes landfall. As much as 5-10 inches of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, Brennan said. He said some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday, the NWS said, there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nNOAA predicts the hurricane season that began June 1 and runs through Nov. 30 is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.\n\nBrennan said the first named system in the Atlantic on average comes on June 20, so Alberto is \"about right on schedule.\"\n\nA no-name storm earlier in June dumped more than 20 inches of rain on parts of south Florida, stranding motorists on flooded streets and pushing water into some homes in low-lying areas.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe

As a result, Tropical Storm Warnings were issued for the Texas coast on Tuesday morning.\n\nWinds over 40 mph are already blowing across the Gulf of Mexico. If the system in the southern Gulf can develop a well-defined center, the low-pressure area will be named Tropical Storm Alberto, but it has a lot of consolidating to do. Currently, the center of the giant circulation is just a broad area with light winds. It's hard to even tell where the center is.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center has designated this system Potential Tropical Cyclone One, for now. The word \"cyclone\" is confusing every time this naming convention comes around. Substitute the word \"threat,\" and it's clear - the system is a potential tropical threat.\n\nThis low is the same super-broad area of low pressure that straddled Central America for days. Now, it has eased north into the Gulf. Normally, it takes quite a while for big lumbering systems to tighten up a smaller circulation. In this case, however, there is an embedded swirl that might take over and hasten the process. The swirl is what's left of a weak disturbance that moved across the Caribbean.\n\nThis situation is an extreme case of the cone being almost wholly disassociated from the worst weather. Whether this system consolidates or not, the impact zone will extend hundreds of miles north of the cone across northern Mexico and Texas. Even Louisiana may feel the effects.\n\nThe strong winds across the northern and central Gulf are caused by the air being squeezed between the low pressure of potential Alberto and the heat-dome high-pressure system over the Northeast US. The blocking effect of the high will also deflect the center of potential Alberto toward the Mexican coast and limit how far north it can get. The high heat risk in the Midwest and Northeast shows the effects of the heat-dome high there.\n\nWaves of tropical rain will begin Tuesday on the Texas coast. As we saw in South Florida just over a week ago, the flooding doesn't start right away. Then all of a sudden, blam! Stay aware in all of coastal Texas including metro Houston. South Texas has an \"advantage\" because it's been in drought. There is more room for the water to soak in, but flash flooding is still possible.\n\nStorm surge is likely at the coast. The strong and persistent onshore winds are pushing Gulf water against the shoreline. The forecast is for the surge to reach up to 4 feet above normal high tide level in some areas, especially in bays and harbors open to the Gulf. Coastal and marine interests should stay informed and take action.\n\nImpacts from potential Alberto are forecast to peak Wednesday into Thursday, and let up by Thursday evening.\n\nUnfortunately, there is increasing computer-forecast consensus that some version of this scenario will repeat itself over the weekend. By then, the heat-dome high will have changed configuration into the Atlantic, so the steering pattern could be different.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center has introduced a potential development area in the southern Gulf. The chances of development are in the low category for now, but it's early in the process, and there is always a lot of uncertainty.\n\nDon't look at any particular computer forecast at this point. There is no system to follow yet, and there may never be. But everyone in coastal Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi should plan to stay in touch with the forecasts later in the week.\n\nWe're calling this possible Gulf system Potential Disturbance #3.\n\nIn the Atlantic, a low-pressure area is still trying to develop from the old front that was part of the Florida deluge - Disturbance #2. There is no indication it could get very strong, and it might not even be tropical. But the steering flow around the heat-dome high-pressure system to the north should eventually push it toward Florida or the Southeast coast.\n\nWhatever form it takes, it's forecast to arrive at the coast about Friday. The National Hurricane Center gives it a low chance of developing into any kind of system with tropical characteristics.\n\nWhen extreme and unusual weather systems like the heat-dome high develop, quite often unusual things happen around the periphery. So we'll watch closely the developments in the Gulf of Mexico.", "source": {"uri": "foxweather.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Weather"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bryan_norcross@foxweather.com",

In the Gulf of Mexico, the transfer typically is from an Aframax or Suezmax onto a very large crude carrier (VLCC) at designated lightering zones near Corpus Christi, Galveston and Beaumont-Port Arthur.\n\nProlonged lightering delays can prevent crude tanker tonnage from becoming available and exert upward pressure on freight rates, while also adding to demurrage fees.\n\nThe storm is expected to turn towards the west-northwest and west tonight and Wednesday, with the system forecast to approach the western Gulf coast late Wednesday, the NHC said.\n\nRainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches are seen across northeast Mexico into South Texas, with maximum totals of 15 inches possible. Flash and urban flooding are likely to follow with river flooding.", "source": {"uri": "argusmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Argus Media"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone warnings and watches"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_O'Connor,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Port O'Connor, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Port O'Connor, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_flooding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coastal flooding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lightering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_tanker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oil tanker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maximum sustained wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_flooding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Urban flooding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aframax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aframax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gulf Coast of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanker_(ship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tanker (ship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suezmax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suezmax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonnage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tonnage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_Christi,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corpus Christi, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Corpus Christi, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Tobacco/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Tobacco/Accessories", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659946", "eventUri": "eng-9659946", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"The heavy rainfall and the water, as usual, is the biggest story in tropical storms,\" said Michael Brennan, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Hurricane Center.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said late Wednesday that Alberto was located about 135 miles (220 kilometers) east of Tampico, Mexico, and about 320 miles (510 kilometers) south-southeast of Brownsville, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph). The storm was moving west at 9 miles per hour.\n\nThe center of the storm was expected to reach the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande by Thursday morning.\n\nAs much as 5 inches (13 centimeters) to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, Brennan said. He said some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nThe municipal government of Tampico, a port city in Tamaulipas state, announced Wednesday afternoon that authorities had activated a command center in coordination with the water, electricity and oil companies.\n\nMany residents were excited about the prospect of heavy showers, as Tamaulipas and most of Mexico has been dealing with extreme droughts.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"We have been needing this water that we're now getting, thank God. Let's hope that we only get water,\" said Blanca Coronel Moral, a resident of Tampico. \"Our lagoon, which gives us drinking water, is completely dry.\"\n\nTamaulipas Gov. Am\u00e9rico Villarreal said Wednesday on X that schools across the state will remain closed between Wednesday and Friday.\n\nThe coordinator of civil protection in Tamaulipas, Luis Gerardo Gonzalez, said they have 333 shelters distributed throughout the state at each municipality. \"As the storm moves, we will be opening up more shelters.\"\n\nAuthorities urged residents to be aware of the alerts the state and municipal civil protections are sharing. They anticipate the storm arriving overnight with communities closest to the coast most affected.\n\nTropical storm warnings were in effect from the Texas coast at San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande and from the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Rapid weakening is expected once the center moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico\" on Thursday, the center said.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. On Wednesday, the NWS said, there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nNOAA predicts the hurricane season that began June 1 and runs through Nov. 30 is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.\n\nBrennan said there will be dangerous rip currents from the storm and drivers should watch out for road closures and turn around if they see water covering roadways.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAreas along the Texas coast were seeing some road flooding and dangerous rip currents Wednesday, and waterspouts have been spotted offshore. \"We've seen a few brief spin-ups and some waterspouts out there,\" said Tyler Castillo, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Corpus Christi.\n\nTim Cady, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Houston, said they'll be keeping an eye on coastal flooding as high tide approaches Thursday morning.\n\n\"When we have these strong onshore winds combined with the high tide, that can result in coastal inundation, particularly in our lower-lying coastal areas,\" Cady said.\n\nA no-name storm earlier in June dumped more than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain on parts of South Florida, stranding numerous motorists on flooded streets and pushing water into some homes in low-lying areas.\n\n\"People underestimate the power of water and they sometimes don't always take rainfall and the threats that come with it seriously, especially if you are driving in an area and you see water covering the road, you don't want to drive into it,\" Brennan said.\n\n___ AP

SUMMARY OF 700 AM CDT...1200 UTC...INFORMATION\n\n---------------------------------------------- LOCATION...22.3N 98.3W\n\nABOUT 25 MI...45 KM W OF TAMPICO Mexico ABOUT 255 MI...410 KM S OF BROWNSVILLE TEXAS\n\nMAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 275 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H\n\nMINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...997 MB...29.44 INCHES WATCHES AND WARNINGS\n\nA Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for... * the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande to Tecolutla.\n\nA Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case through\n\nthis morning. For storm information specific to your area, please monitor\n\nproducts issued by your national meteorological service. DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK\n\n---------------------- At 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Alberto was\n\nlocated near latitude 22.3 North, longitude 98.3 West. Alberto is moving toward the west near 13 mph (20 km/h). This motion is\n\nexpected to continue through today, as Alberto moves further inland over Mexico.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. Weakening is anticipated as Alberto continues to move inland, and\n\nthe storm is likely to dissipate over Mexico later today or tonight. Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 250 miles (400 km)\n\nfrom the center. The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND ----------------------\n\nKey messages for Alberto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC.\n\nRAINFALL: Rainfall associated with Tropical Storm Alberto is expected to begin to diminish across southern Texas during the day,\n\nwith additional rainfall totals of 1 inch or less expected. Heavy rainfall will continue to impact northeast Mexico through this\n\nmorning, with rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches expected. Maximum rainfall totals around 20 inches are possible across the higher\n\nterrain of the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas. This rainfall will likely produce considerable flash\n\nand urban flooding along with new and renewed river flooding. Mudslides are also possible in areas of higher terrain across\n\nnortheast Mexico. For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding\n\nassociated with Alberto, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at\n\nhurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero\n\nSTORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded\n\nby rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated\n\nareas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide... Sargent, TX to Sabine Pass, TX...2-4 ft\n\nGalveston Bay...2-4 ft Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to Sargent, TX...1-3 ft\n\nSabine Pass, TX to Vermilion/Cameron Parish Line, LA...1-3 ft The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to\n\nthe north of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous waves. Surge-related flooding\n\ndepends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances. For information\n\nspecific to your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office.\n\nFor a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,\n\navailable at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge. Storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above\n\nnormal tide levels along the immediate coast of northeastern Mexico in areas of onshore winds north of where the center makes\n\nlandfall. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.\n\nWIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning area through this morning.\n\nTORNADOES: A tornado or two could occur this morning across parts of Deep South Texas.\n\nSURF: Swells generated by Alberto will affect the coast of Texas and northeastern Mexico through Friday. These swells are\n\nlikely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com",

It could become a tropical depression over the weekend, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe next named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season will be Beryl.\n\nHere's the latest update from the NHC as of 8 a.m., June 20:\n\nSpecial note on the NHC cone: The forecast track shows the most likely path of the center of the storm. It does not illustrate the full width of the storm or its impacts, and the center of the storm is likely to travel outside the cone up to 33% of the time.\n\nSpecial note about spaghetti models: Illustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal. The hurricane center uses only the top four or five highest performing models to help make its forecasts.\n\nInvest 92L: A small area of low pressure located about 150 miles east of the northernmost Bahamas continues to produce disorganized showers and thunderstorms.\n\nWhile environmental conditions are only marginally conducive due to nearby dry air, further development of this system could lead to the development of a tropical depression while the low moves west-northwest at 10 to 15 mph and approaches the northeastern coast of Florida or the Georgia coast early on Friday.\n\nAn Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft is scheduled to investigate this system this afternoon, if necessary.\n\nSouthwestern Gulf of Mexico: A broad area of low pressure is forecast to form over southeastern Mexico and northern Central America on Friday.\n\nEnvironmental conditions appear conducive for gradual development after this system moves over the Bay of Campeche on Saturday, and a tropical depression could form over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico thisweekend while it moves slowly west-northwest or northwest.\n\nInvest 92L: \"Regardless of development, this feature can bring high seas, gusty winds and areas of heavy rain and thunderstorms to the Southeast coast,\" said Kienzle.\n\nFrom late Thursday to Saturday, 1-2 inches of rain can generally fall along the Southeast coastal regions, particularly across southeastern Georgia.\n\nSouthwestern Gulf of Mexico: This system could become a tropical depression over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico over the weekend as it moves slowly west-northwest or northwest, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\"There is a moderate chance for development from June 21-23 across a similar area in the Gulf of Mexico,\" according to AccuWeather.\n\n\"This feature will need to be watched for possible impacts on the Gulf coasts of the United States and Mexico this weekend into early next week,\" Kienzle said.\n\nForecasters urge all residents to continue monitoring the tropics and to always be prepared. That advice is particularly important for what is expected to be a very active hurricane season.\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30.\n\nThe peak of the season is Sept. 10, with the most activity happening between mid-August and mid-October, according to the Hurricane Center.\n\nSystems currently being monitored by the National Hurricane Center include:\n\nWe will continue to update our tropical weather coverage daily.

The storm is expected to bring nearly two feet of rain to the country's Gulf Coast. In Texas, coastal cities experienced a storm surge -- an abnormal rise of seawater -- of more than four feet.\n\nOne man died in the La Salle River in Monterrey -- located around three hours from the Texas border, Mexican authorities said, adding that two minors riding their bikes in the rain died from electric shocks in the municipality of Allende.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a flood watch for Corpus Christi and nearby cities in Texas, which will be in place until 1 p.m. local time. The National Hurricane Center also said the storm made landfall with maximum winds of 45 mph and should dissipate over Mexico by the end of the day.\n\nAlthough the worst is believed to be over for Texas, many areas are still dealing with flooding on their streets.\n\nOn Wednesday, Gov. Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration for 51 Texas counties, \"to ensure Texans and at-risk regions have the resources and personnel needed to respond to this storm,\" he said in a statement.\n\nSouthern parts of the United States have already experienced flooding this hurricane season. Southern Florida recently went through days of extreme rainfall and flooding -- with two people reportedly dying during the storms. According to the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, the Atlantic hurricane season is only just beginning.\n\n\"The upcoming Atlantic hurricane season is expected to have above-normal activity due to a confluence of factors,\" the administration said in a May 23 statement. \"NOAA is forecasting a range of 17 to 25 total named storms (winds of 39 mph or higher).

For storm information specific to your area\n\noutside of the United States, please monitor products issued by your national meteorological service.\n\nDISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK ----------------------\n\nAt 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the disturbance was centered near latitude 22.1 North, longitude 92.7 West. The system is moving toward the\n\nnorth near 6 mph (9 km/h). A turn toward the northwest and west with an increase in forward speed is expected tonight and on\n\nWednesday, and the system is forecast to reach the Gulf coast of Mexico by Wednesday night.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. Some increase in strength is possible during the next 36 hours,\n\nand the disturbance is forecast to become a tropical storm by Wednesday. * Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent. * Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.\n\nThe disturbance is quite large, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 415 miles (665 km) to the north of the center.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches). HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n\n---------------------- Key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone One can be found in the\n\nTropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC.\n\nRAINFALL: Potential Tropical Cyclone One is expected to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico into South\n\nTexas, with maximum totals of 15 inches possible. This rainfall will likely produce flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed\n\nriver flooding. Mudslides are also possible in areas of higher terrain across northeast Mexico.\n\nFor a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding associated with Potential Tropical Cyclone One, please see the\n\nNational Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk\n\ngraphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and\n\nthe tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water could\n\nreach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nSargent, TX to Sabine Pass, TX...2-4 ft Galveston Bay...2-4 ft\n\nMouth of the Rio Grande, TX to Sargent, TX...1-3 ft Sabine Pass, TX to Vermilion/Cameron Parish Line, LA...1-3 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be\n\naccompanied by large and dangerous waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,\n\nand can vary greatly over short distances. For information specific to your area, please see products issued by your local\n\nNational Weather Service forecast office. For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,\n\nplease see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.\n\nIn Mexico, minor coastal flooding is possible north of where the center of the system crosses the coast in areas of onshore\n\nwinds. WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning\n\narea by tonight or Wednesday. TORNADOES: A couple of tornadoes may occur Wednesday across parts\n\nof Deep South into southeast Texas. SURF: Swells generated by the disturbance will affect the coast of\n\nTexas and northeastern Mexico through early Thursday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current\n\nconditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

A turn toward the\n\nwest-northwest is expected Tuesday night or Wednesday, and system is likely to approach the western Gulf coast late Wednesday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. Some slow strengthening is possible, and the disturbance is\n\nforecast to become a tropical storm by Wednesday. * Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent. * Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent. The disturbance is quite large with tropical-storm-force winds\n\nextending outward up to 290 miles (465 km) to the northeast of the center.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches). HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n\n---------------------- Key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone One can be found in the\n\nTropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC.\n\nRAINFALL: Potential Tropical Cyclone One is expected to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico\n\ninto South Texas, with maximum totals of 15 inches possible. This rainfall will likely produce flash and urban flooding along with\n\nnew and renewed river flooding. Mudslides are also possible in areas of higher terrain across northeast Mexico.\n\nFor a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding associated with Potential Tropical Cyclone One, please see the\n\nNational Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk\n\ngraphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and\n\nthe tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water could\n\nreach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nSargent, TX to Sabine Pass, TX...2-4 ft Galveston Bay...2-4 ft\n\nMouth of the Rio Grande, TX to Sargent, TX...1-3 ft Sabine Pass, TX to Vermilion/Cameron Parish Line, LA...1-3 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be\n\naccompanied by large and dangerous waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,\n\nand can vary greatly over short distances. For information specific to your area, please see products issued by your local\n\nNational Weather Service forecast office. For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge\n\ninundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic, available at\n\nhurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge. In Mexico, minor coastal flooding is possible north of where the\n\ncenter of the disturbance crosses the coast in areas of onshore winds.\n\nWIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area by Wednesday.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Roadways in Grand Isle, Leeville, and Golden Meadow were overtopped when high tide came Wednesday morning.\n\nFlorissant Highway (Hwy. 46) in St. Bernard Parish, which leads to Shell Beach, was impassable at some points due to high water. The St. Bernard Parish Sheriff's Office was only allowing trucks to pass.\n\nSaltwater from the Gulf overtopped Hwy. 1 in spots between Grand Isle, Leeville, and Golden Meadow.\n\nLouisiana State Police were stationed along the highway monitoring conditions.\n\nVideo from the Bridge Side Marina showed water encroaching on a patio seating area.\n\nHwy. 1 was closed near the Grand Isle Marina, according to Weldon Danos, Executive Director of the Grand Isle Port Commission.\n\nThe Mandeville Police Department is asking to avoid the area of Lakeshore Drive.\n\nIMPORTANT LINKS\n\nAlberto is expected to make landfall in Mexico Wednesday night or early Thursday morning. The NHC says slight strengthening is likely before a rapid weakening once the center moves inland.\n\nAlberto is a large storm with winds extending 415 miles north of the center. Maximum sustained winds were 40 mph.\n\n\"The heavy rainfall and the water, as usual, is the biggest story in tropical storms,\" said NHC Director Michael Brennan.\n\nBrennan said that winds could get up to 45 mph (72 kph) to 50 mph (80 kph) before the storm makes landfall.\n\nTropical Storm Warnings are in effect for the Texas coast, from San Luis Pass south to the mouth of the Rio Grande and the northeastern coast of Mexico, south of the river to Tecoluta.\n\nAs much as 5 inches (13 centimeters) to 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain was expected in some areas along the Texas coast, with even higher isolated totals possible, Brennan said. He said some higher locations in Mexico could see as much as 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, which could result in mudslides and flash flooding, especially in the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.\n\nAlberto is the first named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts the hurricane season from June 1 to Nov. 30 is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. An average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.\n\nThis is the latest A-named storm that has formed to start a hurricane season since 2014.\n\nIf you are able to do so safely, submit your photos and videos to fox8live.com/pics.", "source": {"uri": "wafb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WAFB"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

(WBRC) - Dry and breezy on Juneteenth: We begin our Wednesday morning with overcast skies and temps in the 70s. The Juneteenth holiday is shaping up to be very nice. We will likely remain partly sunny to mostly cloudy with high temperatures climbing into the upper 80s and lower 90s. It looks to remain breezy today with easterly winds at 10-15 mph and gusting at times above that. The heat index will remain close to the actual air temperature.\n\nNext Big Thing: The big story for the end of the week is the heat. We will likely see decreasing clouds giving way to partly cloudy skies Thursday, Friday, and into Saturday. With more sunshine, temperatures should continue to heat up. We will likely see highs in the lower 90s on Thursday. We could see temperatures climb into the mid-90s Friday and into the weekend. Humidity may slowly increase, so the heat index could flirt near 100\u00b0F. It'll be a hot weekend, so you'll want to make sure you stay hydrated and take several breaks if you have to work outdoors. Rain chances will remain isolated Saturday and Sunday with the greatest coverage occurring south of I-20. Our chances of rain may increase early next week with scattered storms possible on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nTropical Update: The National Hurricane Center has designated the area of low pressure spinning away in the Bay of Campeche as \"Potential Tropical Cyclone One\" so they can issue forecasts, watches, and warnings. We will likely see this system impact Mexico Wednesday afternoon. It is expected to bring heavy rainfall and possible flooding for Mexico, southern Texas, and along the coastal areas of Texas. Rainfall totals of 5-10 inches will be possible over the next 48 hours. If this system establishes a closed low, it will likely become our first tropical storm of the season. The first name up on the 2024 Atlantic hurricane list is \"Alberto\".\n\nWe are also watching two areas that have a low chance of forming into a tropical depression or storm in the next five to seven days. One area we continue to watch is in the Atlantic. Odds are lowering (at 20%) for something to form. The system will remain small and could produce gusty winds and rain for parts of Florida, Georgia, and into the Carolinas over the weekend. I don't see this system impacting us at the moment.\n\nThe second area to watch is right where the Potential Tropical Cyclone One is located in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. Once this storm moves inland over Mexico, we could see another low develop over the weekend. It remains too far out to know if another tropical depression could form, but we will likely see more rain and possible flooding for parts Mexico, Central America, and perhaps for southern Texas. Hurricane season peaks in September and comes to an end on November 30th. None of these systems are forecast to impact us, but it will likely create rough surf along the Gulf Coast this week. Double red flags are flying along the Alabama Gulf Coast.

The National Hurricane Center is giving that an 80% chance of happening, but it might run out of time. In any case, naming the system won't make any difference to the impacts on the Gulf Coast. It's purely for the record book.\n\nThe strong winds to the north of the ostensible center of potential Alberto are caused by the air being squeezed between the tropical system's low pressure and the extra strong heat-dome high-pressure system over the northeast US. Those persistent gusty winds blowing east to west are already pushing the water toward the coast, causing minor to moderate storm-surge flooding at high tide.\n\nTides have been 2 to 4 feet above normal on the northern Gulf Coast, especially in Louisiana and Mississippi. But today, the focus will be on the Texas coast, where the strongest onshore winds will occur. High tide tomorrow morning will likely see additional flooding.\n\nWinds of 40 to 50 mph are likely on the southern half of the Texas coast, with gusty winds affecting the rest of Texas and across the northern Gulf.\n\nThere is a widespread risk of flash flooding from the southern counties of metro Houston to the Mexico border. Five to 10 inches of rain is forecast with up to 15 inches possible in some areas. South Texas is in a drought, so the land can absorb quite a bit of rain. If it doesn't all come at once, it will be a good thing - they are desperate for water. On the other hand, areas around Houston were drenched in May, which means it will flood with less rain.\n\nThe rain threat near the coast from potential Alberto should end Thursday morning. However, it will still be quite breezy throughout the day, keeping the tide levels somewhat higher than normal.\n\nNEXT IN THE GULF: Then, weirdly, we look to the same spot in the southern Gulf for the next potential tropical system. The consensus of the computer forecasts is that another low-pressure area will develop late Friday or early Saturday and move slowly over the same waters tread by potential Alberto. For now, we are calling this system Potential Tropical Disturbance #3.\n\nThis system will keep the onshore winds blowing along the Texas coast, though so far, it's forecast to be weaker than potential Alberto.\n\nA key rule applies here, however. Forecasts for systems that have not yet developed or are just developing are always subject to significant changes.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center has the chance of this system developing into at least a tropical depression in the low category for now. But the atmospheric pattern is forecast to be conducive to strengthening, so let's keep an open mind.\n\nIN THE ATLANTIC: The system we've been watching in the Atlantic is related to an old front and an upper-level disturbance, Disturbance #2, does not look likely to develop. The various computer forecast models have mostly lost interest. Still, a weak area of low pressure is forecast to arrive at the Southeast coast as a briefly gusty moisture surge Thursday night or Friday. The National Hurricane Center still gives it a slight chance of developing tropical characteristics before that time.\n\nAs is typical in June, dry air and Saharan dust cover the tropical Atlantic and extend into the Caribbean, so no development is expected there.", "source": {"uri": "foxweather.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Weather"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bryan_norcross@foxweather.com",

The Texas coast south of Port O'Connor and portions of northeastern Mexico have been issued with a Tropical Storm Watch.\n\n\"Small creeks & streams may rise out of their banks, and low-lying areas, especially in urban areas, may easily flood. Turn around, don't drown!\" the NWS wrote on X.\n\nThe NWS has stated that more than 50 per cent of flood fatalities are vehicle-related, and has warned those likely to be impacted by the flash and river flooding threats not to risk driving in flood waters.\n\nTropical Storm Warnings have been issued for many Texas areas such as coastal Jackson, Matagorda, Matagorda Bay, the Gulf Waters, and the Brazoria Counties, NWS Houston said, adding that Flood Watches and Coastal Flood Warnings are also in place along the coast.\n\nForecasters say that the lower and middle Texas coasts will be mostly impacted by the heavy rain and gale-force winds, along with a coastal front that has the potential to enhance the heavy rainfall inland from the coast.\n\nHow sharp the front will get, however, cannot yet be predicted, the NWS said.\n\nThe tropical cyclone will also most likely be helped along by the strong high-pressure system that is also currently sustaining the extreme heat wave across the Ohio Valley and the Northeast.\n\nThe high-pressure system will steer the cyclone westward towards northern Mexico on Wednesday, and the cyclone could acquire tropical storm status before making landfall early Thursday, the NWS detailed in their daily update.\n\nHeavy rain is also due to sweep west across southern Texas into the Rio Grand Valley over Wednesday night, with rainfalls of five to 10 inches possible from northeast Mexico to South Texas - with a maximum total of 15 inches possible.\n\nThe heaviest rainfall is forecast to move west of the Rio Grand Valley into northern Mexico before tapering off early Friday.\n\nThe Four Corners region, consisting of the southwestern states of Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico surrounding their connecting corners, will experience some of the tropical moisture from the storm, which will activate showers and thunderstorms on Thursday and Friday.\n\nMoisture from a 'tropical wave' could also reach northeastern Flordia and coastal Georgia by Thursday night to Friday morning, the NWS stated.\n\nWhile the tropical activity starts its journey into Texas, the ongoing heatwave will continue to impact areas of the Midwest, including locations in the Ohio Valley, Great Lakes, Northeast, and the Mid-Atlantic, over the next few days.\n\nDaily records and monthly records are expected to be challenged by the very high temperatures, with some heat readings likely to peak from 100 to 105F degrees in some areas.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Alberto is the first named storm of the season. It has maximum sustained wind speeds of 40 mph. It's moving west at 9 mph towards the eastern coast of Mexico. Tropical storm warnings are in effect for parts of the Texas coast and northeastern Mexico coast. No tropical headlines are expected for Louisiana.\n\nWednesday morning, PTC One upgraded to Tropical Storm Alberto when a well defined center of circulation was established. This is the first named storm of this season. It has maximum wind speeds of 40 mph and tropical storm winds extend very far away from the center.\n\nAs the system moves westwards, the pressure gradient will tighten over the Northern Gulf between its lower pressure and high pressure to the northeast. This will bring some breezy to gusty at times winds across the region.\n\nA Wind Advisory will be in effect. until 7 PM Wednesday for areas from Coastal Mississippi, the Southshore, and to Assumption Parish. In general, east/southeast winds will be around 10-15 mph with gusts near 20-30 mph around the Greater Baton Rouge area on Wednesday. Winds will be higher toward the coast and south of the Tidal Lakes with gusts around 35 mph possible.\n\nWith higher winds from the east, this brings a coastal flooding concern for east facing shorelines. A Coastal Flood Warning is in effect for areas near Lake Maurepas and Pontchartrain with a Coastal Flood Advisory in effect for the rest of the Louisiana coast.

This will come just days after Alberto took a similar trek through the region.\n\nThis system will be monitored for possible development into a tropical depression or storm. Computer model forecast guidance suggests that if this system does develop, it would be steered westward into eastern Mexico by upper-level high pressure over the southern U.S.\n\nThis new spoke of the Central American Gyre should be smaller in size than Alberto as it crosses the Gulf of Mexico. This should limit the amount of rainfall and storm surge along the Gulf Coast in comparison to Alberto. We'll talk about impacts in the next section.\n\nSimilar track, but very different impacts than Alberto: This next system will be steered westward across the Bay of Campeche by a heat dome over the Lower 48, but its presence may not be made as well known across the neighborhood this time.\n\nAlberto was a very large system, and that allowed it to dump heavy rainfall and spread storm surge from eastern Mexico to the Upper Texas Coast. Some areas in eastern Mexico saw more than 6 inches of rain, while Rockport, Texas, saw nearly 10 inches. Parts of the Texas coast saw up to four feet of storm surge, as well.\n\nIn Texas, rainfall will be more limited, but some areas across the Rio Grande Valley will pick up another inch or two.\n\nFarther south, an additional 5 to 10 inches of rain from Alberto's moisture and this new system is expected in eastern Mexico. This area has already received heavy rainfall, so this additional rainfall could cause flooding and mudslides in a more localized area.\n\nA weekend of choppy seas and enhanced rip current potential can be expected along the Texas Coast, but water levels shouldn't rise as much as they did in recent days.\n\nMORE ON WEATHER.COM\n\n- Why The Atlantic's Slow Start To Hurricane Season Is Meaningless\n\nJonathan Belles has been a graphics meteorologist and writer for weather.com for 8 years and also assists in video production for The Weather Channel en espa\u00f1ol.

This system continues to drift west in the southwestern Gulf,\" the NWS said. \"This system is expected to steadily strengthen, drifting westward, impacting Mexico and south Texas. Some indirect impacts will be possible across our local area through midweek. Continue to monitor the forecast for any changes to expected impacts.\"\n\nThe NWS issued a tropical storm warning in Texas, flood warnings and advisories across several states, and several ocean-related warnings such as a high surf warning, a coastal flood warning, a rip current statement and a gale warning among others as the storm continues to cause impacts.\n\n\"Tropical Storm force winds possible until Wednesday afternoon,\" the tropical storm warning said. \"Very strong winds will cause hazardous seas which could capsize or damage vessels and reduce visibility. Mariners should alter plans to avoid these hazardous conditions. Remain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course and/or secure the vessel for severe conditions.\"\n\nInland flooding also is a concern, particularly in Texas where the storm could bring up to 6 inches of rain to some areas. NWS meteorologist Geoff Bogorad told Newsweek that so far, around an inch or two of rain has already fallen in the Deep South. The heaviest rain will fall throughout the day on Wednesday.\n\nMost of the flood-related warnings are expected to expire by Thursday afternoon.\n\nMultiple agencies, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), have issued forecasts warning that 2024 will be an exceptionally strong year for hurricanes. NOAA's forecast anticipates 17 to 25 named storms, for an above-average hurricane season. Of the 25, eight to 13 will be hurricanes and four to seven will be major hurricanes. The forecast amount of named storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes is the highest NOAA has ever issued in a May outlook.\n\nSeveral factors are contributing to the storm-heavy predictions this year,

It is possible that one of these areas could strengthen into Alberto, becoming the first named storm of the season.\n\nThis AccuWeather Enhanced RealVue\u2122 Satellite image from Tuesday morning, June 18, shows an area of showers and thunderstorms, dubbed a tropical rainstorm by AccuWeather meteorologists, in the Bay of Campeche.\n\nAccuWeather began to highlight portions of the western Gulf of Mexico with a high risk for tropical development last Thursday afternoon. A tropical rainstorm developed late on Sunday and is forecast to steer toward the border between Mexico and Texas into the middle of the week. The storm is expected to drift north-northwestward, bringing with it rounds of heavy rain.\n\nA tropical storm warning has been issued along the Gulf Coast from Port O'Connor, Texas, southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande River, with a tropical storm watch southward from there to Puerto de Altamira, Mexico, due to the expected impacts from the strengthening system.\n\n\"Very warm waters in this area of the Gulf, as well as low wind shear will make this a conducive environment for the tropical rainstorm to strengthen,\" said AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Pydynowski.\n\nGiven these factors, the rainstorm is forecast to strengthen into a tropical depression, then a tropical storm, right before making landfall along the northern Gulf Coast of Mexico. Should the storm produce sustained winds of 39 mph or greater prior to any other development in the Atlantic Basin, it will be given the name Alberto.\n\nA tropical storm is likely to bring widespread strong wind gusts to the Mexican states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon, as well as portions of South Texas. Some storm surge can also be expected along the coast north of the storm's landfall. For both Mexico and the United States, given the risk for damaging winds, storm surge and flooding rainfall, this storm is a 1 on the AccuWeather RealImpact\u2122 Scale for Hurricanes.\n\nGiven the limited time over water and close proximity to land, the tropical disturbance will need to intensify quickly in order to reach tropical storm strength before landfall Wednesday night. This is currently expected to occur, according to AccuWeather forecasters.", "source": {"uri": "theyucatantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Yucatan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

For storm information specific to your area outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by your national\n\nmeteorological service.\n\nDISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK\n\n----------------------\n\nAt 1000 AM CDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Alberto was located near latitude 22.2\n\nNorth, longitude 95.0 West. Alberto is moving toward the west near 9 mph (15 km/h). A westward motion with an increase in forward speed is expected through Thursday. On the forecast track, the center of Alberto will reach the coast of northeastern Mexico early Thursday morning.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. Some slight strengthening is forecast today or tonight before the center of Alberto reaches land. Rapid weakening is expected once the center moves inland, and Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico Thursday or Thursday night.\n\nAlberto is a large tropical storm, with tropical-storm-force winds extending outward up to 415 miles (665 km) north of the center.\n\nThe minimum central pressure based on dropsonde data is 995 mb (29.39 inches).\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n\n----------------------\n\nRAINFALL: Tropical Storm Alberto is expected to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico into South Texas. Maximum totals around 20 inches are possible across the higher terrain of the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas. This rainfall will likely produce considerable flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed river flooding. Mudslides are also possible in areas of higher terrain across northeast Mexico.\n\nSTORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry ar-eas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nSargent, TX to Sabine Pass, TX...2-4 ft\n\nGalveston Bay...2-4 ft\n\nMouth of the Rio Grande, TX to Sargent, TX...1-3 ft\n\nSabine Pass, TX to Vermilion/Cameron Parish Line, LA...1-3 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances. For information specific to your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office.\n\nStorm surge will raise water levels by as much as 1 to 3 feet above normal tide levels along the imme-diate coast of northeastern Mexico in areas of onshore winds north of where the center makes land-fall. Near the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.\n\nWIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning\n\narea today through early Thursday.\n\nTORNADOES: A couple of tornadoes are possible today and tonight across parts of Deep South Texas and Southeast Texas.\n\nSURF: Swells generated by Alberto will affect the coast of Texas and northeastern Mexico through Friday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.\n\nForecaster Berg", "source": {"uri": "thedailyherald.sx", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Alberto targets Texas, 'featherweight' system nears Florida", "body": "Dr. Ryan Truchelut at WeatherTiger explains hurricane forecast models.\n\nOne is expansive, the other petite; one is messy, the other is neat.\n\nWe've got an odd couple situation in the Tropics in the third week of hurricane season, with the first named storm of 2024 lumbering across the western Gulf and a featherweight disturbance set to approach Florida from the east. And like all venerable intellectual property, this classic set-up may well reboot into an immediate sequel early next week.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto is born with little chance to strengthen\n\nFirst things first: with its thunderstorm activity sprawling across the western half of the Gulf of Mexico, much of Central America, and a chunk of the Eastern Pacific, newly designated Tropical Storm Alberto is living large as it angles westward on a path towards northern Mexico. Alberto has slowly consolidated this week from a broad gyre of cyclonic rotation that sometimes forms over Central America early or late in the hurricane season, logically known as a Central American Gyre (CAG).\n\nWhile this gyre has lent Alberto its outsized attitude, the larger the disturbance, the slower the rate of strengthening. So, while Alberto is generating low-end tropical-storm-force gusts hundreds of miles north of its center, only modest additional intensification from its maximum winds of 40 mph as of 11 a.m. Wednesday is likely prior to landfall early Thursday.\n\nTropical Storm Warnings are in effect for South Texas and northern Mexico, and a few of feet of coastal storm surge will also continue in these areas for the next day or two.\n\nThe primary impact of Alberto will be flash flooding.\n\nStorm totals of 4-8\" are probable in the southern Rio Grande Valley, which may well cause localized flash floods, particularly in urban areas. South Texas is in a drought, so there will be some benefit to the region as well. Rains taper by Friday as Alberto clips westward through Mexico, guided by a powerful ridge of high pressure to its north.\n\nA breezy tropical system approaches Florida with little punch, increased rain chances\n\nThis week's jet stream pattern over the eastern United States has more ridges than Ruffles, so look for high pressure to also be the dominant influence on a diminutive disturbance several hundred miles east of Florida.\n\nThunderstorm activity with this small area of low pressure remains limited due to a nearby dry airmass, and it probably won't organize further prior to reaching Florida. However, a slim chance of last-minute development while crossing the Gulf Stream can't be ruled out, as unlike large storms, the intensity of small systems takes the elevator up (or down).\n\nEven if a depression or minimal tropical storm briefly forms, impacts on Florida will be little different than a typical day in June.\n\nExpect enhanced rain chances along Florida's Atlantic coast and into North Florida on Thursday and Friday, and continued breezy conditions into the weekend, but that's about it. In all likelihood, the only necessary watch or warning is a Clickbait Watch for the usual suspects on social media hyping this modest feature beyond what it is.\n\nA brief history of Albertos and expect something of a storm sequel into late June\n\nClimatologically, those two features should be plenty for late June. However, unlike twenty years ago when Spiderman rebooted every five years, today Spiderman reboots literally thousands of times per film, thus a tropical instant replay is in the works.\n\nThe gyre that never ends is expected to spit another disturbance into the southern Gulf of Mexico almost as soon as Alberto moves ashore, and models suggest this broad area of rotation may slowly become a tropical depression over the weekend.\n\nThe early read on track and impacts of this disturbance is that it might copy Alberto, though perhaps be a bit weaker, with a general path towards Mexico and rains extending north into Texas through early next week. Weirdly, this system may also be accompanied by its own small disturbance east of Florida, though indications are that will probably remain offshore, with an even lower chance of any tropical development than during round one.\n\nA final synchronicity worth mentioning: do you get d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu hearing about Alberto?\n\nIf so, that's because this isn't the name's first trip through the content mines.\n\nThis is the eighth iteration of a moniker that first hit the NHC list in 1982 and has repeated every six years since. Oddly, an Alberto has impacted Florida each dozen years starting in 1982, including tropical storm landfalls in 1994, 2006, and 2018.\n\nSo, while Alberto V08's path into the western Gulf fits that pattern, if history rhymes Floridians might want to set a Google Calendar reminder now to expect heavy rain in June 2030.\n\nIn the meantime, we've got our pair of comedically mismatched dyads to monitor this week, whether they are spreading rainfall to Florida and the Gulf Coast or working together by night to solve crimes in a CBS spin-off provisionally titled NHC: Miami.\n\nAs David Caruso might say if smugglers were trafficking contraband through Miami International Airport inside the tail engine of an L-1011, keep watching the skies.\n\nDr. Ryan Truchelut is chief meteorologist at WeatherTiger, a Tallahassee company providing forensic meteorology expert witness services, and agricultural and hurricane forecasting subscriptions.

The system has been classified as a potential tropical cyclone by the center since it has not yet become better organized, but is expected to become the first named storm system of the year by early Wednesday.\n\nThe port of Corpus Christi in South Texas and the Houston Ship Channel remained open as of Tuesday morning, but the nearby ports of Galveston and Texas City closed to inbound and outbound shipping traffic at 10pm ET Monday due to heavy weather, the US Coast Guard said.\n\nThe system was expected to disrupt ship-to-ship transfer operations off the Texas coast as of Monday evening because of heavy seas. In the Gulf of Mexico, the transfer typically is from an Aframax or Suezmax onto a very large crude carrier (VLCC) at designated lightering zones near Corpus Christi, Galveston and Beaumont-Port Arthur.\n\nProlonged lightering delays can prevent crude tanker tonnage from becoming available and exert upward pressure on freight rates, while also adding to demurrage fees.\n\nThe storm is expected to turn towards the west-northwest and west tonight and Wednesday, with the system forecast to approach the western Gulf coast late Wednesday, the NHC said.\n\nRainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches are seen across northeast Mexico into South Texas, with maximum totals of 15 inches possible.

Twenty inches of rain in South Florida in just a couple of days' time last week. The 20 of June. And the year 2020.\n\nAs this week began, two tropical disturbances were being monitored for potential development by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). The one in the Gulf of Mexico showed so much potential, that NHC labeled it early as Potential Tropical Cyclone One (PTC 1) and issued Tropical Storm Warnings for Mexico and South Texas.\n\nSatellite pictures and aircraft reconnaissance data showed a very large counterclockwise gyre taking up much of the western half of the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday. The low-pressure system was so broad that it was struggling to consolidate into a well-defined tropical depression or storm. But on Wednesday, a better-defined center of circulation with a good deal of thunderstorm activity formed, and with that, the first named tropical storm of the year -- Alberto.\n\nThere is a moderate to severe drought across South Texas and especially in the Upper Rio Grande and West Texas. The same applies to many regions of northern Mexico. If there isn't going to be much of a windstorm with Alberto (at least compared to what Texas is accustomed to), then let there be drought-busting rains!\n\nRain is something we hope not to see much of for another week or two in South Florida. Early this week some neighborhoods still had standing water. Many families lost everything.\n\nAs NHC upped the chance for tropical development east of the Bahamas, forecast models were projecting that a deep plume of moisture could be drawn up from the south into our same part of Florida that just flooded.\n\nAs Tuesday and Wednesday went by, thankfully, that Atlantic disturbance showed no signs of organization. NHC lowered the chance for tropical cyclone formation to 20% (yes, another 20) in the next week, and models backed off from their projections that soupy deluge-producing air would park itself over South Florida by the weekend.\n\nWhich brings up the other 20s.\n\nWhat is the significance of the date June 20? That's the average date by which the first named tropical storm of the year forms in the Atlantic basin. Alberto made it just in the nick of time. Dare I say, the year is off to an average start?!\n\nMeteorologists try to learn from history to at least be prepared for a potential repeat. So, the year 2020 is in my mind too. It is the most recent year in which conditions in the tropical Atlantic are considered analog to 2024. Oceanic and atmospheric conditions this spring and early (meteorological) summer are in some ways similar to 2020. There were 30 named storms in the Atlantic that year, and some entities have predicted as many or more this year!\n\nBy this date in 2020, Arthur, Bertha, and Cristobal had already formed, and Dolly was about to. This year, only Alberto has been baptized in the Gulf.\n\nOkay, I'll say it: this year has not started off as everyone expected.", "source": {"uri": "nbcmiami.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 6

Alberto to bring heavy rains, strong winds and flooding in Mexico and Texas - Travel And Tour World", "body": "Tropical storm Alberto is setting its sights on coastal regions of Mexico and Texas.\n\nIt has emerged as the first significant weather system of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nThe storm which formed rapidly in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico may bring heavy rains, strong winds and potential flooding to areas along its projected path.\n\nAs of the latest updates from the National Hurricane Center (NHC), Alberto has intensified steadily, with maximum sustained winds reaching up to 60 miles per hour.\n\nMeteorologists are closely monitoring its movement as it moves northwestward at a pace of 12 miles per hour.\n\nOfficials in both Mexico and Texas are advising residents to prepare for possible impacts from Alberto.\n\nEmergency management teams are activating response plans, urging people in low-lying areas to consider evacuation as a precautionary measure against potential flooding.\n\nIn Mexico, particularly in coastal communities along the Gulf, preparations are underway to secure boats and evacuate vulnerable populations to shelters.\n\nAuthorities are urging residents to stock up on essential supplies and stay informed through local news and weather updates.\n\nIn Texas, coastal counties are bracing for heavy rainfall and gusty winds as Alberto approaches.\n\nLocal officials are urging residents to clear drainage systems and secure outdoor furniture and objects that could become projectiles in strong winds.\n\nForecast models indicate that Alberto will likely make landfall along the Gulf Coast within the next 24 to 36 hours, although the exact location remains uncertain.\n\nThe storm's impact is expected to be felt across a broad swath of the region, potentially affecting transportation, power infrastructure, and agriculture.\n\nThe NHC has issued tropical storm warnings and watches for various coastal areas, urging residents to heed official advice and take necessary precautions.\n\nSmall craft advisories are also in effect, warning mariners of dangerous sea conditions as Alberto churns through the Gulf waters.\n\nMeteorologists are continuing to track Alberto's progress closely, providing regular updates on its strength and trajectory.\n\nResidents are advised to stay tuned to official sources of information and to avoid spreading rumors or unverified reports during this critical period.\n\nAs communities in Mexico and Texas brace for the arrival of Tropical Storm Alberto, emergency responders and volunteers are standing by to assist those in need.\n\nThe storm serves as a stark reminder of the importance of preparedness and resilience in the face of natural disasters.", "source": {"uri": "travelandtourworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Travel And Tour World"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc",

The storm, named Alberto, has sustained winds of 40 miles per hour. According to the National Hurricane Center, the storm will move slowly to the west, approaching northeastern Mexico. The effects were also felt along the coast of Texas in the United States, with strong winds and heavy rain.\n\nAlberto is expected to produce rainfall totals of five to ten inches across northeast Mexico and southern Texas. The maximum rainfall expected by late Thursday was 15 inches. There are concerns that this rainfall may lead to flash and urban flooding. A tropical storm warning has been issued for the Texas coast from Corpus Christi to the mouth of the Rio Grande. Forecasters shared that the Texas coast will gradually improve after Thursday.\n\nWhile this storm poses no threat to Belize, the country's weather has changed significantly over the past few days. Following the prolonged heat wave, the weather forecast calls for cloudy skies and cooler temperatures. The National Meteorological Service of Belize indicated on June 17th that heavy showers and thunderstorms can be expected over central and northern Belize over the following days.\n\nThis year, scientists forecast above-average activity for the North Atlantic basin, predicting 23 storms with an average of 14 named storms, 11 hurricanes with an average of seven hurricanes, and five major hurricanes with an average of three major hurricanes. According to them, this year also has an 85% chance of an \"above average\" season.\n\nBelizeans are advised to monitor any updates on the weather during the hurricane season and to follow information from official sources only. The most active period for tropical storms in Belize is from the end of August through mid-October. Residents of San Pedro Town are encouraged to make any necessary hurricane preparations.\n\nFor further reference on how to improve your emergency family plan, contact San Pedro National Emergency Management Organization Coordinator Vanessa Parham via WhatsApp or call 614-5865, or visit their official website https://site.nemo.org.bz/preparedness-guidelines for additional tips.", "source": {"uri": "sanpedrosun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The San Pedro Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "janelle_cowo@sanpedrosun.com", "name": "Janelle Cowo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belize", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Belize"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belize"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maximum sustained wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_flooding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Urban flooding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_convection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric convection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weather forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone warnings and watches"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_Christi,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corpus Christi, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Corpus Christi, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic hurricane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Pedro_Town", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Pedro Town"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Pedro Town"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belize"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 10}], "image": "https://cdn.sanpedrosun.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20102135/Tropical-Storm-Alberto-2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659946", "eventUri": "eng-9659946", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 14, "textEnd": 23}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-17", "textStart": 1164, "textEnd": 1173}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

As far as the Gulf of Mexico and tropical storm development is concerned, the NHC is \"stacking them deep\". No, we don't know about selling the cheap, but we do know there is another area of concern in the Gulf of Mexico besides the system currently known as Potential Tropical Cyclone One.\n\nFirst things first, let's get you caught up on PTC One. The graphic below is from the National Hurricane Center and it shows the projected track of that storm system. As you can see a landfall is expected in northern Mexico. At the time of landfall, the system is expected to have achieved Tropical Storm status. If it does, it would earn the name Alberto.\n\nThe effects of PTC One/Alberto on Louisiana are expected to be minimal. The state has already experienced an increase in tropical moisture and tropical showers spawned by the system but not much more than that is really projected for Louisiana. And as the system eventually moves onshore the threat of rain and storms spawned by it should decrease.\n\nMeanwhile, if you look at the graphic below also from the National Hurricane Center you can see the yellow shading beneath the \"Red X\". The \"X\" is PTC One but the yellow shading suggests another tropical system could be forming in that same area of the Gulf of Mexico over the next seven days.\n\nCurrent early weather model runs suggest a similar fate for that system if it develops at all. Right now the Hurricane Center is only suggesting a 30% probability of tropical cyclone formation over the next seven days. Of course, with sea surface water temps as warm as they are any system that does form in the Gulf will have the potential to strengthen.

The system is moving toward the\n\nnorth-northeast near 6 mph (9 km/h). A turn toward the northwest and west with an increase in forward speed is expected tonight and\n\non Wednesday, and the system is forecast to reach the Gulf coast of Mexico by Wednesday night.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. Some increase in strength is likely during the next 36 hours,\n\nand the disturbance is forecast to become a tropical storm by Wednesday. * Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent. * Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.\n\nThe disturbance is quite large, and satellite-derived wind data indicate that tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 415\n\nmiles (665 km) north of the center. The minimum central pressure based on Air Force Reserve dropsonde\n\ndata is 999 mb (29.50 inches). HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n\n---------------------- Key messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone One can be found in the\n\nTropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO header WTNT41 KNHC.\n\nRAINFALL: Potential Tropical Cyclone One is expected to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico into South\n\nTexas, with maximum totals of 15 inches possible. This rainfall will likely produce flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed\n\nriver flooding. Mudslides are also possible in areas of higher terrain across northeast Mexico.\n\nFor a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding associated with Potential Tropical Cyclone One, please see the\n\nNational Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk\n\ngraphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero STORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and\n\nthe tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water could\n\nreach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nSargent, TX to Sabine Pass, TX...2-4 ft Galveston Bay...2-4 ft\n\nMouth of the Rio Grande, TX to Sargent, TX...1-3 ft Sabine Pass, TX to Vermilion/Cameron Parish Line, LA...1-3 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be\n\naccompanied by large and dangerous waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,\n\nand can vary greatly over short distances. For information specific to your area, please see products issued by your local\n\nNational Weather Service forecast office. For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,\n\nplease see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.\n\nIn Mexico, minor coastal flooding is possible north of where the center of the system crosses the coast in areas of onshore\n\nwinds. WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning\n\narea by tonight or Wednesday. TORNADOES: A couple of tornadoes may occur across parts of Deep\n\nSouth Texas on Wednesday. SURF: Swells generated by the disturbance will affect the coast of\n\nTexas and northeastern Mexico through Wednesday night. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current\n\nconditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

And today will likely feel like summer.\n\nWe are seeing temperatures starting out in the 60s to 70s this morning. We will likely end up with partly cloudy skies by this afternoon. High temperatures are forecast to climb into the lower 90s with easterly winds continuing at five to 10 mph.\n\nIf you plan on attending the MLB game at Rickwood Field this evening, we are looking at temperatures near 90\u00b0F at the first pitch. It is expected to be partly cloudy with temperatures cooling into the lower 80s by the end of the game.\n\nNext Big Thing: The big story going into the weekend is that temperatures will continue to trend a little warmer. We will likely see high temperatures climb into the mid 90s Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Humidity levels may increase a little Saturday and Sunday, so the heat index could flirt near 100\u00b0F. If you plan on working outdoors this weekend, you'll definitely want to take some breaks and stay hydrated. Your best bet is to work early in the morning while temperatures are in the 70s and 80s. The weekend will likely remain partly cloudy, so don't forget to apply the sunscreen too! The UV Index will remain very high.\n\nWe have to monitor a weak tropical disturbance in the Atlantic that could impact Georgia and Florida by the end of the week. It is forecast to move due west and could help generate a small rain chance for the southern half of Alabama Saturday. I've added a 20% chance for an isolated shower or storm Saturday. Widely scattered showers and storms are possible on Sunday. Scattered rain and storm chances may continue into early next week. We could really use the rain for our lawn and to help cool us off.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto forms: \"Potential Tropical Cyclone One\" has a closed low and the National Hurricane Center has upgraded it to Tropical Storm Alberto. It is the first name storm of the 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season. Tropical Storm Warnings have been issued for coastal Texas from San Luis Pass southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande. While Alberto is forecast to make landfall in Mexico tonight, the impacts from the storm will be felt hundreds of miles north of the center of circulation in parts of Texas. Southern Texas could pick up five to 10 inches of rain. We have already seen storm surge flood parts of coastal Texas earlier this morning.\n\nThis system will not impact central Alabama, but it is creating a high rip current threat along the Gulf Coast. Double red flags are flying at the Alabama Gulf Coast today and tomorrow. It means you are not allowed in the water. The surf may back off a little over the weekend.\n\nWe continue to monitor two other systems that have a low chance to develop. An area of low pressure may form in the Atlantic and push west into the northern Bahamas and into Florida/Georgia over the weekend. Odds of development remain low at 20%. It could produce some rain and breezy conditions for Georgia and Florida Friday into Saturday. There's a chance that if any of it holds together, it could help generate a few showers across the southern half of Alabama Saturday. Another low could develop in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico over the weekend. Odds for tropical development remain low at 30%.\n\nThe same areas getting hit by Alberto now could receive more rain and wind over the weekend and into early next week. The next name on the 2024 Atlantic Hurricane list is Beryl. Hurricane season ends on November 30.", "source": {"uri": "wbrc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://www.wbrc.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Tropical storm conditions with wind gusts up to 57 mph are expected along the Texas coast south of the San Luis Pass.\n\nHeavy rainfall and the threat of flash floods will intensify in the western Gulf Coast, according to National Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan.\n\n\"Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues,\" the weather service said. \"Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in multiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, and ditches may become dangerous rivers.

It had top sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami.

For storm information specific to your area outside of the United States, please monitor products issued by your national\n\nmeteorological service.\n\nDISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK\n\n----------------------\n\nAt 700 AM CDT (1200 UTC), the disturbance was centered near latitude 21.5 North, longitude 92.8 West. The system is moving toward the north near 6 mph (9 km/h). A gradual turn toward the west-northwest and west is expected is expected tonight and Wednesday, and the system is likely to\n\napproach the western Gulf coast late Wednesday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds remain near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. Some increase in strength is likely during the next 36 hours, and the disturbance is forecast to become a tropical storm by Wednesday.\n\n* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.\n\n* Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent.\n\nThe disturbance is quite large with tropical-storm-force winds extending outward up to 290 miles (465 km) to the northeast of the center.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n\n----------------------\n\nRAINFALL: Potential Tropical Cyclone One is expected to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico into South Texas, with maximum totals of 15 inches possible. This rainfall will likely produce flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed river flooding. Mudslides are al-so possible in areas of higher terrain across northeast Mexico.\n\nSTORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nSargent, TX to Sabine Pass, TX...2-4 ft\n\nGalveston Bay...2-4 ft\n\nMouth of the Rio Grande, TX to Sargent, TX...1-3 ft\n\nSabine Pass, TX to Vermilion/Cameron Parish Line, LA...1-3 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances. For information specific to your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office.\n\nIn Mexico, minor coastal flooding is possible north of where the center of the system crosses the coast in areas of onshore winds.\n\nWIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning area by Wednesday.\n\nForecaster Berg", "source": {"uri":

Here's what experts say.", "body": "National Hurricane Center forecasters have had a busy week at the start of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nPotential Tropical Cyclone 1, forecast to become Tropical Storm Alberto at some point Tuesday, is expected to make landfall near northeast Mexico and South Texas this week.\n\nLarge and unorganized, the system that formed in the Bay of Campeche is expected to dump heavy rains and bring up to 4 feet of storm surge with it, and forecasters are already watching another disturbance behind it in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nAt the same time, a disturbance in the Atlantic has a 20% chance for development over the next two days, according to the NHC.\n\nThe NHC forecast map is colorful already, and we're just 17 days into the season.\n\nThe developments have raised concerns that such early activity could foreshadow a very busy hurricane season as predicted by scientists, researchers and meteorologists.\n\nBut while an active season is predicted, there is no need to panic, one New Orleans-based weather expert with the NHC said Tuesday.\n\nHigh activity normal in active hurricane season\n\nTropical activity at the beginning of hurricane season, which starts on June 1, is not a cause of concern, said National Hurricane Center forecaster Mike Efferson.\n\nIt's not uncommon to see developments in the Atlantic and Gulf near the U.S. early on in the season, Efferson said, nothing that there have been several seasons in the last decade where forecasters were tracking systems before June 1.\n\n\"If we have an above-normal seasons, it's not odd to have a few more systems develop this early in the season,\" Efferson said.\n\nMany of the early developments in the Atlantic or Gulf may not strengthen into a tropical storm or hurricane, or affect land.\n\n\"There are about 100 waves that come across the African coast,\" Efferson said. \"And maybe 10% will develop into tropical storms or hurricanes.\"\n\nWhy do systems develop in the Gulf?\n\nSystems can develop early in the Gulf for a variety of reasons, Efferson said, including cold fronts, warming temperatures, weakening upper-level winds and easterly winds.\n\nThere are still some cold fronts moving toward the Gulf in May and June, creating tropical waves that could often develop into a disturbance or something stronger.\n\nDuring this time of year, upper-level winds in the Gulf start to weaken, allowing for potential development. These winds are not strong enough to hinder the development of a disturbance, Efferson said.\n\nEasterly winds, or winds that move from east to west, combined with showers and thunderstorms are another factor that promote system development. When this combination of winds and rain approaches the Central American coast, it starts to rotate in a broad area, creating a cyclonic rotation.\n\nHow busy could the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season be?\n\nHurricane forecasters and researchers predict that the 2024 season will be one of the most active in modern history due to La Nina's return and record warm waters in the Atlantic Ocean and in the Gulf.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that there is an 85% chance of this year's Atlantic hurricane season being above average.\n\nNOAA forecasters predict that there will be 17-25 named storms, with 8-13 of these storms reaching hurricane strength and 4-7 becoming major hurricanes, meaning a Category 3 or higher.\n\nIn June, Colorado State University researchers predicted that there will be 23 storms, with 11 reaching hurricane status and five becoming major hurricanes. CSU said that their predictions have been correct 64 percent of the time within the last nine years.\n\nWhat should you do to prepare?\n\nEven though early tropical activity in the Gulf is normal and expected during this time of year, Efferson said that people should still prepare in advance.\n\nThis means stocking up on essential items, such as nonperishable food, water and batteries, Efferson said. Cash or extra checkbooks, flashlights and medications are some other items that you should have in your hurricane kit.\n\nClick here to learn more about how to prepare for the hurricane season.

Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico as early as Thursday night.\n\nThe NHC said the storm was very large and that rainfall, coastal flooding and strong winds could occur far from the center along north-eastern Mexico and the south Texas coast.\n\nHeavy rains will also impact large regions of Central America, the NHC warned, a region that is still facing strong rains that left some 11 people dead in El Salvador over the weekend, due to landslides and road accidents.\n\n\"Life-threatening flooding and mudslides are likely in and near higher terrain across the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas,\" the NHC said, including the eastern city of Ciudad Victoria and Monterrey, Mexico's third-biggest city in Nuevo Leon state.\n\nNuevo Leon State Governor Samuel Garcia said on X that people should avoid leaving the house or crossing waterways if it is raining and to keep emergency kits at hand. Workers were ready to address possible impacts on the electricity grid, water and sewage supplies caused by strong winds and rains, he said.\n\nIn Tamaulipas state, which runs along the Gulf coast, videos shared on social media showed ominous gray skies, while in the United States as far as Louisiana videos showed flooded coastal towns and water smashing into sea walls.\n\nAcross the Gulf on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, local news reported strong winds and torrential rains. Some authorities, however, said the storm could help fill the country's dams, depleted by an extended drought.\n\nThe NHC predicted \"moderate coastal flooding\" along much of the Texan coast through Thursday as southern areas experience tropical storm conditions.\n\nForecasters have warned that this year's Atlantic hurricane season will likely be highly active due to impacts from the La Nina

Some increase in strength is possible before the system reaches the coast.\n\nA third system that is also in the western Gulf of Mexico, Disturbance 2, appears to pose no serious threat as it has a low chance of becoming a tropical cyclone.\n\nThe onshore winds are keeping temperatures moderate along the coast of the Palmetto State, though that is forecast to change. Temperatures should begin to rising over the weekend and into next week.\n\n\"By Monday, we can be looking at excessive heat indices of 105 to 110 degrees, which would potentially see a heat advisory

Alberto targets Texas, 'featherweight' system nears Florida", "body": "One is expansive, the other petite; one is messy, the other is neat.\n\nWe've got an odd couple situation in the Tropics in the third week of hurricane season, with the first named storm of 2024 lumbering across the western Gulf and a featherweight disturbance set to approach Florida from the east. And like all venerable intellectual property, this classic set-up may well reboot into an immediate sequel early next week.\n\nFirst things first: with its thunderstorm activity sprawling across the western half of the Gulf of Mexico, much of Central America, and a chunk of the Eastern Pacific, newly designated Tropical Storm Alberto is living large as it angles westward on a path towards northern Mexico. Alberto has slowly consolidated this week from a broad gyre of cyclonic rotation that sometimes forms over Central America early or late in the hurricane season, logically known as a Central American Gyre (CAG).\n\nWhile this gyre has lent Alberto its outsized attitude, the larger the disturbance, the slower the rate of strengthening. So, while Alberto is generating low-end tropical-storm-force gusts hundreds of miles north of its center, only modest additional intensification from its maximum winds of 40 mph as of 11 a.m. Wednesday is likely prior to landfall early Thursday.\n\nTropical Storm Warnings are in effect for South Texas and northern Mexico, and a few of feet of coastal storm surge will also continue in these areas for the next day or two.\n\nThe primary impact of Alberto will be flash flooding.\n\nStorm totals of 4-8\" are probable in the southern Rio Grande Valley, which may well cause localized flash floods, particularly in urban areas. South Texas is in a drought, so there will be some benefit to the region as well. Rains taper by Friday as Alberto clips westward through Mexico, guided by a powerful ridge of high pressure to its north.\n\nThis week's jet stream pattern over the eastern United States has more ridges than Ruffles, so look for high pressure to also be the dominant influence on a diminutive disturbance several hundred miles east of Florida.\n\nThunderstorm activity with this small area of low pressure remains limited due to a nearby dry airmass, and it probably won't organize further prior to reaching Florida. However, a slim chance of last-minute development while crossing the Gulf Stream can't be ruled out, as unlike large storms, the intensity of small systems takes the elevator up (or down).\n\nEven if a depression or minimal tropical storm briefly forms, impacts on Florida will be little different than a typical day in June.\n\nExpect enhanced rain chances along Florida's Atlantic coast and into North Florida on Thursday and Friday, and continued breezy conditions into the weekend, but that's about it. In all likelihood, the only necessary watch or warning is a Clickbait Watch for the usual suspects on social media hyping this modest feature beyond what it is.\n\nClimatologically, those two features should be plenty for late June. However, unlike twenty years ago when Spiderman rebooted every five years, today Spiderman reboots literally thousands of times per film, thus a tropical instant replay is in the works.\n\nThe gyre that never ends is expected to spit another disturbance into the southern Gulf of Mexico almost as soon as Alberto moves ashore, and models suggest this broad area of rotation may slowly become a tropical depression over the weekend.\n\nThe early read on track and impacts of this disturbance is that it might copy Alberto, though perhaps be a bit weaker, with a general path towards Mexico and rains extending north into Texas through early next week. Weirdly, this system may also be accompanied by its own small disturbance east of Florida, though indications are that will probably remain offshore, with an even lower chance of any tropical development than during round one.\n\nA final synchronicity worth mentioning: do you get d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu hearing about Alberto?\n\nIf so, that's because this isn't the name's first trip through the content mines.\n\nThis is the eighth iteration of a moniker that first hit the NHC list in 1982 and has repeated every six years since. Oddly, an Alberto has impacted Florida each dozen years starting in 1982, including tropical storm landfalls in 1994, 2006, and 2018.\n\nSo, while Alberto V08's path into the western Gulf fits that pattern, if history rhymes Floridians might want to set a Google Calendar reminder now to expect heavy rain in June 2030.\n\nIn the meantime, we've got our pair of comedically mismatched dyads to monitor this week, whether they are spreading rainfall to Florida and the Gulf Coast or working together by night to solve crimes in a CBS spin-off provisionally titled NHC: Miami.\n\nAs David Caruso might say if smugglers were trafficking contraband through Miami International Airport inside the tail engine of an L-1011, keep watching the skies.\n\nDr. Ryan Truchelut is chief meteorologist at WeatherTiger, a Tallahassee company providing forensic meteorology expert witness services, and agricultural and hurricane forecasting subscriptions.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK\n\n---------------------- At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the poorly defined disturbance was\n\ncentered near latitude 20.5 North, longitude 93.0 West. The system is moving toward the north-northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), and this\n\ngeneral motion is expected to continue through Tuesday. A turn toward the west-northwest is expected Tuesday night or Wednesday,\n\nand system is likely to approach the western Gulf coast late Wednesday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds remain near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts. The disturbance is forecast to to become a tropical storm\n\nby Wednesday. * Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent. * Formation chance through 7 days...high...80 percent. The disturbance is quite large with tropical-storm-force winds\n\nextending outward up to 290 miles (465 km) to the northeast of the center.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches) based on Air Force Reserve dropsonde data.\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND ----------------------\n\nKey messages for Potential Tropical Cyclone One can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT1 and WMO\n\nheader WTNT41 KNHC. RAINFALL: Potential Tropical Cyclone One is expected to produce\n\nrainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico into southeastern Texas, with maximum totals of 15 inches possible. This\n\nrainfall will likely produce flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed river flooding. Mudslides are also possible in\n\nareas of higher terrain across northeast Mexico. For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding\n\nassociated with Potential Tropical Cyclone One, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at\n\nhurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero\n\nSTORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded\n\nby rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated\n\nareas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide... Sargent, TX to Sabine Pass, TX...2-4 ft\n\nGalveston Bay...2-4 ft Mouth of the Rio Grande, TX to Sargent, TX...1-3 ft\n\nSabine Pass, TX to Vermilion/Cameron Parish Line, LA...1-3 ft The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to\n\nthe north of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous waves. Surge-related flooding\n\ndepends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances. For information\n\nspecific to your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office.\n\nFor a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak\n\nStorm Surge Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge.\n\nIn Mexico, minor coastal flooding is possible north of where the center of the disturbance crosses the coast in areas of onshore\n\nwinds.

The patch of disturbed weather is moving at 10 to 15 mph and is expected to reach the northeastern coast of Florida or the Georgia coast early Friday.\n\nThe small area of low pressure is currently moving northwest from the Bahamas and producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms, according to federal meteorologists.\n\nIf the system does reach Florida, its impacts would likely be contained to the greater Jacksonville area, said Rodney Wynn, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Tampa Bay office.\n\n\"We're not concerned about this area at all,\" he said. \"If it does develop into something, that will be very weak and most likely impact the Carolinas more than it will Florida.\"\n\nAn Air Force Reserve reconnaissance plane is on standby to investigate the system Thursday afternoon, if deemed necessary, the hurricane center says.\n\nFederal meteorologists are also watching a broad area of low pressure expected to form over southeastern Mexico and northern Central America Friday.

By mid-morning, the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression as it traveled about 18 mph and packed 35-mph winds through central Mexico.\n\nDespite being downgraded, the National Hurrican Center warned Alberto still poses a threat to the region, due to heavy rain that can cause flooding and mudslides.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday issued a severe weather disaster declaration for 51 counties in anticipation of the heavy rainfall, coastal flooding and tropical force winds the storm was likely to produce.\n\n\"I urge Texans in at risk-areas to remain weather aware and heed the guidance of state and local officials to keep themselves and their families safe,\" Abbott said Wednesday.\n\nThe National Weather Service on Thursday reported winds above 50 mph in the Galveston Bay area and and rainfall totals of about 2 to 7 inches across the coastal bend.\n\nAccuWeather predicted rainfall totals of about 8 to 12 inches for the Big Bend area of Texas, and winds could reach speeds of up to 60 mph.\n\nStorm surge along the coast of northeastern Mexico, Texas and western Louisiana peaked at 1 to 3 feet, according to AccuWeather, but the Houston and Galveston areas could see up to 6 feet in some low-lying areas until conditions ease into Friday.\n\nFootage from CNN on Thursday morning showed the coastal town of Surfside Beach in Texas besieged by high waves crashing over a seawall and flooding residential areas.\n\nSurfside Mayor Gregg Bisso said the cleanup effort is on hold after the high water levels made it unsafe, but recovery will resume once the water has subsided enough.\n\nThe city also limited access to Follet's Island's west end where about 100 homes were left without power in the wake of the storm. Only residents, contractors and people with rental agreements can access that side of the island.\n\nAccess to the beach is also prohibited.\n\n\"We haven't even been able to get down on the beach yet to take a look at it, to see what it's what it looks like, see how much damage we've had to our dunes and things like that,\" Bisso said. \"As we get down there, we'll be able to assess the situation a lot better.\"\n\nIn San Antonio, CPS Energy said about 1,400 of its 938,000 customers were left without power on Thursday morning.\n\nThe White House on Thursday said President Joe Biden was briefed on Alberto, as well as on wildfires in the southwest United States and extreme heat across the rest of the country.\n\nIn Mexico, meanwhile, there were four confirmed deaths related to Alberto as of Thursday.\n\nOfficials in the northeastern state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n said a man died early Thursday morning when he was trying to repair a window on his home.\n\nSevere weather conditions caused by Alberto also claimed the lives of three minors on Wednesday. One 16-year-old boy drowned in Monterrey when he entered the La Silla River to try to retrieve a ball.\n\nThe other two minors were killed by electrocution from a light pole while riding their bikes in Pino Su\u00e1rez.\n\nResidents in northeastern Mexico, however, see Alberto as also bringing much needed rain to the region, which for over a year has suffered from severe drought.\n\nErick Te\u00f3dulo Cavazos Cavazos, director of Civil Protection of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, told local media on Thursday that rains from Alberto are resupplying dams such as La Boca and El Cuchillo.\n\n\"We have to wait for the figures from El Cuchillo, but everything that comes from the Santa Catarina River and the La Silla River goes to El Cuchillo,\" he said. \"We also had a dam that was in a water crisis in the entire Linares region, in the municipality of Cerro Prieto, water is entering.\"\n\nAccuWeather also is keeping an eye on a possible second tropical storm system that could form this weekend and once again hammer notheastern Mexico and southern Texas.\n\n\"There is a moderate chance for development from June 21-23 across a similar area in the Gulf of Mexico,\" said AccuWeather Meteorologist Andrew Kienzle. \"This feature will need to be watched for possible impacts on the Gulf coasts of the United States and Mexico this weekend into early next week.\"", "source": {"uri":

Track system, see possible impacts", "body": "As Tropical Storm Alberto made landfall in Mexico Thursday morning, the National Hurricane Center is tracking two disturbances that could become tropical depressions in the coming days.\n\nOne of them, now called Invest 92L, is located off the eastern coast of Florida and is expected to approach Northeast Florida or the Georgia coast Friday, June 21, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe second disturbance is in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico and has an even higher chance for development. The National Hurricane Center said it could become a tropical depression over the weekend.\n\nThe next named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season will be Beryl.\n\nA small area of low pressure -- Invest 92L -- located about 150 miles east of the northernmost Bahamas continues to produce disorganized showers and thunderstorms, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\u27a4 Tropics watch, June 20: National Hurricane Center tracking 2 tropical disturbances and TS Alberto\n\nWhile environmental conditions are only marginally conducive due to nearby dry air, further development of this system could lead to the development of a tropical depression while the low moves west-northwest at 10 to 15 mph and approaches the northeastern coast of Florida or the Georgia coast early on Friday.\n\nAn Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft was scheduled to investigate this system Thursday afternoon, if necessary.\n\nSpecial note about spaghetti models: Illustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal. The hurricane center uses only the top four or five highest performing models to help make its forecasts.\n\n\"Thunderstorm activity with this small area of low pressure remains limited due to a nearby dry airmass, and it probably won't organize further prior to reaching Florida,\" said Dr. Ryan Truchelut is chief meteorologist at WeatherTiger.\n\n\"However, a slim chance of last-minute development while crossing the Gulf Stream can't be ruled out, as unlike large storms, the intensity of small systems takes the elevator up (or down).\n\n\"Even if a depression or minimal tropical storm briefly forms, impacts on Florida will be little different than a typical day in June. Expect enhanced rain chances along Florida's Atlantic coast and into North Florida on Thursday and Friday, and continued breezy conditions into the weekend, but that's about it\" Truchelut said.\n\nTruchelut works with the USA TODAY Network-Florida to provide the latest storm information Florida residents need.\n\nStorm sequel on horizon? Alberto targets Texas, 'featherweight' system nears Florida\n\n\"Regardless of development, this feature can bring high seas, gusty winds and areas of heavy rain and thunderstorms to the Southeast coast,\" said AccuWeather Meteorologist Andrew Kienzle.\n\nAccuWeather predicted that from late Thursday to Saturday, 1 to 2 inches of rain could fall along the Southeast coastal regions, particularly across southeastern Georgia.\n\n\"Wind gusts directly along the coastline can reach speeds upward of 25-35 mph as this feature advances northwestward over the upcoming days,\" AccuWeather said.\n\nInvest 92L is expected to move across North Central Florida late Thursday night, Friday morning, according to the National Weather Service Jacksonville.\n\nThe disturbance has the potential to bring numerous showers and embedded thunderstorms with a potential of heavy rainfall and gusty winds.\n\nIt \"still appears as this feature is moving too fast to become organized into significant tropical system, but some convective gusts to gale force and localized flooding possible in urban areas and along the beachfront locations during times of high tide late tonight,\" NWS forecasters said.\n\nWhile Invest 92L had a 40 percent chance of developing into a tropical depression as it approaches Florida and Georgia, regardless of development, \"the main threats with any storms will be lightning strikes, local enhancement of gusty winds, and brief heavy downpours,\" the National Weather Service Melbourne said.\n\nBands of \"breezy to gusty showers and isolated storms are expected, especially north of Cape Canaveral\" Thursday night through Friday morning, forecasters said.\n\nExpect dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach erosion.", "source": {"uri":

It is expected to move slowly to the northwest.\n\nFormation chance remains low in the next 48 hours (10%), but in the next seven days, that chance jumps to 50%", "source": {"uri": "wesh.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WESH"}, "authors": [{"uri": "averi_kremposky@wesh.com", "name": "Averi Kremposky", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Alberto_(1994)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical Storm Alberto (1994)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_convection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric convection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pressure_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Low-pressure area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucat\u00e1n_Peninsula", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Socially_Responsible", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Socially Responsible", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/invest-92-l-6674081300324.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659946", "eventUri": "eng-9659946", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

The system has a 40 percent chance of developing into at least a tropical depression as it approaches the Florida or Georgia coast over the next 48 hours, Live 5 First Alert Meteorologist Joey Sovine said.\n\nIt was moving west-northwest at 10 to 15 mph and was expected to reach the coast by early Friday.\n\nAn Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft is expected to investigate the area to collect more data.\n\nFor the second day in a row, a high risk of rip currents should make Thursday a \"no-swim day\" at the beach, Sovine said.\n\nRip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water. The National Weather Service says the risk extends across Georgia and South Carolina coasts and into North Carolina.\n\nSovine said gusty winds off the coast are contributing to the high risk.\n\nIt is expected to continue through Friday, he said.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto, the season's first named storm, was moving inland over Mexico Thursday morning and bringing in heavy rains and flash flooding.\n\nAs of 8 a.m. the center of Tropical Storm Alberto was located near latitude 22.3 North, longitude 98.3 West.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding associated with Potential Tropical Cyclone One, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk graphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?ero\n\nSTORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nSargent, TX to Sabine Pass, TX...2-4 ft\n\nGalveston Bay...2-4 ft\n\nMouth of the Rio Grande, TX to Sargent, TX...1-3 ft\n\nSabine Pass, TX to Vermilion/Cameron Parish Line, LA...1-3 ft\n\nThe deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the north of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large and dangerous waves. Surge-related flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances. For information specific to your area, please see products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast office. For a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation, please see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic, available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at1.shtml?peakSurge. In Mexico, minor coastal flooding is possible north of where the center of the disturbance crosses the coast in areas of onshore winds.\n\nWIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area by Wednesday.\n\nFlood threat increasing in Houston this week\n\nThe next advisory from the National Hurricane Center will be at 10 p.m.", "source": {"uri": "click2houston.com", "dataType":

Forecasters have warned the system could bring rain and minor coastal flooding to South Mississippi, even though its predicted landfall is hundreds of miles away.\n\nRegardless, this is the latest in the season that we have made it without a named storm since 2014, when powerful Arthur kicked the hurricane season off with a Category 2 storm.\n\nHere is a look at the first storm from the past 10 Atlantic hurricane seasons, with the dates of the first named storm, along with damages and deaths that were recorded.\n\n2023: Arlene, June 1 to 3\n\nA subtropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph, Arlene struck Western Cuba and South Florida, but did not cause any reported damage.\n\n2022: Alex, June 5 to 6\n\nA tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph, Alex made landfall in Bermuda, the Northern Bahamas, Cuba, Florida and the Yucatan Peninsula. The storm killed four people and caused more than $100,000 in damage.\n\n2021: Ana, May 22 to 23\n\nA tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of just 45 mph, Ana struck Bermuda, but did not cause any reported damage.\n\n2020: Arthur, May 16 to 19\n\nA tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph, Arthur did not make landfall, but approached land closely enough to cause more than $110,000 in damage. Arthur ultimately passed within 20 miles of Cape Hatteras, N,C.\n\n2019: Andrea, May 20 to 21\n\nA subtropical system with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, Andrea most closely approached Bermuda, but did not cause any damage.\n\n2018: Alberto, May 25 to 31\n\nWhile Alberto never reached hurricane status, and its maximum sustained winds never exceeded 65 mph, the storm caused 18 deaths and more than $125 million in damage. Alberto developed in the Gulf of Mexico near the Yucatan Peninsula, and made its way north, with a landfall near Laguna Beach, Fla. Alberto passed through the entire United States, dissipating over Ontario, Canada.\n\n2017: Arlene, April 19 to 21\n\nA tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph, Arlene never threatened land.\n\n2016: Alex, January 12 to 15\n\nAn exceptionally rare January hurricane, the first of its kind since Alice in 1955. Alex was born near the Bahamas and passed near Bermuda before dissipating in the Atlantic Ocean. Damage from the storm was minimal and there were no deaths.\n\n2015: Ana, May 8 to 11\n\nA tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph, Ana formed off the east coast of Florida. The storm moved north, making landfall near North Myrtle Beach, S.C. Two deaths are attributed to the storm in North Carolina.\n\n2014: Arthur, July 1 to 5\n\nA hurricane that reached Category 2 status, with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph, Arthur caused nearly $40 million in damage and 2 deaths. Arthur gained Tropical Storm status over Grand Bahama, and would become the earliest storm on record to make landfall in North Carolina, coming ashore at Shackleford Banks.", "source": {"uri":

large' Storm Alberto brings floods to Gulf of Mexico coasts", "body": "By Sarah Morland and Stephanie Hamel\n\nMEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Tropical Storm Alberto, the first named storm of 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the western Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said on Wednesday, bringing coastal flooding across the southern U.S. coast.\n\nThe \"very large\" storm was located about 180 miles (290 km) east of Tampico, Mexico, packing maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph), the Miami-based forecaster said.\n\nAlberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico as early as Thursday night, after bringing torrential rainfall, coastal flooding and strong winds from the center along north-eastern Mexico and the south Texas coast.\n\nThe NHC warned of likely \"life-threatening flooding and mudslides\" across north-eastern Mexico, including Monterrey, Mexico's third-biggest city in Nuevo Leon state.\n\n\"We don't rule out that Tropical Storm Alberto could intensify to a Category 1 hurricane\", Alejandra Mendez, who heads Mexico's SMN national meteorological service, told a news conference, citing water temperatures above 31\u00b0C (88\u00b0F).\n\nHurricanes have sustained wind speeds of at least 119 kph.\n\nMendez added the storm was interacting with formations in the Pacific, which will together bring rains over large parts of Central America, a region that is still facing strong rainfall that left some 11 people dead in El Salvador over the weekend, due to landslides and road accidents.\n\nThe storm has gathered up humidity from both the Gulf and the Pacific Ocean, Mendez said, and should bring much-needed rain over swathes of Mexico, which has suffered from an extended drought that has drained the country's dams.\n\nSome dams, especially in the north-eastern Tamaulipas state, are as little as 8% full.\n\nNuevo Leon state Governor Samuel Garcia said people should avoid leaving the house when it is raining and workers were ready to address possible impacts on the electricity grid, water and sewage systems.\n\nIn the United States as far as Louisiana, videos showed flooded coastal towns and water smashing into sea walls, while in Tamaulipas, videos shared on social media showed ominous gray skies as forecasters warned Alberto could bring waves as high as 20 feet (6 meters).\n\nAcross the Gulf on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, local news outlets filmed strong winds and heavy rainfall, after authorities recorded as much as 192 millimeters in the last day.\n\nThe NHC predicted \"moderate coastal flooding\" along much of the Texan coast through Thursday, while Mexican forecasters expect further weekend rains in the south from another formation over the Caribbean.\n\nForecasters have warned that this year's Atlantic hurricane season will likely be highly active due to impacts from the La Nina weather pattern and warmer ocean waters.\n\n(Reporting by Brijesh Patel in Bengaluru, Stephanie

It would be named Beryl. According to the National Hurricane Center, a broad area of low pressure is likely to develop and move into a favorable environment for tropical development.\n\nMeanwhile, a small area of low pressure about 250 miles east of the northernmost Bahamas is producing disorganized shower and thunderstorms. The chance of tropical development has increased to 30% over the next 2 days and 7 days. Regardless of development, showers and storms move onto Florida and Georgia's coast early on Friday.\n\nA few showers could reach eastern North Carolina into the weekend, but the main concern will be the dangerous waters.

The National Hurricane Center said it could become a tropical depression over the weekend.\n\nThe next named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season will be Beryl.\n\nInvest 92L: National Hurricane Center forecast for system east of Florida\n\nA small area of low pressure -- Invest 92L -- located about 150 miles east of the northernmost Bahamas continues to produce disorganized showers and thunderstorms, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\u27a4 Tropics watch, June 20: National Hurricane Center tracking 2 tropical disturbances and TS Alberto\n\nWhile environmental conditions are only marginally conducive due to nearby dry air, further development of this system could lead to the development of a tropical depression while the low moves west-northwest at 10 to 15 mph and approaches the northeastern coast of Florida or the Georgia coast early on Friday.\n\nAn Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft was scheduled to investigate this system Thursday afternoon, if necessary.\n\nSpaghetti models for Invest 92L as it moves toward Florida, Georgia\n\nSpecial note about spaghetti models: Illustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal. The hurricane center uses only the top four or five highest performing models to help make its forecasts.\n\nWeathertiger on Invest 92L: 'Impacts on Florida little different than typical day in June'\n\n\"Thunderstorm activity with this small area of low pressure remains limited due to a nearby dry airmass, and it probably won't organize further prior to reaching Florida,\" said Dr. Ryan Truchelut is chief meteorologist at WeatherTiger.\n\n\"However, a slim chance of last-minute development while crossing the Gulf Stream can't be ruled out, as unlike large storms, the intensity of small systems takes the elevator up (or down).\n\n\"Even if a depression or minimal tropical storm briefly forms, impacts on Florida will be little different than a typical day in June. Expect enhanced rain chances along Florida's Atlantic coast and into North Florida on Thursday and Friday, and continued breezy conditions into the weekend, but that's about it\" Truchelut said.\n\nTruchelut works with the USA TODAY Network-Florida to provide the latest storm information Florida residents need.\n\nStorm sequel on horizon? Alberto targets Texas, 'featherweight' system nears Florida\n\nIsolated storms, gusty winds, dangerous surf possible as Invest 92L nears Florida\n\n\"Regardless of development, this feature can bring high seas, gusty winds and areas of heavy rain and thunderstorms to the Southeast coast,\" said AccuWeather Meteorologist Andrew Kienzle.\n\nAccuWeather predicted that from late Thursday to Saturday, 1 to 2 inches of rain could fall along the Southeast coastal regions, particularly across southeastern Georgia.\n\n\"Wind gusts directly along the coastline can reach speeds upward of 25-35 mph as this feature advances northwestward over the upcoming days,\" AccuWeather said.\n\nWatches, warnings issued across Florida, Georgia, South Carolina\n\nNational Weather Service Jacksonville, Florida, warns heavy rainfall, gusty winds possible\n\nInvest 92L is expected to move across North Central Florida late Thursday night, Friday morning, according to the National Weather Service Jacksonville.\n\nThe disturbance has the potential to bring numerous showers and embedded thunderstorms with a potential of heavy rainfall and gusty winds.\n\nIt \"still appears as this feature is moving too fast to become organized into significant tropical system, but some convective gusts to gale force and localized flooding possible in urban areas and along the beachfront locations during times of high tide late tonight,\" NWS forecasters said.\n\nRadar: See satellite view of Invest 92L\n\nIsolated storms, hazardous beach conditions ahead for East Central Florida coastline\n\nWhile Invest 92L had a 40 percent chance of developing into a tropical depression as it approaches Florida and Georgia, regardless of development, \"the main threats with any storms will be lightning strikes, local enhancement of gusty winds, and brief heavy downpours,\" the National Weather Service Melbourne said.\n\nBands of \"breezy to gusty showers and isolated storms are expected, especially north of Cape Canaveral\" Thursday night through Friday morning, forecasters said.\n\nExpect dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach erosion.", "source": {"uri":

People took to social media Wednesday to post photos and videos of cars battling through the flooded streets of Grand Isle.\n\nThe National Weather Service in New Orleans has issued flash flood warnings to portions of southeast Louisiana coastline, including Orleans, St. Bernard and St. Tammany parishes.\n\nShortly after Alberto reached tropical storm strength, Louisiana State Police announced that troopers are monitoring high waters on La. Highway 1 between Golden Meadow and Grand Isle in Lafourche Parish. Some other minor coastal flooding was spotted south of Highway 22 in Tangipahoa Parish.\n\nNWS forecasters also issued a wind advisory to parts of southeast Louisiana and coastal areas along Interstate 12 Wednesday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Winds are expected to reach 20-25 mph, with gusts up to 40 mph.\n\nResidents in southeast Louisiana can expect persistent winds and flooding Wednesday and Thursday, as well as possibly Friday, according to NWS forecaster Mike Efferson.\n\nNational Hurricane Center forecasters have been monitoring another tropical disturbance in the southwestern Gulf since Tuesday. The system is expected to gradually develop through early next week as it drifts west-northwestward or northwestward.\n\nThe second disturbance in the Gulf does not pose a threat to Louisiana. While southeast region of the state has faced impacts loosely related to the formation of Tropical Storm Alberto, it is unknown if any other system in the Gulf will have the same effects.", "source":

Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico as early as Thursday night.\n\nThe NHC said the storm was very large and that rainfall, coastal flooding and strong winds could occur far from the center along north-eastern Mexico and the south Texas coast.\n\nHeavy rains will also impact large regions of Central America, the NHC warned, a region that is still facing strong rains that left some 11 people dead in El Salvador over the weekend, due to landslides and road accidents.\n\n\"Life-threatening flooding and mudslides are likely in and near higher terrain across the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas,\" the NHC said, including the eastern city of Ciudad Victoria and Monterrey, Mexico's third-biggest city in Nuevo Leon state.\n\nNuevo Leon State Governor Samuel Garcia said on X that people should avoid leaving the house or crossing waterways if it is raining and to keep emergency kits at hand. Workers were ready to address possible impacts on the electricity grid, water and sewage supplies caused by strong winds and rains, he said.\n\nIn Tamaulipas state, which runs along the Gulf coast, videos shared on social media showed ominous gray skies, while in the United States as far as Louisiana videos showed flooded coastal towns and water smashing into sea walls.\n\nAcross the Gulf on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, local news reported strong winds and torrential rains. Some authorities, however, said the storm could help fill the country's dams, depleted by an extended drought.\n\nThe NHC predicted \"moderate coastal flooding\" along much of the Texan coast through Thursday as southern areas experience tropical storm conditions.\n\nForecasters have warned that this year's Atlantic hurricane season will likely be highly active due to impacts from the La Nina weather pattern and warmer ocean waters.\n\n(Reporting by Brijesh Patel in Bengaluru, Stephanie Hamel in Gdansk and Sarah Morland in Mexico City; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Sandra Maler)", "source":

Atlantic basin's first tropical cyclone of the season is quickly coming to an end with its landfall in northeastern Mexico.\n\nAlberto became classified as a tropical storm Wednesday morning after Hurricane Hunters and satellite data indicated a low-level circulation had formed underneath a mass of thunderstorm activity in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center had been tracking the disturbance for several days and even classified the system as Potential Tropical Cyclone One, which enabled government meteorologists to issue watches and warnings ahead of its naming.\n\nThe system's origin can be traced back to the Central American Gyre or what is commonly referred to as the CAG.\n\nThe weather phenomenon is usually evident a few times a year and can produce torrential rainfall and deadly landslides throughout the seven countries that are sandwiched between Mexico and South America.\n\nDRONE VIDEO: TROPICAL STORM ALBERTO LEAVES TEXAS BEACH TOWNS UNDERWATER\n\nBefore the tropical storm gained any sort of designation, its torrential rainfall was problematic for countries south of Mexico and laid the foundation for flooding and landslides that claimed the lives of at least 14 people.\n\nAuthorities in El Salvador and neighboring Guatemala closed schools and opened shelters as hundreds of rescue operations took place.\n\nPTC One and two other areas of disturbed weather produced feet of rainfall over the mountainous terrain, leading to mudslides and landslides.\n\nOnce the moisture that would become Alberto emerged into the Bay of Campeche, only slow organization took place, allowing the NHC to eventually classify the system as a tropical storm.\n\nCENTRAL AMERICAN GYRE TRIGGERS DEADLY FLOODING, LANDSLIDES\n\nDue to Alberto's poor organization and a stiff pressure gradient over the Gulf of Mexico, coastal flooding appeared to have the greatest impacts during the event.\n\nFlooded roadways were reported from Louisiana to South Texas, as water levels rose 3-5 feet, according to initial estimates.\n\nTexas communities such as Treasure Island, Surfside Beach and areas near San Luis Pass appeared to take the brunt from Alberto, with residents waking up to flooded roadways and mailboxes that were nearly underwater Wednesday.\n\nThe state's governor declared a severe weather disaster for 51 counties in the event that flooding, tornadoes or wind damage was too extensive for local authorities to respond to efficiently.\n\nWhat's left of Alberto is expected to mostly rain itself out during the next few days over communities west of Tampico, Mexico.\n\nThe region is important for agriculture, which has been hard hit by drought and heat waves due to a strong El Ni\u00f1o climate pattern.\n\nAccording to the latest North America Drought Monitor, some communities are in the most extreme drought possible, with shortages of water and widespread crop failures.\n\nNOAA anticipates a widespread 4-6 inches of precipitation will likely fall from Alberto and possibly a foot or more over the high terrain.", "source": {"uri": "foxweather.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Weather"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Drier, warmer, and sunnier days are ahead.\n\nTonight & Tomorrow: Remaining showers will fizzle out with the loss of daytime heating on Tuesday night. We'll keep mostly cloudy skies overnight with mild temperatures. Look for a low temperature near 76\u00b0. The stream of tropical moisture from recent days will nudge westward on Wednesday. This will result in some degree of sunshine peeking through the clouds. The added sunshine will push highs into the low-90s. Enough moisture will be present to spark isolated afternoon showers and storms. However, much of the day will be dry and not all spots will see rain.\n\nEven though soon-to-be Alberto (see The Tropics section) will remain well to the southwest, the system will help enhance winds speeds locally. The wind should be noticeable on Wednesday, with sustained winds out of the east at 10-20 mph.\n\nUp Next: The typical summertime pattern makes a comeback by the end of the week. Highs will climb into the mid-90s, winds will back off, and sunshine will take up more of the sky. We cannot rule out a garden variety pop-up storm or two each afternoon, but most stay dry from day-to-day.\n\nThe Tropics: Potential Tropical Cyclone One is still ongoing in the Bay of Campeche. The \"Potential Tropical Cyclone\" term is a designation from the National Hurricane Center for systems that have yet to become tropical in nature, but will likely do so and make landfall within 48 hours. No direct impacts are anticipated for south Louisiana, but Tropical Storm Warnings are in effect for portions of northern Mexico and southern Texas. This disturbance will likely become a tropical storm by Wednesday. Once that happens, it will take the name Alberto.\n\nAnother disturbance appears to develop over the same region occupied by Potential Tropical Cyclone One this weekend. The overall environment will be conducive for gradual development as it moves northward or northwestward into early next week.

(WAFB) - Today's Forecast: Scattered showers and t-storms are expected today, but rain coverage should be lower than what we experienced on Monday as tropical moisture slowly shifts to our southwest.\n\nHigh temperatures will range from the upper 80s to near 90 degrees in most locations.\n\nA strengthening pressure gradient between the tropical system in the southern Gulf and high pressure to our east will result in breezy conditions. Easterly winds of 10-20 mph can be expected, with higher gusts likely.\n\nRest of This Week\n\nPotential Tropical Cyclone #1 will slowly track toward Mexico, helping to draw most of the tropical moisture south of our area. At the same time, strengthening high pressure should help our forecast trend drier and hotter.\n\nBy Friday and into the weekend, highs will likely reach the mid 90s, with rain chances only running 20% to 30%.\n\nExtended Outlook\n\nOur forecast beyond the weekend will be highly dependent on the potential for another surge of tropical moisture to impact parts of the Gulf Coast. It's too soon to get into specifics with considerable uncertainty in place, but for now, I've got rain chances climbing a bit higher, resulting in high temperature trending a bit closer to normal.\n\nTropical Update\n\nPotential Tropical Cyclone #1 continues to spin over the southern Gulf of Mexico this morning. While conditions are generally favorable for development, it has struggled thus far to develop an inner core, which has kept it loosely organized. Some organization is still expected and it could become Tropical Storm Alberto before reaching Mexico over the next couple of days.\n\nAnd it's a map you don't see very often, but the National Hurricane Center is highlighting the general area that PTC #1 is currently located for potential development of another system by the weekend. Development odds are listed at 20% as of Tuesday morning. There is considerable uncertainty on what, if anything, will develop in this area, so we'll just keep an eye on trends through the week.\n\nFinally, NHC continues to monitor an area east of Florida, but development odds are only listed at 20%.

Sign up to receive it in your inbox.\n\nParts of the Texas coast and northeastern Mexico are bracing for tropical storm conditions on Wednesday, as a potential system churns its way through the Bay of Campeche, the US National Hurricane Center said.\n\nWith winds of 40 miles per hour, the storm is already at tropical storm strength, however it currently lacks the organization to be named Alberto, the first name on this year's Atlantic list, the center said. It will likely reach that threshold Wednesday and its winds will peak at 50 miles per hour (80 kilometers per hour) as it nears Mexico's coastline, where watches are in place.\n\nTropical storm warnings have been posted for the Texas coast between Port O'Connor and the mouth of the Rio Grande, the center said. The storm will likely make landfall in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas early Thursday.\n\n\"It should be noted that regardless of the exact track of the low, we expect this system to have a large area of heavy rains, moderate coastal flooding and tropical-storm-strength winds well north of the center,\" Richard Pasch, a senior hurricane specialist at the center, wrote in a forecast.\n\nIn other weather news:\n\nUS: Heat advisories stretch from Iowa to Maine as temperatures soar into the 90sF (32C) and even to 100F or more in some places. Schools are cutting class time short across Massachusetts, governments are warning residents to prepare and electricity demand is set to soar along with temperatures.\n\nMore than 120 daily high temperatures records may be tied or broken through Sunday, the US Weather Prediction Center said. Readings are forecast to reach 100F in Springfield, Massachusetts on Thursday and Philadelphia on Friday.\n\nNew York's Manhattan is forecast to reach 93F on Thursday and Friday missing out on the most extreme temperatures, but the city will still likely rack up three consecutive days of 90-plus temperatures making this the season's first heatwave.\n\nCalifornia: Wildfire season is starting to get underway. The so-called Post Fire north of Los Angeles, one of 18 active blazes, has burned more than 15,600 acres and is 20% contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.",

It has a well-defined low-pressure center with organized cloud circulation. It typically brings heavy rain but has lower wind speeds.\n\nTropical Storm: A tropical storm has stronger wind speeds than a tropical depression. It is better organized with a more defined center and spiral bands of thunderstorms. Tropical storms can cause significant rainfall, flooding, and wind damage.\n\nWhat is heavy flooding?\n\nHeavy flooding occurs when large volumes of water accumulate in an area, usually as a result of excessive rainfall, rapid snowmelt, storm surges, or dam failures. This water overwhelms the local drainage systems and causes rivers, lakes, or other bodies of water to overflow their banks, leading to widespread inundation of the surrounding land.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, the following types of flooding and types can be seen from these powerful storms.\n\nCauses of Heavy Flooding\n\nTypes of Flooding\n\nHurricane storm tracker: See active storms in the Atlantic.", "source": {"uri": "caller.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Corpus Christi Caller Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "corpus_christi_caller_times@caller.com", "name": "Corpus Christi Caller-Times", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pressure_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low-pressure area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam_failure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dam failure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowmelt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snowmelt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_drain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Storm drain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_surge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Storm surge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Flowers/Fresh_Cut", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Flowers/Fresh Cut", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 35}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/14/PTCN/74095463007-6-am-tropics-gulf-radar-june-14-2024.jpg?auto=webp&crop=998,561,x0,y418&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659946", "eventUri": "eng-9659946", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

The National Hurricane Center Wednesday announced the advent of Alberto, as it has been named. The storm was located about 185 miles (300 km) east of Tampico, Mexico, packing maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph), the Miami-based forecaster said.Alberto is likely to dissipate over Mexico Thursday or Thursday night.\n\nThe storm is expected to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches (about 13 to 25 centimetres) across northeast Mexico into South Texas. Maximum totals around 20 inches (51 centimetres) are possible across the higher terrain of the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas. Flash flooding is likely, and mudslides are possible in some areas, the centre said.\n\nThe US National Weather Service said the main hazard for southern coastal Texas is flooding from excess rain. Eight inches (20 centimetres) of rain or more could fall by Saturday morning. On Wednesday, the NWS said, there is \"a high probability\" of flash flooding in southern coastal Texas. Tornadoes or waterspouts are possible.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts the hurricane season that began June 1 and runs through November 30 is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes. A no-name storm earlier in June dumped more than 20 inches (50 centimetres) of rain on parts of South Florida, stranding numerous motorists on flooded streets and pushing water into some homes in low-lying areas.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The depression is expected to dissipate late Thursday but continue to produce rain over parts of the Texas and Mexico.\n\nOf interest to us in the Southeast is an area of low pressure east and north of the Bahamas. Dry air is hindering development however, it could still try to overcome it and become a tropical depression before arriving in the United States early Friday. The low is moving at good pace to the west-northwest at10 to 15 mph. Regardless of whether the system becomes a depression or not, a high risk for rip currents is in effect from North Carolina to South Florida through at least Friday. Choppy surf is also a concern at the beaches along with scattered showers and storms during the day Friday and into Saturday.\n\nAnother area of low pressure is expected to form over southeastern Mexico and northern Central America Friday.

There's a medium 50% chance of formation through the next 7 days.\n\nDuring the month of June, it's typical to get these \"homegrown\" systems: lows that develop in the Gulf of Mexico or just off the Atlantic coast.

Forecasters with the National Hurricane Center have been watching for it too. Yesterday, the Hurricane Center designated the broad area of low pressure in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico and its associated showers and storms as \"Potential Tropical Cyclone One\".\n\nYeah, it does sound ominous but it's basically the Hurricane Center's way of saying we know there is a weather system there. We believe it will become a tropical cyclone of some kind over the next day or so. And, most importantly, we want to make sure that people don't underestimate the potential damage to property and loss of life that might occur because of this system.\n\nFor a tropical system to earn a name it must have maximum sustained winds of 39 mph or more. There are other characteristics a storm system needs as well. A lot of those have to do with circulation around a central point. Convection (thunderstorms/rain) that is associated with that central point is also a key player in determining a storm's status. That's a very broad interpretation of some of the things forecasters look for when deciding whether or not we need to get on a first-name basis with a weathermaker.\n\nYour insurance company also looks for \"names\" when it comes to tropical weather systems. If you are not familiar with the term Named Storm Deductible with your homeowner's policy, I suggest you get familiar with it today. Hopefully, you'll never experience the great letdown that comes with learning that the coverage you thought you had for your storm recovery is a lot less than what you've been paying for.\n\nBased on information provided by the website Insurica.com a storm only earns a name when it is given by the National Weather Service. And while the NWS doesn't give tropical depressions names according to insurica.com they are still included as \"named systems\" by the insurance industry.\n\nThe other times storms earn a name is when they reach tropical storm status or hurricane status. The named storm deductible also looks at the timing of when a storm earns its name and when the storm is downgraded. Why this is important is the difference in the amount your insurance company will be covering.\n\nIn most cases, a standard deductible for homeowners insurance is a fixed rate. You know up front that if your home is damaged in a storm without a name just how much out of pocket you'll be paying. But, if that storm has a name your deductible could be as much as 10% of your home's value. It's all based on what your policy states about named storms.\n\nFor example, if your home's roof is damaged by hail you might pay the standard deductible listed in your policy. But if your roof is damaged by hail from a storm caused by a named tropical system you might be out of pocket up to 10% of your home's value. That's a heck of a lot more than $500 or $1,000 deductibles that a homeowner's policy can have.\n\nWe looked at a lot of articles on the subject online and couldn't find a definitive answer. But since the law usually doesn't take \"potential\" into consideration you'd think that a potential tropical cyclone wouldn't meet the \"naming\" criteria for a named storm deductible. But, I bet your insurance agents have already created a loophole in your policy to avoid paying out your claim.\n\nOur advice is to call your agent or policyholder today and get clarification. Because the term \"potential tropical cyclone\" is a designation by the National Weather Service. That could trigger that higher deductible.\n\nBased on the expected veracity of the tropical season for 2024, my guess is we will see a few more \"potential tropical cyclones\" before the end of November when the Hurricane Season comes to an end.", "source": {"uri": "kpel965.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KPEL 96.5"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bruce_mikells@kpel965.com", "name": "Bruce Mikells", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pressure_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Low-pressure area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maximum sustained wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Convection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hail"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Insurance", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/33/files/2020/04/Storm-Damage-Vernon-Parish-Sheriffs-Office.png?w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659946", "eventUri": "eng-9659946", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

Flooding rain, coastal flooding, gusty winds, high surf, rip currents and isolated tornadoes are threats in Texas. Flooding rain and mudslides are also likely in parts of Mexico.\n\nWe have another question from Michael Hill of Crowley, who has sent in three good questions now. Thank you so much Michael for sending them.\n\nThis time, he wants to know: What is the difference between hurricanes, typhoons, and tropical cyclones? That is a good question.\n\nWhat better time to answer this than with our very first tropical storm forming in the Gulf.\n\nLet's take a trip around the globe.\n\nWe'll start in the Atlantic Ocean. We have tropical storms and hurricanes, which are rated on a scale of Category 1 to Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. We also use this scale for the Pacific Ocean from off the coast of Mexico all the way near Hawaii.\n\nOnce you get past Hawaii, storms are called typhoons and super typhoons, instead of hurricanes. Japan and Hawaiian meteorologists monitor these waters.\n\nLet's go further into the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean. Tropical storms also impact the southern hemisphere near Australia, but spin the opposite direction, and are called tropical cyclones and severe tropical cyclones, similar to off the coast of Madagascar near Africa. In India, they are known as cyclonic storms. The strongest storms here are known as extremely severe tropical cyclones.\n\nFinally, the Southern Atlantic. Storms here are very rare, thanks to unfavorable conditions, with only one storm ever reaching Category 2 strength. But if they do form, they are called tropical cyclones.\n\nAll of these storms form the exact same way, feeding off warm tropical waters just like our hurricanes here at home.\n\nIt really all depends

A tropical storm warning is now in place in parts of Mexico and over the US border in Texas and the British Foreign Office has issued advice.\n\nA potential cyclone is currently heading towards the coast of Tamaulipas and is forecast to become a tropical storm by Wednesday, June 19. The extreme weather is then due to hit land on Thursday morning.\n\nHeavy rain and high winds are expected in the north-east of Mexico and people in the area have also been warned of the possibility of flooding and landslides in some areas. The region has been placed on alert ahead of what could be this year's first named tropical storm.\n\nRead more: Travel warning issued to UK tourists flying from Manchester Airport\n\nThe UK Foreign Office issued a warning to travellers on Tuesday, June 18, which reads: \"Potential Tropical Cyclone One is currently heading towards the coast of Tamaulipas and is due to make landfall on the morning of Thursday, June 20. It is currently forecast to become a tropical storm by Wednesday, June 19.\n\n\"A tropical storm warning is now in place along the coast of Tamaulipas state. High winds, heavy rainfall and coastal flooding are expected in north-eastern Mexico, with the possibility of flooding and landslides in some areas.\"\n\nThe Foreign Office currently advises against all but essential travel to the state of Tamaulipas, apart from the border crossing at Nuevo Laredo accessed by federal toll road 85D from Monterrey and federal highways 80, 81 and 85 between Tampico, Ciudad de Victoria and Magueyes, and the entire area of Tamaulipas south of these highways.\n\nMexico's hurricane season normally runs from June to November and can affect the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. Tropical storms and hurricanes cause floods, landslides and disruption to local services, including transport networks.\n\nTourists are advised to monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Center and follow the advice of local authorities and your tour operator. In extreme cases, you may be ordered to evacuate.\n\nIn 2023, Hurricane Otis hit the south coast near Acapulco. The category five hurricane seriously damaged infrastructure along the coast in Acapulco and between Zihuatenejo and Punta Maldonado.\n\nTravel to many parts of Mexico is considered generally safe, however the Foreign Office does advice against all but essential travel to certain areas including the city of Tijuana and the states of Chihuahua, Sinaloa, Tamaulipas, Zacatecas, the areas of Guanajuato south-west of road 45D, Michoac\u00e1n and the areas of Jalisco south and south-west of Lake Chapala to the border with the state of Colima.

It has a high (80 percent) chance of formation during the next 48 hours and the next 7 days.\n\nThe disturbance is quite large with tropical-storm-force winds extending outward up to 290 miles (465 km) to the northeast of the center.\n\nRAINFALL: Potential Tropical Cyclone One is expected to produce rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches across northeast Mexico into South Texas, with maximum totals of 15 inches possible. This rainfall will likely produce flash and urban flooding along with new and renewed river flooding. Mudslides are also possible in areas of higher terrain across northeast Mexico.\n\nSTORM SURGE: The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.

Highway 1 between Port Fouchon and Grand Isle could flood during high tide Thursday morning.\n\nAlberto, which is bringing strong winds, heavy rainfall and some flooding along the coasts of Texas and Mexico, is expected to make landfall in northern Mexico on Thursday.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Wednesday afternoon that Alberto was located about 170 miles east of Tampico, Mexico, and about 305 miles south-southeast of Brownsville, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph).

Through the weekend we will see more sunshine and less rain.\n\nToday & Tonight: Elevated winds from the east early Wednesday will add a refreshing feel to the air. Conditions are not quite as muggy to start off the day as the highest atmospheric moisture amounts are now to the west of our area. Temperatures early Wednesday start off in the low to mid 70's and as we will see more sunshine today, it will help the region warm back into the low-90's this afternoon. Though we are trending drier, isolated shower activity should still be expected this afternoon, about 30% coverage anticipated for afternoon storms. Winds will remain quite breezy all day, anywhere between 15-25 mph.\n\nSt. James and Assumption parishes have been highlighted in a Wind Advisory until 7pm Wednesday evening.\n\nOvernight, winds will begin to die down a bit and with partly cloudy conditions, temperatures will fall back into the middle 70's by daybreak Thursday.\n\nUp Next: We will see a sunnier and drier pattern begin Thursday and stick around through the weekend. With less clouds and rain, temperatures will creep up to slightly above average temperatures each afternoon, into the middle and possible upper-90's for some. There will still be enough moisture present in the air to make things feel a bit warmer and allow for typical summertime pop-up storms to develop each day.\n\nThe Tropics: Potential Tropical Cyclone One is still ongoing in the Bay of Campeche. The \"Potential Tropical Cyclone\" term is a designation from the National Hurricane Center for systems that have yet to become tropical in nature, but will likely do so and make landfall within 24 hours. No direct impacts are anticipated for south Louisiana, but Tropical Storm Warnings are in effect for portions of northern Mexico and southern Texas. This disturbance will likely become a tropical storm by Wednesday. Once that happens, it will take the name Alberto.\n\nAnother disturbance appears to develop over the same region occupied by Potential Tropical Cyclone One this weekend. The overall environment will be conducive for gradual development as it moves northward or northwestward into early next week. For now, that region has a low chance of tropical development this weekend and early next week.\n\nThe Storm Station is also keeping an eye on an area of showers and storms located several hundred miles east of the Bahamas. There is a small chance of gradual development of this system as it drifts westward toward the Southeast Coast.

However, this morning's high tide could still be a problem in vulnerable areas of coastal Texas.\n\nThe persistent onshore wind from a combination of Alberto and the heat-dome high-pressure system to the north will still cause the tide to be higher than normal around the western half of the Gulf. The air is being squeezed between the large, tropical low-pressure system and the extra-strong heat dome. Like squeezing a toothpaste tube, the air speeds up between two weather systems.\n\nAlberto's strongest spiral band with the heaviest rain has moved well inland. Dangerous flash flooding is still possible in the Mexican mountains, where up to 20 inches of rain might fall. In Texas, periodic tropical downpours are still possible today, but nothing sustained. The weather should be much better by tomorrow.\n\nAlberto developed from a combination of a broad low-pressure system that often develops over Central America in June called the Central American Gyre (in this context, a gyre is a large-diameter circular system) and a weak disturbance from the Caribbean. That scenario is forecast to repeat itself, more or less, over the weekend when another Caribbean disturbance will be flung toward the Gulf with an opportunity to organize.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center now has the chance of at least a tropical depression forming out of Disturbance #2 in the medium range. We'll watch over the weekend to see what develops, but at least a depression is increasingly likely. Whatever form the system takes, high pressure is forecast to hold sway across the Southeast, blocking it from moving very far north.\n\nThe current forecasts call for the system to be less intense than Alberto with less impact on South Texas. It's never smart, however, to count on forecasts for a system that hasn't yet developed. On the current schedule, the disturbance will move into the southern Gulf on Saturday where it will have an opportunity to organize. If blocking high pressure moves into place across the southeastern U.S. as forecast, it would track relatively quickly into Mexico by about Monday. We'll see.\n\nA small low-pressure system has developed offshore of the Bahamas from the remnants of the front that was part of the big deluge in South Florida the week before last. It's officially being dubbed Invest 92L because the Hurricane Center is \"investigating\" it. There is high confidence that the system will track toward the Southeast coast, arriving about Friday.\n\nA defined swirl is obvious from satellites, but the moisture and thunderstorms are not organized around it, so it doesn't qualify to be a tropical depression. The National Hurricane Center is giving the system a decent chance of attaining some organization today before it reaches the coast tonight or tomorrow. Whether it officially becomes a depression or not, gusty winds and a moisture surge are likely. People near the North Florida, Georgia, and Carolina coasts should stay informed. And mariners beware.\n\nAfter these systems move inland, nothing seems to be in the offing.", "source": {"uri": "foxweather.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Weather"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bryan_norcross@foxweather.com", "name": "Bryan Norcross", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pressure_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Low-pressure area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Alberto_(1994)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical Storm Alberto (1994)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_scales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone scales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-pressure_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High-pressure area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainband", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rainband"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_gyre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ocean gyre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flash flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(meteorology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Block (meteorology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Lindenmayer_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Lindenmayer Systems", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 18}], "image": "https://images.foxweather.com/static.foxweather.com/www.foxweather.com/content/uploads/2023/06/1024/512/hurricane_hq.png?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659946", "eventUri": "eng-9659946", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Louisiana has become the first state to require that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every public school classroom, the latest move from a GOP-dominated Legislature pushing a conservative agenda under a new governor.\n\nThe legislation that Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed into law on Wednesday requires a poster-sized display of the Ten Commandments in \"large, easily readable font\" in all public classrooms, from kindergarten to state-funded universities.\n\nOpponents questioned the law's constitutionality and vowed to challenge it in court. Proponents said the the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance. In the language of the law, the Ten Commandments are \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nThe posters, which will be paired with a four-paragraph \"context statement\" describing how the Ten Commandments \"were a prominent part of American public education for almost three centuries,\" must be in place in classrooms by the start of 2025.\n\nUnder the law, state funds will not be used to implement the mandate. The posters would be paid for through donations.\n\nNew Mexico wildfire claims second life, while rain offers hope of relief\n\nROSWELL, N.M. (AP) -- Heavy rain and hail fell Wednesday around an evacuated village in New Mexico threatened by wildfires that have killed at least two people and damaged more than 1,400 structures, offering the hope of some assistance for firefighters but adding the threat of high winds and flash floods.\n\nAir tankers dropped water and red retardant earlier on the pair of fires growing in a mountainous part of the state where earlier in the week residents of the village of Ruidoso were forced to flee the larger of the two blazes with little notice.\n\nNew Mexico State Police spokesman Wilson Silver said Wednesday that officers discovered the skeletal remains of an unidentified second person in the driver seat of a burned vehicle. It's the second confirmed death in the blazes. The first fire victim was a badly burned 60-year-old man found by the side of the road near the popular Swiss Chalet Inn in Ruidoso.\n\nWeather patterns were shifting Wednesday with moisture arriving from the Gulf of Mexico, said Bladen Breitreiter of the National Weather Service office in Albuquerque.\n\n\"It will be a challenging situation going into the late afternoon and evening,\" said Breitreiter, who has been an incident meteorologist at past wildfires. \"The potential for scattered to isolated thunderstorms could help, but it depends on where they hit. If the rain misses the fires, downward winds could cause problems for firefighters on the ground.\"\n\nTropical Storm Alberto forms in southwest Gulf, 1st named storm of the hurricane season\n\nTAMPICO, Mexico (AP) -- Tropical Storm Alberto formed on Wednesday in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico, the first named storm of what is forecast to be a busy hurricane season.\n\nAlberto, which is bringing strong winds, heavy rainfall and some flooding along the coasts of Texas and Mexico, is expected to make landfall in northern Mexico on Thursday.\n\n\"The heavy rainfall and the water, as usual, is the biggest story in tropical storms,\" said Michael Brennan, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center said Wednesday afternoon that Alberto was located about 150 miles (240 kilometers) east of Tampico, Mexico, and about 320 miles (515 kilometers) south-southeast of Brownsville, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph). The storm is moving west-southwest at 9 miles per hour.\n\nThe center of the storm was expected to reach the northeastern coast of Mexico south of the mouth of the Rio Grande by Thursday morning.\n\nRifts seem to appear between Israel's political and military leadership over conduct of the Gaza war\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli army's chief spokesman on Wednesday appeared to question the stated goal of destroying the Hamas militant group in Gaza in a rare public rift between the country's political and military leadership.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted Israel will pursue the fight against Hamas, the group running the besieged Gaza Strip, until its military and governing capabilities in the Palestinian territory are eliminated. But with the war now in its ninth month, frustration has been mounting with no clear end or postwar plan in sight.\n\n\"This business of destroying Hamas, making Hamas disappear -- it's simply throwing sand in the eyes of the public,\" Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the military spokesperson, told Israel's Channel 13 TV. \"Hamas is an idea, Hamas is a party. It's rooted in the hearts of the people -- whoever thinks we can eliminate Hamas is wrong.\"\n\nNetanyahu's office responded by saying that the country's security Cabinet, chaired by the prime minister, \"has defined the destruction of Hamas' military and governing capabilities as one of the goals of the war. The Israeli military, of course, is committed to this.\"\n\nThe military quickly issued a clarification, saying it was \"committed to achieving the goals of the war as defined by the Cabinet\" and that it has been working on this \"throughout the war, day and night, and will continue to do so.\"\n\nScorching temperatures, humidity making life miserable for millions from Midwest to Maine\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- A blistering heat wave Wednesday extended from the Midwest to New England, leaving millions of people sweltering through the Juneteenth holiday, including in places like northern Maine where they rarely experience such conditions this early in the year.\n\nThe city of Caribou, Maine, just 10 miles from the Canadian border, saw a record 103 degrees (39.4 C) on the heat index, which combines heat and humidity. The region was under a heat advisory until Wednesday evening and temperatures in Caribou were hotter than Miami: 94 degrees (34.4 C) compared with 89 (31.6 C), according to the National Weather Service.\n\nSeveral residents said they were used to temperatures in the 70s and 80s in June and rarely this humid.\n\n\"I've seen this maybe one time before where it's been this hot in June,\" said Hannah Embelton, 22, a server at an ice cream store in Caribou, adding that customers were staying away from the soft serve options because they melt took quickly.\n\n\"We usually never get the brunt of all this heat and humidity because we are so north. Just how hot it is, that is all everyone is talking about,\" she added.\n\nWhat's known, and not known, about the partnership agreement signed by Russia and North Korea\n\nBoth Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un say the strategic partnership they signed Wednesday is a breakthrough. But neither side has released the text of the agreement that resulted from their summit in Pyongyang, and its consequences for the near and long terms are uncertain.\n\nRelations between sprawling Russia and small, isolated North Korea -- both of them nuclear powers -- have warmed significantly in recent years amid Russia's growing acrimony with the West over the invasion of Ukraine and suppression of all domestic opposition.\n\nThe new agreement could bring them even closer, while also posing new challenges to the international community.\n\nWhat's in the new partnership, according to Kim and Putin:\n\nPutin told a briefing after the signing that \"the comprehensive partnership agreement provides, among other things, for the provision of mutual assistance in the event of aggression against one of the parties to this document.\"\n\nColombian family's genes offer new clue to delaying onset of Alzheimer's\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists studying a family plagued by early-in-life Alzheimer's found some carry a genetic oddity that delays their initial symptoms by five years.\n\nThe finding points to novel ways of fighting the mind-robbing disease - if researchers can unravel how a single copy of that very rare gene variant offers at least a little protection.\n\n\"It opens new avenues,\" said neuropsychologist Yakeel Quiroz of Massachusetts General Hospital, who helped lead the study published Wednesday. \"There are definitely opportunities to copy or mimic the effects.\"\n\nThe first hint of this genetic protection came a few years ago. Researchers were studying a huge family in Colombia that shares a devastating inherited form of Alzheimer's when they discovered one woman who escaped her genetic fate. Aliria Piedrahita de Villegas should have developed Alzheimer's symptoms in her 40s but instead made it to her 70s before suffering even mild cognitive trouble.\n\nThe big clue: She also harbored something incredibly rare, two copies of an unrelated gene named APOE3 that had a mutation dubbed Christchurch. That odd gene pair appeared to shield her, staving off her genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's.\n\nImmigrant families rejoice over Biden's expansive move toward citizenship, while some are left out\n\nHOUSTON (AP) -- Hundreds of thousands of immigrants had reason to rejoice when President Joe Biden unveiled a highly expansive plan to extend legal status to spouses of U.S. citizens but, inevitably, some were left out.\n\nClaudia Z\u00faniga, 35, married in 2017, or 10 years after her husband came to the United States. He moved to Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, after they wed, knowing that, by law, he had to live outside the country for years to gain legal status. \"Our lives took a 180-degree turn,\" she said.\n\nBiden announced Tuesday that his administration will, in coming months, allow U.S. citizens' spouses without legal status to apply for permanent residency and eventually citizenship without having to first depart the country for up to 10 years. About 500,000 immigrants may benefit, according to senior administration officials.\n\nTo qualify, an immigrant must have lived in the United States for 10 years and be married to a U.S. citizen, both as of Monday. Z\u00faniga's husband is ineligible because he wasn't in the United States.\n\n\"Imagine, it would be a dream come true,\" said Z\u00faniga, who works part time in her father's transportation business in Houston. \"My husband could be with us. We could focus on the well-being of our children.\"\n\nA US aircraft carrier and its crew have fought Houthi attacks for months. How long can it last?\n\nABOARD THE USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER IN THE RED SEA (AP) -- The combat markings emblazoned on the F/A-18 fighter jet tell the story: 15 missiles and six drones, painted in black just below the cockpit windshield.\n\nAs the jet sits on the deck of the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, its markings illuminate the enemy targets that it's destroyed in recent months and underscore the intensity of the fight to protect commercial shipping from persistent missile and drone attacks by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\nBut they also hint at the fatigue setting in, as the carrier, its strike group and about 7,000 sailors close in on their ninth month waging the most intense running sea battle since World War II. That raises difficult questions about what comes next as U.S. military and defense leaders wrangle over how they will replicate the carrier's combat power if the ship returns home to Norfolk, Virginia.\n\nAlready, the carrier's deployment has been extended twice, and sailors post dark memes around the ship about only getting one short break during their steadily growing tour. Some worry they could be ordered to stay out even longer as the campaign drags on to protect global trade in the vital Red Sea corridor.\n\nAt the Pentagon, leaders are wrestling with what has become a thorny but familiar debate. Do they bow to Navy pressure to bring the Eisenhower and the other three warships in its strike group home or heed U.S. Central Command's plea to keep them there longer? And if they bring them home -- what can replace them?\n\nOn Juneteenth, monument dedicated in Alabama to those who endured slavery\n\nMONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Thousands of surnames grace the towering monument, representing the more than 4 million enslaved people who were freed after the Civil War.\n\nThe Equal Justice Initiative, a criminal justice reform nonprofit, invoked the Juneteenth holiday -- the day that commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. -- on Wednesday as it dedicated its National Monument to Freedom.\n\nThe monument, which honors the people who endured and survived slavery, is the centerpiece of the new Freedom Monument Sculpture Park in Montgomery, Alabama, where art and historical artifacts tell the story of enslaved people in the United States.\n\nDuring the dedication ceremony, Equal Justice Initiative founder Bryan Stevenson recounted how enslaved people endured unspeakable horrors, but also left a legacy of perseverance and strength.\n\n\"Enslaved people in this country did something remarkable that we need to acknowledge, that we need to recognize and that we need to celebrate. Enslaved people resisted. Enslaved people were resilient. Enslaved people found ways to make a way,\" Stevenson said.", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But whether or not a cyclone is formed will likely have little effect on the storm's impact on Southeast Texas as the center of the system is forecasted to make landfall in Mexico, according to a National Weather Service webinar on Tuesday.\n\nThe bulk of the heavier rain should be past southeast Texas by Thursday morning, according to NWS, which is predicting a level three risk for flash flooding.\n\n\"One of the things to keep in mind is that the city of Houston streets is one of our primary drainage components, Randy Macchi, Houston Public Works chief operating officer said. \"They're designed primarily to help water flow and drain out of the way.\"\n\nMacchi said residents should keep an eye on storm drainage inlets on streets and report any that are not clear. He said that the department has already begun the process of converting Houston Public Works vehicles to help assist police and fire for potential high water rescues.\n\n\"If you find that you live in areas where there are open ditches, and there is debris in those ditches, please call 311 to elevate those requests as quickly as possible so that we can in partnership with solid waste make sure that we're able to get folks out there,\" he said.\n\nIn Galveston County, lifeguard towers were relocated to higher ground in anticipation of coastal flooding this week. Red flags are flying across the city's beaches, warning of strong currents and heavier winds.\n\nGalveston County Health District is urging people to avoid swimming in Galveston Bay until the threat of high rip currents reduces. There is an active risk of dangerous swimming conditions near jetties and piers and hazardous marine conditions throughout the week.\n\nA wind advisory is in effect through Thursday morning, according to the health district.\n\n\"We anticipate street flooding,\" Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pe\u00f1a said at the press conference on Monday. \"That is always a concern. If you cannot see the road, stay off those streets.

Storm-force winds, which stretch more than 400 miles (640km) from the storm's center, are already affecting southern Texas.\n\nAs much of the US experiences anomalous weather - intense heat in the north-east and northern midwest, epic rains in Miami, fires in New Mexico and California, a winter storm warning in Montana - the tropical system in the gulf is forecast to bring intense downpours to southern Louisiana and the central and southern areas of Texas.\n\nThe National Weather Service warned in an update on Wednesday morning that the gulf system is becoming better defined, the storm activity \"remains rather meager\" and the atmospheric disturbance \"still does not meet the requirements of a tropical cyclone\".\n\nBill Nye, the respected \"science guy\", told CNN that the events meant that \"we need to contain our use of fossil fuels, putting carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere, and we need to do it as soon as we can\".\n\nNye said there had not been a Pearl Harbor-level climate change event \"because it's happening in slow motion ... New research indicates there is not a tipping point or point of no return - it's just things getting worse and worse.\"\n\nThe continental heatwave is expected to intensify in the north-east on Wednesday, bringing 95F (35C) heat to Detroit and 92F (33C) temperatures to Buffalo, where the average for this time of year is 75F (24C). Philadelphia is expected to stay above 90F for the next week. Pittsburgh hit 94F on Tuesday.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued its first-ever excessive heat warning for Caribou, Maine, alerting to \"dangerously hot conditions with heat index values up to 106[F] expected\" on Wednesday.\n\nIn New Mexico, where wildfires ignited on Mescalero Apache land, the village of Ruiduso, with 8,000 residents, was evacuated. Approximately 1,400 structures have been lost, local officials said in an update.\n\nThe wildfire, known as the South Fork fire, has burned across 15,276 acres (6,200 hectares) and was 0% contained as of early Tuesday.\n\n\"We knew that the fire was there and we knew it was bad. We could see it in the distance but it kept on growing closer and closer,\" Kay Bymark, 79, told CNN. \"The smoke was there and you could see it in the air\".\n\nForecasters said that spotty thunderstorm activity could ease conditions in the region. All told, extreme weather now stretches from coast to coast, with more than 80 million people are under heat alerts, according to the National Weather Service.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com",

We'll see some spotty storms continuing to move in from the coast through this evening as the first of the tropical rain bands moves closer to the coast.\n\nFlood Watch:\n\nFlood Watch issued for Washington, Colorado, Austin, Waller, Harris, Chambers, Wharton, Fort Bend, Jackson, Matagorda, Brazoria and Galveston counties until 1 a.m. Thursday.\n\nTropical Outlook:\n\nPotential Tropical Storm #1 has formed and will likely become Tropical Storm Alberto sometime on Tuesday in the Bay of Campeche.\n\nHeavy waves of rain and coastal flooding will become the biggest impacts for most of SE Texas.\n\nThe center of the storm will stay to the south, making landfall in Mexico. Regardless of formation, our impacts are the same. We will see gusty winds to 30mph, rough seas, high rip currents and a flood threat. We can expect to see heavy constant rainfall starting late Tuesday and lasting through early Thursday.\n\nWhat will SE Texas see:\n\nTuesday brings more widespread bands of showers and storms. Tuesday morning starts off with low rain chances, then activity picks up in the afternoon and evening.\n\nThe slow moving nature of the bands will lead to a risk of flooding. The risk is moderate (level 3 out of 4), so you need to take it serious. Street flooding is possible and we'll have to watch out for flash flooding into Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nTuesday night through Wednesday evening more widespread tropical downpours move through. Thursday morning the rain begins to shift southwest, bringing some dry time back to SE Texas.\n\nRain totals through Thursday add up to 6 to 8 inches along the coast and 4 to 6 inches for Harris and Fort Bend counties. Forecast accumulations could top 10''.\n\n10-Day Forecast:\n\nEarly week's tropical downpours will keep temperatures in the 80s. Rain chances will drop over the weekend but we stay in a wet pattern along the Gulf Coast next week.\n\nCheck interactive radarCheck the latest weather alertsShare your weather pictures and

But it happens.\n\nThe first named stormed of the young hurricane season is about to hit Texas. Weather watchers have been tracking Tropical Storm Alberto the past few days while it was a mere disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nBut why do storms get names?\n\nEvery six years or so, The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration releases a list of names that they will use to name hurricanes. This helps clarify any confusion when multiple storms form at the same time. And monikers for the deadliest events, such as Katrina and Sandy, are retired. Otherwise, the list is recycled.\n\nNOAA predicts an 85% chance of an above normal hurricane season for the Atlantic Ocean this year.\n\n\"NOAA is forecasting a range of 17 to 25 total named storms (winds of 39 mph or higher). Of those, eight to 13 are forecast to become hurricanes (winds of 74 mph or higher),\" according to its website.\n\nThey also predict four to seven hurricanes that will be category 3 or worse.\n\nThe last hurricane that hit Texas was Nicholas in 2021. Its storm surge was only a category 1, meaning minimal damage happened. The most recent hurricane to hit the United States was Lee in September 2023 -- another category 1 .\n\nA hurricane is when a storm's wind speeds reach up to 74 mph or higher, according to the National Weather Service. Categories are based on the maximum wind strength and the higher the category, the worse the damage. Hurricane season typically occurs from June 1 to Nov. 30.\n\nIt is likely that 2024 will bring another hurricane to the U.S., possibly even Texas.

It has associated a broad circulation of clouds and storms that cover the entire area of the gulf, the Mexican territory, and the western Caribbean Sea, including western Cuba. It is moving west-northwest at a speed of 13 kilometers per hour. The environmental conditions where this system is located are slightly favorable for its development, so it may become a tropical depression before entering Mexican territory.\n\nAnother area of low pressure is located in the sea's northeast of the Bahamas, over the Atlantic Ocean, which has associated some areas of disorganized storms. The atmospheric conditions remain unfavorable for this system to have any tropical development in the coming days as it moves west or west-northwest.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto continues with very little variation over the western Gulf of Mexico, near the eastern coast of Mexican territory. This system maintains maximum sustained winds of 65 kilometers per hour and a minimum central pressure of 995 millibars.\n\nThe central region of Alberto at six this afternoon was estimated at 21.8 degrees north latitude and 95.6 degrees west longitude, a position that places it about 240 kilometers east of Tampico, Mexico. It is moving with a course close to west-southwest at a rate of 15 kilometers per hour.\n\nIn the next 12 to 24 hours, Tropical Storm Alberto is expected to maintain a similar speed, turning its trajectory again to the west, gaining somewhat more in organization before entering Mexican territory in the early morning. Once over land, it will experience rapid weakening.\n\nHavana is on the periphery of the cyclonic circulation in the Gulf of Mexico, which imposes a humid flow from the south to the lower levels of the troposphere. During the next few days, it will dawn partially cloudy. From the end of the morning, it will become cloudy with some showers, rains, and thunderstorms, which will increase in the afternoon hours.\n\nThe winds will be mainly from the southeast to east with speeds between 15 and 30 kilometers per hour. The relative humidity will range from 80% to 100%. The highs will be between 31 and 32\u00baC (88 and 90 F) and the lows between 23 and 25\u00baC (73 and 77 F). The sea surface temperature will be 28\u00baC (82 F).\n\nIn the rest of the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico area, no tropical cyclonic development is expected in the next 12 to 24 hours.", "source": {"uri": "havanatimes.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Havana Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "circles_robinson@havanatimes.org", "name": "Circles Robinson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pressure_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Low-pressure area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(unit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bar (unit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclogenesis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclogenesis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric pressure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maximum sustained wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sea surface temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Troposphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Havana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Havana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://havanatimes.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/448810672_1263470031494635_2413928045867605987_n.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659946", "eventUri": "eng-9659946", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

The other experts were David Smith, senior director of natural hazard science, and product managers Tal Paschal, Brian Sullivan and Jesse Delmas.\n\nRelated: Potent Hurricane Weather Pattern Continues to Take Shape, Forecaster Says\n\nThe climate has moved out of the El Ni\u00f1o phase and into an ENSO neutral phase (the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation transition state between warm and cool phases). By late summer, we're expected to go into a La Ni\u00f1a phase.\n\nBy all accounts, the hurricane season continues to shape up to be a big one.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration last month forecast an 85% chance of an above-average Atlantic hurricane season, with up to 25 named storms. Colorado State University's tropical meteorology project in April forecast 23 named storms, 11 hurricanes and five major hurricanes.\n\nAccuWeather meteorologists in March forecast an above-average Atlantic hurricane season with as many as 20 to 25 named storms.\n\nRelated: Catastrophe Bond Sales Soar as Markets Brace for Unusually Active Hurricane Season\n\nGlobal insurer Allianz Commercial recently released its annual risk article on the season's outlook, which calls out the good fortune in 2023. That was an above-average season, though only eight storms made landfall. Most of the storms, referred to as \"fish storms,\" stayed at sea.\n\nThe Allianz report summarizes the predicted number of tropical storm events for 2024 by six organizations. All of the forecasts indicate a season ahead to watch.\n\nThe CoreLogic webinar on Tuesday referenced a report on hurricane risk that points to more than 32.7 million residential properties at risk of moderate or severe damage sustained from hurricane-force winds from Texas to Maine. The number of at-risk homes in CoreLogic's 2024 Hurricane Risk Report equates to a combined reconstruction cost of $10.8 trillion.\n\nSmith detailed the 2024 hurricane season outlook and offered an assessment of the midpoint of each of the ranges of the forecasts that have so far come out.\n\n\"One theme here is that all the outlooks are really showing a highly active season,\" he said. \"Certainly at some level this is the most active forecast that NOAA has ever made, really showing the most elevated levels of activity in this forecast, and certainly well above normal with the ranges.\"\n\nOf the 17 to 25 named storms in NOAA's outlook, eight to 13 are likely to become hurricanes, and four to seven of those are likely to become major hurricanes, Smith noted.\n\nSmith said the data so far reflects weather developments ahead of other seasons that turned out to be big ones, putting this season's potential on par with seasons like those including 1995 and 2005, \"which you may remember, were very, very active, and also in terms of loss (were) very, very dramatic years.\" Forecasts for 2024, he added, are for \"way above normal, and if they're at the top end of the ranges, it's going to be really up there along with some of the most significant seasons.\"\n\nAccording to Weather Underground, 2005's 28 named storms and 1995's 19 named storms are on the list of the seasons with the most named storms.

In addition, the camps and shelters are supplied to deal with emergencies caused by the rains,\" Guatemalan President Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo said before the heavy rainfall.\n\nPhotos and videos from the affected region showed dozens of landslides that have destroyed homes and blocked roadways.\n\nWHAT IS A CENTAL AMERICAN GYRE?\n\nNearly every hurricane season, the FOX Forecast Center monitors a broad area of low pressure in the western Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, known as a gyre.\n\nDuring the early and latter parts of the hurricane season, the area is notorious for aiding in the development of tropical disturbances in the eastern Pacific, Bay of Campeche or western Caribbean Sea.\n\nDuring the current gyre's evolution, the National Hurricane Center has warned about the possibility of at least three different cyclones, with what is known as Potential Tropical Cyclone One, having the highest potential for development.\n\nA PTC is a designation used by the National Hurricane Center to indicate a disturbance that is not yet a tropical cyclone but has the potential to develop into one over the next 48 hours and threaten land.\n\nPOTENTIAL TROPICAL CYCLONE 1 PROMPTS TROPICAL STORM WARNING ALONG TEXAS GULF COAST\n\nPTC One is expected to produce heavy rainfall and gusty winds from Texas into Mexico during the next few days.\n\nIf the disturbance gains a low-level circulation, the FOX Forecast Center says sustained winds would meet the threshold for the NHC to declare the system a tropical storm.\n\nThe forecast for the Texas coastline and Mexico would not change, as both a PTC and a tropical storm deliver similar impacts.\n\nIf the disturbance were to gain a name, it would be known as Alberto and be the Atlantic basin's first cyclone of the year.", "source": {"uri": "foxweather.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Weather"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_wulfeck@foxweather.com", "name": "Andrew Wulfeck", "type": "author", "isAgency":

With outer bands reaching more than 400 miles from its center, Alberto's impacts are already being felt in northeastern Mexico and southern Texas, where heavy rains, coastal flooding and tropical storm-force winds are wreaking havoc. Dangerous flash flooding and storm surge are likely to inundate coastal communities in these areas, as well as southern Louisiana.\n\nFires and floods create crisis in New Mexico: Within 24 hours, two fires raging in southern New Mexico have killed at least two people, damaged 1,400 structures and forced the evacuation of more than 8,000 residents. The state's governor has requested federal disaster assistance and called the crisis \"one of the most devastating fires in New Mexico's history.\" To make matters worse, thunderstorms in the area have triggered dangerous flooding - and more rain is on the way Thursday.\n\nCalifornia firefighters brace for 100-degree heat: Crews working to reign in the 19,000-acre Sites Fire in California may have to contend with 100-degree temperatures over the coming days as a heat advisory has been issued for central California. Not only does the heat threaten to feed the flames, but it also poses significant health risks for firefighters working under the sun.\n\nHeat wave broils the Northeast: A long-lasting heat wave has been baking the Midwest, Great Lakes and Northeast under 90-degree temperatures - reaching more than 20 degrees above normal in some places. More than 15 daily high temperature records were broken on Wednesday. The heat wave is expected to peak in the Great Lakes and New England on Thursday but will continue for several more days in many areas.

Have your cell phone warn you when there is going to be a storm", "body": "It's official, the first tropical cyclone of the season has arrived, which will cause rains in the northeast, east, southeast and even in central Mexico. It's about the Tropical Storm Alberto. After spending a couple of days as a potential temporary cyclone one over the Gulf of Mexico, the National Weather Service has declared the formation of this tropical storm.\n\nTropical Storm Alberto is expected to make landfall during the early hours of Thursday morning. According to the forecast, the cyclone will cause Torrential rains that could be accompanied by electric shocks and possibly the fall of hail, as reported by our colleagues from Xataka Mexicoeither. It is important to take precautions against storms and blizzards.\n\nIt is important to take precautions, as in some areas there could also be a risk of flooding.\n\nIf you wish find out as soon as possible that it is going to rainor a storm has started, you can set an alarm on your Android smartphone by following one of the two methods below:\n\nThe Rain Alarm application is available directly on the Google Play Store from this linkand it does just what its name says: it will warn you when a storm is approaching your location.\n\nRain alarm allows you to set a notification on your smartphone when a storm is approaching. In addition, it also allows you to know the weather forecast. The app offers more functions and eliminates advertising if we pay a subscription, but we can set an alarm with the free version.\n\nOnce you install the application and indicate your location, try to go to the settings menu and configure the data to be expressed in Celsius and kilometers per hour, among other preferences.\n\nIFTTT (If This Then That, or \"If this, then that\") is a tool that, among many other functions, allows us to configure alarms and notifications based on different parameters.\n\nIn this case we will create an alarm so that the app tells us if it is raining:\n\nOnce the process is complete, the alarm will have been created. Yes, this tells us if it has already started to rain, not if it is going to rain, but when choosing the location we can select an area close to our frequent location to estimate that if it has already started to rain there, it will also soon rain where we are.\n\nCover image | National Meteorological Service of Mexico (with edition)", "source": {"uri": "gearrice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gearrice"}, "authors": [{"uri": "olivia_hudson@gearrice.com", "name": "Olivia Hudson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Alberto_(1994)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical Storm Alberto (1994)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blizzard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blizzard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google Play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celsius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weather forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Emergency_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Emergency Supplies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.gearrice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Cyclone-Alberto-arrived-in-Mexico-Have-your-cell-phone-warn.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659946", "eventUri": "eng-9659946", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 104, "relevance": 1}

Weather watchers have been tracking Tropical Storm Alberto the past few days while it was a mere disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nBut why do storms get names?\n\nEvery six years or so, The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration releases a list of names that they will use to name hurricanes. This helps clarify any confusion when multiple storms form at the same time. And monikers for the deadliest events, such as Katrina and Sandy, are retired. Otherwise, the list is recycled.\n\n\u26a1 More trending stories from our newsroom:\n\n\u2192Cowboys legend Michael Irvin says wife Sandy, 58, suffers from early onset Alzheimer's\n\n\u2192 Fred's Texas Cafe opens a new restaurant outside of Fort Worth\n\n\u2192 Pastor of Southlake's Gateway Church accused of molesting 12-year-old girl in 1980s\n\nNOAA predicts an 85% chance of an above normal hurricane season for the Atlantic Ocean this year.\n\n\"NOAA is forecasting a range of 17 to 25 total named storms (winds of 39 mph or higher). Of those, eight to 13 are forecast to become hurricanes (winds of 74 mph or higher),\" according to its website.\n\nThey also predict four to seven hurricanes that will be category 3 or worse.\n\nThe last hurricane that hit Texas was Nicholas in 2021. Its storm surge was only a category 1, meaning minimal damage happened. The most recent hurricane to hit the United States was Lee in September 2023 -- another category 1 .\n\nA hurricane is when a storm's wind speeds reach up to 74 mph or higher, according to the National Weather Service. Categories are based on the maximum wind strength and the higher the category, the worse the damage.

(WAFB) - Today's Forecast: The area of low pressure in the southern Gulf of Mexico designated as Potential Tropical Cyclone #1 will begin to pull moisture farther south and west, away from our local area today. Enough fringe moisture will still be in place to produce a few showers and t-storms, but rains should be noticeably less numerous than the last couple of days. Lower rain chances and a little more sunshine should allow highs to climb to around 90 degrees.\n\nRest of This Week\n\nHigh pressure will gradually build in from the east, helping to shove the low pressure system in the Gulf westward toward Mexico. As the high builds in, we'll also trend drier and hotter through the end of the week and into the weekend.\n\nIt won't be completely dry though, with rain chances running 20%-30% daily from Thursday into the weekend. But it will be noticeably hotter, with highs reaching the mid 90s by Friday and potentially staying there for a while. Heat index values could approach the 'danger' category (~105\u00b0) by Sunday\n\nExtended Outlook\n\nThe trend is toward the next round of tropical moisture staying a bit to our southwest, meaning that plenty of heat potentially remains in place for much of next week. Rain chances may trend a touch higher, but highs are currently forecast to remain in the mid 90s.\n\nTropical Update\n\nPotential Tropical Cyclone #1 continues to spin over the southern Gulf of Mexico this morning. Only a small uptick in organization would lead to it being classified as Tropical Storm Alberto, but regardless of a name or not, it will track towards Mexico.\n\nWe continue to keep an eye on the potential for a second low pressure area to form in the same general vicinity by this weekend. Development odds are currently listed at 30%. We still have plenty of time to keep an eye on trends, but early indications point toward this system also remaining to our south.\n\nAnd finally, the National Hurricane Center continues to monitor an area east of Florida, but development chances are only listed at 20%.", "source": {"uri": "wafb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WAFB"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pressure_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Low-pressure area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_Rouge,_Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Alberto_(1994)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropical Storm Alberto (1994)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Pressure_Cooker", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Pressure Cooker", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Flowers/Fresh_Cut", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Flowers/Fresh Cut", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://gray-wafb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/7FT2DRP6RVBW7MR5VOZTJ5L5MY.png?auth=62140f7956d69846e5cdfe790c8fbabba3ea6be1e87b9d31ef67544b5054fe5a&width=1200&height=600&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659946", "eventUri": "eng-9659946", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 103, "relevance": 1}

Could it develop?", "body": "TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) -- A tropical disturbance with a chance of development formed off the Florida Gulf coast on Tuesday morning.\n\nAn area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms is expected to move across Florida over the next day or so, dumping several inches of rain on the region.\n\nIts chance of development, however, is low. The National Hurricane Center said the system has a zero percent chance of development in the next two days.\n\nIt has a 20% chance of \"slow\" development over the next seven days when it is offshore of the southeastern U.S. in the Atlantic.\n\nThe 2024 hurricane season is expected to be an active season.\n\nBoth the Colorado (CSU) long term forecast and the NOAA season forecast predict the highest number of named storms and hurricanes than they ever have on record.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to these above-average predictions and the sense that we will be very busy this fall tracking storms.\n\nWarmer seas surface temperatures provide a source of fuel for storms, often contributing to intensification. Warmer ocean temperatures mean the potential for more powerful hurricanes.\n\nSo far this year, our Atlantic sea surface temperatures are much warmer than average, closer to what we would expect to see in August. This leads us to believe that we will have more powerful hurricanes this year as well.\n\nFor every 3 degrees warmer the water is, stronger storms will be roughly around 20% stronger, especially in the strongest hurricanes. That means a storm with 150 mph winds would potentially have 180 mph winds with the warmer waters by 3 degrees. This does not consider any outside factors like wind shear, forward motion, or other potentially influential aspects.\n\nConsider what we've seen with rapid intensification in regards to hurricanes Katrina and Rita - when each of these storms passed over a warm water eddy, an area of warmer water that broke free from the loop current and moved into the Gulf.\n\nBoth storms significantly intensified as a result of the warmer sea surface temperatures.\n\nLa Ni\u00f1a typically leads to increased hurricane activity in the Atlantic.\n\nThe cooler waters in the Pacific reduce the amount of vertical wind shear (the change in wind speed and direction with height) over the tropical Atlantic. Lower wind shear allows tropical storms to develop and intensify more easily.\n\nSome of the most active hurricane seasons in the Atlantic have occurred during La Ni\u00f1a conditions.\n\nFor example, the record-breaking 2005 hurricane season, which included Hurricane Katrina, was influenced by La Ni\u00f1a conditions.\n\nThe Caribbean region often experiences more rainfall and storm activity during La Ni\u00f1a years. This can lead to more tropical storms forming in this region, which can then move into the Gulf of Mexico or along the eastern seaboard of the United States.", "source": {"uri": "valleycentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KVEO-TV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_scales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone scales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_convection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric convection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sea surface temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_shear", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wind shear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_intensification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapid intensification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_Current", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loop Current"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Ni\u00f1a", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Ni\u00f1a"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_speed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wind speed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_(fluid_dynamics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eddy (fluid dynamics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Katrina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://www.valleycentral.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/39/2024/06/LANINA2.png?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659946", "eventUri": "eng-9659946", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 96, "relevance": 1}

Davis, Madison Dong, Judson Jones, John Keefe, and Bea Malsky\n\nAlberto was a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico Wednesday morning Eastern time, the National Hurricane Center said in its latest advisory.\n\nThe tropical storm had sustained wind speeds of 40 miles per hour.\n\nAlberto is the first named storm to form in the Atlantic in 2024.\n\nIn late May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that there would be 17 to 25 named storms this year, an above-normal amount.\n\nSatellite imagery can help determine the strength, size and cohesion of a storm. The stronger a storm becomes, the more likely an eye will form in the center. When the eye looks symmetrical, that often means the storm is not encountering anything to weaken it.\n\nThis season follows an overly active year, with 20 named storms -- including an early storm later given the official name of \"Unnamed.\" It was the eighth year in a row to surpass the average of 14 named storms. Only one hurricane, Idalia, made landfall in the United States.\n\nTypically, the El Ni\u00f1o pattern that was in force last season would have suppressed hurricanes and reduced the number of storms in a season. But in 2023, the warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic blunted El Ni\u00f1o's usual effect of thwarting storms.\n\nThe warm ocean temperatures that fueled last year's season returned even warmer at the start of this season, raising forecasters' confidence that there would be more storms this year. The heightened sea surface temperatures could also strengthen storms more rapidly than usual.\n\nTo make matters worse, the El Ni\u00f1o pattern present last year is also diminishing, most likely creating a more suitable atmosphere for storms to form and intensify.\n\nHurricanes need a calm environment to form, and, in the Atlantic, a strong El Ni\u00f1o increases the amount of wind shear -- a change in wind speed and/or direction with height -- which disrupts a storm's ability to coalesce. Without El Ni\u00f1o this year, clouds are more likely to tower to the tall heights needed to sustain a powerful cyclone.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Keefe_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Keefe (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_imagery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satellite imagery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_per_hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miles per hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sea surface temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni\u00f1o", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "El Ni\u00f1o"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_speed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wind speed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_shear", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wind shear"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Oceanography", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Oceanography", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/17/world/one-map-path-tracker-index/one-map-path-tracker-index-videoSixteenByNine3000-v14.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659946", "eventUri": "eng-9659946", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 95, "relevance": 1}

This new phase is forecast to persist through the Northern Hemisphere winter and ties in with Atlantic hurricane season - so, what does it mean for such extreme storms?\n\n\"After a year of dominance, El Ni\u00f1o released its hold on the tropical Pacific in May 2024,\" reads NOAA's latest update for June 2024. \"The tropical Pacific's climate pendulum appears to be swinging back toward its other extreme: La Ni\u00f1a.\"\n\nLa Ni\u00f1a, and its counterpart El Ni\u00f1o, are the extreme phases of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle - a recurring climate pattern that describes how changes in the water temperature in the Pacific Ocean have a global impact on the world. Everything from wind, temperature, and rainfall patterns to the intensity of - you guessed it - hurricane seasons are affected. Even the distribution of fish in the seas can be influenced by the cycle.\n\nAround every three to seven years, the surface waters across a large swath of the tropical Pacific warm or cool by 1 to 3\u00b0C (1.8 to 5.4\u00b0F) compared to normal. La Ni\u00f1a is often called the \"cold phase\" of the ENSO, when the ocean surface temperature drops in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. During El Ni\u00f1o, on the other hand, surface temperature rises.\n\nWe've known La Ni\u00f1a was on her way for a while - forecasters originally predicted her return between June and August, but revised this as the rate of cooling slowed. According to the latest forecast from NOAA's Climate Prediction Center, ENSO-neutral conditions returned during the past month. However, they're not set to last and there's a 65 percent chance La Ni\u00f1a will develop in July-September 2024 and an 85 percent chance it will persist during November-January.\n\nThis timing means it will likely coincide with - and possibly intensify - the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season (expected between mid-August and mid-October).\n\nNOAA has already predicted an \"extraordinary\" season, thanks in part to La Ni\u00f1a. Per their estimates, there's an 85 percent chance of an above-normal season, a 10 percent chance of a near-normal season, and just a 5 percent chance of a below-normal season.\n\nBetween eight and 13 storms are forecast to become hurricanes, with wind speeds of 119 kilometers (74 miles) per hour or higher, and four to seven major hurricanes with winds of 178 kilometers (111 miles) per hour or higher are also anticipated. The forecasters have a 70 percent confidence in these ranges.\n\nYou might be wondering how a dip in ocean surface temp could impact the swirling winds of a hurricane. It is primarily down to vertical wind shear - the change in wind speed and direction from near the surface to high up in the atmosphere. Over the Atlantic, La Ni\u00f1a reduces vertical wind shear, which enhances hurricane activity. It also decreases the amount of sinking motion and atmospheric stability, which contribute.\n\nIn the central and eastern Pacific, meanwhile, La Ni\u00f1a suppresses hurricane activity.\n\nWith this year's Atlantic hurricane season already underway, and La Ni\u00f1a looming, 2024 could be set to see some intense storms.", "source": {"uri": "iflscience.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IFLScience"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern_Oscillation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Ni\u00f1a", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "La Ni\u00f1a"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni\u00f1o", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "El Ni\u00f1o"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Prediction_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Climate Prediction Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_variability_and_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate variability and change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sea surface temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic hurricane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_instability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric instability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_speed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wind speed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_shear", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wind shear"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy_and_Forecasting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy and Forecasting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/74720/aImg/76924/la-ni-a-hurricanes-meta.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659946", "eventUri": "eng-9659946", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 55, "relevance": 1}

According to NOAA, \"human-caused climate change\" is solely responsible for \"warming our ocean globally,\" \"melting ice on land\" and \"sea level rise.\"\n\nIn 2022, NOAA issued a very similar hurricane season prediction, which was way overblown. \"Overall, the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season featured near normal activity in terms of the number of named storms and hurricanes, but was slightly below average in terms of the number of major hurricanes,\" notes the National Hurricane Center.\n\nJust because NOAA was wrong in 2022 does not mean that its 2024 prediction will be wrong, too. However, more important, the entire narrative about hurricanes becoming more frequent and more intense due to anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change is not true.\n\nConsider.\n\nIn 2012, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated, \"Many weather and climate extremes are the result of natural climate variability (including phenomena such as El Ni\u00f1o), and natural decadal or multi-decadal variations in the climate provide the backdrop for anthropogenic climate changes. Even if there were no anthropogenic change in climate, a wide variety of natural weather and climate extremes would still occur.\"\n\nIn 2014, the National Climate Assessment stated, \"There has been no significant trend in the global number of tropical cyclones nor has any trend been identified in the number of U.S. land-falling hurricanes.\"\n\nMoreover, in 2018, the IPCC reported that there is \"only low confidence for the attribution of any detectable changes in tropical cyclone activity to anthropogenic influences.\"\n\nIn 2019, a peer-reviewed report in the American Meteorological Society stated, \"The majority of authors had only low confidence that any other observed tropical cyclone changes were beyond what could be attributed to natural variability.\"\n\nIn 2020, the World Meteorological Organization acknowledged that \"any single event, such as a severe tropical cyclone, cannot be attributed to human-induced climate change, given the current status of scientific understanding.\"\n\nPerhaps Steven E. Koonin, the undersecretary for science in the Department of Energy in the Obama administration, put it best when he said, \"Pointing to hurricanes as an example of the ravages of human-caused climate change is at best unconvincing, and at worst plainly dishonest.\"\n\nOver the past century, the number of hurricanes on a per-decade basis making landfall in the United States has declined. For instance, in the 1850s, well before humans harnessed fossil fuels as a viable energy source, 20 hurricanes made landfall, including six \"major\" storms. In the 1940s, 24 hurricanes made landfall, including 10 significant storms.\n\nObviously, the experts at NOAA can read graphs that illustrate that the frequency and severity of hurricanes striking the United States have not increased over the past several decades.\n\nSo, why does NOAA, along with so many other government-affiliated organizations, continue to engage in public fearmongering regarding hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes and so forth? They need to create panic and instill fear to justify their very existence. It is self-preservation.\n\nLike it or not, climate change is big business. Over the next decade, the United States will spend at least $500 billion to \"combat\" climate change. To keep the money flowing, the government needs an endless list of scary predictions to keep the alarmist narrative going.\n\nThe good news is Americans are beginning to realize that they are being lied to about climate change. More and more, polls show that Americans no longer automatically believe that climate change is an existential threat. Because they are starting to lose their hold, the alarmists are resorting to even more desperate measures.\n\nCopy article link", "source": {"uri": "azdailysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arizona Daily Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic hurricane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sea level rise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extreme weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sea surface temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weather forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Climate_Assessment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Climate Assessment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_impact_on_the_environment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human impact on the environment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Meteorological_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Meteorological Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni\u00f1o", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "El Ni\u00f1o"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peer review"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Global catastrophic risk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_scales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone scales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 51}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Quaternary_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Quaternary Studies", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/azdailysun.com/content/tncms/custom/image/7cba55f4-78e8-11ee-b901-cf0dbe53e41e.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659946", "eventUri": "eng-9659946", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 51, "relevance": 1}

The Atlantic hurricane season officially started on June 1.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Heat dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Northeastern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AccuWeather", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AccuWeather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maximum sustained wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Atlantic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Heating_and_Cooling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Heating and Cooling", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy_and_Forecasting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy and Forecasting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy_and_Environment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy and Environment", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6654e6c37409b0b0bf9ab337/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3000,1686,x0,y142,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659946", "eventUri": "eng-9659946", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 1368, "textEnd": 1374}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 51, "relevance": 1}

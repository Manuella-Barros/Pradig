A lot of people said no or a bubble team. So, we were underdogs there. As the season went on, when are they going to fall? Now, same thing. People said the Preds are going to win. ... I just think we kind of like that underdog role and I think players should embrace it. I really do.\"\n\nTocchet does not, however, think his players can take much from their regular-season success against the Oilers. The Canucks won all four games, but three came before Edmonton fired coach Jay Woodcroft and assistant Dave Manson on Nov. 12, when they were 3-9-1, and replaced them with Kris Knoblauch and Hall of Fame defenseman Paul Coffey, respectively.\n\nEdmonton went 46-18-5 under Knoblauch and Coffey and finished second in the Pacific Division (49-27-6), five points behind Vancouver (50-23-9).\n\n\"Since then, they've been the best team in the League,\" Tocchet said, highlighting the Oilers' 16-game winning streak from Dec. 21-Feb. 26, and forward Connor McDavid's 11 assists in the first round against the Los Angeles Kings, which the Oilers won in five games.\n\n\"They shatter records. It's a different team and they just got off to a bad start early.\"\n\nThe Canucks opened the season with an 8-1 home win against the Oilers before sweeping a home-and-home series with a 4-3 victory in Edmonton three days later. Vancouver defeated them at home again 6-2 on Nov. 6, less than a week before the coaching change.\n\nThe fourth win came in Edmonton on April 13, a 3-1 victory that helped the Canucks secure their first division title since 2013, but the Oilers were missing McDavid, who was out with a lower-body injury.\n\n\"They're going to be hungry to play us for obvious reasons,\" forward J.T. Miller said.\n\nEdmonton made quick work of the Kings in the first round, eliminating them for the third straight season. The Oilers' power play went 9-for-20 in that series, and that doesn't include two more goals scored shortly after penalties against Los Angeles had expired.\n\nMcDavid leads the playoffs with 12 points (one goal, 11 assists), Leon Draisaitl is tied for second with 10 points (five goals, five assists), and defenseman Evan Bouchard is tied for third with nine (one goal, eight assists).\n\nMiller and Tocchet discussed the unique challenges presented by McDavid, Draisaitl and the Oilers' power play, but Miller doesn't think the Canucks have to change the overall approach that got them to this point despite the doubters.\n\nThe Canucks tied for fifth in the NHL in goals against during the regular season (221), and allowed 12 against the Predators while killing 20 of 22 Nashville power plays.\n\n\"You could talk about playing defense and shutting whoever down, but when we play Canucks hockey, we're in your face and play in their end more than in our own,\" Miller said. \"You're not going to eliminate all the looks when you play a guy like Connor, but we've proven this year when we focus and play our game and worry about ourselves, we can have the results.

He did give the Canucks credit for playing well and beating Edmonton, but added, \"We don't carry much stock into it.\"\n\nOne reporter asked if McDavid remembered opening night and how it felt to start the season with high expectations and then have that first game go so sideways. When asked if it was the Canucks or the Oilers that were the reason for the end result of that game, McDavid responded, \"It was so long ago, I'm not even going to answer that, it was so long ago.\" The follow-up question was about whether Vancouver has seen anything close to Edmonton's best and McDavid said he could say whatever he wants but they just need to play the series. \"I am looking forward to the challenge, they are a great team.\"\n\nThe series between the Canucks and Oilers starts Wednesday night at 8 pm MT.

For some reason, Edmonton Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch was not among the nominees.\n\nInstead, the NHL named the Winnipeg Jets' Rick Bowness, Andrew Brunette of the Nashville Predators, and the Vancouver Canucks' Rick Tocchet. While not disputing the individual merits of all three nominees, to believe they are all more worthy of inclusion over Knoblauch is quite simply wrong.\n\nAt the time of Jay Woodcroft's firing, this writer will admit to thinking the Oilers were being too hasty with the decision. After all, Woodcroft had done wonders during his tenure as coach in Edmonton, and he arguably deserved more time to right the ship.\n\nAt the same time, objectively speaking, it was clear something was not right. The Oilers had endured their worst ever start to a season through 12 games and at one point had the worst team save percentage in the NHL, while allowing the second-most goals.\n\nIn came Knoblauch, who had a previous history with Connor McDavid and the rest, as they say, was history. In fact almost literally at one point, as the Oilers subsequently came within one victory of the Pittsburgh Peguins' all time NHL record of 17 consecutive wins.\n\nThe change in the Oilers under the calm and cerebral leadership of Knoblauch, was clear for all to see on the ice. Most importantly of all, he galvanised the team's defensive game, which was highlighted by Stuart Skinner seeing his save percentage jump from .861 before Woodcroft was fired, to .912 after he left the organisation.\n\nIn terms of goals allowed, the Oilers improved from second-worst to 10th-fewest by the conclusion of the regular season. They also finished with the fifth-fewest average shots against per game.\n\nOf course most important of all, was Knoblauch's regular season record of 46-18-5. This translated to a .703 winning percentage, which was the best in the NHL after he took over on Nov. 12.\n\nPeople may want to point towards the Oilers finishing the regular season ranked fourth-best in goals scored and power play success rate, which while still excellent, paled in comparison to finishing first in both categories last season. However, this was more than balanced out/explained by the extra focus and planning on defence in 2023-24; for context, consider that last season they were only ranked 17th-best in goals allowed and tied 18th-worst in average shots against per contest.\n\nOne final aspect to consider, is how Knoblauch's coaching influence spilled over into the playoffs -- at least for the opening round. Of the three consecutive seasons of facing the Los Angeles Kings in round one, this year was the most comprehensive series victory for the Oilers.\n\nOverall, again, we appreciate the individual accomplishments of Bowness, Brunette and Tocchet, who are all viable nominees in their own right. However, there is no way that all three deserve to be finalists for the Jack Adams Award ahead of Knoblauch; it will now be up to him and the Oilers to prove this during the remainder of the playoffs, which includes an upcoming matchup versus Tocchet and the Canucks.", "source": {"uri": "oilonwhyte.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oil On Whyte"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Woodcroft", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jay Woodcroft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Brunette", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Brunette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Bowness", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rick Bowness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Adams_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Adams Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_Predators", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nashville Predators"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Canucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver Canucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Canadiens", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montreal Canadiens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Tocchet", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rick Tocchet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_McDavid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connor McDavid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winning percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3000,h_1687,x_0,y_19/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/156/01hwzshw3xg7ctayqwfy.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542075", "eventUri": "eng-9542075", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-12", "textStart": 2126, "textEnd": 2133}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Here are 4 reasons why it doesn't matter", "body": "Minutes after yet another loss to the Vancouver Canucks, Zach Hyman was asked how much he should read into going winless against a divisional foe with a possible postseason matchup looming.\n\nA 3-1 defeat at the hands of the Canucks on April 13 meant the Oilers had dropped all four games in the regular-season matchup. They were outscored 21-7 and demolished in the two contests in Vancouver -- run out of the building by a culminative 14-3 score.\n\nIt was the tipping point for the Oilers missing out on their first division title since 1987. It's why a hypothetical-turned-actual playoff series begins in Vancouver and not Edmonton on Wednesday.\n\nBased on all that, it would seem the Canucks should hold a massive advantage over the Oilers.\n\nBut Hyman's right on point.\n\nThe Oilers are favourites in this series and by quite some margin. What happened in the regular season means jack squat.\n\nHere are four reasons why.\n\nIt's nice to go into a playoff series having dominated your playoff opponent in the weeks and months prior. It sure beats the alternative. After all, those points matter in the standings.\n\nHowever, there are countless examples of the team that got pummelled in the regular season turning the tables on their rivals in the playoffs. In some cases, they do so handily.\n\nLook no further than one of this year's Western Conference first-round series. The Winnipeg Jets beat the Colorado Avalanche in all three games this season. In their third-last game, the Jets routed the Avs 7-0 in Denver, an outcome that was pivotal to the Jets securing home-ice advantage for the upcoming matchup.\n\nIt didn't matter a lick. Though Winnipeg drew first blood in the series, the Avalanche won the next four games and dispatched the Jets with ease.\n\nThe Oilers have been on the wrong side of his equation recently. They were 7-2 against the Jets, having won the last five games, during the truncated 2021 season. The Oilers were then swept by the Jets in their first-round matchup, albeit with three overtime outcomes.\n\nPerhaps the most glaring example this century of a regular-season matchup getting flipped in the playoffs came in 2000-01. The Toronto Maple Leafs went 0-4-1 against the Ottawa Senators in the regular season and entered the series as the lower seed. They won Game 1 when Mats Sundin scored the contest's only goal in overtime and never looked back, sweeping the Sens.\n\nLet's just say there are more important factors to consider heading into a playoff battle than the head-to-head games from early October to mid-April.\n\nThe Oilers and Canucks played three times in Edmonton's first 11 games. Think of how much of a mess the Oilers were back then.\n\nThe season opener saw them get dismantled 8-1 in Vancouver. Jack Campbell started in net. Mattias Ekholm sat out because of a hip flexor/groin injury. The Oilers couldn't do anything right. It was baffling to watch.\n\nThey lost a hard-fought 4-3 decision in the rematch three nights later before getting pasted again on the road on Nov. 6, this time 6-2. The Oilers fell to 2-8-1 after dropping their third game to the Canucks. Organizational changes followed.\n\nCampbell was waived the next day and demoted to the minors when he cleared a day later. The Oilers lost in San Jose on Nov. 9, pushing them to a tie with the lowly Sharks for last in the league. That cost coach Jay Woodcroft and assistant Dave Manson their jobs.\n\nUnder Kris Knoblauch and Paul Coffey, the Oilers went 46-18-5 in 69 games -- an NHL-best .703 points percentage from the time they were hired on Nov. 12.\n\nMost of the season series couldn't be more irrelevant.\n\nConnor McDavid recorded just three points -- a goal and two assists, all on the power play -- against the Canucks this season. Maybe they have figured him out. It isn't likely.\n\nThe Oilers were a trainwreck in the season opener. Misfortune was arguably the biggest reason for their demise in the rematch; they outshot the Canucks 40-16. McDavid was four games into his return from an injury in the Nov. 6 loss and was out of sorts.\n\nThe Oilers captain was stuck in neutral early in the season. He had a very un-McDavid-like 10 points through nine games after the third loss to the Canucks. He'd go without a point in the next two contests to dip below the point-per-game clip.\n\nHowever, McDavid eventually tied Colorado's Nathan MacKinnon for the NHL lead with 68 points at five-on-five after the coaching change and played four fewer games over that span.\n\nPart of the reason for the games-played discrepancy was that McDavid sat out three games late in the season due to a lower-body injury. One of those games was the April 13 loss to the Canucks.\n\nConsidering McDavid's first-round performance against Los Angeles -- he had a goal and 12 points in five games -- the Canucks should have their hands full.\n\nThe Oilers surrendering 21 goals to the Canucks in four games this season isn't good. Let's rephrase: It's horrendous.\n\nTheir penalty kill was a huge part of that awfulness. It allowed the Canucks to go 7-for-17.\n\nHere's the thing, though: The Oilers are in a much better place defensively now than they were in the first few weeks of the season.\n\nThe Oilers averaged 2.68 goals against during the regular season after Knoblauch and Coffey were hired and Mark Stuart took over the penalty kill. They were fifth in the league in the department from Nov. 12 onward.\n\nIncluded in that run was a 16-game winning streak where they allowed two goals or fewer in each of the last 14 contests.\n\nAs for the playoffs, the 12 goals they gave up to the Kings in five games represents a slight improvement -- a 2.6 average. That's with some terrible bounces that went against them. They were a perfect 12-for-12 on the penalty kill, too.\n\nThe Oilers should have the ability to at least contain the Canucks to a much greater degree than earlier in the season.", "source": {"uri":

While both teams have demonstrated their prowess on the ice throughout the season, it's evident that the Oilers hold a significant advantage in various aspects heading into this crucial series.\n\nThe Oilers boast an impressive lineup led by none other than Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl, arguably two of the most dominant players in the league. Their offensive firepower is unmatched, with McDavid's speed and playmaking abilities combined with Draisaitl's scoring prowess posing a constant threat to any opposing defense. The Canucks will undoubtedly struggle to contain these dynamic forwards, giving the Oilers a crucial edge in offensive firepower.\n\nEdmonton's depth extends beyond their top stars. Players like Corey Perry, Warren Foegele, and Ryan McLeod have stepped up consistently throughout the season, providing valuable contributions in both ends of the ice. This depth gives the Oilers flexibility and resilience, allowing them to maintain pressure on the Canucks throughout the series.\n\nDefensively, Edmonton has shown significant improvement compared to previous seasons. With the players like Darnell Nurse and Mattias Ekholm, the Oilers' blue line has become more formidable, capable of shutting down opposing offenses while also contributing offensively. In contrast, the Canucks' defense has struggled at times this season, leaving them vulnerable to Edmonton's relentless attack.\n\nIn goal, the Oilers have an undeniable advantage with the stellar play of goaltender Stuart Skinner. Skinner has been a rock for Edmonton between the pipes, posting impressive numbers and providing leadership and stability to the team. His playoff experience and composure under pressure will be crucial in a playoff series, especially against a talented offensive team like the Canucks.\n\nThe Oilers hold the psychological advantage heading into the series. After finishing the season stronger and with a more convincing performance in the first round, Edmonton enters the matchup with confidence and momentum.\n\nWhile the Vancouver Canucks are a talented team capable of causing upsets, the Edmonton Oilers possess the necessary tools and advantages to emerge victorious in the second round series.

The results of this equation equal the potential winnings of the bettor.\n\nThe lower the number, the more likely the outcome, meaning the payout will be lower.\n\nIn the Oilers and Canucks series, the betting favourite so far is that the Oilers will defeat the Canucks in six games (4.00) followed by Edmonton winning in five (4.50) and Edmonton winning in seven (5.75).\n\nThe least likely outcome thus far, according to those placing bets, is for Vancouver to win in seven games (7.00)\n\nIn Edmonton's winning first series against the Los Angeles Kings, Connor McDavid, Leon Draisaitl, Evan Bouchard, Zach Hyman and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins accounted for a combined 15 goals and 30 assists in just five games.\n\nPlayNow predicts that these five players will be the Canucks biggest obstacle as they hope to move on.\n\nAs of this publication, McDavid (1.63) and Draisaitl (5.00) are the betting favourites to lead the series in points, according to PlayNow.\n\nVancouver will have to get their offense in line if they hope to compete as in their last series, their star centre Elias Pettersson came up with only three assists in six games.\n\nHis odds of being the highest scorer in the series against Edmonton are a lofty 11.00.\n\nCurrently, with eight teams left in the playoffs, the Edmonton Oilers and Florida Panthers (5.25 a piece) are the favourites to win the Stanley Cup.\n\nBehind them are the Dallas Stars (5.75), New York Rangers (6.50) and Carolina Hurricanes (7.00).\n\nThe odds of the Vancouver Canucks winning the cup are a massive 13.00, making them the least likely to win, based on what those placing bets believe.\n\nDo you think the Canucks can defy these odds and beat out the Oilers or win the cup?\n\nLet us know in the comments!\n\nThe two teams will

In their second-round predictions, 24 members of ESPN's staff were asked who they liked better in the Oilers-Canucks series.\n\n23 picked the Oilers to knock off the Canucks -- including Vancouver fan-favourite and former Edmonton captain Mark Messier, who said Edmonton would win in six games.\n\nThe only member of ESPN's staff who chose the Canucks was Ryan S. Clark, who picked the Canucks to advance to the Western Conference Finals after defeating the Oilers in seven games.\n\nThis goes against the grain of what happened in the regular season, where the Canucks swept the season series against the Oilers winning all four games and outscoring Edmonton by a 23-7 margin in those games. There are, however, some caveats to that dominant record.\n\nThree of those four wins came at the beginning of the year when the Oilers were not nearly playing at the level they are now and the fourth came without Connor McDavid in the Edmonton lineup. This playoff series will be the first time that Vancouver has seen the Oilers firing on all cylinders.\n\nThere is also the fact that the Canucks might be without their two top goaltenders in Thatcher Demko and Casey DeSmith, who were both injured in their first-round series against the Nashville Predators. Arturs Silovs played well against the Predators, but the Oilers' offence is a whole new beast.\n\nThe Oilers also looked very good against the LA Kings, not having much problem in their five-game series, whereas the Canucks did not look overtly dominant against a wildcard Predators club.\n\nPlayoff hockey, however, is not decided by those who predict the series and nothing is certain until both these teams take the ice. A schedule for the series has not yet been released, but reports seem to indicate that Game 1 is set for Tuesday night.", "source": {"uri": "dailyhive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "dailyhive.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "preston_hodgkinson@dailyhive.com", "name": "Preston Hodgkinson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Messier", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mark Messier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Division_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Division (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Canucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver Canucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thatcher_Demko", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thatcher Demko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_Predators", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nashville Predators"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_McDavid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connor McDavid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_DeSmith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casey DeSmith"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.dailyhive.com/20230912110323/mcdavid-oilers-6-500x258.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542075", "eventUri": "eng-9542075", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

In their way is one of the most high-powered offensive teams in the NHL. Rick Tocchet and his team are taking on Connor McDavid and the Edmonton Oilers in the Stanley Cup Playoffs.\n\nEntering this series, the Oilers are likely the favorites to move on. Edmonton has two of the best players in the world in McDavid and Leon Draisaitl. They also dominated the Los Angeles Kings in five games during the first round. Being the underdog is nothing new to the Canucks, though.\n\nMany did not expect the Canucks to make the playoffs this season, which Tocchet acknowledged on Sunday. There were doubts they could defeat the Nashville Predators, as well. Nashville entered the Stanley Cup Playoffs as one of the hottest teams in the league. Still, Vancouver sent them home.\n\nTocchet told the media on Sunday that he does not mind being the underdog. \"I love being doubted,\" the Canucks coach said, via NHL.com after an optional skate. \"I just think we kind of like that underdog role and I think players should embrace it, I really do.\"\n\nRick Tocchet addresses the doubters\n\nRick Tocchet continued to address those who doubt his team on Sunday. His team had question marks around their legitimacy as contenders all season long. Now, the Canucks head coach certainly isn't letting those question marks die off in the wind.\n\n\"At the start of the year, if you asked, 'Is Vancouver going to make the playoffs?' A lot of people said no or a bubble team. So, we were underdogs there. As the season went on, when are they going to fall? Now, same thing,\" Tocchet pointed out, via NHL.com, when he spoke to the media on Sunday.\n\nThe team certainly still has some doubters heading into this matchup with the Oilers. Still, Rick Tocchet and his team are not going into this blind. This is the Stanley Cup Playoffs, and a trip to the Western Conference Final is on the line. The Canucks head coach and his players are confident in themselves ahead of Game 1.\n\nCanucks understand gravity of Oilers matchup\n\nVancouver began the season as one of the best teams in the NHL. Edmonton, though, had the complete opposite start. They began the 2023-24 campaign in nightmarish fashion. In fact, their poor performance led to the firing of head coach Jay Woodcroft in November.\n\nThe coaching change breathed new life into Edmonton, however. They went on a 16-game winning streak at one point during the regular season. And they gave Vancouver a bit of a fight for the Pacific Division title. \"They shatter records. It's a different team and they just got off to a bad start early,\" Tocchet said of the Oilers, via NHL.com.\n\nAll that said, the Canucks feel no pressure to make major changes. Their current style of play got them into the Stanley Cup Playoffs. And they feel as if this style can help them take on the Oilers in this second-round matchup.\n\n\"You could talk about playing defense and shutting whoever down, but when we play Canucks hockey, we're in your face and play in their end more than in our own,\" Canucks star J.T. Miller said, via NHL.com. \"You're not going to eliminate all the looks when you play a guy like Connor, but we've proven this year when we focus and play our game and worry about ourselves, we can have the results. So, try to keep it 5-on-5 and bear down and win your 1-on-1 battles. The message doesn't really change.\"", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tristin_mckinstry@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Tristin McKinstry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Tocchet", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Tocchet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_McDavid", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Connor McDavid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Draisaitl", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leon Draisaitl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_Predators", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nashville Predators"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Canucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver Canucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Woodcroft", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jay Woodcroft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Division_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Division (NHL)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Canucks-news-Vancouver-coach-addresses-underdog-narrative-before-Oilers-series.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542075", "eventUri": "eng-9542075", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

This of course included the dates and (some) start times for the Edmonton Oilers' series with the Vancouver Canucks.\n\nOf some interest to fans, the schedule for the Oilers versus Canucks is slightly different than expected, at least based on prior assumptions. Previously, speculation had their second round series beginning on Tuesday.\n\nNow though, as per NHL.com, game one will instead take place on Wednesday night, with puck drop set for 8 p.m. MT in Vancouver, at Rogers Arena. At 24 hours later than previously reported, it doesn't make that much difference, although it at least gives the Oilers more time to prepare with them now not flying out to Vancouver until Tuesday.\n\nThis could prove crucial in respect of forwards Evander Kane and Adam Henrique who both, as per Oilers TV reporter and host Tony Brar, missed consecutive practice days during the weekend. While coach Kris Knoblauch says they will be ready to go for game one, any extra recuperation time can only help.\n\nRegardless, game two in Vancouver will now take place on Friday night, again beginning at 8 p.m. MT. The series will then move to Edmonton for games three and four on Sunday and next Tuesday respectively, although puck drop time has yet to be confirmed.\n\nAssuming the series does not result in a sweep by either team, game five will take place in Vancouver on Thursday May. 16 and game six will be at Rogers Place on Saturday May 18. If a deciding game seven is required, this will take place back in Vancouver on Monday May 20.\n\nDespite being swept 4-0-0 by the Canucks in the regular season series by a combined 21-7, the Oilers enter the second round matchup as betting favourites. However, as much as Edmonton does have the better overall talent on their roster, nothing can be taken for granted against a Vancover team which has been underestimated all season but just continues to win when it matters.", "source": {"uri": "oilonwhyte.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oil On Whyte"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Canucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver Canucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Henrique", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Henrique"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evander_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evander Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rogers Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_Place", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rogers Place"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3000,h_1687,x_0,y_148/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/156/01hx6phb3sgen073w1gs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542075", "eventUri": "eng-9542075", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-16", "textStart": 1609, "textEnd": 1616}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-18", "textStart": 1666, "textEnd": 1672}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 1761, "textEnd": 1767}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

The Edmonton Oilers' head coach, Kris Knoblauch, found himself absent from the list of nominees for the Jack Adams Award. Knoblauch's remarkable turnaround of the Oilers from a struggling squad to a dominant force has been nothing short of extraordinary, yet his name was conspicuously absent from the nominations.\n\nTaking over the reins from Jay Woodcraft, who was let go from the Oilers with a 3-9-1 record, Knoblauch faced a daunting task. However, since assuming control, he has orchestrated a remarkable transformation, guiding the team to an impressive 46-18-5 record, boasting an astonishing 0.800 winning percentage. These numbers speak volumes about Knoblauch's impact on the Oilers' performance on the ice.\n\nOne cannot help but wonder why Knoblauch was overlooked in favor of other coaches. Among the nominees were Rick Bowness of the Winnipeg Jets, Andrew Brunette of the Nashville Predators, and Rick Tocchet of the Vancouver Canucks. While each of these coaches undoubtedly achieved commendable results with their respective teams, the omission of Knoblauch seems perplexing, given the Oilers' remarkable resurgence under his leadership.\n\nRick Bowness guided the Jets to a solid season, navigating the team through various challenges and securing a respectable position in the standings. Andrew Brunette's steady hand played a pivotal role in the Predators' success, fostering a winning culture and guiding the team to an impressive end of the season to secure a playoff spot. Meanwhile, Rick Tocchet's strategic prowess propelled the Canucks to new heights, cementing their status as legitimate contenders and winning the Pacific Division.\n\nHowever, when comparing their achievements to Knoblauch's remarkable turnaround of the Oilers, it becomes evident that his absence from the list is unjustifiable. Transforming a struggling team into a powerhouse in such a short span of time is a testament to Knoblauch's coaching acumen and leadership skills. His ability to instill confidence in his players, devise effective game plans, and extract the best performances from his roster sets him apart as one of the league's top coaches.\n\nFurthermore, the Oilers' success under Knoblauch's guidance extends beyond mere statistics. He has fostered a winning culture within the organization, instilling a sense of belief and unity among players and staff alike. His tactical innovations and keen understanding of the game have earned him the respect and admiration of his peers, further underscoring his credentials for the Jack Adams Award.\n\nWhile the nominations for the Jack Adams Award may have overlooked Kris Knoblauch's remarkable achievements with the Edmonton Oilers, his impact on the team's fortunes cannot be overstated. As the hockey world reflects on the season gone by, Knoblauch's snub serves as a reminder of the subjective nature of awards and the importance of recognizing excellence wherever it may be found.", "source": {"uri": "oilonwhyte.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oil On Whyte"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Knoblauch", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kris Knoblauch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Brunette", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Brunette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Bowness", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rick Bowness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Adams_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Adams Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_Predators", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nashville Predators"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Tocchet", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rick Tocchet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Canucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver Canucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Division_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Division (NHL)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1150,h_646,x_0,y_45/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/156/01hwzsmmw6n8j9sb0n8h.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542075", "eventUri": "eng-9542075", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Find out how Neil Parker is betting on this matchup in his series preview below.\n\nThe Edmonton Oilers opened as sizable favorites to win this Round 2 series despite the Vancouver Canucks having home-ice advantage -- and I've got NHL picks for the action.\n\nEdmonton rolled the Los Angeles Kings in five games in the opening round, and the Oilers have superstar Connor McDavid leading the way as the betting favorite in the Conn Smythe odds. Meanwhile, Vancouver went through three netminders but took down the Preds in six.\n\nRead below on how I think this series is going to shape up!\n\nNews the Vancouver Canucks will be without Thatcher Demko to start Round 2 is accounted for in these series odds, and the high-scoring Edmonton Oilers could make quick work of the Canucks if Vancouver continues to struggle offensively.\n\nEdmonton was a statistical juggernaut during the regular season, and while the Oilers might not have had the same 5-on-5 success against the Kings in Round 1, they didn't allow a shorthanded goal and scored nine times with the man advantage.\n\nAdditionally, the Oilers posted a 100.1 PDO at 5-on-5 when adjusted for score and venue, so there isn't any glaring sign of negative regression ahead. I anticipate the Oil scoring fewer goals and their 11.2 team shooting percentage at 5-on-5 to drop, but No. 1 goalie Stuart Skinner is likely to improve on his .902 SV% at 5-on-5 after posting a .913 mark during the regular season.\n\nSimilarly, the special teams are unlikely to remain as dominant in Round 2, but I'm not expecting an astronomical drop-off on the power play. The Oilers were elite up a man during the regular season, too.\n\nCanucks statistical breakdown\n\nEven with the puck luck drying up as the season progressed, the Canucks still topped the league in team shooting percentage and PDO. Vancouver also continued to drive possession in Round 1 and checks out as an excellent 5-on-5 team across the board.\n\nStill, it's unlikely the Arturs Silovs-Casey DeSmith goaltending tandem can maintain a .940 SV% at 5-on-5, and the Canucks penalty-kill units are also facing a much tougher test in Round 2. Vancouver had middling success while shorthanded throughout the regular season, too.\n\nAll statistics are at five-on-five except power-play percentage and penalty-kill percentage.\n\nThe difference in winning and losing this time of year often comes down to goaltending, special teams, and star power. I'm giving Edmonton the edge in all three. Vancouver had its hands full with Nashville in Round 1, and now the Canucks face a deeper and more talented opponent.\n\nEdmonton proved capable of winning in a variety of ways in Round 1 against Los Angeles, and I don't anticipate Vancouver being able to keep up offensively over a seven-game series. I also don't anticipate the series going the distance.\n\nThe Canucks will be able to limit the Oilers for stretches and potentially a game or two, but in doing so, Vancouver will also be sacrificing its ability to generate quality scoring chances. The Canucks averaged the fewest shots per game (20.2), third-fewest attempts (55.34), and high-danger scoring chances (9.81) per 60 minutes during Round 1, which reinforces the commitment to playing sound defense at the expense of creating offense.\n\nRelying on timely scoring becomes all the more difficult when the quality scoring chances are few and far between.\n\nThere's no sugarcoating the Vancouver goaltending situation, and if Demko is able to return, he'll be both rusty and jumping on a moving train. As noted, there's already statistical correction ahead of Vancouver's .940 5-on-5 team save percentage, and the Edmonton offense is both relentless and opportunistic.\n\nI also expect Edmonton to have better 5-on-5 numbers in this series. Los Angeles topped Vancouver in CF% and xGF% during the regular season and when adjusted for score and venue.\n\nOf course, the superstar factor is the icing on the cake. Vancouver might limit Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl for stretches and even games, but the Canucks are going to have to outscore them, and they don't have the star power to do it.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Canucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver Canucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conn_Smythe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conn Smythe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-handed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Short-handed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thatcher_Demko", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thatcher Demko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_McDavid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connor McDavid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_puck", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hockey puck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Draisaitl", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leon Draisaitl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icing_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Icing (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Five-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Five-Pin", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/192490ab-45ce-4a25-aa9f-eb48d08490ba.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542075", "eventUri": "eng-9542075", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Brian Mulroney was prime minister. Scent of a Woman was in theatres. Free Your Mind by En Vogue was climbing the charts. Microsoft launched Windows 3.1 and the Canucks for the second time lost a playoff series to the Oilers. They previously met in 1986.\n\nFast forward to today and power-forward J.T. Miller says the Canucks' only focus right now is winning.\n\n\"We should be super excited. This is a rivalry we love playing against, \" said Miller. \"When we play Canucks hockey, we're in your face and we play in their end more than we play in our own. We've proven this year that when we focus and play our game and worry about ourselves, we can have the results.\"\n\nMiller describes the series as a highly anticipated battle for the Canucks.\n\n\"I don't think we view ourselves as underdogs by any means. It's a clean slate. We got another chance to re-rack and go again and it's a good test.\"\n\nThe Canucks played the Oilers four times in the regular season, with Vancouver winning each game, outscoring Edmonton 21-7.\n\nBut Captain Quinn Hughes says those stats don't matter anymore.\n\n\"Since I've been [playing], [we've] probably played these guys 25-30 times, especially in the COVID year, we played them 10 times. We definitely have a feel for how good they are and what their team is, but I think that'll probably get elevated even more.\"\n\nHughes points out that the game plan against Edmonton is pretty straightforward -- play well 5-on-5, stay out of the penalty box, and shut down Connor McDavid, Leon Draisaitl, and Zach Hyman.\n\nThe 24-year-old from Orlando, Florida, admits he hasn't quite grasped how big of a deal it is to play in an all-Canadian match-up.\n\n\"Obviously, it's two markets where the hockey is so important to each city and so important to the people, so it's going to be a really competitive series. I'm sure the fans will enjoy it.\"\n\nHe adds they're remaining grounded after knocking off the Nashville Predators last week.\n\n\"We won one round. It's exciting but I don't think anyone is hanging their hat on that. I think it's just on to the next.\"\n\nHead Coach Rick Tocchet says right now his players are resting and resetting.\n\n\"For the coaches, it's the game plan. Totally different team. I don't think there's a lot of changes in the way we play, but there are some tweaks that we're going to have to do against Edmonton -- offensively and defensively.\"\n\nSo far, both teams say they respect each other, but not surprisingly, the smack talk is underway. One Edmonton radio host ripped into Hughes, saying, \"If you really start pulverizing him, he looks like he's going to cry all the time.\"\n\nMeanwhile, 23 of 24 ESPN hockey analysts are pegging the Oilers to win the series.\n\n\"I don't know if we're an underdog or if anyone is expecting us to win -- I have no idea. All I know is what I know and I'm just trying to put myself in a position where I'm best prepared to play my best hockey and I think that's what everyone on our team is trying to do,\" said Hughes.\n\nVancouver used three goalies in the first round against the Nashville Predators, but it remains unclear who will start Game 1 on Wednesday at Rogers Arena and it's entirely possible Arturs Silovs will continue to lead the way.\n\n\"I know he works really hard and obviously, he's learning a lot right now. This is an important time for him and I'm sure he's feeling confident, feeling good about himself which is really important,\" praised Miller.\n\n\"I think he just did a great job and he's a young guy. He's very competitive and the moment wasn't too big for him. I'm really happy for him and really happy for our team that we have another guy like that,\" added Hughes.\n\nThe puck drop is just after 7 p.m. on Wednesday at Rogers Arena.

The best part? It's only ramping up from here, as the Stars will next face the Colorado Avalanche in a thrilling heavyweight tilt.\n\nOn the Pacific Division side, the Vancouver Canucks will take on the Edmonton Oilers in an all-Canadian matchup. The storylines will be massive and the chirping on social media between these two passionate fan bases will be just as entertaining as the on-ice action.\n\nHere are five pressure points to track in the Western Conference playoffs.\n\nOn the surface, scoring may not seem like a concern for the Canucks. After all, they ranked sixth in the NHL with 3.4 goals scored per game during the regular season and boasted the 11th-ranked power play. That should be plenty of offensive firepower to supplement a Canucks squad that defends exceptionally well, right?\n\nThe problem is it's been a long time since the Canucks clicked offensively at that type of rate. Vancouver ranked 24th in the NHL for shots per game, goals per game and on the power-play from the All-Star break to the end of the regular season.\n\nVancouver's first-round series victory over the Nashville Predators wasn't a convincing offensive showcase either. The Canucks averaged just 2.17 goals per game, 20.2 shots per game and a 15.4 percent power play in the first round. Across the board, those were the worst offensive totals of any team that advanced to Round 2.\n\nThe Canucks generated offense when J.T. Miller or Quinn Hughes was on the ice, but it was nearly impossible to source secondary offense when they were on the bench. Vancouver mustered just 33 shots on goal in the 162 minutes when Miller and Hughes were on the bench during the six-game series against Nashville, which translates to a dreadful 12.2 shots-per-60-minutes rate.\n\nBy this point, we know the Canucks are much stronger defensively than they are offensively. And they deserve a ton of credit for slowing down a Predators offense that seemed to score at will during the second half of the regular season. But for as stingy as the Canucks are in their own end, they probably can't limit Edmonton's offense to two goals per game the way they did to Nashville. Consider, for example, that the Los Angeles Kings ranked third best in the NHL for goals against during the regular season and had the league's second-best penalty kill, and yet the Oilers averaged 4.4 goals per game against them in the first round anyway.\n\nVancouver will obviously prefer gritty, lower-scoring games against the Oilers, but even with that formula, its even-strength scoring and power play will need to reach a higher level than what we saw in Round 1.\n\nThis is where officiating will be influential for this series' outcome, too. The refs calling a high volume of penalties for both teams would heavily favor the Oilers, who scored on nearly half their power plays and were 100 percent on the penalty in Round 1. On the other hand, if the games in this series only feature 1-3 power-play opportunities per game for each team, the Canucks' chances of winning will rise because of how they can muck it up with tight-checking, low-event hockey at five-on-five.\n\nBesides fixing the power play, Elias Pettersson is the biggest key to unlocking the Canucks' offense. The 25-year-old star Swede can take games over when he's at his best. He scored 102 points last season and was producing at a breakneck 45-goal, 107-point pace heading into the All-Star break.\n\nPettersson struggled for the last two months of the regular season, which included just one goal in his final 13 games. He didn't look any better in Round 1 against Nashville, registering zero goals and three assists (all of them secondary assists) in six games. The Canucks were outscored 3-1 at five-on-five during Pettersson's shifts, despite him having a favorable soft matchup against Nashville's Colton Sissons line.\n\nHere's a comprehensive video analysis of why he's struggled and how he can get back on track.\n\nPettersson looked better in Game 5 and had a secondary assist on Pius Suter's game-winner in Game 6, so hopefully that's a sign he'll elevate his game in Round 2. If he plays at a superstar level again, he will significantly enhance the Canucks' chances of holding up against the Oilers.\n\nDarnell Nurse's and Cody Ceci's defensive struggles contributed to Edmonton's playoff elimination last year. The Oilers controlled just 46 percent of five-on-five shot attempts with that pair on the ice in the playoffs in 2023. Vegas pummeled the Nurse-Ceci pair by a 7-2 score at five-on-five in the second round last year.\n\nEdmonton's second pair has had another rough start to the playoffs, driving just a 42 percent share of five-on-five shot attempts and expected goals while getting outscored 4-2 by the Kings in Round 1. This pair needs to perform better, otherwise, the Canucks have the opportunity to bump their offensive output.\n\nThe other big question mark, outside of secondary scoring, is goaltending. Stuart Skinner recovered well after a horrible start to the regular season and was solid with a .910 save percentage in the first round against L.A., but last season he had some tough moments in the playoffs.\n\nEdmonton's goaltending was a big reason why the Canucks had success against the Oilers in the regular season. Skinner needs to continue his sturdy play from the first round.\n\nBefore the playoffs started, the Avalanche were one of the hardest, most polarizing Cup contenders to get a read on. Everybody knew how star-studded they were, but they didn't look as deep as the 2022 Cup-winning team, and goaltending was a major concern with Alexandar Georgiev's sliding form.\n\nThe Avalanche made it abundantly clear which version of them is showing up for the playoffs after annihilating a strong Winnipeg Jets team in five games. Colorado looks terrifying, even if it still has blemishes.\n\nColorado was the highest-scoring team in the regular season and pumped 28 goals in five games (5.6 per game) against a Jets squad that ranked second best in the NHL for goals against and was backstopped by arguably the best goaltender on the planet.\n\nDallas doesn't need to grind out a bunch of low-scoring 2-1 or 3-2 victories. The Stars are loaded with speed, skill and offensive IQ up and down the lineup. They can hang in and even win a high-scoring series against Colorado.\n\nThey can't, however, afford to get sliced and diced defensively to the historically egregious extent that Winnipeg did. The Avs created dangerous zone entries at will. They found backdoor passes with ease. Their relentless offensive barrage broke through Winnipeg's defensive zone coverage like a sledgehammer against drywall.\n\nThe Stars need to find the defensive answers and adjustments that eluded Winnipeg. They have a better blue line than the Jets, so that's a decent start. But beyond that, they need to make sure they're on point tactically and are ruthlessly attentive to details like avoiding turnovers at the offensive blue line, keeping their forwards above the puck and reloading in good positions to provide back pressure, and ensuring their defensemen stay within the dots while defending the rush rather than spraying out to the flanks (Vegas' lone goal in Game 7 is an example of that mistake).\n\nHeading into the playoffs, I viewed the Stars as the deepest, most complete team in the West. This isn't me trying to paint them as underdogs because this is a relatively even matchup. But the Avs are clicking at an offensive gear that no other team in the league has reached this year and that means the Stars need to be ready with answers.\n\nFor years, Dallas' top line has consistently ranked among the best in the league statistically in underlying metrics and goal differential. That first line was still productive this season but didn't click at its typically elite level.\n\nThe Stars are so deep offensively that they managed to beat the Golden Knights despite the top of their lineup scuffling a little bit, but they'll need more from Roope Hintz in the second round. Hintz mustered just one point across seven games in Round 1, with the Stars outscored 5-3 at five-on-five during his shifts. It didn't help, of course, that Joe Pavelski had a rough series on his wing, too. And Hintz's struggles span longer than these last seven games, as he scored just 18 points in his final 33 regular-season games.\n\nHintz's speed, range and two-way prowess showed how he could take games over during last year's playoffs when he scored 10 goals and 24 points in 19 games. If the Stars can unlock that version of Hintz, or even something close to it, it would go a long way toward matching the Avalanche's elite offensive firepower.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "harman_dayal@theathletic.com", "name": "Harman Dayal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._T._Miller", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

Can they get better? Is there another level to their game? Because I'm telling you right now the L.A. Kings are going to challenge you. Dallas Stars are going to challenge you.

They don't want to be asked anymore about it.\n\nThey know full well that the Vancouver Canucks swept the four games between the two teams in the regular season. They also know from experience that regular-season results mean nothing during the playoffs.\n\nYet, the Oilers can't shake the narrative heading into their Western Conference second-round series against the Canucks, which begins Wednesday in Vancouver.\n\n\"I don't know how much more we need to talk about this,\" said Leon Draisaitl, who was dominant in the Oilers first-round series win over the Los Angeles Kings. He had 10 points and was also a major part of the penalty-killing unit that didn't allow a goal in five games.\n\n\"We're going into Round 2 of the Stanley Cup playoffs. We don't care about what happened in the regular season. And I bet you that they don't either, as much as you think. We're a different team now. It's going to be tight-checking, with two really good teams going at it. The team that plays better hockey will win.\"\n\nDraisaitl referred to the fact that three of those Canucks wins over Edmonton -- including a season-opening 8-1 demolition -- came very early in the season, when the Oilers were undergoing a crisis that eventually cost former coach Jay Woodcroft his job.\n\nThe Oilers started the season 3-9-1 under Woodcroft. After coach Kris Knoblauch took over, the team went 46-18-5.\n\n\"It is old, for sure,\" Oilers defenceman Vincent Desharnais said of the season-series talk. \"It's been so long. People keep asking about it ... Those first three games were, like, six or seven months ago. We're a different team. And, at the end of the day, whatever happened in the regular season doesn't mean anything.\n\n\"The most important part is the first game on Wednesday, the rest doesn't matter.\"\n\nCore players like Draisaitl, Connor McDavid and defenceman Darnell Nurse know the \"regular season doesn't mean anything\" mantra all too well. Back in 2020-21, they were on the other side of this discussion, with the Oilers winning seven of nine regular-season games against the Winnipeg Jets, including all six final matchups, only to be swept by the Jets in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nThe Canucks-Oilers series is a de facto Canadian NHL championship, as the winner will be the final team standing from north of the border.\n\n\"It's exciting,\" said Draisaitl, comparing it to the Oilers' playoff series win over the Calgary Flames two seasons ago.\n\n\"The Battle of Alberta was great, it was a lot of fun to be part of. I'm sure this series will write its own story. We're ready.\"\n\nThe Oilers will have had a full week off by the time the second round starts on Wednesday, providing extra time for forwards Adam Henrique and Evander Kane to recover from whatever has been keeping them away from the ice. Both players missed Monday's practice, but Knoblauch expects both to be skating Tuesday.\n\n\"We are hopeful they are available for Game 1,\" said Knoblauch.\n\nIf one or both of them can't go, Knoblauch was noncommittal about how he may have to shuffle the lineup. Henrique played the first round as a winger on the top line with McDavid and Zach Hyman, while Kane moved up to the second unit to play with Draisaitl and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins.\n\n\"We got a lot of guys who can fill in that spot,\" said Knoblauch of the potential vacancy on McDavid's line. Mattias Janmark played there in practice.\n\n\"I don't think there's one guy who can play there and do it all, but I think we can maybe do it by committee. Different guys, different situations. We also have the opportunity of Zach Hyman playing left wing, if we need someone else to play right wing.\"\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published May 6, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "brandonsun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brandon Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Draisaitl", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leon Draisaitl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Knoblauch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kris Knoblauch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Canucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver Canucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Woodcroft", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jay Woodcroft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darnell_Nurse", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darnell Nurse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_McDavid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connor McDavid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Hyman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zach Hyman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Alberta", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Alberta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Henrique", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Henrique"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evander_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evander Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Nugent-Hopkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Nugent-Hopkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canadian_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Canadian Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary_Flames", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Calgary Flames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.brandonsun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/20240506160548-c07c6ecb69da3feb8676ca1745d55ffbacc56ef1c6a61cc340f270b1cfe662e0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542075", "eventUri": "eng-9542075", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

The forward began his career with a hot start in his first full season in 2017-18 after having a nine-game taste in the previous season. He scored 55 points in 62 games and looked to improve from there. But over the next five seasons, he never eclipsed 56 points and was talked about in trade rumours all the time. But a resurgent 2023-24 season has cemented himself as a valuable member of the Canucks core and has been one of many reasons why they have made it into the second round.\n\nBoeser hit a low point in his career during his last three seasons where he saw his goal and point production decrease from what fans expected of him. He regressed in the 2019-20 season where he only scored 16 goals, had back-to-back 40-point seasons in 2021 and 2022, and although his point production spiked last season, he only ended it with 18 goals. The writing looked to be on the wall for Boeser and his time in Vancouver looked to be coming to an end. Until this season, when everything clicked.\n\nBoeser opened the season with a four-goal game against the Edmonton Oilers and his season took off from there. He played a magnificent season with the Canucks and was a huge part of their offensive firepower along with Elias Pettersson and J.T. Miller. Finding his game at this time was the best thing for Boeser as now all teams that play the Canucks need to worry about him along with the other threats that they have. Boeser finished the season with 40 goals and 73 points. It was the first time he had ever hit 40 goals in his career.\n\nEvery player has that one game in the playoffs that is remembered forever as one of the best performances of all time. Max Talbot's two-goal game for the Pittsburgh Penguins against the Detroit Red Wings in the Stanley Cup Final in 2009, and Wayne Gretzky's hat trick for the Los Angeles Kings against the Toronto Maple Leafs in the conference finals in 1993 come to mind. But Canucks fans will always remember the incredible hat trick that Boeser scored in Game 4 against the Nashville Predators in 2024.\n\nRelated: Canucks' Trade Options for Brock Boeser\n\nBoeser took a Canucks team that looked to be preparing for a Game 5 against the Predators before Game 4 was over and took over the game to force overtime. After already scoring a goal earlier in the game, he scored two goals in the final minutes to force overtime. Vancouver went on to win that game in overtime. Without that incredible game by Boeser, the Canucks may not be in the second round right now since Nashville ended up winning Game 5 and could have won the series on home ice in Game 6.\n\nBoeser added even more to Vancouver's series win outside of those three goals in Game 4. He recorded another goal and two assists during the other five games in the series to total six points in six playoff games. He has found a home playing with Miller and Pius Suter and has found his role on the powerplay as the finisher on the left-wing boards. With Boeser playing this way, the Canucks become a much more dangerous team to play against because they have more options in the offensive zone and more players that can score when the team needs a goal.\n\nBoeser's newfound game is blossoming at the right time and his scoring is rising just when Vancouver needs it most. The Canucks were able to have a defensive battle against the Predators but that will not happen against the Edmonton Oilers. With their firepower, they will look to outscore Vancouver, but the Canucks have more firepower than Edmonton realizes with all of their great offensive weapons.

The Oilers are heavy favourites in this series, but there should be no sense that the Canucks are some glass-slipper-wearing ball attendee nervously checking the clock.\n\nThis Canucks team finished first in the Pacific Division. They beat the Oilers in all four meetings between the two clubs in the regular season. There's nothing about this team that expresses any \"happy just to be here\" sentiment.\n\nWhen the puck drops on this all-Canadian second-round matchup on Wednesday evening at Rogers Arena, the Canucks are going to believe they can win, even if the betting markets, most experts and Dom Luszczyszyn's model view them as a long shot.\n\nIf this party is going to keep raging into June, however, Vancouver is going to need more players beyond their top line and their depth goaltenders to cape up and get going. The Canucks looked too often like a one-line time against the Predators, and that isn't likely to be enough against a star-studded Cup favourite like the Oilers.\n\nWith the Broadway lights of Music City in the rearview mirror, let's dive into The Athletic Vancouver's individual report cards for the first-round series. We'll begin today with the forwards and move on to the defenders and goaltenders tomorrow.\n\nBrock Boeser: A+\n\n6 GP, 4 goals + 2 assists = 6 points\n\nWhen the puck drops for the NHL playoffs, it's often said that the ice shrinks, there's less time and space and most goals are scored in the greasy, high-traffic areas on the inside. This is where Boeser's steady, year-over-year evolution as a scorer has paid dividends. Boeser entered the league in 2016-17 as a sizzling sniper who relied on shots from distance to score and has slowly transformed into a savvy, clinical net-front finisher.\n\nThree of Boeser's team-leading four goals were scored right around the blue paint. It's a reflection of the progress he's made at hunting rebounds, getting open, absorbing physical contact from defenders and setting screens (including J.T. Miller's critical goal in Game 3, which he didn't get an assist on).\n\nBoeser's Game 4 hat trick, which included two goals in the last three minutes to erase a 3-1 deficit and set the table for Elias Lindholm's heroic overtime winner, will go down in Canucks playoff lore. He also doesn't get enough credit for the spectacular no-look backhand pass from behind the net to set up Suter's Game 6 winner.\n\nIn addition to all of the offence, Boeser's two-way form was sharp throughout the series. He was well-positioned without the puck and had an active stick that noticeably broke up Nashville's breakout attempts. Boeser and Miller were by far the Canucks' best forwards from the first round.\n\nJ.T. Miller: A+\n\n6 GP, 1 goal + 5 assists = 6 points\n\nMiller put his cape on and continued his dominant campaign with a monstrous first-round performance against the Predators.\n\nIt's not just the points, although they were massive, or the clutch moments throughout the series. It's also the physical play, the 20 minutes a night Miller logged, the way his line dominates the run of play at five-on-five, and the 58 percent faceoff win rate he managed against Nashville.\n\nIt's also that Vancouver's emotional leader kept his cool when things went poorly, and seemed to find smart ways to keep the mood around the group light when it was required, even at the expense of Arturs Silovs' dress shirts.\n\nThe Canucks are going to need Miller to be great if they're going to best the Oilers in the second round. There is no question he was great in Round 1.\n\nElias Lindholm: B\n\n6 GP, 2 goals + 1 assist = 3 points\n\nVancouver's third line didn't control play nearly as well as it did in the regular season (the Canucks were outshot 56-33 and only controlled 36 percent of scoring chances during Lindholm's five-on-five shifts) but it still made vital contributions in the series.\n\nLindholm opened the scoring for the Canucks in Game 1 with a rush goal and did an outstanding job on the forecheck in the third period to force a turnover and pick up an assist on Dakota Joshua's game-winning goal in Game 1. He also, of course, had a slick finish on the OT winner in Game 4. Lindholm was a key cog for the Canucks' excellent penalty kill. The third line also matched up against the Ryan O'Reilly line early in the series, although the Canucks moved away from that as the series progressed.\n\nWould we like to see Lindholm and his linemates hit another gear at driving play and stacking heavy offensive zone shifts instead of getting decisively outshot and outchanced? Yes, there's a higher level for them to reach. But two critical goals and top-notch penalty-killing is still a job well done by Lindholm.\n\nElias Pettersson: C-\n\n6 GP, 0 goals + 3 assists = 3 points\n\nThere's no sugarcoating it: Pettersson needs to be way better if the Canucks are going to beat the Oilers in Round 2.\n\nVancouver's Swedish star was soft-matched against Colton Sissons' line, which should have been a favourable draw, but he couldn't capitalize. Pettersson went goal-less, which extends his one-goal-in-19-games dry spell going back to late March, and the Canucks were outscored 3-1 during his five-on-five shifts.\n\nPettersson struggled as a playmaker, was uncharacteristically imprecise as a finisher and lacked some pace and heaviness from Games 1 to 4. Vancouver's power play didn't look dangerous enough with his poor execution from the right flank.\n\nOf course, Pettersson was also dragged down by his wingers who couldn't make plays, recover pucks for him or finish chances. It's also worth pointing out that even though scoring was an issue, Pettersson's defensive play was mostly clean and the Canucks controlled play decently when he was on the ice. And if you're looking for positives, he looked significantly better in Game 5 and won a key battle along the boards to earn a secondary assist on Suter's goal in Game 6.\n\nHopefully Pettersson's improved play at the end of the series can be a launchpad for a much stronger second-round performance.\n\nDakota Joshua: B-\n\n6 GP, 2 goals + 2 assists = 4 points\n\nJoshua had a monster three-point performance in Game 1. He assisted Lindholm's opening goal, pulled off a beautiful against-the-grain finish on Juuse Saros to give the Canucks a lead and then tallied an insurance marker with an empty netter.\n\nThe physical two-way winger was far less impactful later in the series, however. He wasn't consistently disruptive on the forecheck (aside from his secondary assist during Game 4), could have done more to drive play and took a pair of undisciplined penalties, including a third-period boarding penalty in Game 5 which the Predators scored on to spark their comeback victory.\n\nJoshua had a solid series overall and wasn't on the ice for a single PK goal against. After Game 1, however, you were left hoping for a bit more than what he showed.\n\nConor Garland: B+\n\n6 GP, 0 goals + 2 assists = 2 points\n\nGarland is the key driver on what's become Vancouver's second line.\n\nAgainst the Predators, that line often duelled the Predators' top line in a soft match. They ate a few dashes and were actually outscored as a line in the series, but given the difficulty of the assignment, they mostly held their own.\n\nIn a couple of critical moments in the series, however, it was Garland who made the key play to unlock the Predators defence. His pass to Joshua in Game 1 was key in shifting the momentum of the series, as was his setup to Lindholm in overtime which sealed the miraculous Game 4 comeback.\n\nGarland has contributed as a key down-lineup game breaker, and given his size, those contributions should answer any questions that may have lingered about his ability to make an impact in the playoffs.\n\nPius Suter: A\n\n6 GP, 2 goals + 0 assists = 2 points\n\nIn almost every game against the Predators, Suter found himself on the business end of at least one (and usually multiple) Grade-A scoring chances.\n\nThat the versatile forward struggled to finish his chances at times in Round 1 is really the only mark against him. He was, in all other respects, one of Vancouver's most impactful individual players.\n\nSuter's defensive awareness and hockey-level two-way IQ were essential components in helping the Miller line dominate play the way they did all series long. When things seem to be on the verge of breaking down, or after giveaways, it's often Suter who arrives first to put out or at least mitigate the fire.\n\nSuter's defensive game has brought a different level of robustness to the Miller line. That he had that kind of impact and then scored the series winner as well as another key goal to tie the score in the third period of Game 1 makes him one of Vancouver's single most important forwards from the opening round.\n\nIlya Mikheyev: D\n\n6 GP, 0 goals + 0 assists = 0 points\n\nMikheyev went without a point despite spending most of the series attached to Pettersson's hip. It's wild he's scored just one goal in his last 56 games given his regular top-six opportunity.\n\nThe speedy 29-year-old Russian looks incapable of finishing chances at the moment. He also still isn't contributing meaningfully to his line in the areas of the game in which he's typically excelled, like transporting play up the ice or forcing turnovers on the forecheck.\n\nTeddy Blueger: B-\n\n6 GP, 0 goals + 1 assists = 1 point\n\nBlueger probably would've played a bigger role in the first-round series if the Canucks had spent more time leading.\n\nAs it were, Vancouver regularly trailed (or were tied) in games throughout the series. That sort of limited Blueger's role five-on-five, even though he finished the series playing third-line minutes despite skating on the fourth line.\n\nNonetheless, Blueger's contributions were solid. His work on the penalty kill, in particular, was immense in helping Vancouver eliminate the Predators. And the fourth line that Blueger centres didn't give up a single goal against at five-on-five, even if, all told, it wasn't a significant factor in the series.\n\nPhil Di Giuseppe: C\n\n6 GP, 0 goals + 1 assist = 1 point\n\nDi Giuseppe was able to hang with the pace of Vancouver's first-round series, log a regular shift and pitch in an assist on Nikita Zadorov's 3-1 goal in Game 2.\n\nHis impact wasn't loud and Vancouver's fourth line didn't make a significant impact on the series -- it was wildly outshot, although it didn't surrender a goal against -- but Di Giuseppe's speed and all-around game helped permit the Canucks to keep playing their preferred brand of hockey when their star forwards took a breather. There's value in that, although they will need more from their down-lineup forwards against Edmonton.\n\nSam Lafferty: C\n\n6 GP, 0 points + 0 assists = 0 points\n\nRemember the first half of the season when Lafferty was legitimately impactful in a fourth-line role? Back then, his speed, size, physicality and secondary scoring were consistently noticeable and appeared to move the needle. From the second half onward, however, he's looked more and more like a fourth-line contributor.\n\nLafferty didn't make a mark on the forecheck, couldn't swing momentum with physicality and didn't generate chances, let alone any points in Round 1. He didn't seize an opportunity to play with Pettersson in Game 1 and he doesn't kill penalties, either. Lafferty won't hurt you when he's on the ice, which has real value at this time of year, but he's struggling to offer a distinct identity right now and the Canucks were ultimately outshot 24-13 during his five-on-five shifts.\n\nNils H\u00f6glander: C-\n\n6 GP, 0 goals + 0 assists = 0 points\n\nH\u00f6glander was a disappointment in the opening round. He went without a point in six games, generated just two shots on goal in the series and appeared to lose the coaching staff's trust at times as he averaged just 9:27 per game.\n\nThe scrappy, undersized 22-year-old winger didn't create enough havoc on the forecheck. When he did recover pucks in the corner, he couldn't translate it into offence -- he'd either get checked too easily or turn it over with an errant pass. H\u00f6glander was more noticeable in Game 5 but went fairly quiet again in Game 6.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "harman_dayal@theathletic.com", "name": "Harman Dayal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "thomas_drance@theathletic.com", "name": "Thomas Drance", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._T._Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

The former revealed before the postseason that he was fighting a sports hernia, while the latter is believed to be ailing from some unknown lower-body injury.\n\nOn Saturday, Oilers head coach Kris Knoblauch said that he expected both those players to be ready for Game 1 against the Vancouver Canucks, but that tune changed a little bit on Monday morning.\n\n\"We are hopeful they are available for Game 1,\" Knoblauch told reporters after practice. \"They were on in the morning [skating by themselves]... and we expect them to be on the ice for practice tomorrow.\"\n\nMattias Janmark was playing in Henrique's usual spot beside Connor McDavid and Zach Hyman on the Oilers' top line at practice. Connor Brown, who has yet to lace them up in a playoff game this season, was the placeholder for Kane on the second line with Leon Draisaitl and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins.\n\nWhen asked if that would be the forward lines IF Kane and Henrique can't play, Knoblauch was not quick to confirm either way.\n\n\"We don't know. We have a lot of guys that could fill in that spot,\" the rookie head coach explained. \"I guess the lines would be like that, but we expect those other guys to come back.\"\n\nLosing even one of those two players would be a big loss for the Oilers.

He led the way physically and could really get under the skin of the Kings.

They don't want to be asked anymore about it.\n\nThey know full well that the Vancouver Canucks swept the four games between the two teams in the regular season. They also know from experience that regular-season results mean nothing during the playoffs.\n\nYet, the Oilers can't shake the narrative heading into their Western Conference second-round series against the Canucks, which begins Wednesday in Vancouver.\n\n\"I don't know how much more we need to talk about this,\" said Leon Draisaitl, who was dominant in the Oilers first-round series win over the Los Angeles Kings. He had 10 points and was also a major part of the penalty-killing unit that didn't allow a goal in five games.\n\n\"We're going into Round 2 of the Stanley Cup playoffs. We don't care about what happened in the regular season. And I bet you that they don't either, as much as you think. We're a different team now. It's going to be tight-checking, with two really good teams going at it. The team that plays better hockey will win.\"\n\nDraisaitl referred to the fact that three of those Canucks wins over Edmonton -- including a season-opening 8-1 demolition -- came very early in the season, when the Oilers were undergoing a crisis that eventually cost former coach Jay Woodcroft his job.\n\nThe Oilers started the season 3-9-1 under Woodcroft. After coach Kris Knoblauch took over, the team went 46-18-5.\n\n\"It is old, for sure,\" Oilers defenceman Vincent Desharnais said of the season-series talk. \"It's been so long. People keep asking about it ... Those first three games were, like, six or seven months ago. We're a different team. And, at the end of the day, whatever happened in the regular season doesn't mean anything.\n\n\"The most important part is the first game on Wednesday, the rest doesn't matter.\"\n\nCore players like Draisaitl, Connor McDavid and defenceman Darnell Nurse know the \"regular season doesn't mean anything\" mantra all too well. Back in 2020-21, they were on the other side of this discussion, with the Oilers winning seven of nine regular-season games against the Winnipeg Jets, including all six final matchups, only to be swept by the Jets in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nThe Canucks-Oilers series is a de facto Canadian NHL championship, as the winner will be the final team standing from north of the border.\n\n\"It's exciting,\" said Draisaitl, comparing it to the Oilers' playoff series win over the Calgary Flames two seasons ago.\n\n\"The Battle of Alberta was great, it was a lot of fun to be part of. I'm sure this series will write its own story. We're ready.\"\n\nThe Oilers will have had a full week off by the time the second round starts on Wednesday, providing extra time for forwards Adam Henrique and Evander Kane to recover from whatever has been keeping them away from the ice. Both players missed Monday's practice, but Knoblauch expects both to be skating Tuesday.\n\n\"We are hopeful they are available for Game 1,\" said Knoblauch.\n\nIf one or both of them can't go, Knoblauch was noncommittal about how he may have to shuffle the lineup. Henrique played the first round as a winger on the top line with McDavid and Zach Hyman, while Kane moved up to the second unit to play with Draisaitl and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins.\n\n\"We got a lot of guys who can fill in that spot,\" said Knoblauch of the potential vacancy on McDavid's line. Mattias Janmark played there in practice.\n\n\"I don't think there's one guy who can play there and do it all, but I think we can maybe do it by committee. Different guys, different situations. We also have the opportunity of Zach Hyman playing left wing, if we need someone else to play right wing.\"\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published May 6, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "brandonsun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brandon Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Draisaitl", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leon Draisaitl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Knoblauch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kris Knoblauch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Canucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver Canucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Woodcroft", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jay Woodcroft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darnell_Nurse", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darnell Nurse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_McDavid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connor McDavid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Hyman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zach Hyman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Alberta", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Alberta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Henrique", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Henrique"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evander_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evander Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Nugent-Hopkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Nugent-Hopkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canadian_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Canadian Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary_Flames", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Calgary Flames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.brandonsun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/20240506160548-c07c6ecb69da3feb8676ca1745d55ffbacc56ef1c6a61cc340f270b1cfe662e0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542075", "eventUri": "eng-9542075", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 452724963, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 29, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 29}}}

It's not like they put on a clinic in that series. Demko is hurt and Pettersson was basically invisible for all five games.\"\n\nIt's a valid argument.\n\nWhile they didn't exactly score a lot of style points in winning against the Predators, a couple of things happened which both could be a harbinger of great things to come.\n\nFirst off, the Canucks were down to their third string goaltender in game six with Arturs Silovs and won that contest 1-0. Not too many NHL teams can start their third-string goalie and come up with a win - never mind in a playoff-clinching game on the road.\n\nThen there's the comeback.\n\nDown 3-1 with three minutes remaining in the third period of game four, the Canucks got a couple of goals from Brock Boeser to tie it and then won it on Elias Lindholm's goal in overtime to take a commanding three-games-to-one lead in the series.\n\nIt was a surreal moment, an improbable comeback that could be the one thing that galvanizes the team moving forward.\n\nIt's kind of a yin and yang in the world of sports.\n\nThe yin is there are teams that always find a way to lose. They get a bad break or two against them and they go into the \"here we go again\" mode. Those teams lack confidence in critical situations and aren't successful.\n\nThen there's the yang part. Those are the teams that always believe they are going to find a way to win no matter what the circumstances.\n\nAfter the series against Nashville, which category do you think the Canucks fall into?\n\nI'm not guaranteeing that the Canucks will win the Stanley Cup but when teams have moments that bring them together early in the playoffs, some special things can happen.\n\nLook at the Florida Panthers last year in the opening round against the Boston Bruins. Down three games to one, the Panthers won three consecutive games with two of those wins coming in overtime. The Panthers went on to the Stanley Cup Finals before they lost to the Vegas Golden Knights.\n\nProbably the best example of this by a Canuck team was in 1994, when down three games to one against the Calgary Flames in their opening round series, the Canucks somehow prevailed by winning three consecutive games in overtime.\n\nBuoyed by that confidence, they advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals before they lost to the New York Rangers.\n\nWith Vancouver facing Edmonton in the second round, the Canucks have a good matchup. Yes, the Oilers are a highly-skilled team with arguably the world's best player in Connor McDavid but they don't play as physical of a game as Nashville. The Oilers are similar to the Canucks in that they love to run-and-gun, which actually bodes well for Vancouver if they can maintain their defensive structure.\n\nIt won't be easy beating the Oilers but the Canucks have been hardened by their series against Nashville. They've played with a third string goalie and won. They won by winning three games in an opposing rink. They won by not playing their best hockey at times.\n\nThe bottom line?\n\nThey found a way to win.\n\nOVERTIME\n\n* \"I think we've had ten guys that have never played a playoff round. I think there are a couple of guys early on...it wasn't overwhelming but it was like 'wow, this is playoff hockey\" and it took them awhile to figure it out. I think this round might help these guys figure it out that \"OK. Now I know what playoff hockey is about.\" Hopefully going into this round we can loosen up a little bit more. Our team sometimes played a little too tight the last series. Saying that, you still have to have the same staples and the same attitude when it comes to playoff hockey. I think getting out of the round winning is going to loosen some guys up - I do,\" said Canucks head coach Rick Tocchet.\n\n* Tocchet believes his blueline corps was instrumental in the first-round win over Nashville and will play a key role against the Oilers. \"Our defence held the fort for us, experience-wise. When things got crazy out there, I thought they held it together...The experience helped us that round,\" said Tocchet.\n\n* Tocchet has been named as a finalist for the Jack Adams Award as the NHL's Coach of the Year along with Winnipeg's Rick Bowness and Nashville's Andrew Brunette.\n\n* Elias Pettersson is up for the Lady Byng Trophy given to the \"player adjudged to have exhibited the best type of sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct combined with a high standard of playing ability.\" Carolina's Jaccob Slavin and Toronto's Auston Matthews are also finalists.\n\n* The schedule for the second round series is as follows: Friday May 10 - 8 p.m. in Vancouver; Sunday May 12 - TBD in Edmonton; Tuesday May 14 - TBD in Edmonton; Thursday May 16 - TBD in Vancouver; Saturday May 18 - TBD in Edmonton; Monday May 20 - TBD in Vancouver.\n\nVeteran B.C. sports personality Bob \"the Moj\" Marjanovich writes twice weekly for Black Press Media.\n\nREAD MORE: Oilers, Canucks start NHL playoff

It's not like they put on a clinic in that series. Demko is hurt and Pettersson was basically invisible for all five games.\"\n\nIt's a valid argument.\n\nWhile they didn't exactly score a lot of style points in winning against the Predators, a couple of things happened which both could be a harbinger of great things to come.\n\nFirst off, the Canucks were down to their third string goaltender in game six with Arturs Silovs and won that contest 1-0. Not too many NHL teams can start their third-string goalie and come up with a win - never mind in a playoff-clinching game on the road.\n\nThen there's the comeback.\n\nDown 3-1 with three minutes remaining in the third period of game four, the Canucks got a couple of goals from Brock Boeser to tie it and then won it on Elias Lindholm's goal in overtime to take a commanding three-games-to-one lead in the series.\n\nIt was a surreal moment, an improbable comeback that could be the one thing that galvanizes the team moving forward.\n\nIt's kind of a yin and yang in the world of sports.\n\nThe yin is there are teams that always find a way to lose. They get a bad break or two against them and they go into the \"here we go again\" mode. Those teams lack confidence in critical situations and aren't successful.\n\nThen there's the yang part. Those are the teams that always believe they are going to find a way to win no matter what the circumstances.\n\nAfter the series against Nashville, which category do you think the Canucks fall into?\n\nI'm not guaranteeing that the Canucks will win the Stanley Cup but when teams have moments that bring them together early in the playoffs, some special things can happen.\n\nLook at the Florida Panthers last year in the opening round against the Boston Bruins. Down three games to one, the Panthers won three consecutive games with two of those wins coming in overtime. The Panthers went on to the Stanley Cup Finals before they lost to the Vegas Golden Knights.\n\nProbably the best example of this by a Canuck team was in 1994, when down three games to one against the Calgary Flames in their opening round series, the Canucks somehow prevailed by winning three consecutive games in overtime.\n\nBuoyed by that confidence, they advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals before they lost to the New York Rangers.\n\nWith Vancouver facing Edmonton in the second round, the Canucks have a good matchup. Yes, the Oilers are a highly-skilled team with arguably the world's best player in Connor McDavid but they don't play as physical of a game as Nashville. The Oilers are similar to the Canucks in that they love to run-and-gun, which actually bodes well for Vancouver if they can maintain their defensive structure.\n\nIt won't be easy beating the Oilers but the Canucks have been hardened by their series against Nashville. They've played with a third string goalie and won. They won by winning three games in an opposing rink. They won by not playing their best hockey at times.\n\nThe bottom line?\n\nThey found a way to win.\n\nOVERTIME\n\n* \"I think we've had ten guys that have never played a playoff round. I think there are a couple of guys early on...it wasn't overwhelming but it was like 'wow, this is playoff hockey\" and it took them awhile to figure it out. I think this round might help these guys figure it out that \"OK. Now I know what playoff hockey is about.\" Hopefully going into this round we can loosen up a little bit more. Our team sometimes played a little too tight the last series. Saying that, you still have to have the same staples and the same attitude when it comes to playoff hockey. I think getting out of the round winning is going to loosen some guys up - I do,\" said Canucks head coach Rick Tocchet.\n\n* Tocchet believes his blueline corps was instrumental in the first-round win over Nashville and will play a key role against the Oilers. \"Our defence held the fort for us, experience-wise. When things got crazy out there, I thought they held it together...The experience helped us that round,\" said Tocchet.\n\n* Tocchet has been named as a finalist for the Jack Adams Award as the NHL's Coach of the Year along with Winnipeg's Rick Bowness and Nashville's Andrew Brunette.\n\n* Elias Pettersson is up for the Lady Byng Trophy given to the \"player adjudged to have exhibited the best type of sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct combined with a high standard of playing ability.\" Carolina's Jaccob Slavin and Toronto's Auston Matthews are also finalists.\n\n* The schedule for the second round series is as follows: Friday May 10 - 8 p.m. in Vancouver; Sunday May 12 - TBD in Edmonton; Tuesday May 14 - TBD in Edmonton; Thursday May 16 - TBD in Vancouver; Saturday May 18 - TBD in Edmonton; Monday May 20 - TBD in Vancouver.\n\nVeteran B.C. sports personality Bob \"the Moj\" Marjanovich writes twice weekly for Black Press Media.\n\nREAD MORE: Oilers, Canucks start NHL playoff

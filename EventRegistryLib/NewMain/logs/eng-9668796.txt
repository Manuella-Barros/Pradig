Neil Friske was arrested early Thursday morning here on undisclosed charges after police responded to \"a report of a male with a gun, as well as possible shots that were fired,\" according to the Lansing Police Department.\n\nJordan Gulkis, a spokeswoman for the Lansing Police Department, said officers were dispatched to the 2100 block of Forest Road in Lansing, near where public records show Friske owns a home, \"Our officers quickly responded and made contact with all the parties involved,\" Gulkis said.\n\nGulkis said Friske, the Charlevoix Republican, was arrested shortly at 2:45 a.m. Thursday \"for a felon-level offense,\" Gulkis said.\n\nThe Ingham County Prosecutor's Office is reviewing charges, Gulkis said, and Friske is expected to be arraigned Friday or Saturday if charges are authorized. Officials at the Ingham County jail said Thursday morning that Friske is currently being held at the Lansing Police Department lockup.\n\nIngham County Prosecutor John Dewane said Thursday morning he had not yet received a warrant request from Lansing police but expected one was coming.\n\nAround midday Thursday, Friske's campaign published a statement on his Facebook page responding to the arrest that suggested a firearm was involved.\n\n\"As many of us know, Rep Friske is always exercising his 2nd Amendment right,\" the Friske campaign said in a statement. \"... We ask everyone for prayers and to stay tuned from updates directly from this campaign or Representative Friske himself. Thank you for the outpouring of concern and unwavering support we have received this morning. Clearly, Rep. Friske is over the target in this race.\"\n\nFriske faces a Republican primary election challenge in August primary against Parker Fairbairn of Harbor Springs.\n\nFairbairn, in a statement, said Friske is presumed innocent until proven guilty of any alleged crime. Friske has an \"abysmal and immoral voting record,\" Fairbairn said.\n\n\"He voted against protecting spouses from marital rape, voted against making child marriage illegal, voted against tax cuts for veterans -- and just this past week, he voted against making it illegal to create AI 'deep fake' pornography using the likeness of our daughters and wives,\" Fairbairn said. \"Neil deserves his time in court, and the people of the 107th District deserve better than Neil.\"\n\nForty minutes after Lansing police said Friske was arrested, at 3:25 a.m., Friske had two tweets posted to his X account (formerly Twitter) referencing legislation banning the use of artificial intelligence for producing pornography without the consent of the individual in the image.\n\n\"I'm not going to cave to the pressure of special interest. I'm not afraid of the false accusations, like 'Friske is for AI Porn' when a bill denies THE PEOPLE their rights to properly defend themselves,\" Friske tweeted at 3:25 a.m.\n\nIn a second tweet at 3:26 a.m., Friske added: \"... My opponent has made it clear that he will work with the Democrats, and all he can do is try and discredit my pro-freedom voting record.\"\n\nFriske was one of just two representatives in the 110-member House to vote against the legislation last week.\n\nOn the House floor Thursday morning, Speaker Joe Tate, D-Detroit, told reporters he had just been informed of Friske's arrest, but had no immediate comment until more details are released by Lansing police.\n\nFriske is one of the most conservative members of the lower chamber and is part of the House Freedom Caucus. He and his brother run Friske Orchards in Ellsworth, according to Friske's biography, and is owner of Friske & Sons Property Management.\n\nThe lawmaker's biography indicates he \"serves in the local church where he worships\" and is a member of Right to Life, the National Rifle Association, Michigan United Conservation Clubs and Farm Bureau.\n\n-------\n\n\u00a92024 www.detroitnews.com.

Neil Friske, R-Charlevoix, was arrested for an alleged felony-level offense following the incident, according to Lansing police. The Ingham County Prosecutor's Office is expected to review the case Friday for possible charges.\n\nThe incident unfolded around 2:45 a.m. Thursday, June 20, when Lansing police received reports of a man with a gun and possible shots fired in a neighborhood off of Forest Road between Aurelius Road and I-496, according to Lansing Police Department spokesperson Jordan Gulkis.\n\nThe police spokesperson has not released details about what led up to the possible shots fired.\n\nIngham County property records show Friske owns a home in the neighborhood.\n\nLansing police officers talked with everyone involved and arrested Friske, 62. Gulkis said no further information about the incident is being released at this time.\n\nRelated: State lawmaker arrested in Lansing on undisclosed charges\n\nIn a statement on social media Thursday afternoon, Friske's campaign said the lawmaker is \"always exercising his 2nd Amendment right\" and that they know nothing about the incident other than what has been reported in the media.\n\nThe campaign called the timing of the incident \"highly suspect\" and suggested it is related to Friske's reelection campaign and his upcoming Aug. 6 primary battle against a Republican opponent who they allege has \"deep-state ties.\"\n\n\"We ask everyone for prayers and to stay tuned for updates directly from this campaign or Representative Friske himself,\" campaign officials wrote. \"Thank you for the outpouring of concern and unwavering support we have received this morning. Clearly, Rep. Friske is over the target in this race.\"\n\nFriske is serving out his first term in the state House. He was elected to the seat representing all of Charlevoix and Emmet counties and portions of Cheboygan, Chippewa, and Mackinac counties in 2022.\n\nFriske is up for reelection this year and faces one challenger, Parker Fairbairn, in the Aug. 6 Republican primary. In a statement, Fairbairn said Friske should be presumed innocent until proven guilty.\n\nHowever, Fairbairn said, the people of his district deserve better than Friske and his voting record.\n\n\"I'm running against Neil because he has an abysmal and immoral voting record, and the families of the 107th District deserve better,\" Fairbairn wrote. \"Since going to Lansing, Neil has voted against nearly every pro-family and conservative value issue that he's had the chance to vote on.\n\n\"He voted against protecting spouses from marital rape, voted against making child marriage illegal, voting against tax cuts for veterans -- and just this past week, he voted against making it illegal to create AI 'deepfake' pornography using the likeness of our daughters and wives. Neil deserves his time in court, and the people of the 107th District deserve better than Neil.\"\n\nFairbairn is a small business owner, according to his campaign page.\n\nFriske is a member of the highly conservative House Freedom Caucus and owner of Friske and Sons Property Management.\n\nAccording to Friske's biography, he serves at his local church and is a member of the National Rifle

Some of the other efforts from the group have included bolstering U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's power in Michigan.\n\nDuring his first term in office, Friske has introduced efforts to repeal the voter-approved right to an abortion and require libraries that make \"obscene or sexually explicit matter that is harmful to minors\" to have an age-restricted where the materials can be viewed.\n\nRecently, Friske and his fellow Freedom Caucus colleague, Rep. Steve Carra (R-Three Rivers), were the sole no votes against legislation to criminalize non-consensual deep fake pornography, which commonly is used to blackmail and shame women, but is also used to create nude images of minors.\n\nFriske is facing a primary challenge from Parker Fairbairn of Harbor Springs in the Aug. 6 GOP primary. The winner will face Democrat Jodi Decker in November in the GOP-favored district.\n\nIn a post on one of Friske's Facebook accounts Thursday, an official statement from his reelection campaign noted that the timing of the incident is \"highly suspect\" considering it's before voters will get their absentee ballots for the upcoming primary for the November election for all the seats in the state House.\n\n\"This morning, it was brought to our attention that Representative Friske was arrested and being held.

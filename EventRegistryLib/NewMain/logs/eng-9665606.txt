Rape, antisemitism: Everything is abominable in this crime committed in Courbevoie against a 12-year-old girl,\" Belloubet tweeted on Wednesday. She added, \"Justice, School, Republic: a single response against barbarism.\"\n\nTwo 13-year-old boys were indicted on Tuesday on multiple charges including rape as well as because of the victim's religious affiliation in connection to the incident, which took place on Saturday night. A third boy, aged 12, was charged with offenses related to witnessing the alleged crime.\n\nThe French newspaper Le Monde called the police report, which included testimony from the girl and from investigating officers, \"unbearable\" in its details.\n\nTwo of the teenagers accused of participating admitted to being motivated by the victim's identity, according to the report, with one saying he had been angry that she had hidden her religion from him and another saying he had resented her comments about Palestine. (The reports did not specify details about the comments.) One of the boys called her a \"dirty Jew,\" according to multiple reports about the incident.\n\nThe incident has drawn recriminations from people across France and beyond who say it reflects deep problems in French society. \"We have the impression that French society has resigned itself to antisemitism,\" Yonathan Arfi, president of CRIF, an umbrella organization of French Jewish institutions, said on TV Thursday.\n\nIn recent years, French Jews have been victim to several high-profile acts of antisemitism, and communal leaders have lamented feeling increasingly unsafe in the country, which has one of Europe's largest Jewish populations. CRIF, like its counterparts in other countries, reported a spike in reported antisemitic incidents following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel and amid the subsequent Israel-Hamas war.\n\nHaim Korsia, France's chief rabbi, tweeted that he was \"horrified\" by the alleged rape. \"Justice must firmly sanction the perpetrators of this despicable act,\" Korsia wrote.\n\nThe incident comes as French politics are in turmoil after Macron, a centrist, called for elections following a strong showing by far-right parties in European Union elections earlier this month. The dynamic has resulted in an unprecedented embrace by the traditional conservative party of a far-right party, National Rally, that was founded by a convicted Holocaust denier, leading some French Jews to express fears.\n\nThis week, National Rally withdrew its support for a local candidate who said in a now-deleted 2018 tweet that \"gas did justice for the victims of the Holocaust.\"\n\nAnd Marine Le Pen, the leader of National Rally, joined politicians from across the political spectrum in denouncing the rape -- and pointing fingers about the cause.\n\n\"The antisemitic attack and the rape of a 12-year-old child in Hauts-de-Seine revolt us,\" Le Pen tweeted. \"The explosion of antisemitic acts, up 300% compared to the first three months of 2023, must alert all French people: the stigmatization of Jews for months by the far left through the instrumentalization of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a real threat to civil peace. Everyone should be fully aware of this on June 30 and July 7,\" when elections are scheduled.\n\nJean-Luc Melechon, who heads the far-left party France Unbowed, also denounced the alleged attack, saying he hoped it would not become a \"media spectacle\" during the election season. His party has been accused of stoking antisemitism in its aggressive opposition to the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\"Horrified by this rape in Courbevoie and everything it highlights regarding the conditioning of criminal male behavior from a young age, and antisemitic racism,\" Melenchon tweeted.\n\nLeading members of Macron's party also took aim at Melenchon in their public comments.\n\n\"Faced with such a tragedy ... of course I imagine that all the major politicians condemn it, including Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon,\" Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who has Jewish ancestry, said at a press conference on Thursday, according to Politico. \"But what I also want to say is that since Oct. 7, we've seen a form of unbridled antisemitism develop and break free. And I think that political leaders and political parties have a responsibility to put up barriers, to prevent a certain amount of rhetoric from becoming commonplace.\"", "source": {"uri": "jta.org",

It would be the first far-right force to lead a French government since the Nazi occupation.\n\nFar-left figures, meanwhile, have faced accusations of antisemitism linked to their response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the ensuing war.\n\nConcerns came to the fore after two adolescent boys in a Paris suburb were given preliminary charges this week of raping a 12-year-old girl and religion-motivated violence, according to prosecutors. Lawyer and Jewish leader Elie Korchia told French broadcaster BFM that the girl is Jewish and that the word Palestine was mentioned during the attack.\n\nHundreds of people gathered Thursday evening around the Bastille monument in Paris to protest against antisemitism, in the second straight night of demonstrations.\n\nFrance has the largest Jewish population in Europe, but given its own World War II collaboration with the Nazis, antisemitic acts today open old scars. France also has the largest Muslim population in western Europe, and anti-Muslim acts have risen in recent years.\n\nPoliticians from all sides were quick to comment on the attack, notably after a surge in antisemitic acts in France since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nFrench Prime Minister Gabriel Attal wrote on X that the girl was \"raped because she's Jewish,\" while French President Emmanuel Macron called on schools to hold a \"discussion hour\" on racism and antisemitism.\n\nJordan Bardella, president of the National Rally, said that if elected he would \"fight the antisemitism that has been plaguing France since Oct. 7.\" In the wake of reports of the attack, Bardella announced that his party was withdrawing support for one of its candidates over an antisemitic message on social media posted in 2018.\n\nHis predecessor as party president and the National Rally's 2022 presidential candidate, Marine Le Pen, accused the \"extreme left\" of \"stigmatization of Jews\" and of \"instrumentalizing\" the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nLeftist leader Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon denounced \"antisemitic racism,\" though the France Unbowed party which he formerly led has itself faced accusations of antisemitism linked to the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nAri\u00e9 Alimi, lawyer and vice-president of the League of Human Rights, called for a united front against the far right.\n\n\"For some time now there is an awareness that there is antisemitism also on the left and that we need to address it,'' he said at Thursday's demonstration. ''Today it's the camp of the left, of progressives that is gathered with all people who are worried by antisemitism and all kinds of racism in France, in a particular political moment with a far right that could possibly come to power.''\n\nAlthough the alleged rape has heightened tensions regarding antisemitism in France before the June 30 and July 7 two-round parliamentary election, it is far from a new issue in French politics.\n\nMore than 180,000 people across France, marched in November to protest rising antisemitism in the wake of Israel's ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nAlong with then-Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne and representatives of several other parties, Le Pen attended the march amid fierce criticism that her once-pariah National Rally party had failed to shake off its antisemitic heritage despite growing political legitimacy.\n\nBorne, the daughter of a Jewish Holocaust survivor, tweeted that \"the presence of the National Rally is not fooling anyone.\"\n\nParty founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marine Le Pen's father, was convicted repeatedly of antisemitic hate speech and played down the scope of the Holocaust. Marine Le Pen -- runner-up in the last two presidential elections and likely a top contender in 2027 -- has worked to scrub the party's image, kicking her father out and changing its name from National Front to National Rally.\n\nAttal announced in May that \"366 antisemitic acts\" were recorded between January and March this year, an increase of 300% compared to the first three months of 2023.\n\nMorton reported from London.", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Santa Maria Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@santamariatimes.com", "name":

According to French media, the assailants called the victim a \"dirty Jew\" and uttered other antisemitic remarks during the brutal gang-rape.\n\nA police source told AFP that one of the boys asked the young girl questions about \"her Jewish religion\" and Israel, citing the child's statement to investigators.\n\nThe boys -- two aged 13 and one 12 -- were arrested on Monday and indicted on Tuesday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Macron's office said the president asked French Education Minister Nicole Belloubet \"to organize a discussion in all schools on the fight against antisemitism and racism, to prevent hate speech with serious consequences from infiltrating schools.\"\n\nThe rape of the unnamed 12-year-old girl has caused outrage throughout France and among the Jewish community.\n\nElie Korchia, president of France's Central Israelite Consistory, told BFM TV that the girl was raped \"because she is Jewish,\" adding, \"We have never seen antisemitism that extends so far in all areas of life.\"\n\nCourbevoie Mayor Jacques Kossowski echoed that sentiment in a statement released on X/Twitter, saying, \"The rape was carried out with antisemitic intent.\"\n\nEric Ciotti, leader of Les R\u00e9publicains, also condemned the \"rise of antisemitism\" in France, which he argued was \"fueled by the alliance of the far left.\" He added that \"we must act as a bulwark\" against antisemitism.\n\nMarine Le Pen, leader of the right-wing National Rally party, decried the rape on social media. She noted \"the explosion of antisemitic acts\" in France since Oct. 7.\n\nThe recent gang-rape came amid a record surge of antisemitism in France in the wake of Hamas' Oct. 7 massacre across southern Israel. Antisemitic outrages rose by over 1,000 percent in the final three months of 2023 compared with the previous year, with over 1,200 incidents reported -- greater than the total number of incidents in France for the previous three years combined.", "source": {"uri": "algemeiner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Algemeiner"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hate crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courbevoie", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Courbevoie"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Courbevoie"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelites", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israelites"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BFM_TV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BFM TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judaism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_in_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism in France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Rally"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republicans_(France)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Republicans (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Kossowski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacques Kossowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c9ric_Ciotti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u00c9ric Ciotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Le_Pen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marine Le Pen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Rape", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Rape", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://www.algemeiner.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-06-19T154242Z_1_LYNXMPEK5I0HF_RTROPTP_4_FRANCE-ANTISEMITISM1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665606", "eventUri": "eng-9665606", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1979, "textEnd": 1985, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.615686274509804, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Rape, antisemitism: Everything is abominable in this crime committed in Courbevoie against a 12-year-old girl,\" Belloubet tweeted. She added, \"Justice, School, Republic: a single response against barbarism.\"\n\nTwo 13-year-old boys were indicted on June 18th on multiple charges including rape as well as because of the victim's religious affiliation in connection to the incident, which took place on Saturday night. A third boy, aged 12, was charged with offenses related to witnessing the alleged crime.\n\nThe French newspaper Le Monde called the police report, which included testimony from the girl and from investigating officers, \"unbearable\" in its details.\n\nTwo of the teenagers accused of participating admitted to being motivated by the victim's identity, according to the report, with one saying he had been angry that she had hidden her religion from him and another saying he had resented her comments about Palestine. (The reports did not specify details about the comments.) One of the boys called her a \"dirty Jew,\" according to multiple reports about the incident.\n\nThe incident has drawn recriminations from people across France and beyond who say it reflects deep problems in French society. \"We have the impression that French society has resigned itself to antisemitism,\" Yonathan Arfi, president of CRIF, an umbrella organization of French Jewish institutions, said on TV.\n\nIn recent years, French Jews have been victim to several high-profile acts of antisemitism, and communal leaders have lamented feeling increasingly unsafe in the country, which has one of Europe's largest Jewish populations. CRIF, like its counterparts in other countries, reported a spike in reported antisemitic incidents following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel and amid the subsequent Israel-Hamas war.\n\nHaim Korsia, France's chief rabbi, tweeted that he was \"horrified\" by the alleged rape. \"Justice must firmly sanction the perpetrators of this despicable act,\" Korsia wrote.\n\nThe incident comes as French politics are in turmoil after Macron, a centrist, called for elections following a strong showing by far-right parties in European Union elections earlier this month. The dynamic has resulted in an unprecedented embrace by the traditional conservative party of a far-right party, National Rally, that was founded by a convicted Holocaust denier, leading some French Jews to express fears.\n\nNational Rally withdrew its support for a local candidate who said in a now-deleted 2018 tweet that \"gas did justice for the victims of the Holocaust.\"\n\nAnd Marine Le Pen, the leader of National Rally, joined politicians from across the political spectrum in denouncing the rape -- and pointing fingers about the cause.\n\n\"The antisemitic attack and the rape of a 12-year-old child in Hauts-de-Seine revolt us,\" Le Pen tweeted. \"The explosion of antisemitic acts, up 300% compared to the first three months of 2023, must alert all French people: the stigmatization of Jews for months by the far left through the instrumentalization of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a real threat to civil peace. Everyone should be fully aware of this on June 30 and July 7,\" when elections are scheduled.\n\nJean-Luc Melechon, who heads the far-left party France Unbowed, also denounced the alleged attack, saying he hoped it would not become a \"media spectacle\" during the election season. His party has been accused of stoking antisemitism in its aggressive opposition to the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\"Horrified by this rape in Courbevoie and everything it highlights regarding the conditioning of criminal male behavior from a young age, and antisemitic racism,\" Melenchon tweeted.\n\nLeading members of Macron's party also took aim at Melenchon in their public comments.\n\n\"Faced with such a tragedy ... of course I imagine that all the major politicians condemn it, including Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon,\" Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who has Jewish ancestry, said at a press conference on Thursday, according to Politico. \"But what I also want to say is that since Oct. 7, we've seen a form of unbridled antisemitism develop and break free. And I think that political leaders and political parties have a responsibility to put up barriers, to prevent a certain amount of rhetoric from becoming commonplace.\"", "source": {"uri":

It would be the first far-right force to lead a French government since the Nazi occupation.\n\nFar-left figures, meanwhile, have faced accusations of antisemitism linked to their response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the ensuing war.\n\nConcerns came to the fore after two adolescent boys in a Paris suburb were given preliminary charges this week of raping a 12-year-old girl and religion-motivated violence, according to prosecutors. Lawyer and Jewish leader Elie Korchia told French broadcaster BFM that the girl is Jewish and that the word Palestine was mentioned during the attack.\n\nPoliticians from all sides were quick to comment on the attack, which elicited widespread shock and concern, notably after a surge in antisemitic acts in France since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nFrance has the largest Jewish population in Europe, but given its own World War II collaboration with the Nazis, antisemitic acts today open old scars. France also has the largest Muslim population in western Europe, and anti-Muslim acts have risen in recent years.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, hundreds of people gathered in front of Paris City Hall to protest antisemitism. Many in the crowd were holding placards, including some bearing the slogan \"raped because she's Jewish.\" Further protests are planned for Thursday evening at Place de la Bastille.\n\nFrench Prime Minister Gabriel Attal wrote on X that the girl was \"raped because she's Jewish,\" identifying it as an antisemitic attack, while French President Emmanuel Macron called on schools to hold a \"discussion hour\" on racism and antisemitism.\n\nJordan Bardella, president of the National Rally, said that if elected he would \"fight the antisemitism that has been plaguing France since Oct. 7.\" In the wake of reports of the attack, Bardella announced that his party was withdrawing support for one of its candidates over an antisemitic message on social media posted in 2018.\n\nHis predecessor as party president and the National Rally's 2022 presidential candidate, Marine Le Pen, accused the \"extreme left\" of \"stigmatization of Jews\" and of \"instrumentalizing\" the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nLeftist leader Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon denounced \"antisemitic racism,\" though the France Unbowed party which he formerly led has itself faced accusations of antisemitism linked to the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nAlthough the alleged rape has heightened tensions regarding antisemitism in France before the June 30 and July 7 two-round parliamentary election, it is far from a new issue in French politics.\n\nMore than 180,000 people across France, including 100,000 in Paris, marched in November to protest rising antisemitism in the wake of Israel's ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza -- the biggest gathering to denounce antisemitism in France since a 1990 demonstration against the desecration of a Jewish cemetery.\n\nAlong with then-Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne and representatives of several other parties, Le Pen attended the march amid fierce criticism that her once-pariah National Rally party had failed to shake off its antisemitic heritage despite growing political legitimacy.\n\nBorne, who is the daughter of a Jewish Holocaust survivor, tweeted that \"the presence of the National Rally is not fooling anyone.\"\n\nParty founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marine Le Pen's father, was convicted repeatedly of antisemitic hate speech and played down the scope of the Holocaust. Marine Le Pen -- runner-up in the last two presidential elections and likely a top contender in 2027 -- has worked to scrub the party's image, kicking her father out and changing its name from National Front to National Rally.\n\nAttal announced in May that \"366 antisemitic acts\" were recorded between January and March this year, an increase of 300% compared to the first three months of 2023.\n\nMorton reported from London.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@register-herald.com",

It would be the first far-right force to lead a French government since the Nazi occupation.\n\nFar-left figures, meanwhile, have faced accusations of antisemitism linked to their response to Hamas\u00b4 Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the ensuing war.\n\nConcerns came to the fore after two adolescent boys in a Paris suburb were given preliminary charges this week of raping a 12-year-old girl and religion-motivated violence, according to prosecutors. Lawyer and Jewish leader Elie Korchia told French broadcaster BFM that the girl is Jewish and that the word Palestine was mentioned during the attack.\n\nPoliticians from all sides were quick to comment on the attack, which elicited widespread shock and concern, notably after a surge in antisemitic acts in France since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nFrance has the largest Jewish population in Europe, but given its own World War II collaboration with the Nazis, antisemitic acts today open old scars. France also has the largest Muslim population in western Europe, and anti-Muslim acts have risen in recent years.\n\nAnti far-left protesters display a banner that reads, \"antisemitism is not a campaign promise\" next to the entrance where the media conference will take place of the leaders of France left-wing parties for the upcoming election in Paris, Friday, June 14, 2024. Leaders of France's left-wing parties, allied in a coalition known as the New Popular Front on Friday outlined their plan to fend off the far-right from claiming power at the upcoming snap national election. (AP Photo/Thomas Padilla)\n\nOn Wednesday evening, hundreds of people gathered in front of Paris City Hall to protest antisemitism. Many in the crowd were holding placards, including some bearing the slogan \"raped because she\u00b4s Jewish.\" Further protests are planned for Thursday evening at Place de la Bastille.\n\nFrench Prime Minister Gabriel Attal wrote on X that the girl was \"raped because she\u00b4s Jewish,\" identifying it as an antisemitic attack, while French President Emmanuel Macron called on schools to hold a \"discussion hour\" on racism and antisemitism.\n\nJordan Bardella, president of the National Rally, said that if elected he would \"fight the antisemitism that has been plaguing France since Oct. 7.\" In the wake of reports of the attack, Bardella announced that his party was withdrawing support for one of its candidates over an antisemitic message on social media posted in 2018.\n\nHis predecessor as party president and the National Rally\u00b4s 2022 presidential candidate, Marine Le Pen, accused the \"extreme left\" of \"stigmatization of Jews\" and of \"instrumentalizing\" the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nLeftist leader Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon denounced \"antisemitic racism,\" though the France Unbowed party which he formerly led has itself faced accusations of antisemitism linked to the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nAlthough the alleged rape has heightened tensions regarding antisemitism in France before the June 30 and July 7 two-round parliamentary election, it is far from a new issue in French politics.\n\nMore than 180,000 people across France, including 100,000 in Paris, marched in November to protest rising antisemitism in the wake of Israel\u00b4s ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza - the biggest gathering to denounce antisemitism in France since a 1990 demonstration against the desecration of a Jewish cemetery.\n\nAlong with then-Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne and representatives of several other parties, Le Pen attended the march amid fierce criticism that her once-pariah National Rally party had failed to shake off its antisemitic heritage despite growing political legitimacy.\n\nBorne, who is the daughter of a Jewish Holocaust survivor, tweeted that \"the presence of the National Rally is not fooling anyone.\"\n\nParty founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marine Le Pen\u00b4s father, was convicted repeatedly of antisemitic hate speech and played down the scope of the Holocaust. Marine Le Pen - runner-up in the last two presidential elections and likely a top contender in 2027 - has worked to scrub the party\u00b4s image, kicking her father out and changing its name from National Front to National Rally.\n\nAttal announced in May that \"366 antisemitic acts\" were recorded between January and March this year, an increase of 300% compared to the first three months of 2023.\n\nMorton reported from London.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

At least one was known to her.\n\nThe victim said the boys dragged her away to an isolated location before hurling antisemitic abuse at her and raping her.\n\nThe incident has been described by French police as a hate crime.\n\nThe boys were arrested on Monday and two of them were charged with gang rape, antisemitic insults and violence, and issuing death threats.\n\nFrench media also reported that one of the attackers threatened to kill the girl if she went to the police.\n\nMr Macron talked about the Courbevoie attack during a Council of Ministers meeting on Wednesday, where he meets with the members of his government.\n\nHe asked the Minister of Education, Nicole Belloubet, to ensure that over the next few days schools hold a dialogue on the topics of racism and hatred of Jews to prevent \"hateful speech with serious consequences\" from \"infiltrating\" classrooms.\n\nMs Belloubet later wrote on X: \"There is no limit to horror... Rape, antisemitism: every part of this crime is revolting.\"\n\nChief Rabbi of France Haim Korsia said he was \"horrified\".\n\n\"Justice must firmly punish the perpetrators of this despicable act. No one can be excused from this unprecedented antisemitic surge,\" Mr Korsia wrote on X.\n\nA January 2024 report by the Council of Jewish Institutions in France (CRIF) said there had been a 284% increase of antisemitic acts in France between 2022 and 2023.\n\nIt also said that nearly 13% of such acts last year took place in schools. A significant spike was reported in the wake of the 7 October Hamas attacks against communities in Israel.\n\nFrance is in the middle of a heated election campaign after President Macron called a snap parliamentary election two weeks ago, and politicians from all sides were quick to weigh in.\n\nJean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, leader of the far-left France Unbowed (LFI) party, denounced \"anti-Semitic racism\".\n\nMarine Le Pen, the president of the far-right National Rally (RN), urged voters to keep in mind the \"stigmatisation of Jews by the far left\" when they go to the polls later this

No one can be excused from this unprecedented antisemitic surge,\" Korsia wrote on X.\n\nOne of the suspects was allegedly the victim's ex-boyfriend who planned revenge against her after she supposedly hid from him the fact that she was Jewish, according to the local Le Parisien newspaper.\n\nLawyer and Jewish leader Elie Korchia told French broadcaster BFM that the war in Gaza was referenced during the attack.\n\nAfter the attack, the girl was warned not to go to the police and the main assailant demanded she pay them 200 euros, or $215, \"otherwise something bad would happen to her and her family because he knows where she is,\" Le Parisien reports.\n\nThe attackers -- ages 12, 13 and 14 -- were all arrested.\n\nTwo of the boys were charged with aggravated gang rape on a minor younger than 15, violence and public insult motivated by religion, death threats, attempted extortion and unlawfully recording or broadcasting sexual images.\n\nThe two teens accused of participating in the rape are being held in custody and the third boy was placed in a special education program for assisting in the vile act.\n\nThe horrific crime triggered protests outside Paris City Hall, with citizens frustrated over the rise of antisemitism in France since Oct. 7 and the start of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nMacron was quick to condemn the attack and called on Education Minister Nicole Belloubet \"to organize a discussion in all schools on the fight against antisemitism and racism, to prevent hate speech with serious consequences from infiltrating schools.\"\n\nBelloubet echoed the outrage and said the nation would be united in its \"response against barbarism.\"\n\n\"Horror has no limits,\" Belloubet said in a statement about the crime.

Two boys approached her and attempted to block her path outside her house. After a third boy arrived, the group began to physically attack the girl, hurling antisemitic insults at her, BFMTV reported, citing police sources.\n\nThe girl received several death threats and one of the boys called her a \"dirty Jew,\" according to the account reported by BFMTV.\n\nAntisemitic incidents have increased by 284% in France between 2022 and 2023, according to data from the French interior ministry. In 2023, antisemitic acts constituted 60% of all anti-religious acts, compared to 26% in 2022, French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told the French Senate earlier this year.\n\nGrowing fears of an antisemitism problem\n\nThe incident has sparked an intense political debate on what politicians have described as a spiraling antisemitism problem in France linked to Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nOn Wednesday, Jordan Bardella, the far-right firebrand hoping to score big wins for his National Rally party in the upcoming elections, pledged to tackle antisemitism if elected in three weeks' time. \"Since October 7, an atmosphere of anti-Semitism has spread and developed in an extremely worrying manner in our country, which we must combat,\" Bardella told reporters.\n\nBardella's party colleague and far-right juggernaut, Marine Le Pen said in a post on X that the attack revolted members of her party, highlighting the uptick in antisemitic incidents across the country.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Presidential Palace in Paris, France on June 20, 2024.\n\nAndr\u00e9 Pain/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLe Pen said the recent surge in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war reveals a worrying \"stigmatization\" of Jewish people which \"everyone should be fully aware of\" when hitting the ballot boxes on June 30 and July 7.\n\nFrench Prime Minister Gabriel Attal meanwhile described the incident as a \"despicable\" and took direct aim at his left-wing political opponent, Jean-Luc Melenchon, whom he accused of previously downplaying the severity of antisemitism in France by describing it as a \"residual\" issue.\n\nPoliticians in France have a \"responsibility\" to ensure that antisemitic rhetoric does not become \"trivialized,\" Attal said in an interview with TF1 Info Wednesday, warning that if trivialized it can lead young people in particular to \"the worst.\"\n\nMelenchon for his part said he was \"horrified by this rape,\" saying in a social media post that \"it put under a concerning spotlight the conditioning of criminal male behavior from a young age, and antisemitic racism.\"\n\nVoter anger over the issue appeared clear on Wednesday, as demonstrators gathered outside Paris's city hall on, according to reporting from BFMTV.\n\nProtesters carried placards with slogans such as \"Raped at 12 because she was Jewish,\" and \"Anti-Semitism is not residual,\" and listened to speeches from Jewish rights activists in attendance.\n\n\"All light must be shed on the circumstances of this crime, including its anti-Semitic nature, if this is confirmed,\" the main Jewish interest group in France, the Conseil repr\u00e9sentatif des institutions juives de France (CRIF) said.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"},

Rape, antisemitism: Everything is abominable in this crime committed in Courbevoie against a 12-year-old girl.\" Belloubet tweeted on Wednesday. She added, \"Justice, School, Republic: a single response against barbarism.\"\n\nTwo 13-year-old boys were indicted on Tuesday on multiple charges including rape as well as because of the victim's religious affiliation in connection to the incident, which took place on Saturday night. A third boy, aged 12, was charged with offenses related to witnessing the alleged crime.\n\nThe French newspaper Le Monde called the police report, which included testimony from the girl and from investigating officers, \"unbearable\" in its details.\n\nTwo of the teenagers accused of participating admitted to being motivated by the victim's identity, according to the report, with one saying he had been angry that she had hidden her religion from him and another saying he had resented her comments about Palestine. (The reports did not specify details about the comments.) One of the boys called her a \"dirty Jew,\" according to multiple reports about the incident.\n\nThe incident has drawn recriminations from people across France and beyond who say it reflects deep problems in French society. \"We have the impression that French society has resigned itself to antisemitism,\" Yonathan Arfi, president of CRIF, an umbrella organization of French Jewish institutions, said on TV Thursday.\n\nHaim Korsia, France's chief rabbi, tweeted that he was \"horrified\" by the alleged crime, which follows several others in recent years that have prompted soul-searching among French Jews. \"Justice must firmly sanction the perpetrators of this despicable act,\" Korsia wrote.\n\nThe incident comes as French politics are in turmoil after Macron, a centrist, called for elections following a strong showing by far-right parties in European Union elections earlier this month. The dynamic has resulted in an unprecedented embrace by the traditional conservative party of a far-right party, National Rally, that was founded by a convicted Holocaust denier, leading some French Jews to express fears.\n\nThis week, National Rally withdrew its support for a local candidate who said in a now-deleted 2018 tweet that \"gas did justice for the victims of the Holocaust.\"\n\nAnd Marine Le Pen, the leader of National Rally, joined politicians from across the political spectrum in denouncing the rape -- and pointing fingers about the cause.\n\n\"The antisemitic attack and the rape of a 12-year-old child in Hauts-de-Seine revolt us,\" Le Pen tweeted. \"The explosion of antisemitic acts, up 300% compared to the first three months of 2023, must alert all French people: the stigmatization of Jews for months by the far left through the instrumentalization of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a real threat to civil peace. Everyone should be fully aware of this on June 30 and July 7,\" when elections are scheduled.\n\nJean-Luc Melechon, who heads the far-left party France Unbowed, also denounced the alleged attack, saying he hoped it would not become a \"media spectacle\" during the election season. His party has been accused of stoking antisemitism in its aggressive opposition to the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\"Horrified by this rape in Courbevoie and everything it highlights regarding the conditioning of criminal male behavior from a young age, and antisemitic racism,\" Melenchon tweeted.\n\nLeading members of Macron's party also took aim at Melenchon in their public comments.\n\n\"Faced with such a tragedy ... of course I imagine that all the major politicians condemn it, including Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon,\" Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who has Jewish ancestry, said at a press conference on Thursday, according to Politico. \"But what I also want to say is that since Oct. 7, we've seen a form of unbridled antisemitism develop and break free. And I think that political leaders and political parties have a responsibility to put up barriers, to prevent a certain amount of rhetoric from becoming commonplace.\"", "source": {"uri": "jta.org",

The anti-immigration National Rally party, which has been attempting to distance itself from historical antisemitism, leads in pre-election polls and has a significant chance of forming a government if it wins the two-round elections ending July 7.This would be the first far-right government in France since the Nazi occupation.\n\nFar-left figures have also faced antisemitism accusations related to their responses to Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel and the subsequent conflict.\n\nThe issue intensified after prosecutors charged two adolescent boys in a Paris suburb with raping a 12-year-old girl and committing religion-motivated violence. Lawyer and Jewish leader Elie Korchia stated the girl is Jewish and that the word \"Palestine\" was mentioned during the assault.\n\nHundreds gathered around the Bastille monument in Paris on Thursday evening to protest antisemitism, marking the second consecutive night of demonstrations. France, home to Europe's largest Jewish population, is sensitive to antisemitic acts due to its WWII collaboration with the Nazis. The country also has the largest Muslim population in Western Europe, with rising anti-Muslim acts in recent years.\n\nPoliticians quickly commented on the attack amid a surge in antisemitic acts in France since the Israel-Hamas war began. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal stated on X that the girl was \"raped because she's Jewish,\" while President Emmanuel Macron urged schools to hold discussions on racism and antisemitism.\n\nJordan Bardella, president of the National Rally, pledged to combat antisemitism if elected and announced the withdrawal of support for a party candidate over a past antisemitic social media post. Marine Le Pen, Bardella's predecessor, accused the far left of stigmatizing Jews and exploiting the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nLeftist leader Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon condemned \"antisemitic racism,\" although his party, France Unbowed, has faced similar accusations.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Two boys approached her and attempted to block her path outside her house. After a third boy arrived, the group began to physically attack the girl, hurling antisemitic insults at her, BFMTV reported, citing police sources.\n\nThe girl received several death threats and one of the boys called her a \"dirty Jew,\" according to the account reported by BFMTV.\n\nAntisemitic incidents have increased by 284% in France between 2022 and 2023, according to data from the French interior ministry. In 2023, antisemitic acts constituted 60% of all anti-religious acts, compared to 26% in 2022, French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told the French Senate earlier this year.\n\nThe incident has sparked an intense political debate on what politicians have described as a spiraling antisemitism problem in France linked to Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nOn Wednesday, Jordan Bardella, the far-right firebrand hoping to score big wins for his National Rally party in the upcoming elections, pledged to tackle antisemitism if elected in three weeks' time. \"Since October 7, an atmosphere of anti-Semitism has spread and developed in an extremely worrying manner in our country, which we must combat,\" Bardella told reporters.\n\nBardella's party colleague and far-right juggernaut, Marine Le Pen said in a post on X that the attack revolted members of her party, highlighting the uptick in antisemitic incidents across the country.\n\nLe Pen said the recent surge in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war reveals a worrying \"stigmatization\" of Jewish people which \"everyone should be fully aware of\" when hitting the ballot boxes on June 30 and July 7.\n\nFrench Prime Minister Gabriel Attal meanwhile described the incident as a \"despicable\" and took direct aim at his left-wing political opponent, Jean-Luc Melenchon, whom he accused of previously downplaying the severity of antisemitism in France by describing it as a \"residual\" issue.\n\nPoliticians in France have a \"responsibility\" to ensure that antisemitic rhetoric does not become \"trivialized,\" Attal said in an interview with TF1 Info Wednesday, warning that if trivialized it can lead young people in particular to \"the worst.\"\n\nMelenchon for his part said he was \"horrified by this rape,\" saying in a social media post that \"it put under a concerning spotlight the conditioning of criminal male behavior from a young age, and antisemitic racism.\"\n\nVoter anger over the issue appeared clear on Wednesday, as demonstrators gathered outside Paris's city hall on, according to reporting from BFMTV.\n\nProtesters carried placards with slogans such as \"Raped at 12 because she was Jewish,\" and \"Anti-Semitism is not residual,\" and listened to speeches from Jewish rights activists in attendance.\n\n\"All light must be shed on the circumstances of this crime, including its anti-Semitic nature, if this is confirmed,\" the main Jewish interest group in France, the Conseil repr\u00e9sentatif des institutions juives de France (CRIF) said.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

When will you wake up?\"\n\nFrench Chief Rabbi Haim Korsia blamed radical-left parties for the rise in antisemitism in the country in a statement from the Conference of European Rabbis on Wednesday. He lambasted the Left for denying the atrocities of October 7, adding that \"instead of calming the situation on the streets, it incites antisemitism, which leads to cases like the current rape affair.\"\n\nUptick in antisemitism in france\n\n\"This shocking case joins a long line of violent cases experienced by French Jews in recent months. We are witnessing an alarming increase in the rate of manifestations of antisemitism throughout France. If, in a normal year, we were used to seeing about 400 cases of violence against Jews, in just the three months after October, we witnessed almost 1,600 cases,\" said Korsia. \"Jews are persecuted, raped, beaten, ostracized, and marked. We are no longer just fighting for the legitimacy of the State of Israel to protect its security; we are fighting for the protection of Jews around the world.\"\n\nThe Representative Council of Jewish Institutions of France (CRIF) on Wednesday urged authorities to shed more light on the circumstances and antisemitic motivation. The European Jewish Congress echoed the calls for more information and said that their \"thoughts are with the victim and her family.\"\n\nThe Union of Jewish Students in France also offered support and said on X that \"hatred of Israel leads to unsustainable antisemitic violence. Those who deny it are accountable for it.\"\n\nAccording to Le Parisien, investigators found antisemitic comments and a picture of a burning Israeli flag on the ex-boyfriend's cell phone. A second minor allegedly told police that he beat the girl because she made negative remarks about \"Palestine.\"\n\nFondation des Femmes said on social media on Wednesday that the sexist and antisemitic crime shook the women's rights organization.\n\n\"Rape is a tool of destruction in the service of hatred, and when children rape children, it is society as a whole that must ask itself the question of its responsibility in the face of violence, antisemitism, and misogyny at home,\" said the foundation.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType":

They were also charged with issuing death threats as well as antisemitic insults and violence.\n\nThe suspects beat the girl and forced her to have sex \"while uttering death threats and antisemitic remarks,\" one police source told AFP.\n\nThe case has shocked France, drawing condemnation from across the political spectrum as the country prepares for a high-stakes parliamentary election.\n\n\"Words have effects, ideas have consequences,\" wrote the French prime minister, Gabriel Attal. \"The fight against antisemitism must be that of all republicans,\" he said.\n\nRapha\u00ebl Glucksmann, who led a French socialist list in the European parliamentary elections, warned in a social media post on Thursday that \"any attempt to minimise the explosion of antisemitism is dangerous\".\n\nAntisemitic incidents have spiked in France. A Crif report published in January said there had been 1,676 antisemitic acts in 2023, compared with 436 the previous year, with a big increase in after the Hamas attacks of 7 October and Israel's subsequent assault on Gaza.\n\nLast month, French police shot dead a man armed with a knife and an iron bar who set fire to a synagogue in Rouen.\n\n\"The situation has deteriorated very significantly after 7 October,\" Arfi said.\n\n\"You have always the pressure to take a position regarding the conflict, and it means being a Jew is being, in a way, a legitimate target for some people,\" he said.\n\nThe upcoming French elections, on 30 June and 7 July, have posed a dilemma for parts of the Jewish community in France.\n\nSome have raised concerns about antisemitism within the country's far-left and the credibility of far-right leader Marine Le Pen's claims to have detoxified her party.\n\nIn recent days, high profile figures including Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld have said they would vote for Le Pen's National Rally in case of a runoff with the left-green New Popular Front alliance, which includes the far-left France Unbowed.\n\nLe Pen has courted Jewish voters, seeking to distance herself from the legacy of her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, who as leader was known for his antisemitic rhetoric. The 96-year-old has been convicted several times of contesting crimes against humanity in claims that the gas chambers used to kill Jews during the Holocaust were only a \"detail\" of history.\n\nAfter reports of the alleged rape emerged this week, Le Pen blamed the left for stigmatisation of Jews and urged French voters to keep that in mind when they vote.\n\nBut her party has continued to grapple with accusations of antisemitism. On Wednesday, it withdrew support for one of its candidates over an antisemitic message posted in 2018.\n\nThe result of this fraught climate was that French Jews were fearful of the future, said Arfi.\n\n\"They are very worried [about] the future, also due to the two extreme blocs which now are growing in France - the extreme right, the extreme left - even if some Jews sometimes think to be attracted by the extreme right as an answer to antisemitism, most of the Jews think it is also a real threat.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"},

The majority of the recorded acts took place in November and December, after Hamas's Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the start of Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nIn April, French Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin ordered local officials to step up security at synagogues and Jewish schools.\n\nActivists have called for a mass demonstration against antisemitism in Paris on Friday.\n\nOn Wednesday, French media reported that more than 1,000 people attended a rally at Paris's City Hall. Its organizers said they gathered to stop the rise of anti-Jewish hatred and to offer solidarity to the 12-year-old victim. Addressing the crowd, French Justice Minister \u00c9ric Dupond-Moretti warned against minimizing instances of antisemitism: \"After words, there are acts. And after fiery words, there are fires,\" he said.\n\nAcross the political aisle, Jordan Bardella, the 28-year-old far-right leader of the populist National Rally, said it was essential to combat the atmosphere of antisemitism in France.\n\nThe French far right has itself been historically linked to antisemitism. National Front party founder Jean-Marie Le Pen was repeatedly fined for diminishing the Nazi gas chambers as a mere \"detail\" in the history of World War II.\n\nBut his daughter, Marine Le Pen, has rebranded the party, moderating its tone and expanding its appeal. In European Parliament elections this month, National Rally claimed victory over French President Emmanuel Macron's centrist coalition.

She reported being physically assaulted, including being kicked, slapped, and having her hair pulled.\n\nShe further alleged that she was raped multiple times by two of the three teenagers, and that one of the three threatened to burn her.\n\nTwo of the accused have been taken into custody and given preliminary charges, while the third is under assisted witness status.\n\nLater, lawyer and Jewish leader Elie Korchia said in an interview with French broadcaster BFM that the girl is Jewish and that Palestine was mentioned during the attack.\n\nFrench Prime Minister Gabriel Attal wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that the girl was \"raped because she's Jewish.\"\n\nDuring an interview with the French television channel TF1 on Wednesday evening, Attal urged leaders of political parties to avoid exacerbating an already critical situation regarding antisemitism in France.\n\n\"I call on all political leaders to raise barriers around the issue of antisemitism. Enough of the rhetoric that trivialises, enough of the comments that are tolerated, that create a climate in the country that, I say, is deadly. Unfortunately, since 7 October, antisemitism has been on the rise again in our country.\"\n\nHe called the incident \"absolutely despicable, unbearable and unspeakable\".\n\nThe attack comes in the midst of the campaign for a snap legislative election, and leaders of the various parties reacted quickly -- particularly the far left and far right.\n\nJean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, leader of the leftist party La France Insoumise, posted on the social media platform X: \"Horrified by this rape in Courbevoie and all that it highlights about the conditioning of male criminal behaviour from an early age, and antisemitic racism.\n\n\"Solidarity and sympathy to the victim and those close to her. I hope that the emergency care and support will be properly taken care of. And that this crime and the suffering it causes are not turned into a media spectacle\".\n\nMarine Le Pen, who heads the far-right National Rally's group in the National Assembly, took to X to condemn the attack while also criticising the far left, accusing them of exploiting the Israel-Hamas conflict for their own political gains.\n\n\"The recent antisemitic attack and rape of a 12-year-old in Hauts-de-Seine are abhorrent,\" she wrote. \"The surge in antisemitic incidents, up 300% compared to the first three months of 2023, should serve as a wake-up call to all French citizens.\n\n\"The extreme left's scapegoating of Jews using the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a genuine threat to societal harmony. Everyone needs to recognise this as we approach June 30 and July 7.\"", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Attal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gabriel Attal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TF1", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TF1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_France_Insoumise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La France Insoumise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_(Polish_trade_union)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solidarity (Polish trade union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scapegoating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_M\u00e9lenchon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Le_Pen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marine Le Pen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courbevoie", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Courbevoie"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Courbevoie"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauts-de-Seine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hauts-de-Seine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hauts-de-Seine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Rape", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Rape", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/51/65/20/1200x675_cmsv2_aa4de87c-38af-58d1-a34b-9bfbc361efd6-8516520.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665606", "eventUri": "eng-9665606", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "dateEnd": "2024-07-07", "textStart": 3065, "textEnd": 3083}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1590, "textEnd": 1599}], "sentiment": -0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

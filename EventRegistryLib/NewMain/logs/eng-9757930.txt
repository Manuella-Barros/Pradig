Rest assured that this is an outright grant, and the beneficiaries will not need to repay it\".\n\nThe Expanded National MSME Clinics is one of the federal government's strategies for ease of doing business in Nigeria through a series of business forums organized across the country to provide on-the-spot solutions to challenges confronting MSMEs, with the first, second, and third editions launched in Benue, Ogun, and Ekiti States respectively earlier this year.\n\nShettima said, that as the very foundation of the nation's economy, the MSMEs sub-sector has remained a top priority of the Tinubu administration, noting that they not only represent 96 percent of all businesses in Nigeria and contribute over 45 percent to its GDP but also provide a crucial lifeline to 80 percent of the nation's workforce.\n\n\"We recognize your essence, and that's why we are establishing MSME clinics across the nation. These clinics will act as incubators for small businesses and offer alternative financing. They will also ensure that you have the support and resources you need to compete and thrive,\" he added.\n\nNoting that the prosperity of small businesses is the prosperity of Nigeria and their downturn is the downturn of Nigeria, the Vice President urged the business owners not to harbor any fear, saying the Tinubu administration will not rest until each of them is in a vantage position to access the support and capital made available for them.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Jigawa State Governor, Malam Umar Namadi, thanked the Federal Government for providing dividends of democracy for the people of the state through the MSME Clinics and related projects scattered across the area.\n\nNamadi urged existing and aspiring small business owners in the state to take advantage of services provided through the Clinics, describing the initiative as a rare opportunity for operators in the sector in the state.\n\nHe said the state government is aligning with the Federal Government's Renewed Hope Agenda through the 'Greater Jigawa' initiative that provides social protection services and projects for the people.\n\nThe high point of the event at the Mallam Aminu Kano Triangle was the inspection of exhibition pavilions by MSMEs in the State and the inauguration of the Jigawa Retail Empowerment Shops.\n\nEarlier on arrival in Dutse, Shettima, who was received by the Governor and other dignitaries, proceeded to the Sumore Farm in Madobi where he inaugurated the 10-Hectare, Solar-powered irrigation farm.\n\nHe also inaugurated the 1,435 J-AGRO Agricultural Extension Agents and the distribution of agricultural inputs under the NG CARES Fadama Programme, benefiting over 26,000 individuals, with 30 percent being women.\n\nThe Vice President also flagged off the Palliative Shop initiative at Yalwawa before proceeding to the Dutse Ultra Modern market where he commissioned a 120KVA Solar Plant.\n\nShettima said the solar unit is to ensure \"that the entire market receives a

He noted that the N150,000 grant is an outright grant that does not require beneficiaries to repay. Meanwhile, the AI Expertise Blockchain and Technology Training and Outsourcing Initiative, a partnership with tech company Gluwa, aims to train 1,000 Nigerians annually in artificial intelligence, blockchain, and other cutting-edge technologies.

Rest assured that this is an outright grant, and the beneficiaries will not need to repay it,\" the VP declared.\n\nThe Expanded National MSME Clinics is one of the Federal Government's strategies for ease of doing business in Nigeria through a series of business forums organised across the country to provide on-the-spot solutions to challenges confronting MSMEs, with the first, second, and third editions launched in Benue, Ogun, and Ekiti States respectively earlier this year.\n\nSpeaking during the launch of the MSMEs Clinic on Tuesday in Dutse, Shettima said that as the very foundation of the nation's economy, the MSMEs sub-sector has remained a top priority of the Tinubu administration, noting that they not only represent 96 percent of all businesses in Nigeria and contribute over 45 percent to its GDP but also provide a crucial lifeline to 80 percent of the nation's workforce.\n\n\"We recognise your essence, and that's why we are establishing MSME clinics across the nation. These clinics will act as incubators for small businesses and offer alternative financing. They will also ensure that you have the support and resources you need to compete and thrive,\" he added.\n\nNoting that the prosperity of small businesses is the prosperity of Nigeria and their downturn is the downturn of Nigeria, VP Shettima urged the business owners not to harbour any fear, saying the Tinubu administration will not rest until each of them is in a vantage position to access the support and capital made available for them.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Jigawa State Governor, Malam Umar Namadi, thanked the Federal Government for providing dividends of democracy for the people of the state through the MSME Clinics and related projects scattered across the area.\n\nGovernor Namadi urged existing and aspiring small business owners in the state to take advantage of services provided through the Clinics, describing the initiative as a rare opportunity for operators in the sector in the state.\n\nHe said the State Government is aligning with the Federal Government's Renewed Hope Agenda through the 'Greater Jigawa' initiative that provides social protection services and projects for the people.\n\nThe high point of the event at the Mallam Aminu Kano Triangle was the inspection of exhibition pavilions by MSMEs in the State and the commissioning of the Jigawa Retail Empowerment Shops.\n\nEarlier on arrival in Dutse, the VP, who was received by the Governor and other dignitaries, proceeded to the Sumore Farm in Madobi where he commissioned the 10-hectare solar-powered irrigation farm.\n\nHe commissioned the 1,435 J-AGRO Agricultural Extension Agents and the distribution of agricultural inputs under the NG CARES Fadama Programme, benefiting over 26,000 individuals, with 30 percent being women.\n\nThe VP also flagged off the Palliative Shop initiative at Yalwawa before proceeding to the Dutse Ultra Modern Market where he commissioned a 120KVA Solar Plant.\n\nSenator Shettima said the solar unit is to ensure \"that the entire market receives a minimum of eight hours of electricity per day during market hours.\"\n\nPresent at the AI Expertise Blockchain & Technology Training and Outsourcing Initiative and the Jigawa Expanded National MSME Clinics were Governors Uba Sani of Kaduna and Nasir Idris of Kebbi State; Deputy Governor of Katsina State, Alhaji Farouq Lawal Jobe; Deputy Governor of Sokoto, Idris Mohammed Gobir, and Sen.

The program was launched at the Yakubu Gowon NYSC Orientation Camp, Fanisau, Dutse.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Vice President Shettima urged Nigerian youths to embrace this initiative, emphasizing its importance for the nation's economic future.\n\nHe stated, \"We are not merely catching up with the rest of the world; we are poised to overtake them. This initiative offers its beneficiaries the chance to become part of a global workforce, driving innovation that will shape our future.\"\n\nShettima highlighted Jigawa State's pioneering role in digital technology adoption, describing the program as \"a homecoming ceremony for those who have eased our journey through the Fourth Industrial Revolution.\"\n\nHe outlined the federal government's broader vision to adopt this initiative nationwide, aiming to create a network of tech hubs that will drive Nigeria's economic growth for decades to come.\n\nThe Vice President commended the partnership with Gluwa, aligning it with President Tinubu's agenda to revolutionize Nigeria's digital technology sphere.\n\nHe acknowledged Gluwa's significant impact, particularly their empowerment of Aella Microfinance Bank, which has led to the disbursement of over N100 billion to two million Nigerians.\n\nAddressing the global implications of the Initiative, Shettima said, \"Our aspiration remains to transform Nigeria into a premier destination for technology outsourcing, creating a model that combines global expertise with local talent.\"\n\nJigawa State Governor, Malam Umar Namadi, also spoke at the launch, emphasizing the importance of the initiative and describing it as a rare opportunity for the youth.\n\nHe urged the population to \"venture into the Digital World of ICT Outsourcing and reap all the benefits that it offers, particularly in terms of job creation and opportunities to contribute to the growth of our economy.\"\n\nGovernor Namadi highlighted Jigawa's history with ICT education, noting that the state has a large number of ICT-savvy and qualified youths, thanks to the reputable Informatics Institute established over two decades ago.\n\nHe stated that the new initiative aligns with both the federal government's Renewed Hope Agenda and Jigawa State's 12-Point Agenda, which prioritize digital technologies and innovation.\n\nHe announced the establishment of a new ICT & Digital Economy Agency to further position Jigawa State as a major ICT hub in Nigeria.\n\nIn a related development, Vice President Shettima also launched the 4th edition of the Expanded National Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) Clinic in Dutse.\n\nDuring the launch, he disclosed that President Bola Ahmed Tinubu has ordered a grant of N150,000 to be given to each business owner in the state as part of the federal government's support to MSMEs across the country. Shettima emphasized that this grant is an outright grant and does not require repayment.\n\nThe Expanded National MSME Clinics is one of the federal government's strategies for easing the business environment in Nigeria.\n\nIt involves organizing business forums across the country to provide on-the-spot solutions to challenges confronting MSMEs. Previous editions of the clinics were launched in Benue, Ogun, and Ekiti States earlier this year.\n\nSpeaking at the MSMEs Clinic launch, Senator Shettima highlighted the critical role of the MSMEs sector, noting that it represents 96 percent of all businesses in Nigeria, contributes over 45 percent to the GDP, and provides a livelihood for 80 percent of the workforce.\n\n\"We recognize your essence, and that's why we are establishing MSME clinics across the nation. These clinics will act as incubators for small businesses and offer alternative financing. They will also ensure that you have the support and resources you need to compete and thrive,\" he said.\n\nGovernor Namadi expressed gratitude to the federal government for the MSME Clinics and related projects, urging small business owners to take advantage of the opportunities provided.\n\nHe stated that the state government is aligned with the federal government's Renewed Hope Agenda through the 'Greater Jigawa' initiative, which offers social protection services and projects for the people.\n\nDuring the event, Vice President Shettima inspected exhibition pavilions by MSMEs and commissioned the Jigawa Retail Empowerment Shops.\n\nHe also commissioned a 10-hectare solar-powered irrigation farm at Sumore Farm in Madobi and the distribution of agricultural inputs under the NG CARES Fadama Programme, benefiting over 26,000 individuals, including a significant number of women.\n\nAdditionally, Shettima launched the Palliative Shop initiative at Yalwawa and commissioned a 120KVA Solar Plant at the Dutse Ultra Modern market, ensuring a minimum of eight hours of electricity per day during market hours.\n\nIn his remarks, Vice President Shettima reiterated the federal government's commitment to supporting small businesses, emphasizing that their prosperity is crucial to Nigeria's overall economic well-being.\n\nHe assured business owners that the Tinubu administration would continue to provide the necessary support and resources to help them thrive.", "source": {"uri": "thenews-chronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News Chronicle"},

This is courtesy of our very reputable Informatics Institute established more than two decades ago.\"\n\nHe said the new initiative aligns with both the federal government's Renewed Hope Agenda and Jigawa State's 12-Point Agenda, prioritizing digital technologies and innovation.\n\nGovernor Namadi further announced the establishment of a new ICT & Digital Economy Agency, saying, \"More than ever before, we are determined to reposition Jigawa State as a major ICT hub in Nigeria.\"\n\nEarlier at the launch of the 4th edition of the Expanded National MSMEs Clinic in Dutse, Vice President Shettima said the N150,000 grant for each of the MSMEs as directed by the President was an outright grant that does not require beneficiaries to repay.\n\n\"Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to announce that His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has mandated that a grant of N150,000 each be awarded to outstanding exhibiting MSMEs at today's event.

These clinics will act as incubators for small businesses and offer alternative financing. They will also ensure that you have the support and resources you need to compete and thrive,\" he added.\n\nNoting that the prosperity of small businesses is the prosperity of Nigeria and their downturn is the downturn of Nigeria, VP Shettima urged the business owners not to harbor any fear, saying the Tinubu administration will not rest until each of them is in a vantage position to access the support and capital made available for them.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Jigawa State Governor, Malam Umar Namadi, thanked the Federal Government for providing dividends of democracy for the people of the state through the MSME Clinics and related projects scattered across the area.\n\nGovernor Namadi urged existing and aspiring small business owners in the state to take advantage of services provided through the Clinics, describing the initiative as a rare opportunity for operators in the sector in the state.\n\nHe said the state government is aligning with the Federal Government's Renewed Hope Agenda through the 'Greater Jigawa' initiative that provides social protection services and projects for the people.\n\nThe high point of the event at the Mallam Aminu Kano Triangle was the inspection of exhibition pavilions by MSMEs in the State and the commissioning of the Jigawa Retail Empowerment Shops.\n\nEarlier on arrival in Dutse, the VP, who was received by the Governor and other dignitaries, proceeded to the Sumore Farm in Madobi where he commissioned the 10-Hectare, Solar-powered irrigation farm.\n\nHe commissioned the 1,435 J-AGRO Agricultural Extension Agents and the distribution of agricultural inputs under the NG CARES Fadama Programme, benefiting over 26,000 individuals, with 30 percent being women.\n\nThe VP also flagged off the Palliative Shop initiative at

This initiative offers its beneficiaries the chance to become part of a global workforce, driving innovation that will shape our future,\" he said.\n\nThe Vice-President noted Jigawa State's

significant impact, even as he applauded the firm for its empowerment of Aella Microfinance Bank, resulting in the disbursement of over N100 billion to two million Nigerians.\n\nAddressing the global implications of the Initiative, Shettima said, \"Our aspiration remains to transform Nigeria into a premier destination for technology outsourcing, creating a model that combines global expertise with local talent.\"\n\nEarlier, Jigawa State Governor, Malam Umar Namadi, noted the importance of the initiative, describing it as a rare opportunity at the doorstep of the youths.\n\nHe called on the population to \"venture into the Digital World of ICT Outsourcing and reap all the benefits that it offers, particularly in terms of job creation and opportunities to contribute to the growth of our

Rest assured that this is an outright grant, and the beneficiaries will not need to repay it,\" the VP declared.\n\nThe Expanded National MSME Clinics is one of the federal government's strategies for ease of doing business in Nigeria through a series of business forums organized across the country to provide on-the-spot solutions to challenges confronting MSMEs, with the first, second, and third editions launched in Benue, Ogun, and Ekiti States respectively earlier this year.\n\nSpeaking during the launch of the MSMEs Clinic on Tuesday in Dutse, Senator Shettima said, that as the very foundation of the nation's economy, the MSMEs sub-sector has remained a top priority of the Tinubu administration, noting that they not only represent 96 per cent of all businesses in Nigeria and contribute over 45 per cent to its GDP but also provide a crucial lifeline to 80 per cent of the nation's workforce.\n\n\"We recognise your essence, and that's why we are establishing MSME clinics across the nation. These clinics will act as incubators for small businesses and offer alternative financing. They will also ensure that you have the support and resources you need to compete and thrive,\" he added.\n\nNoting that the prosperity of small businesses is the prosperity of Nigeria and their downturn is the downturn of Nigeria, VP Shettima urged the business owners not to harbor any fear, saying the Tinubu administration will not rest until each of them is in a vantage position to access the support and capital made available for them.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Jigawa State Governor, Malam Umar Namadi, thanked the Federal Government for providing dividends of democracy for the people of the state through the MSME Clinics and related projects scattered across the area.\n\nGovernor Namadi urged existing and aspiring small business owners in the state to take advantage of services provided through the Clinics, describing the initiative as a rare opportunity for operators in the sector in the state.\n\nHe said the state government is aligning with the Federal Government's Renewed Hope Agenda through the 'Greater Jigawa' initiative that provides social protection services and projects for the people.\n\nThe high point of the event at the Mallam Aminu Kano Triangle was the inspection of exhibition pavilions by MSMEs in the State and the commissioning of the Jigawa Retail Empowerment Shops.\n\nEarlier on arrival in Dutse, the VP, who was received by the Governor and other dignitaries, proceeded to the Sumore Farm in Madobi where he commissioned the 10-Hectare, Solar-powered irrigation farm.\n\nHe commissioned the 1,435 J-AGRO Agricultural Extension Agents and the distribution of agricultural inputs under the NG CARES Fadama Programme, benefiting over 26,000 individuals, with 30 percent being women.\n\nThe VP also flagged off the Palliative Shop initiative at Yalwawa before proceeding to the Dutse Ultra Modern market where he commissioned a 120KVA Solar Plant.\n\nSenator Shettima said the solar unit is to ensure \"that the entire market receives a minimum of eight hours of electricity per day during market hours.\"\n\nPresent at the AI Expertise Blockchain & Technology Training and Outsourcing Initiative and the Jigawa Expanded National MSME Clinics were Governors Uba Sani of Kaduna and Nasir Idris of Kebbi State; Deputy Governor of Katsina State, Alhaji Farouq Lawal Jobe; Deputy Governor of Sokoto, Idris Mohammed Gobir, and Sen.

Rest assured that this is an outright grant, and the beneficiaries will not need to repay it,\" the VP declared.\n\nThe Expanded National MSME Clinics is one of the federal government's strategies for ease of doing business in Nigeria through a series of business forums organized across the country to provide on-the-spot solutions to challenges confronting MSMEs, with the first, second, and third editions launched in Benue, Ogun, and Ekiti States respectively earlier this year.\n\nSpeaking during the launch of the MSMEs Clinic on Tuesday in Dutse, Senator Shettima said, that as the very foundation of the nation's economy, the MSMEs sub-sector has remained a top priority of the Tinubu administration, noting that they not only represent 96 percent of all businesses in Nigeria and contribute over 45 percent to its GDP but also provide a crucial lifeline to 80 percent of the nation's workforce.\n\n\"We recognize your essence, and that's why we are establishing MSME clinics across the nation. These clinics will act as incubators for small businesses and offer alternative financing. They will also ensure that you have the support and resources you need to compete and thrive,\" he added.\n\nNoting that the prosperity of small businesses is the prosperity of Nigeria and their downturn is the downturn of Nigeria, Shettima urged the business owners not to harbor any fear, saying the Tinubu administration will not rest until each of them is in a vantage position to access the support and capital made available for them.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Jigawa State Governor, Malam Umar Namadi, thanked the Federal Government for providing dividends of democracy for the people of the state through the MSME Clinics and related projects scattered across the area.\n\nGovernor Namadi urged existing and aspiring small business owners in the state to take advantage of services provided through the Clinics, describing the initiative as a rare opportunity for operators in the sector in the state.\n\nHe said the state government is aligning with the Federal Government's Renewed Hope Agenda through the 'Greater Jigawa' initiative that provides social protection services and projects for the people.\n\nThe high point of the event at the Mallam Aminu Kano Triangle was the inspection of exhibition pavilions by MSMEs in the State and the commissioning of the Jigawa Retail Empowerment Shops.\n\nEarlier on arrival in Dutse, the vice president, proceeded to the Sumore Farm in Madobi where he commissioned the 10-Hectare, Solar-powered irrigation farm.\n\nHe commissioned the 1,435 J-AGRO Agricultural Extension Agents and the distribution of agricultural inputs under the NG CARES Fadama Programme, benefiting over 26,000 individuals, with 30 percent being women.\n\nShettima also flagged off the Palliative Shop initiative at Yalwawa before proceeding to the Dutse Ultra Modern market where he commissioned a 120KVA Solar Plant.\n\nHe said the solar unit is to ensure \"that the entire market receives a minimum of eight hours of electricity per day during market hours.\"", "source": {"uri": "tribuneonlineng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tribune Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "leon_usigbe@tribuneonlineng.com", "name": "Leon Usigbe", "type": "author",

They will also ensure that you have the support and resources you need to compete and thrive,\" he noted.\n\nHe observed that the prosperity of small businesses was the prosperity of Nigeria and their downturn was the downturn of Nigeria.\n\nShettima urged the business owners not to harbour any fear, assuring that the Tinubu administration would not rest until each of them \"is in a vantage position to access the support and capital made available for them.\"\n\nEarlier, Governor Umar Namadi thanked the federal government for providing dividends of democracy to the people of the state through the MSME Clinics and related projects scattered across the area.\n\nNamadi urged the existing and aspiring small business owners in the state to take advantage of services provided through the clinics.\n\nHe described the initiative as a rare opportunity for operators in the sector in Jigawa.\n\nHe said the state government was aligning with the federal government's Renewed Hope Agenda through the 'Greater Jigawa Initiative' that provides social protection services and projects for the people.\n\nThe high point of the event at the Malam Aminu Kano Triangle was the inspection of exhibition pavilions by MSMEs in the state and the commissioning of the Jigawa Retail Empowerment Shops.\n\nEarlier on arrival in Dutse, Shettima commissioned the 10-hectare, Solar-powered irrigation farm at the Sumore Farm in Madobi.\n\nHe also commissioned 1,435 J-AGRO Agricultural Extension Agents and the distribution of agricultural inputs under the NG-CARES Fadama Programme.\n\nNAN reports that the inputs will benefit more than 26,000 individuals, out of which 30 per cent are women.\n\nSimilarly, Shettima inaugurated the Palliative Shop initiative at Yalwawa before proceeding to the Dutse Ultra Modern market where he commissioned a 120KVA Solar Plant.\n\nShettima said the solar unit would ensure that the entire market receives a minimum of eight hours of electricity per day during market hours.", "source": {"uri": "punchng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Punch Newspapers"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

President Shettima explained, \"President Bola Ahmed Tinubu has initiated multiple interventions for SMEs, which have generated over 300,000 businesses and will provide over one million jobs within a year.\"\n\nHe emphasised that the Renewal Hope Agenda of President Tinubu is designed to tackle poverty and create job opportunities by encouraging and supporting medium and small-scale businesses,

policies and programmes that will improve the social and economic lives of Nigerians.\n\nAddressing the youth, Shettima urged them to ignore calls for the proposed nationwide protest, describing those calling for it as selfish and unpatriotic.\n\nHe said, \"The protest will not yield any positive development; instead, it will lead to violence and destruction of public properties.\"\n\nVice

Agenda for inclusive and sustainable socioeconomic growth and development but also further our state's development objectives of improved socioeconomic well-being for all, as encapsulated in our 12-Point Agenda.\"\n\nHe noted that all the programmes commissioned by the Vice President have significant potential to contribute to the nation's goals of economic diversification, food security, employment generation, and job creation.\n\nDuring his visit, Vice President Senator Kashim Shettima launched several key initiatives, including the training of 1,000 youth in artificial intelligence (AI), the development of 20,000 hectares of sprinkler-based solar-powered irrigation, and the establishment of a small and medium-scale enterprise clinic in Jigawa State to boost job creation and poverty eradication.\n\nAdditionally, the Vice President commissioned a 100 KVA solar-energy power supply system to provide stable power to small-scale enterprises at Dutse Market, distributed

This is meant to help build a home-grown fintech ecosystem.\n\nDuring the launch in Jigawa, Shettima made it clear that this grant is a gift -- no repayment needed.\n\nWhile in Jigawa, Shettima also kicked off the 4th edition of the Expanded National MSMEs Clinic. This program is designed to support small businesses across the country.\n\nNigeria's approach to cryptocurrency has become pretty hostile recently. In May, Tinubu banned P2P crypto trading with the naira. He claimed that he wanted to protect the national currency from devaluation and speculation.\n\nEmomotimi Agama, the Director General of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), led a crackdown on Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world.\n\nBinance was ordered to halt all naira transactions and trading in Nigeria. The country then filed charges against Binance and two of its executives, accusing them of tax evasion and money laundering.\n\nOne executive, Nadeem Anjarwalla, managed to escape custody in March but was found in Kenya in April. Tigran Gambaryan, Binance's head of financial crime compliance, is still in custody.\n\nThe Federal High Court decided in May 2024 that Gambaryan can stand trial on behalf of Binance. Despite all of these, crypto trading in Nigeria has been steady.\n\nBetween July 2022 and June 2023, trading volumes grew by 9%, hitting $56.7 billion according to Chainalysis. There's a push to promote the eNaira, Nigeria's central bank digital currency, launched in 2021.\n\nSome in the industry think the government's actions might be aimed at making the eNaira more popular.

According to the President, the goal of this grant is to encourage the birth of the indigenous fintech market, as well as to strengthen Nigeria's technological base. Shettima said the N150,000 is a non-refundable grant and an immediate cash intervention to support owners of MSMEs.\n\nVice President Shettima stated Nigeria is not only a country in the process of coming up but also a country that is set to overtake other countries in the world economically. The aim is to create a global talent pool that will drive future progress.\n\nNITDA plans research centers for emerging technologies across Nigeria\n\nThe National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) of Nigeria is also contributing a lot to this regard. In early July, NITDA revealed its plans to create research centers for new technologies, including AI, IoTs, and blockchain, in Nigeria's six geopolitical zones. These centers will focus on important sectors, namely, Unmanned aerial vehicles, Additive manufacturing, and Robotics.\n\nNITDA's Director-General, Kashifu Inuwa, highlighted the agency's commitment to fostering a strong technology research ecosystem. He said, \"We are establishing a special-purpose vehicle that will look into these key areas and also establish research centers across the six geo-political zones of Nigeria that will be targeting these six key areas of emerging technologies.\"\n\nThis news comes as a technology platform known as AI-Grants, which has collaborated with Civil Society Organizations on Community Advancement and Humanitarian Empowerment Initiative (CSCHEI) to introduce a program that aims to raise funds for institutions in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria's bid to become a technological nation is not only through training and research institutions.

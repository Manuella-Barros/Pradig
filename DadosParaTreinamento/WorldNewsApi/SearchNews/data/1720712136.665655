If users want to hide comments within a presentation or avoid accidental edits, they can switch to view mode. Choosing commenting mode will hide all options associated with editing, but still allow users to read and add comments, the tech giant explained. To change mode, users will be required to navigate to the View > Mode > select a mode. This capability will be available to Google Workspace customers, Google Workspace Individual subscribers, and users with personal Google accounts. The tech giant also announced a feature that will let users scroll and zoom in or out on their content directly from Google Meet. According to the company, this feature will eliminate the need to switch between tabs, helping users focus more on delivering their presentation.

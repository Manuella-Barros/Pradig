Kamala Harris launches TV ad to define her record and so does Trump", "body": "WASHINGTON - Is Kamala Harris a \"fearless\" leader who has taken on big banks and drug companies for the American people?\n\nOr is she \"failed, weak\" and \"dangerously liberal?\"\n\nOne week after Harris quickly emerged as the new Democratic presumptive nominee, the Harris and Donald Trump campaigns for president set out hastily Tuesday to define Harris with dueling television ads that will air in critical battleground states likely to decide the 2024 election.\n\nA 60-second ad from the Harris campaign introduces Harris to a broader electorate by saying, \"The one thing Kamala Harris has always been: fearless.\" The ad traces her career as a prosecutor \"putting murders and abusers behind bars,\" as California attorney general going after \"the big banks\" and as vice president going after \"the big drug companies.\"\n\n\"Because Kamala Harris has always known who she represents,\" a narrator says in the ad.\n\nThe Trump campaign, in a 30-second television ad of its own, calls Harris \"America's border czar,\" seizing on her role as the Biden administration's point person to tackle root causes of migration at the U.S.-Mexico border. The ad blames Harris for illegal migration, fentanyl overdoses, \"brutal migrant crimes,\" and allegedly making the U.S. susceptible to domestic terrorism. (Thanks to strict new Biden administration rules, illegal border crossings last month hit their lowest level since Biden took office, and data shows immigrants are not more likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans.)\n\nThroughout the ad, Harris is shown dancing at a White House celebration for hip-hop music held last year. \"Kamala Harris - failed, weak, dangerously liberal,\" it concludes.\n\nThe Harris campaign said its ad is part of a $50 million paid media blitz ahead of the Democratic National Convention, set to begin Aug. 19 in Chicago. The DNC plans to formally nominate Harris by virtual rollcall before Aug. 7.\n\nThe Trump campaign reserved $12.2 million in media markets in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin for its attack ad against Harris, according to AdImpact, which tracks political ads.\n\nSince President Joe Biden dropped out of the race earlier this month, Harris has quickly coalesced Democrats behind her bid, raising more than $200 million and improving on Biden's poor poll numbers.\n\nBut Republican attacks against Harris are expected to ramp up, with a focus especially on the border.\n\n\"Harris is dangerously liberal and Americans are paying the price,\" said Danielle Alvarez, a Trump campaign senior advisor.\n\nHarris campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa rejected the claims of the Trump attack ad in a statement, noting that Senate Republicans pulled out of a bipartisan deal to strengthen border security after Trump came out against it. \"After killing the toughest border deal in decades, Donald Trump is running on his trademark lies because his own record and 'plans' are extreme and unpopular,\" he said.\n\nThe Harris ad also looks to contrast Harris and Trump - painting Harris as the forward-thinking candidate and Trump as stuck in the past.\n\n\"This campaign is about who we fight for,\" Harris says in the ad, replaying remarks she made at a campaign rally last week in Milwaukee. \"Donald Trump wants to take our country backward. To give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and end the Affordable Care Act,\" Harris says in the ad. \"But we are not going back.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Harris ad.\n\nHarris almost immediately catapulted to the top of the Democratic ticket after Biden dropped out of the race July 21. Since then, the vice president quickly garnered the support of Democratic leaders and organizers, as well as raked in record levels of cash. Of the whopping $200 million she raised in less than a week, 66% came from first-time donors.\n\nWith less than 100 days until the general election, Harris has not pumped the brakes on campaigning. She held her first campaign rally in Milwaukee, just two days after Biden dropped out. And she will hold a rally in Atlanta, Georgia on Tuesday, a key battleground state that Biden won in 2020 by several thousand votes. Rapper Megan Thee Stallion is expected to join Harris in Atlanta.\n\nHarris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, in a statement, said Harris has \"always stood up to bullies\" throughout her career on behalf of the American people. \"And she's beaten them. She's uniquely suited to take on Donald Trump, a convicted felon who has spent his entire life ripping off working people, tearing away our rights, and fighting for himself,\" O'Malley said.\n\nSince announcing her candidacy, Harris has faced racist and misogynistic attacks from members of the Republican Party. She has been labeled a \"DEI candidate\" -- a talking point using the acronym for diversity, equity and inclusion that conservatives are using to disqualify people of color or women who ascend to positions of power and influence.\n\nA video of Sen. JD Vance, Trump's running mate resurfaced recently that implied Harris was among top Democrats who were \"childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made.\"\n\nVance, who made those comments during an appearance on Fox News' \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" in July 2021 while he was running for Ohio's U.S. Senate seat, said \"the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children.\" Harris is the step-mother of two children.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

They're walking the line between open self-promotion and loyal advocacy for the potential boss in what amounts to unofficial auditions.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro campaigned for Harris on Monday outside Philadelphia. He blasted Republican former President Donald Trump and called Harris ready to lead. But he also showcased his own accomplishments.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear took a similar approach over the weekend.

They're betting that a fresh burst of energy and a surge in fundraising has helped make Georgia -- the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020 -- a toss-up again.\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nTrump ad blasts Harris for problems at the border\n\nRepublican candidate Donald Trump's campaign released a new advertisement Tuesday, blasting Vice President Kamala Harris for problems at the U.S. southern border.\n\nThe advertisement dubs Harris the \"border czar,\" a reference to her work on migration issues. It includes a parade of headlines about drugs and criminals entering the country, as well as a clip from a controversial interview that Harris did three years ago in which she brushed off a suggestion that she would visit the border.\n\n\"Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal,\" the advertisement brands Harris.\n\nNew $50 million ad portrays Harris as 'fearless'\n\nVice President Kamala Harris' campaign is kickstarting a $50 million advertising campaign with a new television spot calling the likely Democratic presidential nominee \"fearless\" throughout her career.\n\n\"Throughout her career as a courtroom prosecutor, attorney general, United States senator, and now as vice president, Kamala Harris has always stood up to bullies, criminals and special interests on behalf of the American people - and she's beaten them,\" said a statement from Jen O'Malley Dillon, the campaign chair.\n\n\"She's uniquely suited to take on Donald Trump, a convicted felon who has spent his entire life ripping off working people, tearing away our rights, and fighting for himself.\"\n\nThe advertisement is slated to run during the Olympics, \"The Bachelorette,\" \"The Daily Show\" and other popular programs. It's an attempt to even the score with Republicans, who have been outspending Democrats on the airwaves during a chaotic summer when President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed Harris.\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion to campaign for Harris\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion will join Vice President Kamala Harris for a special performance during her campaign stop in Atlanta on Tuesday.\n\nA Harris campaign spokesperson confirmed the hip-hop star's performance alongside the vice president in a post on X on Monday night.\n\nThe Harris campaign is promising a large rally in Atlanta, on par with the large events that Republican former President Donald Trump has made his signature.\n\nHarris has America focused on multiracial identity\n\nIf Vice President Kamala Harris were to ascend to the presidency, she would become the first female president, but also one who is also multiracial.\n\nThe daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, both of whom immigrated to the U.S. during the Civil Rights Movement, Harris' historic presidential bid has again put a spotlight on American identity politics and the growing number of people who say they are multiracial.\n\nDifferent countries divide people into categories depending on different national traditions. The U.S., with its slavery-molded history, divides people into Black or white, and nine million people identified as multiracial in 2010.\n\nWhen Harris ran for vice president in 2020, 33.8 million

Abrams, who is a fervent defender of the vice president, will be at Harris' side alongside the state's Democratic Senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock . Singer Megan Thee Stallion will also join Harris at her rally, the campaign announced. 'ATL HOTTIES SEE YOU TOMORROW,' the singer wrote on her instagram.\n\nTuesday marks Harris' first appearance in the battleground state since she announced her presidential campaign and her 15th visit since becoming vice president. Georgia is seen as a critical win for Harris in the 2024 race, part of a group of sunbelt states Democrats believe she can carry in addition to the Midwest states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan that make up the so-called 'blue wall.' 'We have multiple pathways to 270 electoral votes. The Vice President is strong in both the blue wall and in the Sun Belt and we are running hard in both,' Harris' battleground states director Dan Kanninen said on a call with reporters on Monday. Abrams has been a vocal defender of Harris in the past. The two African American women have endorsed each others' campaigns and supported each other in their respective races.\n\nShe also helped Joe Biden win the state in the 2020 election, giving Democrats their first win there since Bill Clinton. One point that Abrams has made repeatedly is that Harris would not receive the criticism she has gotten if she were a white male. 'We will always question the person behind the person, but we cannot ignore the misogyny and racism remain very prevalent in our politics,' Abrams told MSNBC late last year. 'For those behaviors that don't rise to either misogyny or racism, there's also just a difference. Our expectations are set for the traditional white male vice president. It's what it's always been. We are not always great with new,' she noted.\n\n'But more importantly, I know if you filter through the critiques, if you think about how she is castigated, it is inextricably linked to race and gender.' Abrams' defense came at a time when Harris, the first black and female vice president, was seeing record low approval ratings. Her services will likely be needed again as the presidential campaign continues and Donald Trump's campaign ratches up its attacks. Trump's running mate Sen. JD Vance has increased his efforts to frame Harris as a far-left politician out of touch with the American mainstream. Vance on Sunday said that Harris has 'got a little bit of a bump from her introduction' but predicted it would soon dissipate.\n\n'Look, the people are going to learn her record,' Vance said. 'They're going to learn that she's a radical. They're going to learn that she's basically a San Francisco liberal who wants to take San Francisco policies to the entire country.' Trump himself has called Harris a 'crazy liberal.' Trump and Vance will hold a campaign rally in Atlanta together on Saturday August 3, the Trump campaign announced on Tuesday. It will be held in the same location as Harris' rally. Meanwhile, Georgia played a crucial role in the last presidential election, and it is expected to be just as significant this November. According to several polls released last week, it's a virtual toss-up between Harris and Trump. Polls showed Joe Biden trailed Trump significantly in the state but Harris does much better against the former president.\n\nShe outperforms Biden among young people, Black voters, and Hispanic voters, key demographics that could decide swing states like Georgia and Arizona. Biden only won the state by some 12,000 votes in 2020, a win heavily contested by Trump, who is currently in the midst of an election interference case in the state Georgia is a top focus with less than 100 days to go before the election. The Harris campaign noted it has 24 offices open in the state and 170 staffers on the ground there. 'In Georgia, we're running the largest in state operation of any Democratic presidential campaign cycle ever,' campaign communications director Michael Tyler said.\n\nWhile in the state Harris plans to attack Trump for his ties to Project 2025 - an initiative from the Heritage Foundation that promotes conservative polices - and for his position on abortion rights. And while Harris focuses on Georgia, Trump will be focused on breaking the Democrats' blue wall. He's holding a rally in Pennsylvania on Wednesday - his first visit back to the state since the assassination attempt on him in late June. Harris had surrogates in Pennsylvania on Monday to counter Trump - the state's Governor Josh Shapiro and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmore. Both Democrats have been names as possible Harris running mates. The Harris campaign also has had surrogates Georgia, as she weighs who to pick as her number two.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who is reported to be a potential running mate, was in in the state on Sunday. The Harris campaign is vetting him along with several other candidates, including Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Govs. Roy Cooper of North Carolina and Tim Walz of Minnesota. She is expected to choose her vice presidential candidate by Aug. 7. Harris' campaign noted it's held some 2,300 organizing events in battleground states this weekend as several high-profile Democrats on her potential VP list stumped for her. With less than 100 days to go until Election Day, the Harris campaign is touting its fundraising and infrastructure, arguing it is well-positioned to beat Trump in November.\n\nThe campaign has taken in $200 million since Harris emerged as the likely Democratic presidential nominee last week. Over 170,000 volunteers have also signed up to help the Harris campaign with phone banking, canvassing and other get-out-the-vote efforts. 'The momentum and energy for Vice President Harris is real -- and so are the fundamentals of this race: this election will be very close and decided by a small number of voters in just a few states,' Tyler wrote in a memo.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

The bad news is that Kamala Harris does not have the same baggage as Joe Biden, because whatever we might have to say, Kamala is a lot younger,' the former 'Never-Trumper' said.\n\n'And Kamala Harris is obviously not struggling in the same ways that Joe Biden did.'\n\nThis embarrassing development for the Trump campaign comes as a new poll from the non-profit Angus Reid Institute shows that Harris holds a two point lead over the GOP nominee.\n\nMeanwhile, an ABC News/Ipsos poll, Harris' favorability rating among Americans hit 43 percent in late July. It's a sharp increase from its 35 percent before Biden exited the race.\n\nPublicly JD Vance has been bullish regarding the prospect of Vice President Kamala Harris replacing President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nPublicly, Vance has been bullish, arguing that Harris jumping in the race following President Joe Biden's shock announcement that he would not be running, did not impact 'the political calculus' for Republicans.\n\nVance's surrogates have been targeting Harris' record on the border, support for police funding and fracking.\n\nRead More Forecaster who predicted every presidential winner for 40 YEARS reveals who is on course to win\n\n'We have a very unique opportunity, but also a very unique challenge, because, let's be honest, 10 days ago, the two candidates who were running for president, everybody had an opinion about 'em,' Vance told supporters.\n\n'Love 'em or hate 'em, everybody has an opinion about Donald Trump and Joe Biden after the past eight years... but Kamala Harris, people don't really know.'\n\nThe Angus Reid poll shows a much more diverse and youthful vote for Harris.\n\nA whopping 56 percent of non-white voters say they favor the former senator from California compared against 25 percent for Trump.\n\nIn terms of the youth vote, 50 percent of potential Harris voters are under the age of 35 compared against Trump's 32 percent.\n\nThe pair are tied among voters between the age of 35 and 54.\n\nTrump is unsurprisingly favored by white voters with 51 percent to 37 and with elderly voters, 49 to 40 percent.\n\nIn response to The Washington Post's report, a Vance spokesperson called Harris 'weak' and 'failed' while promoting a 'dangerously liberal agenda.'\n\n'Her far-left ideas are even more radioactive than Joe Biden, particularly in the key swing states that will decide this election like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin,' Will Martin said.\n\nIt has emerged this week that the Harris campaign has raised $200 million since she emerged as the likely Democratic presidential nominee last week\n\nIt has also emerged this week that the Harris campaign has raised $200 million since she emerged as the likely Democratic presidential nominee last week, an eyepopping haul in her race against the Republican nominee.\n\nThe campaign, which announced its latest fundraising total on Sunday, said the bulk of the donations - 66 percent - comes from first-time contributors in the 2024 election cycle and were made after Biden's decision not to run.\n\nOver 170,000 volunteers have also signed up to help the Harris campaign with phone banking, canvassing and other get-out-the-vote efforts.

JD Vance, as \"weird.\"\n\nSenate lawmakers are expected Tuesday to grill the acting director of the Secret Service about law enforcement lapses in the hours before the attempted assassination of Trump.\n\nFollow the AP's Election-2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nTrump ad blasts Harris for problems at the border\n\nRepublican candidate Donald Trump's campaign released a new advertisement Tuesday, blasting Vice President Kamala Harris for problems at the U.S. southern border.\n\nThe advertisement dubs Harris the \"border czar,\" a reference to her work on migration issues. It includes a parade of headlines about drugs and criminals entering the country, as well as a clip from a controversial interview that Harris did three years ago in which she brushed off a suggestion that she would visit the border.\n\n\"Failed.

Dangerously liberal,\" the advertisement brands Harris.\n\nNew $50 million ad portrays Harris as 'fearless'\n\nVice President Kamala Harris' campaign is kickstarting a $50 million advertising campaign with a new television spot calling the likely Democratic presidential nominee \"fearless\" throughout her career.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"Throughout her career as a courtroom prosecutor, attorney general, United States senator, and now as vice president, Kamala Harris has always stood up to bullies, criminals and special interests on behalf of the American people - and she's beaten them,\" said a statement from Jen O'Malley Dillon, the campaign chair.\n\n\"She's uniquely suited to take on Donald Trump, a convicted felon who has spent his entire life ripping off working people, tearing away our rights, and fighting for himself.\"\n\nThe advertisement is slated to run during the Olympics, \"The Bachelorette,\" \"The Daily Show\" and other popular programs. It's an attempt to even the score with Republicans, who have been outspending Democrats on the airwaves during a chaotic summer when President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed Harris.\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion to campaign for Harris\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion will join Vice President Kamala Harris for a special performance during her campaign stop in Atlanta on Tuesday.\n\nA Harris campaign spokesperson confirmed the hip-hop star's performance alongside the vice president in a post on X on Monday night.\n\nThe Harris campaign is promising a large rally in Atlanta, on par with the large events that Republican former President Donald Trump has made his signature.\n\nHarris has America focused on multiracial identity\n\nIf Vice President Kamala Harris were to ascend to the presidency, she would become the first female president, but also one who is also multiracial.\n\nThe daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, both of whom immigrated to the U.S. during the Civil Rights Movement, Harris' historic presidential bid has again put a spotlight on American identity politics and the growing number of people who say they are multiracial.\n\nDifferent countries divide people into categories depending on different national traditions. The U.S., with its slavery-molded history, divides people into Black or white, and nine million people identified as multiracial in 2010.\n\nWhen Harris ran for vice president in 2020, 33.8 million people in the U.S. identified as being more than one race, according to the census.", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@gazette.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Thee_Stallion", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Megan Thee Stallion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Supreme_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Supreme Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Trump is unsurprisingly favored by white voters with 51 percent to 37 and with elderly voters, 49 to 40 percent.\n\nIn response to The Washington Post's report, a Vance spokesperson called Harris 'weak' and 'failed' while promoting a 'dangerously liberal agenda.' 'Her far-left ideas are even more radioactive than Joe Biden, particularly in the key swing states that will decide this election like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin,' Will Martin said. It has also emerged this week that the Harris campaign has raised $200 million since she emerged as the likely Democratic presidential nominee last week, an eyepopping haul in her race against the Republican nominee.\n\nThe campaign, which announced its latest fundraising total on Sunday, said the bulk of the donations - 66 percent - comes from first-time contributors in the 2024 election cycle and were made after Biden's decision not to run. Over 170,000 volunteers have also signed up to help the Harris campaign with phone banking, canvassing and other get-out-the-vote efforts. Election Day is 100 days away.\n\n'The momentum and energy for Vice President Harris is real -- and so are the fundamentals of this race: this election will be very close and decided by a small number of voters in just a few states,' Michael Tyler, the campaign's communications director, wrote in a memo. Her campaign said it held some 2,300 organizing events in battleground states this weekend as several high-profile Democrats under consideration to serve as Harris' running mate stumped for her.\n\nHarris campaigned in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, on Saturday, drawing hundreds to a fundraiser that had been organized when Biden was still at the top of the Democratic ticket. The fundraiser had originally been expected to raise $400,000 but ended bringing in about $1.4 million, according to the campaign. Mandy Robbins, 45, of Decatur, Georgia, drove to one of those organizing events Sunday in the northern suburbs of Atlanta to hear Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a potential Harris running mate.\n\nShe thought Biden did a 'great job' in the White House, but acknowledged she 'would not have been nearly this excited' if he remained in the race. 'I finally feel hopeful now,' Robbins said. She added, 'We can win this with Harris.'\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

JD Vance, have several campaign events set up this week as they aim their attacks on Harris.\n\nHarris has secured commitments from enough delegates to become the presumptive nominee if they all honor their commitment when voting, according to ABC News reporting.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris rolled out an aggressive $50 million, three-week advertising blitz for the first ad of her presidential campaign on Tuesday, in which she introduces herself to voters, highlights her career and takes hits at former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"The one thing Kamala Harris has always been: fearless,\" a narrator says at the start of the minute-long ad, as pictures of Harris over the years -- from a toddler to college graduate to vice president -- flash on screen.\n\n\"As a prosecutor, she put murderers and abusers behind bars,\" the narrator continued. \"As California's attorney general, she went after the big banks and won $20 billion for homeowners. And as vice president, she took on the big drug companies to cap the cost of insulin for seniors. Because Kamala Harris has always known who she represents.\"\n\nThe spot then leads into laying out Harris' vision and attacking Trump, using footage from her first rally of the campaign last week in a high school gym just outside Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\n\"We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead. Where every senior can retire with dignity,\" Harris said in the footage from the rally. \"But Donald Trump wants to take our country backward, to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and end the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\n\"But we are not going back,\" she added.\n\nHarris campaign chair, Jen O'Malley Dillon, said in a statement that because of Harris' prosecutorial, congressional and vice-presidential experience, the vice president is \"uniquely suited to take on Donald Trump, a convicted felon who has spent his entire life ripping off working people, tearing away our rights, and fighting for himself.\"\n\n'White Dudes for Harris' raises over $4 million in 3 hours\n\nThe \"White Dudes for Harris\" livestream held on Monday night raised over $4 million over three hours in support of Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential bid, organizers said.\n\nThe event featured participants from politics and a parade of celebrities -- including \"The Dude\" himself, The Big Lebowski's Jeff Bridges -- all making their own call to action for other white men to step up in their support for Harris.\n\nOver 190,000 people tuned into the Zoom call, organizers of the unofficial event said at the conclusion of the stream.\n\nAmong the recognizable faces that cropped up during the livestream were Star Wars icon Mark Hamill, Supernatural alum Misha Collins, The West Wing alum Bradley Whitford, Frozen's Josh Gad and singer Josh Groban. Several potential running mates for Harris also joined the event, including North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who withdrew from contention for vice president on the Democratic ticket around the time he spoke at the meeting. He did not mention his withdrawal on the call.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, all still in the running for Harris' vice-presidential pick, were also part of the \"White Dudes for Harris\" meeting.\n\nJD Vance said Democratic ticket switch to Harris was 'sucker punch': Report\n\nSen. JD Vance, running mate to former President Donald Trump, said over the weekend that Kamala Harris moving to the top of the Democratic ticket was a \"sucker punch,\" according to the Washington Post.\n\n\"All of us were hit with a little bit of a political sucker punch,\" Vance said to donors over the weekend in Minnesota, per an audio recording the paper said it had obtained. \"The bad news is that Kamala Harris does not have the same baggage as Joe Biden, because whatever we might have to say, Kamala is a lot younger. And Kamala Harris is obviously not struggling in the same ways that Joe Biden did.\"\n\nWhen asked about the report and Vance's \"sucker punch\" comment, a spokesperson for the vice presidential contender took aim at Harris.\n\n\"Poll after poll shows President Trump leading Kamala Harris as voters become aware of her weak, failed and dangerously liberal agenda. Her far-left ideas are even more radioactive than Joe Biden, particularly in the key swing states that will decide this election like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin,\" Vance spokesperson William Martin said in a statement.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper will not be Kamala Harris' VP pick\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper issued a statement on Monday night signaling that he's removed himself from contention as a vice presidential running mate for presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\n\n\"I strongly support Vice President Harris' campaign for President. I know she's going to win and I was honored to be considered for this role. This just wasn't the right time for North Carolina and for me to potentially be on a national ticket,\" he said in a post on X.\n\n\"As l've said from the beginning, she has an outstanding list of people from which to choose, and we'll all work to make sure she wins,\" he added.\n\nTrump says he'll 'probably end up debating' Harris\n\nFormer President Donald Trump seems to be one step closer to formally agreeing to debate his opponent for the presidency, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nDuring an interview on The Ingraham Angle Monday night, Trump told the Fox News host that he will \"probably end up debating\" Harris. In his remarks, though, he also appeared to downplay the necessity of debates.\n\n\"I want to do a debate, but I also can say this. Everybody knows who I am. And now people know who she is,\" he said.\n\n\"If you're going to have a debate, you gotta do it, I think, before the votes are cast. I think it's very important that you do that. So, the answer is yes, but I can also make a case for not doing it,\" Trump said.\n\nA short while later, a spokesperson for Harris' campaign issued a statement on Trump's comments on Fox, insisting that the vice president will be at the next debate no matter what.\n\n\"Why won't Donald Trump give a straight answer on debating Vice President Harris? It's clear from tonight's question-dodging: he's scared he'll have to defend his running mate's weird attacks on women, or his own calls to end elections in America in a debate against the vice president. Vice President Harris will be on the debate stage September 10th. Donald Trump can show up, or not,\" the statement said.\n\nMegan Thee Stallion to perform at VP Kamala Harris' campaign rally in Atlanta: Source\n\nRapper Megan thee Stallion will give a special performance at Vice President Kamala Harris' rally in Atlanta, Georgia, on Tuesday, a source familiar confirmed to ABC News.\n\nIn addition to Megan thee Stallion, Georgia Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock and former Rep. Stacey Abrams will be in attendance, supporting Harris' 2024 presidential bid.\n\nThe news was first reported by Billboard.\n\nMarianne Williamson suspends her Democratic presidential bid, again\n\nDemocratic long-shot nominee Marianne Williamson has suspended her campaign for president, announcing on X Monday that it is \"time to let go\" of her bid for the White House.\n\nWilliamson said she failed to register for the Democratic National Convention's candidate directory by Saturday evening's deadline.\n\nHarris will be at ABC News debate with or without Trump, her campaign says\n\nVice President Kamala Harris will be at ABC News' Sept. 10 debate with or without former President Donald Trump, her campaign communications director said Monday.\n\n\"As Vice President Harris said last week, the American people deserve to hear from the two candidates running for the highest office in the land and she will do that at September's ABC debate,\" her campaign communications director, Michael Tyler, said in a statement first reported by the Hill. \"If Donald Trump and his team are saying anything other than 'we'll see you there' -- and it appears that they are -- it's a convenient, but expected backtrack from Team Trump. Vice President Harris will be there on September 10th -- we'll see if Trump shows.\"\n\nWhile Harris has previously affirmed her intention to be at the debate, this statement takes it a step further by saying she'll show up regardless of Trump's presence.\n\nTrump accepted the debate when Biden was still the presumptive Democratic nominee, though his campaign has since said they're waiting until there is an official Democratic nominee before agreeing to debates.\n\nElection content on social media 'could be propaganda' for foreign adversaries: ODNI\n\nContent about the election on social media \"could be propaganda\" for foreign adversaries, officials with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence warned on Monday.\n\n\"The American public should know that content that they read online, especially on social media, could be foreign propaganda, even if it appears to be coming from fellow Americans or originating in the United States,\" an ODNI official said on a conference call with reporters on Monday. \"In short, foreign influence actors are getting better at hiding their hand and using Americans to do it.\"\n\nRussia is still pervasive in this space and remains the biggest threat to the election, according to the officials.\n\nThe officials also warned that the influence operators will use the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump \"as part of their narratives portraying the event to fit their broad goals.\"\n\n-ABC News' Luke Barr\n\nDNC says it raked in $6.5M in grassroots donations in 24 hours after Biden endorsed Harris\n\nThe Democratic National Committee is claiming it has raised $6.5 million in grassroots donations in the 24 hours after President Biden's endorsement of Vice President Harris on July 21.\n\nThe DNC said $1 million was donated in the 5 p.m. hour alone for what they're claiming is a record for its best online fundraising day of all time.\n\nThe DNC is making a significant push in battleground states, investing an additional $15 million into those crucial states this month to fund new field offices, build data infrastructure, mobilize volunteers and strengthen coordinated campaigns.\n\n\"Democratic voters, volunteers, and grassroots donors are fired up,\" chairman Jaime Harrison said in a memo. \"We are confident that in our battleground states, Democrats will win up and down the ballot in November.\"\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear spoke on Sunday at the opening of Kamala Harris' campaign office in Forsyth County, Georgia.\n\nThe possible VP pick for Harris has been an effective surrogate for the vice president's White House bid over the weekend, coming to the metro Atlanta event fresh off of a stump in Iowa on Saturday night.\n\nThe red-state governor introduced himself to the Southern audience on Sunday while boosting Harris' candidacy and taking a number of swipes at Trump's Vice Presidential pick, JD Vance.\n\n\"Are you ready to beat Donald Trump? Are you ready to beat JD Vance? Are you ready to elect Kamala Harris president of the United States of America?\" Beshear asked the crowd, adding, \"Let's win this race,\"\n\n\"Let me tell you just a bit about myself,\" Beshear said. \"I'm a proud pro-union governor. I'm a proud pro-choice governor. I am a proud pro-public education governor. I am a proud pro-diversity governor and I'm a proud Harris for president governor,\" he added.\n\nCalling out Vance, Beshear said, \"Just let me be clear. JD Vance ain't from Kentucky. He ain't from Appalachia. And he ain't gonna be the vice president of the United States.\"\n\nFormer Vice President Al Gore endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday.\n\n\"As a prosecutor, [Kamala Harris] took on Big Oil companies -- and won. As [VP], she cast the tie-breaking vote to pass the most significant investment in climate solutions in history, the Inflation Reduction Act. That's the kind of climate champion we need in the White House,\" he wrote on X.\n\n\"With so much at stake in this year's election -- from strengthening democracy in the US and abroad, to expanding opportunity for the American people, to accelerating climate action -- I'm proud to endorse Kamala Harris for President,\" he added.\n\nDuring a quick stop at a diner in Minnesota on Sunday morning, Sen. JD Vance on Sunday spoke about his past criticisms of former President Donald Trump.\n\nWhen asked by ABC News if he and Trump have talked about his past criticism of the former president, Vance said yes, adding that Trump \"doesn't care about what I said eight years ago.\"\n\n\"I mean, look, President Trump and I have talked a lot about this,\" Vance said. \"In fact, I sometimes joke that I wish that he had the memory of Joe Biden, because he's got a memory like a steel trap, and he certainly remembers criticisms that people have made.\"\n\n\"But this is where the media, I think, really misses Trump -- Donald Trump accepts that people can change their mind, and you ask, 'Why did I change my mind on Donald Trump?' Because his agenda made people's lives better,\" Vance said.\n\n\"This whole thing is not about red team versus blue team or winning an election for its own sake. It's about getting a chance to govern so that you can bring down the cost of groceries, close that border and stop the fentanyl coming across our country for four years,\" Vance continued, saying he was \"wrong\" about Trump.\n\n\"He did a better job of that than anybody that I've ever seen as president in my lifetime. So I changed my mind, because he did a good job. And that's what you do when people do a good job and you're wrong. I've talked to President Trump a lot about it, but look, he, I mean, he just, he doesn't... He doesn't care about what I said eight years ago. He cares about whether we together [and] can govern the country successful.\"\n\nWhen asked again if the two have talked about the subject, specifically in the last week since his comments have resurfaced, Vance admitted that they haven't spoken about it and their conversations have focused on the race ahead.", "source": {"uri": "weisradio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WEIS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roy Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Thee_Stallion", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Megan Thee Stallion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_Care_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Affordable Care Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jen_O'Malley_Dillon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jen O'Malley Dillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Peters", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gary Peters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

He has called on Congress to quickly establish term limits and an enforceable ethics code for the court\u00b4s nine justices. He also called on lawmakers to ratify a constitutional amendment limiting presidential immunity.\n\nThe FBI says former President Donald Trump has agreed to be interviewed as part of the investigation into the assassination attempt in Pennsylvania this month.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris\u00b4 campaign raised $200 million since she emerged as the likely Democratic presidential nominee last week, an eyepopping haul in her race against former President Trump.\n\nFollow the AP\u00b4s Election-2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nRepublican candidate Donald Trump\u00b4s campaign released a new advertisement Tuesday, blasting Vice President Kamala Harris for problems at the U.S. southern border.\n\nFILE - Vice President Kamala Harris speaks, Jan. 11, 2022, in Atlanta. With President Joe Biden having bowed out of the presidential race and endorsing Harris, their party is suddenly eyeing an expanding map, betting that a new burst of energy and fundraising surge has helped make Georgia, the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020, a toss-up again. Harris is planning a show of political force on Tuesday, July 30, 2024, in Atlanta, the latest example of just how much the presidential contest against Republican former President Donald Trump has changed. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File)\n\nThe advertisement dubs Harris the \"border czar,\" a reference to her work on migration issues. It includes a parade of headlines about drugs and criminals entering the country, as well as a clip from a controversial interview that Harris did three years ago in which she brushed off a suggestion that she would visit the border.\n\n\"Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal,\" the advertisement brands Harris.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris\u00b4 campaign is kickstarting a $50 million advertising campaign with a new television spot calling the likely Democratic presidential nominee \"fearless\" throughout her career.\n\n\"Throughout her career as a courtroom prosecutor, attorney general, United States senator, and now as vice president, Kamala Harris has always stood up to bullies, criminals and special interests on behalf of the American people - and she\u00b4s beaten them,\" said a statement from Jen O\u00b4Malley Dillon, the campaign chair.\n\n\"She\u00b4s uniquely suited to take on Donald Trump, a convicted felon who has spent his entire life ripping off working people, tearing away our rights, and fighting for himself.\"\n\nThe advertisement is slated to run during the Olympics, \"The Bachelorette,\" \"The Daily Show\" and other popular programs. It\u00b4s an attempt to even the score with Republicans, who have been outspending Democrats on the airwaves during a chaotic summer when President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed Harris.\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion will join Vice President Kamala Harris for a special performance during her campaign stop in Atlanta on Tuesday.\n\nA Harris campaign spokesperson confirmed the hip-hop star\u00b4s performance alongside the vice president in a post on X on Monday night.\n\nThe Harris campaign is promising a large rally in Atlanta, on par with the large events that Republican former President Donald Trump has made his signature.\n\nIf Vice President Kamala Harris were to ascend to the presidency, she would become the first female president, but also one who is also multiracial.\n\nThe daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, both of whom immigrated to the U.S. during the Civil Rights Movement, Harris\u00b4 historic presidential bid has again put a spotlight on American identity politics and the growing number of people who say they are multiracial.\n\nDifferent countries divide people into categories depending on different national traditions. The U.S., with its slavery-molded history, divides people into Black or white, and nine million people identified as multiracial in 2010.\n\nWhen Harris ran for vice president in 2020, 33.8 million people in the U.S. identified as being more than one race, according to the census.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally, Saturday, July 27, 2024, in St. Cloud, Minn.

The Vice President is strong in both the blue wall and in the Sun Belt and we are running hard in both,' Harris' battleground states director Dan Kanninen said on a call with reporters on Monday.\n\nKamala Harris will tap Stacey Abrams to help her win Georgia\n\nAbrams has been a vocal defender of Harris in the past. The two African American women have endorsed each others' campaigns and supported each other in their respective races.\n\nRead More Forecaster who predicted every presidential winner for 40 YEARS reveals who is on course to win\n\nShe also helped Joe Biden win the state in the 2020 election, giving Democrats their first win there since Bill Clinton.\n\nOne point that Abrams has made repeatedly is that Harris would not receive the criticism she has gotten if she were a white male.\n\n'We will always question the person behind the person, but we cannot ignore the misogyny and racism remain very prevalent in our politics,' Abrams told MSNBC late last year.\n\n'For those behaviors that don't rise to either misogyny or racism, there's also just a difference. Our expectations are set for the traditional white male vice president. It's what it's always been. We are not always great with new,' she noted.\n\n'But more importantly, I know if you filter through the critiques, if you think about how she is castigated, it is inextricably linked to race and gender.'\n\nAbrams' defense came at a time when Harris, the first black and female vice president, was seeing record low approval ratings.\n\nHer services will likely be needed again as the presidential campaign continues and Donald Trump's campaign ratches up its attacks.\n\nTrump's running mate Sen. JD Vance has increased his efforts to frame Harris as a far-left politician out of touch with the American mainstream.\n\nVance on Sunday said that Harris has 'got a little bit of a bump from her introduction' but predicted it would soon dissipate.\n\n'Look, the people are going to learn her record,' Vance said. 'They're going to learn that she's a radical. They're going to learn that she's basically a San Francisco liberal who wants to take San Francisco policies to the entire country.'\n\nTrump himself has called Harris a 'crazy liberal.'\n\nStacey Abrams is a fervent defender of the vice president\n\nMeanwhile, Georgia played a crucial role in the last presidential election, and it is expected to be just as significant this November. According to several polls released last week, it's a virtual toss-up between Harris and Trump.\n\nPolls showed Joe Biden trailed Trump significantly in the state but Harris does much better against the former president.\n\nShe outperforms Biden among young people, Black voters, and Hispanic voters, key demographics that could decide swing states like Georgia and Arizona.\n\nGeorgia is a top focus with less than 100 days to go before the election.\n\nThe Harris campaign noted it has 24 offices open in the state nd 170 staffers on the ground there.\n\n'In Georgia, we're running the largest in state operation of any Democratic presidential campaign cycle ever,' campaign communications director Michael Tyler said.\n\nWhile in the state Harris plans to attack Trump for his ties to Project 2025 - an initiative from the Heritage Foundation that promotes conservative polices - and for his position on abortion rights.\n\nAnd while Harris focuses on Georgia, Trump will be focused on breaking the Democrats' blue wall.\n\nHe's holding a rally in Pennsylvania on Wednesday - his first visit back to the state since the assassination attempt on him in late June.\n\nHarris had surrogates in Pennsylvania on Monday to counter Trump - the state's Governor Josh Shapiro and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmore. Both Democrats have been names as possible Harris running mates.\n\nThe Harris campaign also has had surrogates Georgia, as she weighs who to pick as her number two.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who is reported to be a potential running mate, was in in the state on Sunday.\n\nThe Harris campaign is vetting him along with several other candidates, including Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Govs. Roy Cooper of North Carolina and Tim Walz of Minnesota.\n\nShe is expected to choose her vice presidential candidate by Aug. 7.\n\nHarris' campaign noted it's held some 2,300 organizing events in battleground states this weekend as several high-profile Democrats on her potential VP list stumped for her.\n\nJD Vance has tried to paint Kamala Harris as an out-of-touch liberal\n\nWith less than 100 days to go until Election Day, the Harris campaign is touting its fundraising and infrastructure, arguing it is well-positioned to beat Trump in November.\n\nThe campaign has taken in $200 million since Harris emerged as the likely Democratic presidential nominee last week.\n\nOver 170,000 volunteers have also signed up to help the Harris campaign with phone banking, canvassing and other get-out-the-vote efforts.\n\n'The momentum and energy for Vice President Harris is real -- and so are the fundamentals of this race: this election will be very close and decided by a small number of voters in just a few states,' Tyler wrote in a memo.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Trump's campaign did not respond to requests for comment, but the blitz comes as Harris' candidacy has changed the race.\n\nSince President Joe Biden dropped out last week and endorsed Harris, she has rapidly consolidated support within the Democratic Party and from big-money donors. She has also sparked a newfound energy among groups such as young voters that Biden had been struggling to win over.\n\nAfter months of attacks on Biden's fitness for office, Trump's campaign has had to pivot to find a new message to use against the younger and more dynamic Harris, 59, less than 100 days until the Nov. 5 election.\n\nOn Monday, Trump, 78, released an ad on his Truth Social platform using Harris's own words from old interviews, campaign events and debates to try to portray her as an extreme liberal out of touch with everyday Americans, particularly in the Rust Belt.\n\nIn response, Harris accused the Trump campaign of lying about her record.\n\n\"Vice President Harris has been a key leader in working across the aisle to pass the Biden-Harris administration's historic, popular agenda,\" said Harris spokesperson Sarafina Chitika.\n\nSince she emerged as her party's candidate, Harris has focused on Trump's felony convictions in a New York hush-money trial and the other criminal charges he faces, and portrayed him as responsible for a wave of anti-abortion measures in Republican-led states around the country.\n\nA super PAC supporting Trump, MAGA Inc., kicked off a parallel ad blitz when it said last week it will spend $32 million in three states with new ads criticizing Harris.\n\nUnlike presidential campaigns, there are no limits on donations to super PACs, meaning they often have more money to spend. But they are not permitted to coordinate with campaigns on strategy.\n\nFuture Forward, a Democratic super PAC, said it is launching a $50 million effort to back Harris in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the six states seen as pivotal to deciding the election because their voting preferences can swing either way.\n\nHarris' campaign said on Sunday that it raised $200 million in new campaign funds last week.\n\nWhile Harris is well known, her policy positions are not.\n\n\"She has a second chance to make a first impression,\" said pollster Evan Roth Smith of the Democratic polling firm Blueprint.\n\nBut the danger for Harris lies in whether the Trump campaign can define her in voters' minds before her campaign can make it to the airwaves, he said.\n\nBrian Schimming, chair of Wisconsin's Republican Party, said Republicans are moving to do just that.\n\n\"It's about letting people know that if you didn't like Joe Biden, you're really not going to like Kamala Harris,\" he said.\n\nAs a candidate for president during the 2020 election, Harris adopted several left-leaning positions on immigration and healthcare in a bid to court liberals. But as Biden's vice president, she has has stayed true to the administration's more pragmatic policies.", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [{"uri":

No. 2, she doesn't like Jewish people. You know it, I know it and everybody knows it, and nobody wants to say it.\"\n\nThe Republican former president then said, \"If you're Jewish, if you vote for a Democrat, you're a fool, an absolute fool. They have let Jewish people down since Obama at a level that nobody could believe.\"\n\nAs the interview went on, Trump again said Harris \"dislikes Jewish people.\" The interview host, Sid Rosenberg, then mentioned Emhoff and said, \"He's Jewish like Bernie Sanders is Jewish. Are you kidding me?\"\n\nRosenberg went on, saying of Emhoff, \"He's a horrible Jew.\"\n\nJames Singer, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, said, \"America is better than the fear, hate, and despicable insults of Donald Trump. Vice President Harris believes Americans want a president who unites our country instead of divides it, uses the power of the presidency to help families instead of hurt them, and has a vision for our future, instead of taking us backwards.\"\n\nDemocratic governors and other officials under consideration to be Democrat Kamala Harris' vice presidential running mate are practicing a time-honored tradition in presidential campaigns. They're walking the line between open self-promotion and loyal advocacy for the potential boss in what amounts to unofficial auditions.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro campaigned for Harris on Monday outside Philadelphia. He blasted Republican former President Donald Trump and called Harris ready to lead. But he also showcased his own accomplishments.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear took a similar approach over the weekend. He told voters in Georgia that Harris has the makings of \"a great president,\" and then highlighted the elections he has won as a Democrat in Republican territory.\n\nHarris is said to also be considering Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, among others.\n\nThe acting director of the Secret Service said Tuesday he \"cannot defend\" why the roof used by the gunman in the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump was not secured.\n\nRonald Rowe, testifying before two Senate committees, said that he recently traveled to the Pennsylvania shooting site where Trump had been holding a campaign rally, and that \"what I saw made me ashamed.\"\n\nRowe was joined at a joint hearing of the Senate committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security by FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate.\n\nThe FBI's No. 2 official said a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from when the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, would have been in high school.\n\nRepublican Donald Trump's campaign announced Tuesday, hours ahead of a rally planned by Vice President Kamala Harris at Georgia State University, that he will travel to Atlanta on Saturday for a rally in the same venue.\n\nDemocrats say they have new hope for winning Georgia in November after President Joe Biden bowed out of the race and endorsed Harris. They're betting that a fresh burst of energy and a surge in fundraising has helped make Georgia -- the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020 -- a toss-up again.\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nRepublican candidate Donald Trump's campaign released a new advertisement Tuesday, blasting Vice President Kamala Harris for problems at the U.S. southern border.\n\nThe advertisement dubs Harris the \"border czar,\" a reference to her work on migration issues. It includes a parade of headlines about drugs and criminals entering the country, as well as a clip from a controversial interview that Harris did three years ago in which she brushed off a suggestion that she would visit the border.\n\n\"Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal,\" the advertisement brands Harris.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris' campaign is kickstarting a $50 million advertising campaign with a new television spot calling the likely Democratic presidential nominee \"fearless\" throughout her career.\n\n\"Throughout her career as a courtroom prosecutor, attorney general, United States senator, and now as vice president, Kamala Harris has always stood up to bullies, criminals and special interests on behalf of the American people - and she's beaten them,\" said a statement from Jen O'Malley Dillon, the campaign chair.\n\n\"She's uniquely suited to take on Donald Trump, a convicted felon who has spent his entire life ripping off working people, tearing away our rights, and fighting for himself.\"\n\nThe advertisement is slated to run during the Olympics, \"The Bachelorette,\" \"The Daily Show\" and other popular programs. It's an attempt to even the score with Republicans, who have been outspending Democrats on the airwaves during a chaotic summer when President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed Harris.\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion will join Vice President Kamala Harris for a special performance during her campaign stop in Atlanta on Tuesday.\n\nA Harris campaign spokesperson confirmed the hip-hop star's performance alongside the vice president in a post on X on Monday night.\n\nThe Harris campaign is promising a large rally in Atlanta, on par with the large events that Republican former President Donald Trump has made his signature.\n\nIf Vice President Kamala Harris were to ascend to the presidency, she would become the first female president, but also one who is also multiracial.\n\nThe daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, both of whom immigrated to the U.S. during the Civil Rights Movement, Harris' historic presidential bid has again put a spotlight on American identity politics and the growing number of people who say they are multiracial.\n\nDifferent countries divide people into categories depending on different national traditions.

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nTrump also appears to be backing away from his earlier commitment to debate Harris, questioning the value of a meetup and saying that he \"probably\" will debate but that he \"can also make a case for not doing it\" -- prompting her campaign to say he's \"scared.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAnd Senate lawmakers grilled the acting director of the Secret Service about law enforcement lapses in the hours before the attempted assassination of Trump.\n\nFollow the AP's Election-2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nHarris' potential running mates walk a fine line\n\nDemocratic governors and other officials under consideration to be Democrat Kamala Harris' vice presidential running mate are practicing a time-honored tradition in presidential campaigns. They're walking the line between open self-promotion and loyal advocacy for the potential boss in what amounts to unofficial auditions.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro campaigned for Harris on Monday outside Philadelphia. He blasted Republican former President Donald Trump and called Harris ready to lead. But he also showcased his own accomplishments.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear took a similar approach over the weekend. He told voters in Georgia that Harris has the makings of \"a great president,\" and then highlighted the elections he has won as a Democrat in Republican territory.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHarris is said to also be considering Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, among others.\n\nSecret Service head, FBI's No. 2 grilled by Senate lawmakers\n\nThe acting director of the Secret Service said Tuesday he \"cannot defend\" why the roof used by the gunman in the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump was not secured.\n\nRonald Rowe, testifying before two Senate committees, said that he recently traveled to the Pennsylvania shooting site where Trump had been holding a campaign rally, and that \"what I saw made me ashamed.\"\n\nRowe was joined at a joint hearing of the Senate committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security by FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate.\n\nThe FBI's No. 2 official said a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from when the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, would have been in high school.\n\nTrump plans rally at same Georgia venue as Harris event\n\nRepublican Donald Trump's campaign announced Tuesday, hours ahead of a rally planned by Vice President Kamala Harris at Georgia State University, that he will travel to Atlanta on Saturday for a rally in the same venue.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDemocrats say they have new hope for winning Georgia in November after President Joe Biden bowed out of the race and endorsed Harris. They're betting that a fresh burst of energy and a surge in fundraising has helped make Georgia -- the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020 -- a toss-up again.\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nTrump ad blasts Harris for problems at the border\n\nRepublican candidate Donald Trump's campaign released a new advertisement Tuesday, blasting Vice President Kamala Harris for problems at the U.S. southern border.\n\nThe advertisement dubs Harris the \"border czar,\" a reference to her work on migration issues. It includes a parade of headlines about drugs and criminals entering the country, as well as a clip from a controversial interview that Harris did three years ago in which she brushed off a suggestion that she would visit the border.\n\n\"Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal,\" the advertisement brands Harris.\n\nNew $50 million ad portrays Harris as 'fearless'\n\nVice President Kamala Harris' campaign is kickstarting a $50 million advertising campaign with a new television spot calling the likely Democratic presidential nominee \"fearless\" throughout her career.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Throughout her career as a courtroom prosecutor, attorney general, United States senator, and now as vice president, Kamala Harris has always stood up to bullies, criminals and special interests on behalf of the American people - and she's beaten them,\" said a statement from Jen O'Malley Dillon, the campaign chair.\n\n\"She's uniquely suited to take on Donald Trump, a convicted felon who has spent his entire life ripping off working people, tearing away our rights, and fighting for himself.\"\n\nThe advertisement is slated to run during the Olympics, \"The Bachelorette,\" \"The Daily Show\" and other popular programs. It's an attempt to even the score with Republicans, who have been outspending Democrats on the airwaves during a chaotic summer when President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed Harris.\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion to campaign for Harris\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion will join Vice President Kamala Harris for a special performance during her campaign stop in Atlanta on Tuesday.\n\nA Harris campaign spokesperson confirmed the hip-hop star's performance alongside the vice president in a post on X on Monday night.\n\nThe Harris campaign is promising a large rally in Atlanta, on par with the large events that Republican former President Donald Trump has made his signature.\n\nHarris has America focused on multiracial identity\n\nIf Vice President Kamala Harris were to ascend to the presidency, she would become the first female president, but also one who is also multiracial.\n\nThe daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, both of whom immigrated to the U.S. during the Civil Rights Movement, Harris' historic presidential bid has again put a spotlight on American identity politics and the growing number of people who say they are multiracial.\n\nDifferent countries divide people into categories depending on different national traditions. The U.S., with its slavery-molded history, divides people into Black or white, and nine million people identified as multiracial in 2010.\n\nWhen Harris ran for vice president in 2020, 33.8 million people in the U.S. identified as being more than one race, according to the census.\n\nRead more on the U.S. Election at thestar.com", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Trump's campaign did not respond to requests for comment, but the blitz comes as Harris' candidacy has changed the race.\n\nSince President Joe Biden dropped out last week and endorsed Harris, she has rapidly consolidated support within the Democratic Party and from big-money donors. She has also sparked a newfound energy among groups such as young voters that Biden had been struggling to win over.\n\nAfter months of attacks on Biden's fitness for office, Trump's campaign has had to pivot to find a new message to use against the younger and more dynamic Harris, 59, less than 100 days until the Nov. 5 election.\n\nOn Monday, Trump, 78, released an ad on his Truth Social platform using Harris's own words from old interviews, campaign events and debates to try to portray her as an extreme liberal out of touch with everyday Americans, particularly in the Rust Belt.\n\nIn response, Harris accused the Trump campaign of lying about her record.\n\n\"Vice President Harris has been a key leader in working across the aisle to pass the Biden-Harris administration's historic, popular agenda,\" said Harris spokesperson Sarafina Chitika.\n\nSince she emerged as her party's candidate, Harris has focused on Trump's felony convictions in a New York hush-money trial and the other criminal charges he faces, and portrayed him as responsible for a wave of anti-abortion measures in Republican-led states around the country.\n\nA super PAC supporting Trump, MAGA Inc., kicked off a parallel ad blitz when it said last week it will spend $32 million in three states with new ads criticising Harris.\n\nUnlike presidential campaigns, there are no limits on donations to super PACs, meaning they often have more money to spend. But they are not permitted to coordinate with campaigns on strategy.\n\nFuture Forward, a Democratic super PAC, said it is launching a $50 million effort to back Harris in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the six states seen as pivotal to deciding the election because their voting preferences can swing either way.\n\nHarris' campaign said on Sunday that it raised $200 million in new campaign funds last week.\n\nWhile Harris is well known, her policy positions are not.\n\n\"She has a second chance to make a first impression,\" said pollster Evan Roth Smith of the Democratic polling firm Blueprint.\n\nBut the danger for Harris lies in whether the Trump campaign can define her in voters' minds before her campaign can make it to the airwaves, he said.\n\nBrian Schimming, chair of Wisconsin's Republican Party, said Republicans are moving to do just that.\n\n\"It's about letting people know that if you didn't like Joe Biden, you're really not going to like Kamala Harris,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "tbsnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Business Standard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

JD Vance, R-Ohio, told donors that running against Vice President Kamala Harris presents a \"unique opportunity\" but acknowledged her relative youth and lower profile when compared to President Biden offer the campaign challenges as well.\n\n\"We have a very unique opportunity, but also a very unique challenge, because, let's be honest, 10 days ago, the two candidates who were running for president, everybody had an opinion about 'em. Love 'em or hate 'em, everybody has an opinion about Donald Trump and Joe Biden after the past eight years,\" Vance privately told donors in Minnesota of Biden's decision to drop out of the race and endorse Harris, according to a recording of the Ohio senator's remarks obtained by the Washington Post. \"But Kamala Harris, people don't really know.\"\n\nThe remarks come as the Trump campaign continues to adjust to the new reality of the race, pivoting from running against a candidate whose age and mental acuity were among the top concerns of voters to highlighting Harris' role in an administration that remains unpopular with Americans.\n\nHARRIS CLOSES IN ON TRUMP IN ELECTION BETTING MARKETS\n\nVance told donors that the campaign would have to attack Harris' previous positions, including her opposition to fracking, praising the \"defund the police\" movement, and her record on the border, the report notes.\n\nThe message echoed a similar sentiment Vance expressed to reporters the day after Biden's decision, when the Ohio senator cited Harris' role in the administration as being a weak spot for the vice president, most notably when it comes to issues such as border security.\n\n\"I don't think the political calculus changes at all,\" Vance said. \"We were running against Joe Biden's open border, Kamala Harris's open border. Kamala Harris supported the green new scam. Kamala Harris, frankly, covered Joe Biden even though it was obvious he was mentally incompetent for a very long time.\"\n\nHowever, Vance admitted to donors that running against Harris also presents a new challenge for the campaign, noting that she does not come with some of the \"baggage\" Biden had on the trail.\n\n\"All of us were hit with a little bit of a political sucker punch,\" Vance. \"The bad news is that Kamala Harris does not have the same baggage as Joe Biden, because whatever we might have to say, Kamala is a lot younger. And Kamala Harris is obviously not struggling in the same ways that Joe Biden did.\"\n\nFLASHBACK: HARRIS COMPARED ICE TO KKK, SAID IMAGES OF BORDER PATROL AGENTS 'EVOKED SLAVERY'\n\nNevertheless, the campaign has continued to express confidence in running against the vice president, who Trump has argued is worse than Biden.\n\n\"Lyin' Kamala Harris, the Biden appointed 'Border Czar' who never visited the Border, and whose incompetence gave us the WORST and MOST DANGEROUS Border anywhere in the World, has absolutely terrible pole [sic] numbers against a fine and brilliant young man named DONALD J. TRUMP! Be careful what you wish for, Democrats,\" Trump posted on Truth Social in reaction to the news that Biden was dropping out of the race last week.\n\nTrump adviser Jason Miller struck a similar tone in an interview with Fox News the day after Biden's announcement, arguing that \"Democrats are a bit of jumping out of the frying pan into the fire.\"\n\n\"And they may have gotten rid of one problem with Joe Biden, but they've inherited a whole new problem with Kamala Harris,\" Miller said.\n\nDEMOCRATS TO CONFIRM NOMINEES BY VIRTUAL ROLL CALL WEEKS BEFORE DNC IN CHICAGO TO AVOID LEGAL CHALLENGES\n\nWhen reached for comment by Fox News Digital, a spokesperson for Vance argued that the campaign is excited to take on Harris, a candidate who polls have long showed is not popular with voters.\n\n\"Poll after poll shows President Trump leading Kamala Harris as voters become aware of her weak, failed, and dangerously liberal agenda,\" the spokesperson, William Martin, said Tuesday. \"Her far-left ideas are even more radioactive than Joe Biden, particularly in the key swing states that will decide this election like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital that Harris is a \"weak\" candidate.\n\n\"Democrats are in complete disarray after their coup that forcibly removed Biden from the campaign, proving they are the real threats to democracy,\" Cheung said Tuesday. \"The fact remains that Kamala Harris is weak, failed, and dangerously liberal, and no amount of gaslighting from her or her campaign will erase her despicable record.\"\n\nPolls have shown a tighter race for Trump against Harris in the week since Biden's decision to drop out, with the Real Clear Politics polling average showing Trump with a 3.1 point lead over Biden nationally but just a 1.7 lead over Harris.\n\nHarris has also gained significant ground on Trump in presidential betting markets, with Trump having a 55% chance to win the election and Harris having a 39% chance, according to the Real Clear Politics betting odds average.\n\nWhile Trump maintains a 16-point gap, Trump enjoyed an almost 43-point gap between himself and Harris on July 20, the day before Biden dropped out of the election, and a nearly 52-point lead over Biden.\n\nHowever, Martin argued that Trump will have a wide advantage once voters become more familiar with Harris' policies.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Her far-left ideas are even more radioactive than Joe Biden, particularly in the key swing states that will decide this election like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin,\" Martin said.\n\nThe Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment.", "source": {"uri":

It is Trump's biggest ad buy since January, when he was fighting off Republican rivals for the party's nomination.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign will launch a $10 million advertising blitz in six battleground states this week as it tries to counter a surge of voter enthusiasm and donations for his Democratic rival Kamala Harris.\n\nIt is Trump's biggest ad buy since January, when he was fighting off Republican rivals for the party's nomination. Trump's campaign did not respond to requests for comment, but the blitz comes as Harris' candidacy has changed the race. Since President Joe Biden dropped out last week and endorsed Harris, she has rapidly consolidated support within the Democratic Party and from big-money donors. She has also sparked a newfound energy among groups such as young voters that Biden had been struggling to win over.\n\nAfter months of attacks on Biden's fitness for office, Trump's campaign has had to pivot to find a new message to use against the younger and more dynamic Harris, 59, less than 100 days until the Nov. 5 election. On Monday, Trump, 78, released an ad on his Truth Social platform using Harris's own words from old interviews, campaign events and debates to try to portray her as an extreme liberal out of touch with everyday Americans, particularly in the Rust Belt.\n\nIn response, Harris accused the Trump campaign of lying about her record. \"Vice President Harris has been a key leader in working across the aisle to pass the Biden-Harris administration's historic, popular agenda,\" said Harris spokesperson Sarafina Chitika.\n\nSince she emerged as her party's candidate, Harris has focused on Trump's felony convictions in a New York hush-money trial and the other criminal charges he faces, and portrayed him as responsible for a wave of anti-abortion measures in Republican-led states around the country. A super PAC supporting Trump, MAGA Inc., kicked off a parallel ad blitz when it said last week it will spend $32 million in three states with new ads criticizing Harris.\n\nUnlike presidential campaigns, there are no limits on donations to super PACs, meaning they often have more money to spend. But they are not permitted to coordinate with campaigns on strategy. Future Forward, a Democratic super PAC, said it is launching a $50 million effort to back Harris in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the six states seen as pivotal to deciding the election because their voting preferences can swing either way.\n\nHarris' campaign said on Sunday that it raised $200 million in new campaign funds last week. While Harris is well known, her policy positions are not.\n\n\"She has a second chance to make a first impression,\" said pollster Evan Roth Smith of the Democratic polling firm Blueprint. But the danger for Harris lies in whether the Trump campaign can define her in voters' minds before her campaign can make it to the airwaves, he said.\n\nBrian Schimming, chair of Wisconsin's Republican Party, said Republicans are moving to do just that. \"It's about letting people know that if you didn't like Joe Biden, you're really not going to like Kamala Harris,\" he said.\n\nAs a candidate for president during the 2020 election, Harris adopted several left-leaning positions on immigration and healthcare in a bid to court liberals. But as Biden's vice president, she has has stayed true to the administration's more pragmatic policies.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated

That would bring Harris' total campaign staff in those states to 750 people, up from 600. In Arizona and North Carolina, Harris plans to double the size of her campaign staff, a sign that her strategists believe those states are back in play after some in the party had suggested they had become unwinnable when President Joe Biden was still at the top of the ticket.\n\n\"This election is going to be incredibly close, so this campaign is getting to work and taking nothing for granted,\" Harris for President communications director Michael Tyler told reporters during a conference call on Monday afternoon.\n\nCampaign data shows a lot of Democratic voters who had been holding back for Biden immediately got off the sideline last week to back Harris. Of the $200 million Harris has raised since Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, two-thirds came from people who hadn't donated so far this cycle, her campaign said Monday. And her campaign signed up a striking 360,000 new volunteers in its first week.\n\nHarris Campaign officials believe that the extensive network they had already built for Biden is kicking into high gear for the Vice President. Over the weekend, volunteers knocked on 126,000 doors and made 768,635 phone calls, a Harris campaign official said, far more than campaign leaders had anticipated at this stage in the campaign.\n\nHarris will hold a campaign rally at Georgia State University in Atlanta on Tuesday evening and meet with local advocates for reproductive rights, an issue her campaign believes will be decisive for voters in close states.\n\nAlmost immediately, Harris' campaign has captured the momentum in the race, while gaining traction with framing Trump as \"weird\" and his running mate J.D. Vance as a callous critic of \"childless cat ladies.\" Speaking at a rally in St. Cloud, Minn. on Saturday, Trump tried to kick back at Harris calling her \"a radical left lunatic\" and mocking the way she laughs. But so far, the critiques of Harris from the right haven't dampened the energy behind her run.\n\nIt's an unusual position for Trump, who has built his political career by dominating the news cycle with unexpected and outlandish comments, and as recently as mid-July seemed ascendant in the race following the assassination attempt against him in Butler, Pa.\n\nDan Kanninen, the battleground state director for Harris, said the campaign \"will not get comfortable.\"\n\nIn addition to campaigning in Georgia, Harris will travel to Houston on Thursday to attend Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee's funeral service. Also this week, Harris's staff is working to vet vice presidential candidates with an eye to her being able to pick a running mate as soon as next week.", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_bennett@time.com", "name": "Brian Bennett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

JD Vance, as \"weird.\"\n\nSenate lawmakers are expected Tuesday to grill the acting director of the Secret Service about law enforcement lapses in the hours before the attempted assassination of Trump.\n\nFollow the AP's Election-2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nTrump ad blasts Harris for problems at the border\n\nRepublican candidate Donald Trump's campaign released a new advertisement Tuesday, blasting Vice President Kamala Harris for problems at the U.S. southern border.\n\nThe advertisement dubs Harris the \"border czar,\" a reference to her work on migration issues. It includes a parade of headlines about drugs and criminals entering the country, as well as a clip from a controversial interview that Harris did three years ago in which she brushed off a suggestion that she would visit the border.\n\n\"Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal,\" the advertisement brands Harris.\n\nNew $50 million ad portrays Harris as 'fearless'\n\nVice President Kamala Harris' campaign is kickstarting a $50 million advertising campaign with a new television spot calling the likely Democratic presidential nominee \"fearless\" throughout her career.\n\n\"Throughout her career as a courtroom prosecutor, attorney general, United States senator, and now as vice president, Kamala Harris has always stood up to bullies, criminals and special interests on behalf of the American people - and she's beaten them,\" said a statement from Jen O'Malley Dillon, the campaign chair.\n\n\"She's uniquely suited to take on Donald Trump, a convicted felon who has spent his entire life ripping off working people, tearing away our rights, and fighting for himself.\"\n\nThe advertisement is slated to run during the Olympics, \"The Bachelorette,\" \"The Daily Show\" and other popular programs. It's an attempt to even the score with Republicans, who have been outspending Democrats on the airwaves during a chaotic summer when President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed Harris.\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion to campaign for Harris\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion will join Vice President Kamala Harris for a special performance during her campaign stop in Atlanta on Tuesday.\n\nA Harris campaign spokesperson confirmed the hip-hop star's performance alongside the vice president in a post on X on Monday night.\n\nThe Harris campaign is promising a large rally in Atlanta, on par with the large events that Republican former President Donald Trump has made his signature.\n\nHarris has America focused on multiracial identity\n\nIf Vice President Kamala Harris were to ascend to the presidency, she would become the first female president, but also one who is also multiracial.\n\nThe daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, both of whom immigrated to the U.S. during the Civil Rights Movement, Harris' historic presidential bid has again put a spotlight on American identity politics and the growing number of people who say they are multiracial.\n\nDifferent countries divide people into categories depending on different national traditions. The U.S., with its slavery-molded history, divides people into Black or white, and nine million people identified as multiracial in 2010.\n\nWhen Harris ran for vice president in 2020, 33.8 million people in the U.S. identified as being more than one race, according to the census.\n\nMore from this section\n\nPIC's WooSOS Plugin Streamlines Ecommerce Through WooCommerce and SOS Inventory Integration\n\nFix Support Apple Com/iPhone/Restore in 5 Minutes - iOS 18 Supported\n\nInformative Research's Kelly Richards Receives MPA Elite Women Award", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kulr8.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Thee_Stallion", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Megan Thee Stallion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Enjoying a burst of voter enthusiasm and campaign cash, the vice president is vying for Sun Belt states that Democrats had all but written off -- Georgia, Arizona and Nevada -- as well as the Democrats' so-called \"Blue Wall\" of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\n\nHarris' event in Georgia's largest city is her first major effort to put a larger group of states back in play since launching her campaign on July 21. Rapper Megan Thee Stallion plans to make an appearance at the rally, she announced Monday on her Instagram account.\n\nHarris' campaign is confident that her relative popularity among key voting groups -- including women, younger voters and people of color -- has helped expand the electoral map, according to people familiar with their thinking. Those groups had drifted from Biden but have gravitated to the new presumptive Democratic nominee, who would become the first Black woman and Asian American president if she wins in November.\n\n\"The data is clear: We have multiple pathways to 270 electoral votes,\" Dan Kanninen, battleground director for the Harris campaign, told reporters on Monday. \"The vice president is strong in both the Blue Wall and in the Sun Belt, and we are running hard in both.\"\n\nEven before Biden's dramatic exit from the race, Harris had spent more time campaigning in the South and West than the president. Georgia is a state where the campaign sees that investment poised to pay off.\n\nThe vice president's visit to Georgia on Tuesday is her 15th since taking office and her campaign has bragged about its presence there, which includes 24 offices.\n\nA spree of activity by Trump and his supporters indicates they, too, see Georgia as competitive.\n\nThe former president and his running mate, JD Vance, announced plans for a Saturday rally in Atlanta. Trump and his allied super political action committee have booked $14.7 million in advertising in Georgia through the end of August, according to AdImpact, almost triple the $4.9 million that Future Forward PAC, which backs Harris, is set to spend.\n\nHarris' campaign on Tuesday launched a $50 million ad campaign in battleground states touting her background as a prosecutor. The announcement did not specify how much would be spent in Georgia.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump won Georgia by over 5 percentage points in 2016 but lost it to Biden four years later by less than a quarter of a point, the first time a Democratic nominee carried the Peach State in nearly three decades. The 2020 election left an indelible mark: Trump was indicted last year on state charges he sought to overturn his loss.\n\nTurning out Black voters in Atlanta will be crucial to Harris' chances.\n\nThe city has long been a magnet for people of color, with a cluster of historically Black colleges and universities that have been a pipeline for young professionals and a source of political activism. Harris attended Howard University, a prestigious historically Black college in Washington.\n\nAtlanta is a popular landing spot for members of the Divine Nine -- the most prominent Black fraternities and sororities -- whose network Harris has tapped as a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha. They offer her campaign an organic ground game in the state.\n\nRepresentative Nikema Williams, who also chairs the Georgia Democratic Party and will attend Harris' event, said her home state remains a \"true battleground.\"\n\n\"We're seeing the excitement on the ground, we're seeing people sign up to volunteer who haven't volunteered before,\" Williams said in an interview.\n\nAn Emerson College poll earlier in July when Biden was still in the race showed him trailing Trump in Georgia 47% to 41%. A poll taken after Harris' entry showed her narrowing the gap to 48% to 46%.\n\nBiden ended his bid after pressure from fellow Democrats alarmed by his calamitous debate against Trump. Polls showed the race moving in Trump's direction. The Republican gained an edge in many swing states and put places Biden carried easily in 2020, such as Minnesota and Virginia, into play.\n\n\"He was expanding the map into states that Democrats really had no business losing in,\" said Amy Walter, publisher of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. Harris \"took what was a rapidly expanding map, which was benefiting Trump, and has narrowed it back to the battleground states.\"\n\nWith Biden atop the ticket, Democrats viewed the Blue Wall states as his best path to reelection. The president often touted his pro-union stance in an effort to win over White, working-class voters.\n\nHigh inflation, however, has overshadowed Biden's investments in domestic manufacturing and infrastructure. Broad voter skepticism over the administration's handling of the economy also threatens to undercut Harris' campaign.\n\nKanninen, the battleground director, said in an interview there is no indication Harris is performing worse across the Blue Wall.\n\n\"We've seen no data to suggest a backslide whatsoever,\" he said. \"The theory of the case has been win close races across several geographies and have the resources to do it.\"\n\nHarris' campaign has enrolled at least 170,000 new volunteers since Biden endorsed her, including over 50,000 in the battleground states, Kanninen said.\n\nDemocrats also have renewed hopes of competing in Nevada, a state with a relatively young electorate with large Black, Latino and Asian and Pacific Islander populations.\n\n\"When it comes to turning out must-win constituencies, energizing young voters and connecting with Nevada families on the issues that matter to them, Vice President Harris has already begun working to win and earn and their vote,\" said Molly Forgey, a Democratic campaign operative in the state.\n\nThe party saw a surge of interest there when Biden endorsed Harris, a Democratic campaign official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. About 600 new volunteers signed up that day. Harris also has cultivated ties with Nevada labor groups, including the powerful Culinary Workers Union most recently during a visit to Las Vegas in January.", "source": {"uri": "dailymaverick.co.za",

It includes a parade of headlines about drugs and criminals entering the country, as well as a clip from a controversial interview that Harris did three years ago in which she brushed off a suggestion that she would visit the border.\n\n\"Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal,\" the advertisement brands Harris.\n\nNew $50 million ad portrays Harris as 'fearless'\n\nVice President Kamala Harris' campaign is kickstarting a $50 million advertising campaign with a new television spot calling the likely Democratic presidential nominee \"fearless\" throughout her career.\n\n\"Throughout her career as a courtroom prosecutor, attorney general, United States senator, and now as vice president, Kamala Harris has always stood up to bullies, criminals and special interests on behalf of the American people - and she's beaten them,\" said a statement from Jen O'Malley Dillon, the campaign chair.\n\n\"She's uniquely suited to take on Donald Trump, a convicted felon who has spent his entire life ripping off working people, tearing away our rights, and fighting for himself.\"\n\nThe advertisement is slated to run during the Olympics, \"The Bachelorette,\" \"The Daily Show\" and other popular programs. It's an attempt to even the score with Republicans, who have been outspending Democrats on the airwaves during a chaotic summer when President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed Harris.\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion to campaign for Harris\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion will join Vice President Kamala Harris for a special performance during her campaign stop in Atlanta on Tuesday.\n\nA Harris campaign spokesperson confirmed the hip-hop star's performance alongside the vice president in a post on X on Monday night.\n\nThe Harris campaign is promising a large rally in Atlanta, on par with the large events that Republican former President Donald Trump has made his signature.\n\nHarris has America focused on multiracial identity\n\nIf Vice President Kamala Harris were to ascend to the presidency, she would become the first female president, but also one who is also multiracial.\n\nThe daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, both of whom immigrated to the U.S. during the Civil Rights Movement, Harris' historic presidential bid has again put a spotlight on American identity politics and the growing number of people who say they are multiracial.\n\nDifferent countries divide people into categories depending on different national traditions. The U.S., with its slavery-molded history, divides people into Black or white, and nine million people identified as multiracial in 2010.\n\nWhen Harris ran for vice president in 2020, 33.8 million

It's a sign that the former president has settled on a longstanding GOP line of attack against the vice president, after grappling with the abrupt change atop the Democratic ticket.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, unveiled a minute-long ad entitled \"Fearless\" that offers highlights of her career dating to her tenure as a prosecutor in the Bay Area of California - as she scrambles to introduce herself as the prospective nominee to voters following President Joe Biden's decision to end his reelection bid. It's part of what the Harris campaign said will be a $50 million blitz in the run-up to next month's Democratic National Convention - fueled, in part, by the record-breaking fundraising the Harris campaign has seen since Biden's departure from the race and endorsement of her candidacy a little more than a week ago.\n\nTrump, in two new campaign ads, seeks to define Harris on his terms by relying on what has been a political liability for the Biden administration: the management of the US-Mexico border.\n\nRepublicans have jumped on an assignment given to Harris - the task of addressing the root causes of migration in Central America - to cast her falsely as the nation's \"border czar\" and as solely responsible for the record number of migrant arrivals at the US southern border over the last three years.\n\nBoth Trump campaign ads pull from a 2021 NBC interview during which Harris was pressed about the fact that she hadn't yet visited the US-Mexico border and she stumbled through a response by claiming she also hadn't yet gone to Europe - an answer that perplexed administration officials at the time.\n\nAnother shows a video of Harris dancing at an event, stating: \"This is America's border czar - and she's failed us.\"\n\nThe ads conclude with a description of Harris as \"failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal.\"\n\nIn response, Harris campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said Trump is \"running on his trademark lies\" and said the former president opposed a congressional border deal that would have helped with enforcement.\n\nHarris' root cause work dates to March 2021. During an influx of unaccompanied migrant children, Biden tasked the vice president with overseeing diplomatic efforts in Central America. While Harris focused on long-term fixes, the Department of Homeland Security remained responsible for overseeing border security.\n\nAs the vice president's campaign takes shape and as immigration remains a top issue for voters, her team is forced to contend with an assignment that, sources say, has showed early success in Central America as a result of major private-sector investment but that's been bundled with the administration's larger migration issues.\n\nThe Trump campaign so far has reserved about $12.2 million in advertising across six battleground states - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - through August 12, according to data from AdImpact, which tracks media buying.\n\nEven as she seeks to introduce herself to voters, Harris' new campaign ad also goes on the attack against Trump, using some of the vice president's remarks at her first rally as the presumptive Democratic nominee for president.\n\n\"Donald Trump wants to take our country backward,\" Harris can be heard saying in the ad. \"To give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and end the Affordable Care Act. But we are not going back.\"\n\nIn a statement, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon noted the former president's May felony conviction for falsifying business records and said that Harris' career - ranging from a courtroom prosecutor and California attorney general to her current role in the Biden administration - makes her \"uniquely suited to take on Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe new Harris ad, according to the campaign, will air during the Olympics along with other programs - such as \"Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta,\" \"The Bachelorette\" and \"The Daily Show\" - that target demographic groups the campaign is trying to reach.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "priscilla_alvarez@cnn.com", "name": "Priscilla Alvarez", "type":

JD Vance, R-Ohio, privately admitted that Kamala Harris' presumptive Democratic nomination is a \"political sucker punch\" to the Trump campaign, The Washington Post reported.\n\nAhead of a rally in Minnesota on Saturday, Vance privately told GOP donors that Harris presents a unique challenge to the Republican Party, despite the Trump campaign exuding confidence since President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race on July 21.\n\n\"All of us were hit with a little bit of a political sucker punch,\" Vance told donors at a fundraiser. \"The bad news is that Kamala Harris does not have the same baggage as Joe Biden, because whatever we might have to say, Kamala is a lot younger. And Kamala Harris is obviously not struggling in the same ways that Joe Biden did,\" Vance said.\n\nWhereas the public knew Biden's weaknesses, Vance said Harris is less known so the GOP would have to shape people's views of her.\n\n\"Love 'em or hate 'em, everybody has an opinion about Donald Trump and Joe Biden after the past eight years. But Kamala Harris, people don't really know,\" he told donors.\n\nDespite these admissions, Vance has previously told reporters that Harris' presumptive nomination doesn't change the presidential race.\n\n\"We were running against Joe Biden's open border, Kamala Harris's open border. Kamala Harris supported the green new scam. Kamala Harris, frankly, covered Joe Biden even though it was obvious he was mentally incompetent for a very long time,\" Vance told reporters on July 22, according to The Post.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham on Monday, Trump said Harris was an \"even worse candidate'' than Biden because of her \"radical left\" policies.\n\nThe entire Trump campaign has doubled down on this message, pointing to Harris' flaws and remaining steadfast that she is a weak candidate.\n\n\"Poll after poll shows President Trump leading Kamala Harris as voters become aware of her weak, failed and dangerously liberal agenda. Her far-left ideas are even more radioactive than Joe Biden, particularly in the key swing states that will decide this election like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin,\" said Vance spokesperson Will Martin in a statement to The Post on Monday.\n\nIn a New York Times/Sienna College poll from July 25, Trump currently leads Harris by one percentage point. He previously led Biden by six percentage points, before the president withdrew from November's presidential race.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidential nominee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Ingraham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laura Ingraham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/yJGshr22H75NJ5Ck5UC5Bg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/salon_articles_879/b13849ecb09f4dfea5450652bb78669f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773409", "eventUri": "eng-9773409", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-21", "textStart": 467, "textEnd": 474}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "textStart": 1529, "textEnd": 1536}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 2291, "textEnd": 2298}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

It includes a parade of headlines about drugs and criminals entering the country, as well as a clip from a controversial interview that Harris did three years ago in which she brushed off a suggestion that she would visit the border.\n\n\"Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal,\" the advertisement brands Harris.\n\nNew $50 million ad portrays Harris as 'fearless'\n\nVice President Kamala Harris' campaign is kickstarting a $50 million advertising campaign with a new television spot calling the likely Democratic presidential nominee \"fearless\" throughout her career.\n\n\"Throughout her career as a courtroom prosecutor, attorney general, United States senator, and now as vice president, Kamala Harris has always stood up to bullies, criminals and special interests on behalf of the American people - and she's beaten them,\" said a statement from Jen O'Malley Dillon, the campaign chair.\n\n\"She's uniquely suited to take on Donald Trump, a convicted felon who has spent his entire life ripping off working people, tearing away our rights, and fighting for himself.\"\n\nThe advertisement is slated to run during the Olympics, \"The Bachelorette,\" \"The Daily Show\" and other popular programs. It's an attempt to even the score with Republicans, who have been outspending Democrats on the airwaves during a chaotic summer when President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed Harris.\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion to campaign for Harris\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion will join Vice President Kamala Harris for a special performance during her campaign stop in Atlanta on Tuesday.\n\nA Harris campaign spokesperson confirmed the hip-hop star's performance alongside the vice president in a post on X on Monday night.\n\nThe Harris campaign is promising a large rally in Atlanta, on par with the large events that Republican former President Donald Trump has made his signature.\n\nHarris has America focused on multiracial identity\n\nIf Vice President Kamala Harris were to ascend to the presidency, she would become the first female president, but also one who is also multiracial.\n\nThe daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, both of whom immigrated to the U.S. during the Civil Rights Movement, Harris' historic presidential bid has again put a spotlight on American identity politics and the growing number of people who say they are multiracial.\n\nDifferent countries divide people into categories depending on different national traditions. The U.S., with its slavery-molded history, divides people into Black or white, and nine million people identified as multiracial in 2010.\n\nWhen Harris ran for vice president in 2020, 33.8 million people in the U.S. identified as being more than one race, according to the census.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

But we are not going back.\"\n\nThe former president's ad, I Don't Understand, used a snippet of Harris answering a question about immigration policy to bolster a hardline message about drugs, crime, terrorism and the southern border.\n\nShowing footage of her dancing, Trump's ad called Harris \"failed, weak, dangerously liberal\".\n\nHarris's campaign hit back against Trump, pointing to the Republican's role in directing congressional Republicans to reject bipartisan border reform.\n\n\"After killing the toughest border deal in decades, Donald Trump is running on his trademark lies because his own record and 'plans' are extreme and unpopular,\" Ammar Moussa, a Harris campaign spokesperson, told reporters.\n\nHarris has been the presumptive Democratic nominee for little more than a week - but she has made an extremely strong start, reeling in more than $200m and appearing to make up ground in the polls.\n\nShe is still considering her own vice-presidential pick. But on Monday, Trump's Republican running mate, the hardline Ohio senator JD Vance, was revealed to have made a telling admission about the strength of Harris's start.\n\nIn remarks at a fundraiser in Minnesota last weekend, reported by the Washington Post and referring to Biden's decision to give in to those who said he was too old for a second term, Vance said: \"All of us were hit with a little bit of a political sucker punch.\n\n\"The bad news is that Kamala Harris does not have the same baggage as Joe Biden, because whatever we might have to say, Kamala is a lot younger. And Kamala Harris is obviously not struggling in the same ways that Joe Biden did.\"\n\nBiden is 81, and Harris is 59. Trump is 78, making him the oldest presidential nominee of all time. The language of Harris's new ad pointed to Democratic determination to target Trump's age - and to portray him as backward-looking and a thing of the past, now that their own old man is out of the campaign picture.\n\nThe Harris campaign is also keen to point to its fundraising efforts, which as the new ad was released saw a \"White Dudes for Harris\" Zoom call featuring celebrities including the actor Jeff Bridges, who famously played Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski. The campaign said it raised $4m.\n\nFive years before Bridges made The Big Lebowski, he played the lead role in Fearless, a 1993 movie about a man whose behaviour is changed after he survives a plane crash.\n\nIn a statement accompanying the Fearless ad, the Harris campaign chairperson, Jen O'Malley Dillon, saluted Democrats' own dramatic shift in fortunes, from plummeting polls under Biden to soaring hopes under Harris.\n\n\"Kamala Harris has always stood up to bullies, criminals and special interests on behalf of the American people - and she's beaten them,\" O'Malley Dillon said, echoing the ad's citation of Harris's work as attorney general of California, as well as her time as a US senator and vice-president.\n\n\"This $50m paid media campaign, bolstered by our record-setting fundraising haul and a groundswell of grassroots enthusiasm, is one crucial way we will reach and make our case to the voters who will decide this election.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign plans to air its ad prominently over three weeks, including amid coverage of the Olympic Games in Paris.\n\nThe Trump campaign is also reportedly focusing on Arizona, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada, Georgia and Michigan - the key battleground states.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris",

She also inherited some $91 million in leftover campaign funds from Biden.\n\nHowever, Trump immediately shared a scathing post on Truth Social about his potential rival before Harris even accepted the nomination, branding her a \"San Francisco Radical.\"\n\nThe former president posted a video that claimed Harris was soft on immigration and called her a \"cop hater.\"\n\nIt comes as:\n\nHis campaign had also said Trump will not commit to a debate until the party's nominee is confirmed, according to the Trump campaign's communications director.\n\nThe Democrats will officially nominate the party's candidate at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois starting on August 19.\n\nTHE RUNNING MATE QUESTION\n\nSpeculation continues to swirl about who Harris could name as her vice president pick as the poll revealed that 42% of Americans are simply unsure about who the running mate could be.\n\nPotential names thrown into the running have included North Carolina governor Roy Cooper, Pennsylvania's governor Josh Shapiro, and Michigan's governor Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nHarris is reportedly set to announce her running partner by August 7, according to The New York Times.\n\nObama shared an X post announcing that he and Michelle gave Harris their \"full support,\" after not rushing to endorse her immediately following Joe Biden's announcement.\n\nHarris has also gathered support from big-name Democrats like Nancy Pelosi, Bill Clinton, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, and the House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_party_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Third party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Communications_Director", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Communications Director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gretchen Whitmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Doggett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lloyd Doggett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Michigan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

It's a sign that the former president has settled on a longstanding GOP line of attack against the vice president, after grappling with the abrupt change atop the Democratic ticket.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, unveiled a minute-long ad entitled \"Fearless\" that offers highlights of her career dating to her tenure as a prosecutor in the Bay Area of California - as she scrambles to introduce herself as the prospective nominee to voters following President Joe Biden's decision to end his reelection bid. It's part of what the Harris campaign said will be a $50 million blitz in the run-up to next month's Democratic National Convention - fueled, in part, by the record-breaking fundraising the Harris campaign has seen since Biden's departure from the race and endorsement of her candidacy a little more than a week ago.\n\nTrump, in two new campaign ads, seeks to define Harris on his terms by relying on what has been a political liability for the Biden administration: the management of the US-Mexico border.\n\nRepublicans have jumped on an assignment given to Harris - the task of addressing the root causes of migration in Central America - to cast her falsely as the nation's \"border czar\" and as solely responsible for the record number of migrant arrivals at the US southern border over the last three years.\n\nBoth Trump campaign ads pull from a 2021 NBC interview during which Harris was pressed about the fact that she hadn't yet visited the US-Mexico border and she stumbled through a response by claiming she also hadn't yet gone to Europe - an answer that perplexed administration officials at the time.\n\nAnother shows a video of Harris dancing at an event, stating: \"This is America's border czar - and she's failed us.\"\n\nThe ads conclude with a description of Harris as \"failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal.\"\n\nIn response, Harris campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said Trump is \"running on his trademark lies\" and said the former president opposed a congressional border deal that would have helped with enforcement.\n\nHarris' root cause work dates to March 2021. During an influx of unaccompanied migrant children, Biden tasked the vice president with overseeing diplomatic efforts in Central America. While Harris focused on long-term fixes, the Department of Homeland Security remained responsible for overseeing border security.\n\nAs the vice president's campaign takes shape and as immigration remains a top issue for voters, her team is forced to contend with an assignment that, sources say, has showed early success in Central America as a result of major private-sector investment but that's been bundled with the administration's larger migration issues.\n\nThe Trump campaign so far has reserved about $12.2 million in advertising across six battleground states - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - through August 12, according to data from AdImpact, which tracks media buying.\n\nEven as she seeks to introduce herself to voters, Harris' new campaign ad also goes on the attack against Trump, using some of the vice president's remarks at her first rally as the presumptive Democratic nominee for president.\n\n\"Donald Trump wants to take our country backward,\" Harris can be heard saying in the ad. \"To give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and end the Affordable Care Act. But we are not going back.\"\n\nIn a statement, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon noted the former president's May felony conviction for falsifying business records and said that Harris' career - ranging from a courtroom prosecutor and California attorney general to her current role in the Biden administration - makes her \"uniquely suited to take on Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe new Harris ad, according to the campaign, will air during the Olympics along with other programs - such as \"Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta,\" \"The Bachelorette\" and \"The Daily Show\" - that target demographic groups the campaign is trying to reach.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Harris Will Campaign There Tuesday", "body": "ATLANTA -- Little more than a week ago, Georgia appeared to be slipping out of the Democrats' reach: President Joe Biden's campaign pledged to concentrate more on holding the Midwestern \"blue wall\" states and indicated they might be willing to forsake \"Sun Belt\" battlegrounds.\n\nBut now that Biden has bowed out of the race and Vice President Kamala Harris is the likely nominee, Democrats say they have new hope for the state. They're betting that a fresh burst of energy and a surge in fundraising has helped make Georgia -- the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020 -- a toss-up again.\n\nHarris is planning to make a show of political force with a rally in Atlanta at 7 p.m. ET on Tuesday, the latest example of just how much the race against Republican Donald Trump has shifted since Biden abandoned his reelection bid. She will be appearing in the same city where Biden's dismal performance in a debate against Trump on June 27 sparked a Democratic revolt that ultimately ended his campaign.\n\nHarris is hoping a large rally, featuring a performance by hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion, will help affirm her campaign's momentum. The campaign argues that Harris' appeal with young people, working-age women and non-white voters has scrambled the dynamics in Georgia and other states that are demographically similar, from North Carolina to Nevada and Arizona.\n\n\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams, a congresswoman from Atlanta. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"\n\nRelated Story: Liberal 'White Dudes' Rally for Harris: 'It's Like a Rainbow of\n\nIn a strategy memo released after the president left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who held the same role for Biden, reaffirmed the importance of winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a trio of industrial states that have formed the traditional Democratic blue wall.\n\nBut she also argued that the vice president's place atop the ticket \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" and described them as \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" in places like Georgia.\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nBut they concede that the landscape suddenly looks much closer to 2020 - when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points -- than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt.\n\n\"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"\n\nRobinson said Harris still has plenty of liabilities, including the progressive positions she took in her failed 2020 primary campaign and her various rhetorical stumbles. But he said Harris so far in this campaign has been \"in command,\" and if that continues \"we have a new ballgame and she will be competitive in Georgia.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt did not give similar ground. She dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\"\n\nThe former president's campaign announced Tuesday, hours ahead of Harris' rally, that he would travel to Atlanta on Saturday for a rally in the same venue where Harris will appear on the Georgia State University campus.\n\nRelated Story: Roy Cooper Is Said to Withdraw From Harris' Vice-Presidential Field\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nDemocrats are betting that a combination of high turnout among traditional, core Democratic constituencies, as well as a strong showing in the suburbs and small pickups elsewhere can be enough for Harris to carry Georgia. That approach was on display at the weekend office openings.\n\nOn Saturday, the venue was East Point, a majority Black municipality and Democratic stronghold south of Atlanta. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., was the featured guest, telling a crowd of mostly Black women that they were the key to victory -- \"the people who are really going to save the country.\"\n\nA day later, it was Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, among several contenders Harris is considering for her running mate, campaigning in Forsyth County. The area is historically very conservative, though Democrats have narrowed the GOP margins in recent cycles.\n\n\"Every county matters,\" Beshear said, holding out his ability to win two governor's races in Kentucky despite Trump's domination of the state in presidential elections.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said in a recent interview that the best GOP campaigns can win comfortably in Georgia but bad efforts -- combined with strong Democratic campaigns -- lose. Kemp, for example, won reelection by 7.5 percentage points in 2022 over national Democratic star Stacey Abrams. Yet in the same election cycle, Georgians reelected Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock over his Republican challenger Herschel Walker, who was endorsed by Trump.\n\nIn recent elections, Democrats have held wide advantages in the core of metro Atlanta, where Jayapal spoke. The party also performed well in Columbus and Savannah, as well as some rural, majority-Black counties. But Republicans dominated in other rural areas and small towns and cities -- where Trump has held multiple rallies in recent years.\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs, like those where Beshear campaigned on Sunday, offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nRelated Story: Harris Looks to Maintain Momentum as 'Honeymoon Phase' Winds Down\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist -- I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" Smith said.", "source": {"uri": "gvwire.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

She dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nDemocrats are betting that a combination of high turnout among traditional, core Democratic constituencies, as well as a strong showing in the suburbs and small pickups elsewhere can be enough for Harris to carry Georgia. That approach was on display at the weekend office openings.\n\nOn Saturday, the venue was East Point, a majority Black municipality and Democratic stronghold south of Atlanta. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., was the featured guest, telling a crowd of mostly Black women that they were the key to victory - \"the people who are really going to save the country.\"\n\nA day later, it was Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, among several contenders Harris is considering for her running mate, campaigning in Forsyth County. The area is historically very conservative, though Democrats have narrowed the GOP margins in recent cycles.\n\n\"Every county matters,\" Beshear said, holding out his ability to win two governor\u00b4s races in Kentucky despite Trump\u00b4s domination of the state in presidential elections.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said in a recent interview that the best GOP campaigns can win comfortably in Georgia but bad efforts - combined with strong Democratic campaigns - lose.\n\nDemocrats recently have held wide advantages in the core of metro Atlanta, where Jayapal spoke. The party also performed well in Columbus and Savannah, as well as some rural, majority-Black counties. But Republicans dominated in other rural areas and small towns and cities -- where Trump has held multiple rallies in recent years.\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs, like those where Beshear campaigned on Sunday, offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist - I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" Smith said.\n\nWeissert reported from Washington.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikema_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikema Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State governments of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Harris inherited a bleak electoral map from President Joe Biden. Before withdrawing from the race, polls showed the president trailing in nearly every swing state and his unpopularity largely confined him to a narrow path to victory dependent on holding a trio of key Great Lakes states.\n\nThe dynamic has shifted with Harris atop the ticket. Enjoying a burst of voter enthusiasm and campaign cash, the vice president is vying for Sun Belt states that Democrats had all but written off -- Georgia, Arizona and Nevada -- as well as the Democrats' so-called \"Blue Wall\" of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\n\nHarris' event in Georgia's largest city is her first major effort to put a larger group of states back in play since launching her campaign on July 21. Rapper Megan Thee Stallion plans to make an appearance at the rally, she announced Monday on her Instagram account.\n\nHarris' campaign is confident that her relative popularity among key voting groups -- including women, younger voters and people of color -- has helped expand the electoral map, according to people familiar with their thinking. Those groups had drifted from Biden but have gravitated to the new presumptive Democratic nominee, who would become the first Black woman and Asian American president if she wins in November.\n\n\"The data is clear: We have multiple pathways to 270 electoral votes,\" Dan Kanninen, battleground director for the Harris campaign, told reporters on Monday. \"The vice president is strong in both the Blue Wall and in the Sun Belt, and we are running hard in both.\"\n\nEven before Biden's dramatic exit from the race, Harris had spent more time campaigning in the South and West than the president. Georgia is a state where the campaign sees that investment poised to pay off.\n\nThe vice president's visit to Georgia on Tuesday is her 15th since taking office and her campaign has bragged about its presence there, which includes 24 offices.\n\nA spending spree by Trump and his supporters indicates they, too, see Georgia as competitive. Trump and his allied super political action committee have booked $14.7 million in advertising there through the end of August, according to AdImpact, almost triple the $4.9 million that Future Forward PAC, which backs Harris, is set to spend.\n\nHarris' campaign on Tuesday launched a $50 million ad campaign in battleground states touting her background as a prosecutor. The announcement did not specify how much would be spent in Georgia.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump won Georgia by over 5 percentage points in 2016 but lost it to Biden four years later by less than a quarter of a point, the first time a Democratic nominee carried the Peach State in nearly three decades. The 2020 election left an indelible mark: Trump was indicted last year on state charges he sought to overturn his loss.\n\nTurning out Black voters in Atlanta will be crucial to Harris' chances.\n\nThe city has long been a magnet for people of color, with a cluster of historically Black colleges and universities that have been a pipeline for young professionals and a source of political activism. Harris attended Howard University, a prestigious historically Black college in Washington.\n\nAtlanta is a popular landing spot for members of the Divine Nine -- the most prominent Black fraternities and sororities -- whose network Harris has tapped as a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha. They offer her campaign an organic ground game in the state.\n\nRepresentative Nikema Williams, who also chairs the Georgia Democratic Party and will attend Harris' event, said her home state remains a \"true battleground.\"\n\n\"We're seeing the excitement on the ground, we're seeing people sign up to volunteer who haven't volunteered before,\" Williams said in an interview.\n\nAn Emerson College poll earlier in July when Biden was still in the race showed him trailing Trump in Georgia 47% to 41%. A poll taken after Harris' entry showed her narrowing the gap to 48% to 46%.\n\nBlue Wall\n\nBiden ended his bid after pressure from fellow Democrats alarmed by his calamitous debate against Trump. Polls showed the race moving in Trump's direction. The Republican gained an edge in many swing states and put places Biden carried easily in 2020, such as Minnesota and Virginia, into play.\n\n\"He was expanding the map into states that Democrats really had no business losing in,\" said Amy Walter, publisher of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. Harris \"took what was a rapidly expanding map, which was benefiting Trump, and has narrowed it back to the battleground states.\"\n\nWith Biden atop the ticket, Democrats viewed the Blue Wall states as his best path to reelection. The president often touted his pro-union stance in an effort to win over White, working-class voters.\n\nHigh inflation, however, has overshadowed Biden's investments in domestic manufacturing and infrastructure. Broad voter skepticism over the administration's handling of the economy also threatens to undercut Harris' campaign.\n\nKanninen, the battleground director, said in an interview there is no indication Harris is performing worse across the Blue Wall.\n\n\"We've seen no data to suggest a backslide whatsoever,\" he said. \"The theory of the case has been win close races across several geographies and have the resources to do it.\"\n\nHarris' campaign has enrolled at least 170,000 new volunteers since Biden endorsed her, including over 50,000 in the battleground states, Kanninen said.\n\nDemocrats also have renewed hopes of competing in Nevada, a state with a relatively young electorate with large Black, Latino and Asian and Pacific Islander populations.\n\n\"When it comes to turning out must-win constituencies, energizing young voters and connecting with Nevada families on the issues that matter to them, Vice President Harris has already begun working to win and earn and their vote,\" said Molly Forgey, a Democratic campaign operative in the state.\n\nThe party saw a surge of interest there when Biden endorsed Harris, a Democratic campaign official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. About 600 new volunteers signed up that day. Harris also has cultivated ties with Nevada labor groups, including the powerful Culinary Workers Union most recently during a visit to Las Vegas in January.", "source": {"uri": "batimes.com.ar",

Please try again later.\n\nThe Republican vice-presidential nominee, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), privately told donors that running against Vice President Harris instead of President Biden made the race more challenging -- an admission at odds with the Donald Trump campaign's public projections of confidence.\n\n\"All of us were hit with a little bit of a political sucker punch,\" Vance said about Biden's withdrawal on July 21, according to a recording of his remarks at a Saturday fundraiser in Golden Valley, Minn. \"The bad news is that Kamala Harris does not have the same baggage as Joe Biden, because whatever we might have to say, Kamala is a lot younger. And Kamala Harris is obviously not struggling in the same ways that Joe Biden did.\"\n\nPublicly, the Trump campaign has insisted that Harris replacing Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket has not changed the race, arguing that she shares responsibility for public dissatisfaction with Biden's leadership. Vance told reporters on July 22, a day after Biden dropped out of the race, that there was no difference in running against Harris versus Biden.\n\n\"I don't think the political calculus changes at all,\" Vance said. \"We were running against Joe Biden's open border, Kamala Harris's open border. Kamala Harris supported the green new scam. Kamala Harris, frankly, covered Joe Biden even though it was obvious he was mentally incompetent for a very long time.\"\n\nTrump adviser Jason Miller said in a July 22 Fox News interview: \"Democrats are a bit of jumping out of the frying pan into the fire. And they may have gotten rid of one problem with Joe Biden, but they've inherited a whole new problem with Kamala Harris.\"\n\nTrump himself has expressed nostalgia for running against Biden (\"He will always be my first choice\"), and at the same time dismissed Harris as \"worse than Joe.\"\n\nVance, though, gave a different assessment for donors on Saturday ahead of joining Trump at a rally in St. Cloud, Minn. He said Harris was less well-known than Trump or Biden, so Republicans would have to work to shape people's opinions of her.\n\n\"We have a very unique opportunity, but also a very unique challenge, because, let's be honest, 10 days ago, the two candidates who were running for president, everybody had an opinion about 'em. Love 'em or hate 'em, everybody has an opinion about Donald Trump and Joe Biden after the past eight years. But Kamala Harris, people don't really know.\"\n\nVance said the campaign would try to define Harris based on past positions, which he said included opposing fracking, praising the \"defund the police\" movement and supporting decriminalization of unauthorized border crossings. The Harris campaign says she won't ban fracking. She denounced \"defund the police\" after becoming Biden's running mate, and the current administration opposes decriminalizing border crossings.\n\nAt the fundraiser Vance recounted asking Trump's senior adviser Susie Wiles how the race had changed, and she answered that she was more confident Trump would win because people like Trump's polices better than Biden's.\n\nTwo national polls taken since Biden dropped out showed Trump and Harris within the margin of error, erasing Trump's earlier leads over Biden in the same surveys.\n\nVance spokesman Will Martin said Monday in a statement: \"Poll after poll shows President Trump leading Kamala Harris as voters become aware of her weak, failed and dangerously liberal agenda. Her far-left ideas are even more radioactive than Joe Biden, particularly in the key swing states that will decide this election like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.\"\n\nMeryl Kornfield contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "isaac_arnsdorf@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Isaac Arnsdorf", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Miller_(communications_strategist)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Miller (communications strategist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Cloud,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Cloud, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Cloud, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fracking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defund_the_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defund the police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Margin of error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Modern liberalism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LIAFBPXY6467PLRAIDAPUFMMJY.JPG&w=1440", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773409", "eventUri": "eng-9773409", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-21", "textStart": 478, "textEnd": 485}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "textStart": 1053, "textEnd": 1060, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Harris will campaign there Tuesday", "body": "National Politics | Democrats had feared Georgia was a lost cause with Biden running. Harris will campaign there Tuesday\n\nBy WILL WEISSERT and BILL BARROW Associated Press\n\nATLANTA (AP) -- Little more than a week ago, Georgia appeared to be slipping out of the Democrats' reach: President Joe Biden's campaign pledged to concentrate more on holding the Midwestern \"blue wall\" states and indicated they might be willing to forsake \"Sun Belt\" battlegrounds.\n\nBut now that Biden has bowed out of the race and Vice President Kamala Harris is the likely nominee, Democrats say they have new hope for the state. They're betting that a fresh burst of energy and a surge in fundraising has helped make Georgia -- the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020 -- a toss-up again.\n\nHarris is planning to make a show of political force with a rally in Atlanta at 7 p.m. ET on Tuesday, the latest example of just how much the race against Republican Donald Trump has shifted since Biden abandoned his reelection bid. She will be appearing in the same city where Biden's dismal performance in a debate against Trump on June 27 sparked a Democratic revolt that ultimately ended his campaign.\n\nHarris is hoping a large rally, featuring a performance by hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion, will help affirm her campaign's momentum. The campaign argues that Harris' appeal with young people, working-age women and non-white voters has scrambled the dynamics in Georgia and other states that are demographically similar, from North Carolina to Nevada and Arizona.\n\n\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams, a congresswoman from Atlanta. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"\n\nIn a strategy memo released after the president left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who held the same role for Biden, reaffirmed the importance of winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a trio of industrial states that have formed the traditional Democratic blue wall.\n\nBut she also argued that the vice president's place atop the ticket \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" and described them as \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" in places like Georgia.\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nBut they concede that the landscape suddenly looks much closer to 2020 - when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points -- than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt.\n\n\"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"\n\nRobinson said Harris still has plenty of liabilities, including the progressive positions she took in her failed 2020 primary campaign and her various rhetorical stumbles. But he said Harris so far in this campaign has been \"in command,\" and if that continues \"we have a new ballgame and she will be competitive in Georgia.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt did not give similar ground. She dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\"\n\nThe former president's campaign announced Tuesday, hours ahead of Harris' rally, that he would travel to Atlanta on Saturday for a rally in the same venue where Harris will appear on the Georgia State University campus.\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nDemocrats are betting that a combination of high turnout among traditional, core Democratic constituencies, as well as a strong showing in the suburbs and small pickups elsewhere can be enough for Harris to carry Georgia. That approach was on display at the weekend office openings.\n\nOn Saturday, the venue was East Point, a majority Black municipality and Democratic stronghold south of Atlanta. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., was the featured guest, telling a crowd of mostly Black women that they were the key to victory -- \"the people who are really going to save the country.\"\n\nA day later, it was Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, among several contenders Harris is considering for her running mate, campaigning in Forsyth County. The area is historically very conservative, though Democrats have narrowed the GOP margins in recent cycles.\n\n\"Every county matters,\" Beshear said, holding out his ability to win two governor's races in Kentucky despite Trump's domination of the state in presidential elections.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said in a recent interview that the best GOP campaigns can win comfortably in Georgia but bad efforts -- combined with strong Democratic campaigns -- lose. Kemp, for example, won reelection by 7.5 percentage points in 2022 over national Democratic star Stacey Abrams. Yet in the same election cycle, Georgians reelected Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock over his Republican challenger Herschel Walker, who was endorsed by Trump.\n\nIn recent elections, Democrats have held wide advantages in the core of metro Atlanta, where Jayapal spoke. The party also performed well in Columbus and Savannah, as well as some rural, majority-Black counties. But Republicans dominated in other rural areas and small towns and cities -- where Trump has held multiple rallies in recent years.\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs, like those where Beshear campaigned on Sunday, offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist -- I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" Smith said.", "source": {"uri": "dailycamera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boulder Daily Camera"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@dailycamera.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikema_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikema Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Belt_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sun Belt Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jen_O'Malley_Dillon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jen O'Malley Dillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Gretchen Whitmer, left, and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, center, arrive at a campaign event for Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris in Ambler, Pa., Monday, July 29, 2024.\n\nRepublican Donald Trump's campaign has announced that he will travel to Atlanta on Saturday for a rally in the same venue where Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris plans one Tuesday night featuring a performance by hip hop star Megan Thee Stallion.\n\nDueling ad campaigns by the presidential candidates portray Harris as \"fearless,\" while an ad from Trump blasts the vice president for problems at the southern U.S. border.\n\nTrump also appears to be backing away from his earlier commitment to debate Harris, questioning the value of a meetup and saying that he \"probably\" will debate but that he \"can also make a case for not doing it\" -- prompting her campaign to say he's \"scared.\"\n\nAnd Senate lawmakers grilled the acting director of the Secret Service about law enforcement lapses in the hours before the attempted assassination of Trump.\n\nFollow the AP's Election-2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nTrump says Harris, married to a Jewish man, doesn't like Jewish people\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said in a radio interview Tuesday that Vice President Kamala Harris, who is married to a Jewish man, \"doesn't like Jewish people\" and appeared to agree with a radio host who called second gentleman Doug Emhoff \"a crappy Jew.\"\n\nTrump, speaking on radio station WABC, claimed Harris looked uncomfortable while meeting last week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\"You can see the disdain,\" he said. \"No. 1, she doesn't like Israel. No. 2, she doesn't like Jewish people. You know it, I know it and everybody knows it, and nobody wants to say it.\"\n\nThe Republican former president then said, \"If you're Jewish, if you vote for a Democrat, you're a fool, an absolute fool. They have let Jewish people down since Obama at a level that nobody could believe.\"\n\nAs the interview went on, Trump again said Harris \"dislikes Jewish people.\" The interview host, Sid Rosenberg, then mentioned Emhoff and said, \"He's Jewish like Bernie Sanders is Jewish. Are you kidding me?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Trump said.\n\n\"He's a crappy Jew,\" Rosenberg said.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Trump said again.\n\nRosenberg went on, saying of Emhoff, \"He's a horrible Jew.\"\n\nJames Singer, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, said, \"America is better than the fear, hate, and despicable insults of Donald Trump. Vice President Harris believes Americans want a president who unites our country instead of divides it, uses the power of the presidency to help families instead of hurt them, and has a vision for our future, instead of taking us backwards.\"\n\nHarris' potential running mates walk a fine line\n\nDemocratic governors and other officials under consideration to be Democrat Kamala Harris' vice presidential running mate are practicing a time-honored tradition in presidential campaigns. They're walking the line between open self-promotion and loyal advocacy for the potential boss in what amounts to unofficial auditions.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro campaigned for Harris on Monday outside Philadelphia. He blasted Republican former President Donald Trump and called Harris ready to lead. But he also showcased his own accomplishments.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear took a similar approach over the weekend. He told voters in Georgia that Harris has the makings of \"a great president,\" and then highlighted the elections he has won as a Democrat in Republican territory.\n\nHarris is said to also be considering Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, among others.\n\nSecret Service head, FBI's No. 2 grilled by Senate lawmakers\n\nThe acting director of the Secret Service said Tuesday he \"cannot defend\" why the roof used by the gunman in the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump was not secured.\n\nRonald Rowe, testifying before two Senate committees, said that he recently traveled to the Pennsylvania shooting site where Trump had been holding a campaign rally, and that \"what I saw made me ashamed.\"\n\nRowe was joined at a joint hearing of the Senate committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security by FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate.\n\nThe FBI's No. 2 official said a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from when the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, would have been in high school.\n\nTrump plans rally at same Georgia venue as Harris event\n\nRepublican Donald Trump's campaign announced Tuesday, hours ahead of a rally planned by Vice President Kamala Harris at Georgia State University, that he will travel to Atlanta on Saturday for a rally in the same venue.\n\nDemocrats say they have new hope for winning Georgia in November after President Joe Biden bowed out of the race and endorsed Harris. They're betting that a fresh burst of energy and a surge in fundraising has helped make Georgia -- the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020 -- a toss-up again.\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nTrump ad blasts Harris for problems at the border\n\nRepublican candidate Donald Trump's campaign released a new advertisement Tuesday, blasting Vice President Kamala Harris for problems at the U.S. southern border.\n\nThe advertisement dubs Harris the \"border czar,\" a reference to her work on migration issues. It includes a parade of headlines about drugs and criminals entering the country, as well as a clip from a controversial interview that Harris did three years ago in which she brushed off a suggestion that she would visit the border.\n\n\"Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal,\" the advertisement brands Harris.\n\nNew $50 million ad portrays Harris as 'fearless'\n\nVice President Kamala Harris' campaign is kickstarting a $50 million advertising campaign with a new television spot calling the likely Democratic presidential nominee \"fearless\" throughout her career.\n\n\"Throughout her career as a courtroom prosecutor, attorney general, United States senator, and now as vice president, Kamala Harris has always stood up to bullies, criminals and special interests on behalf of the American people - and she's beaten them,\" said a statement from Jen O'Malley Dillon, the campaign chair.\n\n\"She's uniquely suited to take on Donald Trump, a convicted felon who has spent his entire life ripping off working people, tearing away our rights, and fighting for himself.\"\n\nThe advertisement is slated to run during the Olympics, \"The Bachelorette,\" \"The Daily Show\" and other popular programs. It's an attempt to even the score with Republicans, who have been outspending Democrats on the airwaves during a chaotic summer when President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed Harris.\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion to campaign for Harris\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion will join Vice President Kamala Harris for a special performance during her campaign stop in Atlanta on Tuesday.\n\nA Harris campaign spokesperson confirmed the hip-hop star's performance alongside the vice president in a post on X on Monday night.\n\nThe Harris campaign is promising a large rally in Atlanta, on par with the large events that Republican former President Donald Trump has made his signature.\n\nHarris has America focused on multiracial identity\n\nIf Vice President Kamala Harris were to ascend to the presidency, she would become the first female president, but also one who is also multiracial.\n\nThe daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, both of whom immigrated to the U.S. during the Civil Rights Movement, Harris' historic presidential bid has again put a spotlight on American identity politics and the growing number of people who say they are multiracial.\n\nDifferent countries divide people into categories depending on different national traditions. The U.S., with its slavery-molded history, divides people into Black or white, and nine million people identified as multiracial in 2010.\n\nWhen Harris ran for vice president in 2020, 33.8 million people in the U.S. identified as being more than one race, according to the census.", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [{"uri":

US President Joe Biden announced on 21 July he would not seek re-election and endorsed Vice President Harris to be the Democratic Party's new nominee for the US elections in November 2024. EPA/LESLIE PLAZA JOHNSON\n\nRecent polls conducted by numerous outlets have found that Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are neck and neck in terms of support from Americans, closing the gap the Republican nominee held over President Joe Biden.\n\nSince Biden withdrew from the race, Harris' support from many voters has considerably increased, indicating she has broken into the six-point lead Trump previously had over the president since the debate that they held. According to a poll issued by the Wall Street Journal, Trump now holds just a 2% lead over Harris in a two-person race, within the Journal's 3.1% margin of error.\n\nOther polls conducted this week by The New York Times/Siena College (Trump +1 over Harris) and CNN (Trump +3) also represent tightening from a 6-point Trump leads, a shift that followed the assassination attempt, his selection of Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) as his running mate, and the GOP convention. Those events were all expected to give Trump a considerable boost, instead he seems to be losing ground. Harris is trailing closely behind the Republican nominee, performing rather well with traditionally Democratic groups among whom Biden was not overwhelmingly favored.\n\n\"Only 37% of Biden voters were enthusiastic about him in early July, and now 81% of Harris voters are enthusiastic about her,\" Democratic pollster Mike Bocian, who conducted the WSJ survey with Republican pollster David Lee, told the Journal. \"This is an astounding change.\"\n\nThe Times/Siena poll found Harris is running stronger than Biden has all year among young voters and minority voters, while also maintaining support from older and white voters, a demographic where his numbers were strong. Yet, the results also show the former president is running ahead of his 2016 and 2020 numbers within those groups.\n\nMeanwhile, an Axios/Generation Lab poll conducted this week among voters aged 18-34 showed Harris leading Trump by 20 points, 60% to 40%, compared to Biden's 6% lead. Some 45% among the cohort said they had a positive opinion of Harris, compared with 33% who said the same about Biden, and 34% who felt positively about Trump.\n\nAn aggregate of polls from the Hill and Decision Desk HQ, based on 80 polls, has Trump at 47.8% to 45.7% for Harris, a difference again within the margin of error that could reflect they are actually tied.\n\nSince Harris announced she would run in place of Biden, she has raised $200 million from donors, marking one of the largest fundraising periods in presidential history. However, Harris has still not chosen a running mate, which could potentially alter the trajectory of her campaign.", "source": {"uri": "lavocedinewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "La Voce di New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Federation_of_Teachers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Federation of Teachers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena_College", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Siena College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_Desk_HQ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decision Desk HQ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://lavocedinewyork.com/wp-content/uploads/ansa/2024/07/26/8cfb31858c10c044fe80e9fc64b9e884.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773409", "eventUri": "eng-9773409", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-21", "textStart": 204, "textEnd": 211}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Dangerously liberal,\" the advertisement brands Harris.\n\nNew $50 million ad portrays Harris as 'fearless'\n\nVice President Kamala Harris' campaign is kickstarting a $50 million advertising campaign with a new television spot calling the likely Democratic presidential nominee \"fearless\" throughout her career.\n\n\"Throughout her career as a courtroom prosecutor, attorney general, United States senator, and now as vice president, Kamala Harris has always stood up to bullies, criminals and special interests on behalf of the American people - and she's beaten them,\" said a statement from Jen O'Malley Dillon, the campaign chair.\n\n\"She's uniquely suited to take on Donald Trump, a convicted felon who has spent his entire life ripping off working people, tearing away our rights, and fighting for himself.\"\n\nThe advertisement is slated to run during the Olympics, \"The Bachelorette,\" \"The Daily Show\" and other popular programs. It's an attempt to even the score with Republicans, who have been outspending Democrats on the airwaves during a chaotic summer when President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed Harris.\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion to campaign for Harris\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion will join Vice President Kamala Harris for a special performance during her campaign stop in Atlanta on Tuesday.\n\nA Harris campaign spokesperson confirmed the hip-hop star's performance alongside the vice president in a post on X on Monday night.\n\nThe Harris campaign is promising a large rally in Atlanta, on par with the large events that Republican former President Donald Trump has made his signature.\n\nHarris has America focused on multiracial identity\n\nIf Vice President Kamala Harris were to ascend to the presidency, she would become the first female president, but also one who is also multiracial.\n\nThe daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, both of whom immigrated to the U.S. during the Civil Rights Movement, Harris' historic presidential bid has again put a spotlight on American identity politics and the growing number of people who say they are multiracial.\n\nDifferent countries divide people into categories depending on different national traditions. The U.S., with its slavery-molded history, divides people into Black or white, and nine million people identified as multiracial in 2010.\n\nWhen Harris ran for vice president in 2020, 33.8 million people in the U.S. identified as being more than one race, according to the census.\n\nMore from this section\n\nPIC's WooSOS Plugin Streamlines Ecommerce Through WooCommerce and SOS Inventory

Vance, as he holds a rally for the first time with his running mate, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, U.S. July 20. (Reuters)\n\nDonald Trump on Monday backed his running mate JD Vance over past comments about \"childless cat ladies,\" which criticised Vice President Kamala Harris and have since gone viral.\n\nVance's 2021 comments about Democrats resurfaced after Trump selected the Ohio senator as his running mate earlier this month. Harris is the likely Democratic Party presidential nominee for the Nov. 5 election following President Joe Biden's decision to quit the race.\n\nIn an interview on Fox News, Republican presidential candidate Trump said he did not place a higher value on people with families. \"You know, you don't meet the right person, or you don't meet any person. But you're just as good, in many cases, a lot better than a person that's in a family situation,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump said Vance, who had a tough upbringing in Ohio and was largely raised by his grandmother, was simply trying to show how much he values family life. \"He grew up in a very interesting family situation, and he feels family is good. And I don't think there's anything wrong in saying that,\" Trump said.\n\nThis interview comes as Trump's campaign is expected to launch a $10 million advertising blitz in six battleground states this week as it tries to counter a surge of voter enthusiasm and donations for his Democratic rival. It is Trump's biggest ad buy since January, when he was fighting off Republican rivals for the party's nomination. Trump's campaign did not respond to requests for comment, but the blitz comes as Harris' candidacy has changed the race.\n\nSince Joe Biden dropped out last week and endorsed Harris, she has rapidly consolidated support within the Democratic Party and from big-money donors. She has also sparked a newfound energy among groups such as young voters that Biden had been struggling to win over. After months of attacks on Biden's fitness for office, Trump's campaign has had to pivot to find a new message to use against Harris, 59, less than 100 days until the Nov. 5 election.\n\nOn Monday, Trump, 78, released an ad on his Truth Social platform using Harris's own words from old interviews, campaign events and debates to try to portray her as an extreme liberal out of touch with everyday Americans. In response, Harris accused the Trump campaign of lying about her record. \"Vice President Harris has been a key leader in working across the aisle to pass the Biden-Harris administration's historic, popular agenda,\" said Harris spokesperson Sarafina Chitika.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

The rally marks a shift in the race against former President Donald Trump, as Harris aims to galvanize support with a star-studded event featuring a performance by rapper Megan Thee Stallion, reflecting her campaign's focus on appealing to young, working-age, and nonwhite voters across Georgia and similar states.\n\nMegan Thee Stallion joins a host of musicians who have recently come out in support of Harris as she has also earned endorsements from several pop-culture stars, including British artist Charli XCX, whose latest album Brat has become a branding tool for the vice president's campaign.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to Harris' campaign via email for comment.\n\nHowever, this comes after Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, had a wave of public figures show their support for his reelection campaign during the Republican National Convention this month. Model and rapper Amber Rose gave a passionate speech endorsing Trump on the first day of the convention, and singer and rapper Kid Rock performed his hit American Bad Ass before the former president gave his keynote address on the last day of the event.\n\nMeanwhile, according to The Associated Press, the Democratic Party is now seeing renewed hope in Georgia, fueled by a surge in fundraising and energy as battleground states will continue to play a key role in determining the election due to the Electoral College, which awards each state a certain number of electoral votes based on population.\n\nA presidential candidate needs to secure 270 electoral votes for victory, and winning the national popular vote does not guarantee success.\n\nIn a strategy memo post-Biden's exit, Harris' campaign chair, Jen O'Malley Dillon, emphasized the continued importance of other battleground states such as Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania as she argued that Harris \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" including \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under-30\" voters in states like Georgia, the AP reported.\n\nIn addition, Democrats have ramped up their presence in Georgia with 24 campaign offices, including new additions in the metro Atlanta area as the Democratic strategy focuses on making gains in suburban areas.\n\nThe campaign offices come as Trump and the Republican National Committee have also recently opened their first Georgia offices.\n\nHowever, according to AP, Republicans remain skeptical, arguing that Harris inherits Biden's low approval ratings and voter concerns over economic issues and immigration as they aim to take back the state after the tight contest of 2020 when Biden won by a slim margin of 0.25 percentage points.\n\n\"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" GOP consultant Brian Robinson told AP. \"Now, Democrats have a chance for a reset.\"\n\nNewsweek has reached out to Trump's campaign via email for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, the momentum behind Harris has helped Democrats close the gap on Trump and Republicans in national polling. Voter surveys have also shown the former president's lead shrink in key swing states like Georgia, which Biden flipped in the 2020 election when he defeated Trump.\n\nAccording to a recent poll by Landmark Communications, Trump was trailing Harris by 1.3 percentage points (48% to 46.7%) in a hypothetical head-to-head match among likely voters in the Peach State. When other candidates were included, Trump beat Harris by 1.5 points (45.8% to 44.3%).", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It's the first ad in the Harris campaign's new $50 million battleground state paid media blitz ahead of the Democratic National Convention, set to kick off on Aug. 19.\n\nTrump's team on Tuesday, on the other hand, released its first major TV ad targeting Harris just over a week since she became Democrats' likely nominee.\n\nThe 30-second spot seeks to hit the vice president on immigration and the southern border, starting with a video of her dancing and referring to her as \"America's border czar,\" a phrase Republicans have latched onto to criticize Harris and one Democrats have sought to aggressively push back against. Biden tasked Harris, his vice president, with leading the charge to tackle the root causes of migration.\n\nThe ad goes on to say that under the vice president, \"over 10 million [are] illegally here\" and \"a quarter of a million Americans [are] dead from fentanyl.\"\n\nThe spot then highlights an interview Harris did with NBC News' Lester Holt three years ago in which the anchor pressed the vice president on criticism for not visiting the border.\n\n\"Kamala Harris. Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal,\" the ad concludes with the words appearing on the screen.\n\nThe ad is part of a $12 million reservation the Trump team has made through Aug. 12 across the six biggest swing states, according to AdImpact, a firm that tracks data on advertisements.\n\nBoth ads out on Tuesday build on storylies the campaigns have already sought to establish in just the first week since it appeared likely that it would be Trump and Harris facing off in November.\n\nThe vice president has pointed to her background as a prosecutor and contrasted it with Trump's legal troubles, including the guilty verdict in his New York hush money trial in May. Trump has often pointed to the Biden-Harris administration's handling of the border as polls show the issue has surged in importance to voters.\n\nArrests for illegal border crossings hit all-time highs during Biden and Harris' time in office. Encounters have significantly dropped in recent weeks after Biden signed took executive action to put restrictions on asylum.", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News 9"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bachelorette_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Bachelorette (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jen_O'Malley_Dillon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jen O'Malley Dillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_Holt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lester Holt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fentanyl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/AP_Harris_Trump_Combo_Image_072924", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773409", "eventUri": "eng-9773409", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-19", "textStart": 1973, "textEnd": 1980}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-12", "textStart": 3070, "textEnd": 3077}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Before withdrawing from the race, polls showed the president trailing in nearly every swing state and his unpopularity largely confined him to a narrow path to victory dependent on holding a trio of key Great Lakes states.\n\nThe dynamic has shifted with Harris atop the ticket. Enjoying a burst of voter enthusiasm and campaign cash, the vice president is vying for Sun Belt states that Democrats had all but written off - Georgia, Arizona and Nevada - as well as the Democrats' so-called \"Blue Wall\" of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\n\nHarris' event in Georgia's largest city is her first major effort to put a larger group of states back in play since launching her campaign on July 21. Rapper Megan Thee Stallion plans to make an appearance at the rally, she announced Monday on her Instagram account.\n\nHarris' campaign is confident that her relative popularity among key voting groups - including women, younger voters and people of color - has helped expand the electoral map, according to people familiar with their thinking. Those groups had drifted from Biden but have gravitated to the new presumptive Democratic nominee, who would become the first Black woman and Asian American president if she wins in November.\n\n\"The data is clear: We have multiple pathways to 270 electoral votes,\" Dan Kanninen, battleground director for the Harris campaign, told reporters on Monday. \"The vice president is strong in both the Blue Wall and in the Sun Belt, and we are running hard in both.\"\n\nGeorgia Battleground\n\nEven before Biden's dramatic exit from the race, Harris had spent more time campaigning in the South and West than the president. Georgia is a state where the campaign sees that investment poised to pay off.\n\nThe vice president's visit to Georgia on Tuesday is her 15th since taking office and her campaign has bragged about its presence there, which includes 24 offices.\n\nA spending spree by Trump and his supporters indicates they, too, see Georgia as competitive. Trump and his allied super political action committee have booked $14.7 million in advertising there through the end of August, according to AdImpact, almost triple the $4.9 million that Future Forward PAC, which backs Harris, is set to spend. The vice president's campaign has not reserved any advertising time in the state.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump won Georgia by over 5 percentage points in 2016 but lost it to Biden four years later by less than a quarter of a point, the first time a Democratic nominee carried the Peach State in nearly three decades. The 2020 election left an indelible mark: Trump was indicted last year on state charges he sought to overturn his loss.\n\nTurning out Black voters in Atlanta will be crucial to Harris' chances.\n\nThe city has long been a magnet for people of color, with a cluster of historically Black colleges and universities that have been a pipeline for young professionals and a source of political activism. Harris attended Howard University, a prestigious historically Black college in Washington.\n\nAtlanta is a popular landing spot for members of the Divine Nine - the most prominent Black fraternities and sororities - whose network Harris has tapped as a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha. They offer her campaign an organic ground game in the state.\n\nRepresentative Nikema Williams, who also chairs the Georgia Democratic Party and will attend Harris' event, said her home state remains a \"true battleground.\"\n\n\"We're seeing the excitement on the ground, we're seeing people sign up to volunteer who haven't volunteered before,\" Williams said in an interview.\n\nAn Emerson College poll earlier in July when Biden was still in the race showed him trailing Trump in Georgia 47% to 41%. A poll taken after Harris' entry showed her narrowing the gap to 48% to 46%.\n\nBlue Wall\n\nBiden ended his bid after pressure from fellow Democrats alarmed by his calamitous debate against Trump. Polls showed the race moving in Trump's direction. The Republican gained an edge in many swing states and put places Biden carried easily in 2020, such as Minnesota and Virginia, into play.\n\n\"He was expanding the map into states that Democrats really had no business losing in,\" said Amy Walter, publisher of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. Harris \"took what was a rapidly expanding map, which was benefiting Trump, and has narrowed it back to the battleground states.\"\n\nWith Biden atop the ticket, Democrats viewed the Blue Wall states as his best path to reelection. The president often touted his pro-union stance in an effort to win over White, working-class voters.\n\nHigh inflation, however, has overshadowed Biden's investments in domestic manufacturing and infrastructure. Broad voter skepticism over the administration's handling of the economy also threatens to undercut Harris' campaign.\n\nKanninen, the battleground director, said in an interview there is no indication Harris is performing worse across the Blue Wall.\n\n\"We've seen no data to suggest a backslide whatsoever,\" he said. \"The theory of the case has been win close races across several geographies and have the resources to do it.\"\n\nDemocratic Surge\n\nHarris' campaign has enrolled at least 170,000 new volunteers since Biden endorsed her, including over 50,000 in the battleground states, Kanninen said.\n\nDemocrats also have renewed hopes of competing in Nevada, a state with a relatively young electorate with large Black, Latino and Asian and Pacific Islander populations.\n\n\"When it comes to turning out must-win constituencies, energizing young voters and connecting with Nevada families on the issues that matter to them, Vice President Harris has already begun working to win and earn and their vote,\" said Molly Forgey, a Democratic campaign operative in the state.\n\nThe party saw a surge of interest there when Biden endorsed Harris, a Democratic campaign official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. About 600 new volunteers signed up that day. Harris also has cultivated ties with Nevada labor groups, including the powerful Culinary Workers Union most recently during a visit to Las Vegas in January.\n\n-With assistance from Hadriana

Her far-left ideas are even more radioactive than Joe Biden, particularly in the key swing states that will decide this election like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.\"\n\nAlthough Trump is polling ahead, since entering the race Harris has narrowed the gap between her and the Republican nominee.

She also inherited some $91 million in leftover campaign funds from Biden.\n\nThe Democrats will officially nominate the party's candidate at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois starting on August 19.\n\nIt comes as:\n\nSpeculation continues to swirl about who Harris could name as her vice president pick as the poll revealed that 42% of Americans are simply unsure about who the running mate could be.\n\nPotential names thrown into the running have included North Carolina governor Roy Cooper, Pennsylvania's governor Josh Shapiro, and Michigan's governor Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nHarris is reportedly set to announce her running partner by August 7, according to The New York Times.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "carsen_holaday@the-sun.com", "name": "Carsen Holaday", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_party_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Third party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gretchen Whitmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Doggett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lloyd Doggett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Michigan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Trump's campaign did not respond to requests for comment, but the blitz comes as Harris' candidacy has changed the race.\n\nSince President Joe Biden dropped out last week and endorsed Harris, she has rapidly consolidated support within the Democratic Party and from big-money donors. She has also sparked a newfound energy among groups such as young voters that Biden had been struggling to win over.\n\nAfter months of attacks on Biden's fitness for office, Trump's campaign has had to pivot to find a new message to use against the younger and more dynamic Harris, 59, less than 100 days until the Nov. 5 election.\n\nOn Monday, Trump, 78, released an ad on his Truth Social platform using Harris's own words from old interviews, campaign events and debates to try to portray her as an extreme liberal out of touch with everyday Americans, particularly in the Rust Belt.\n\nIn response, Harris accused the Trump campaign of lying about her record.\n\n\"Vice President Harris has been a key leader in working across the aisle to pass the Biden-Harris administration's historic, popular agenda,\" said Harris spokesperson Sarafina Chitika.\n\nSince she emerged as her party's candidate, Harris has focused on Trump's felony convictions in a New York hush-money trial and the other criminal charges he faces, and portrayed him as responsible for a wave of anti-abortion measures in Republican-led states around the country.\n\nA super PAC supporting Trump, MAGA Inc., kicked off a parallel ad blitz when it said last week it will spend $32 million in three states with new ads criticizing Harris.\n\nUnlike presidential campaigns, there are no limits on donations to super PACs, meaning they often have more money to spend. But they are not permitted to coordinate with campaigns on strategy.\n\nFuture Forward, a Democratic super PAC, said it is launching a $50 million effort to back Harris in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the six states seen as pivotal to deciding the election because their voting preferences can swing either way.\n\nHarris' campaign said on Sunday that it raised $200 million in new campaign funds last week.\n\nWhile Harris is well known, her policy positions are not.\n\n\"She has a second chance to make a first impression,\" said pollster Evan Roth Smith of the Democratic polling firm Blueprint.\n\nBut the danger for Harris lies in whether the Trump campaign can define her in voters' minds before her campaign can make it to the airwaves, he said.\n\nBrian Schimming, chair of Wisconsin's Republican Party, said Republicans are moving to do just that.\n\n\"It's about letting people know that if you didn't like Joe Biden, you're really not going to like Kamala Harris,\" he said.\n\nAs a candidate for president during the 2020 election, Harris adopted several left-leaning positions on immigration and healthcare in a bid to court liberals. But as Biden's vice president, she has has stayed true to the administration's more pragmatic policies.\n\n(Reporting by James Oliphant and Tim Reid; Additional reporting by Alexandra Ulmer; Editing

As California's attorney general, she went after the big banks and won $20 billion for homeowners,\" the narrator in the spot says.\n\nAnd pointing to her three and a half years as vice president, the narrator spotlights that Harris \"took on the big drug companies to cap the cost of insulin for seniors. Because Kamala Harris has always known who she represents.\"\n\nWATCH: NEW TRUMP INTERVIEW ON FOX NEWS' 'THE INGRAHAM ANGLE'\n\nTrump's ad - part of the Republican presidential nominee's first major ad buy since the beginning of the year during the GOP primaries - targets Harris for being weak on border security, which along with crime is a leading issue on the minds of American voters.\n\n\"She's failed us. Under Harris, over 10 million illegally here. A quarter of a million Americans dead from fentanyl. Brutal migrant crimes. And ISIS - now here,\" the narrator argues.\n\nHOW LONG WILL THE HARRIS 'HONEYMOON' IN THE POLLS LAST?\n\nThe ad includes a clip of Harris' well-watched and widely criticized interview in 2021 with NBC News in which she pushed back against a question about whether she had visited the nation's southern border with Mexico.\n\n\"Kamala Harris. failed, weak, dangerously liberal,\" the narrator charges.\n\nTrump's campaign says it will spend over $12 million to run the ad for the next two weeks in the key battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nIt amplifies Trump and his campaign's attacks on Harris over the past week over the surge of migrants over the nation's southern border during the Biden administration.\n\nHarris was tasked by Biden in 2021 with leading the diplomatic outreach to tackle the \"root causes\" of migration in Central American countries. It led to her being dubbed the \"border czar\" both by the media and Republican opponents, although the White House has rejected that description.\n\nWHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING IN THE KEY BATTLEGROUNDS SHOWS\n\nThe former president's campaign comes as two pro-Trump super PACs, MAGA Inc. and Preserve America, are running multimillion-dollar ad blitzes that also criticize Harris over border security.\n\nThe Harris campaign says its first TV commercial - which uses clips from her first rally last week, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin - is part of a $50 million ad buy on local and national broadcast TV, cable, streaming and social channels, ahead of the Democratic National Convention, which kicks off Aug. 19 in Chicago.\n\nThe narrator in the Harris spot claims that \"Donald Trump wants to take our country backward,\" which appears to be a move by the 59-year-old vice president to spotlight the 78-year-old Trump's age.\n\nHARRIS SHOWCASES 'RECORD-BREAKING' FUNDRAISING\n\nBiden's blockbuster announcement nine days ago came amid mounting pressure from within the Democratic Party for him to drop out after a disastrous performance in last month's first presidential debate with Trump. The 81-year-old Biden's halting and stumbling delivery fueled questions about his physical and mental abilities to serve another four years in the White House.\n\nBut Biden's immediate backing of Harris ignited a surge of endorsements for the vice president by Democratic governors, senators, House members and other party leaders. Within 36 hours, Harris announced that she had locked up her party's nomination by landing the verbal backing of a majority of the nearly 4,000 convention delegates.\n\nThe switch at the top of the Democratic Party ticket upended the presidential race, which was a rematch between two candidates who were extremely well known to Americans.\n\nBut the vice president is not nearly as well known to voters, and both the Harris and Trump campaigns are aiming to be the first to define her.\n\n\"Kamala Harris has always stood up to bullies, criminals and special interests on behalf of the American people - and she's beaten them,\" Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said in a statement accompanying the ad's release.\n\nFor over a week, Harris has been pointing to her hefty law enforcement r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as she spotlights Trump's numerous legal controversies, including his 34 felony convictions two months ago in the first criminal trial of a former or current president.\n\n\"As many of you know, before I was elected as vice president, before I was elected as a United States senator, I was the elected attorney general of California. Before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds,\" Harris said at a campaign event last week.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say I know Donald Trump's type,\" she emphasized as she pointed to Trump's multiple lawsuits and criminal cases, many of which are ongoing.\n\nTrump pushed back at a rally last week in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\n\"I don't think people are going to buy it.\" Trump emphasized, as he argued that the vice president \"was one of the worst prosecutors in history\" and that \"she destroyed San Francisco.\"\n\nAnd in an interview Monday on Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle,\" the former president reiterated his charge that Harris is far more liberal than Biden.\n\nLongtime Republican consultant David Kochel emphasized that both the Trump and Harris campaigns are \"in a race to define\" the vice president and that most Americans \"know so little about her record...

I haven't seen anything like this in my many years in Georgia politics,\" state Rep. Sam Park said.\n\nPark's district is in Gwinnett County, one of the state's largest jurisdictions. It was once a conservative stronghold but now goes to Democrats by double digits thanks to demographic shifts and a diverse base of Black, Latino and Asian voters.\n\nHarris' strength comes in part from the belief that she can better engage those voters, a belief already buoyed by polling that has signaled early strength from Harris among voters of color and Gen Z voters in particular.\n\nThe question, in a state that Democrats have carried several times in recent years but only by the thinnest of margins, is whether Harris can use those strengths while also holding on to wavering Republicans and independents who abandoned former President Donald Trump and Trump-like candidates in 2020 and 2022.\n\nRepublican leaders in the state maintain winning Georgia again will be too tall a task for Harris, particularly as, they say, their plans to target Democrats over immigration and the economy remain unchanged.\n\n\"It's essentially a swap of Democratic candidates because Joe Biden could not win. The failed policies remain the same, prioritizing agendas that seem to put Americans last,\" DeKalb County Republican Party chair Marci McCarthy said, describing Harris' burst of popularity in the state as a \"sugar high.\"\n\nStill, the Harris campaign identified Georgia, alongside other Sun Belt states, as top targets in a recent memo outlining its path to victory.\n\n\"The Vice President's advantages with young voters, Black voters, and Latino voters will be important to our multiple pathways to 270 electoral votes,\" Harris for President campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon wrote.\n\nRep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., a longtime ally of Biden's, said: \"Kamala Harris is attractive to a new generation. She excites those who are coming into the party for the first time. She knows how to use social media technology. She's communicating with people on their level, and people like what they hear.\"\n\nHarris' sudden ascension to the top of the Democratic ticket is also energizing voters eager to elect the first woman of color as president.\n\n\"I feel like it's history for us,\" said Tracy Starks, 56, a voter from Lithonia. \"It's great for the women. It's great for the Black community. It's just great. And I think she is going to give Trump what he needs. He ain't ready for this one.\"\n\nSince Harris took over, Democrats have opened four new field offices in the state, including one in Gwinnett County, recruited 7,500 new volunteers and hosted nearly 200 events.\n\nIn total, it says, the Harris campaign has 170 staff members working across 24 campaign offices in the state.\n\nThe new field offices aren't just in Democratic strongholds, where Harris will need to maximize turnout; they are also in counties largely considered safely Republican.\n\n\"In Georgia, we're running the largest in-state operation of any Democratic presidential campaign cycle ever,\" Tyler said, noting offices \"strategically located in all corners of the state.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, one of several Democratic governors vying to be Harris' running mate, headlined the campaign office opening in Forsyth County, where Trump picked up 66% of the vote in 2020. Trump won with similar percentages in other counties the campaign is targeting, including Butts and Lowndes.\n\n\"In Georgia and across America, every single vote counts. There aren't red counties and blue counties. There're just counties with American families that want a better life, and Vice President Harris is going to be talking about just that,\" Beshear told reporters after he spoke in Forsyth.\n\n\"That is how you win votes in counties like this, by not trying to move something to the right or the left, but with the vice president moving all of us forward,\" he said.\n\nThat's in line with the advice former Lt. Gov Geoff Duncan, a lifelong Republican and avowed Trump critic, offered in an op-ed in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution endorsing Harris, calling her \"the best vehicle toward preventing another stained Trump presidency.\"\n\n\"There are still pockets of undecided voters that total in the millions, including the roughly one in five GOP voters who were casting protest votes for former South Carolina Governor and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley in Republican primaries months after she dropped out,\" Duncan wrote. \"Harris must break from electoral tradition and speak to those voters, resisting the urge to cater to her base.\"\n\nDuncan is among a group of Georgia Republicans who have repudiated Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the state, an act that resulted in an indictment in Fulton County and that the Harris campaign has suggested left a sour taste in the mouths of Georgia Republicans who may have grown tired of Trump's antics.\n\n\"Donald Trump and the ticket have problems with Republicans in Georgia -- look at Geoff Duncan,\" Harris campaign battleground state director Dan Kanninen said. \"I think the combination of those two things, having a candidate who can mobilize our key coalition ... and the problems they have with Republicans, make that state in play.\"\n\nHarris' rally in Atlanta will mark her sixth visit this year to Georgia, where campaign officials say she's expected to \"lay out her vision for an America where we move forward, not backwards,\" and \"prosecute the case against Trump and his Project 2025, agenda.\"\n\nBut beyond her remarks, her presence is giving Democrats new optimism ahead of a difficult presidential campaign.\n\n\"The sun is out shining brightly; the sky is blue and clear,\" Johnson said. \"The way forward is clarified, and people feel good about the direction that we're headed in. They feel great about having someone at the head of our ticket that we can all get behind, and that is Kamala Harris.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"},

With President Joe Biden having bowed out of the presidential race and endorsing Harris, their party is suddenly eyeing an expanding map, betting that a new burst of energy and fundraising surge has helped make Georgia, the state that delivered Biden his narrowest [...]\n\nATLANTA (AP) -- Little more than a week ago, Georgia appeared to be slipping out of the Democrats' reach: President Joe Biden 's campaign pledged to concentrate more on holding the Midwestern \" blue wall\" states and indicated they might be willing to forsake \"Sun Belt\" battlegrounds.\n\nBut now that Biden has bowed out of the race and Vice President Kamala Harris is the likely nominee, Democrats say they have new hope for the state. They're betting that a fresh burst of energy and a surge in fundraising has helped make Georgia -- the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020 -- a toss-up again.\n\nHarris is planning to make a show of political force with a rally in Atlanta on Tuesday night that will feature a performance by hip hop star Megan Thee Stallion, the latest example of just how much the race against Republican Donald Trump has shifted since Biden abandoned his reelection bid. She will be appearing in the same city where Biden's dismal performance in a debate against Trump on June 27 sparked a Democratic revolt that ultimately ended his campaign.\n\nHarris is hoping a large rally will help affirm her campaign's momentum. Her campaign argues that Harris' appeal with young people, working-age women and non-white voters have scrambled the dynamics in Georgia and other states that are demographically similar, from North Carolina to Nevada and Arizona.\n\n\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams, a congresswoman from Atlanta. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"\n\nIn a strategy memo released after the president left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who held the same role for Biden, reaffirmed the importance of winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a trio of industrial states that have formed the traditional Democratic blue wall.\n\nBut she also argued that the vice president's place atop the ticket \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" and described them as \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" in places like Georgia.\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nBut they concede that the landscape suddenly looks much closer to 2020 - when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points -- than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt.\n\n\"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"\n\nRobinson said Harris still has plenty of liabilities, including the progressive positions she took in her failed 2020 primary campaign and her various rhetorical stumbles. But he said Harris so far in this campaign has been \"in command,\" and if that continues \"we have a new ballgame and she will be competitive in Georgia.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt did not give similar ground. She dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nDemocrats are betting that a combination of high turnout among traditional, core Democratic constituencies, as well as a strong showing in the suburbs and small pickups elsewhere can be enough for Harris to carry Georgia. That approach was on display at the weekend office openings.\n\nOn Saturday, the venue was East Point, a majority Black municipality and Democratic stronghold south of Atlanta. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., was the featured guest, telling a crowd of mostly Black women that they were the key to victory -- \"the people who are really going to save the country.\"\n\nA day later, it was Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, among several contenders Harris is considering for her running mate, campaigning in Forsyth County. The area is historically very conservative, though Democrats have narrowed the GOP margins in recent cycles.\n\n\"Every county matters,\" Beshear said, holding out his ability to win two governor's races in Kentucky despite Trump's domination of the state in presidential elections.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said in a recent interview that the best GOP campaigns can win comfortably in Georgia but bad efforts -- combined with strong Democratic campaigns -- lose.\n\nDemocrats recently have held wide advantages in the core of metro Atlanta, where Jayapal spoke. The party also performed well in Columbus and Savannah, as well as some rural, majority-Black counties. But Republicans dominated in other rural areas and small towns and cities -- where Trump has held multiple rallies in recent years.\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs, like those where Beshear campaigned on Sunday, offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist -- I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" Smith said.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikema_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikema Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jen_O'Malley_Dillon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jen O'Malley Dillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State governments of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

The messaging might sound familiar to those who were following Trump's campaign even before President Joe Biden announced he was no longer seeking reelection.\n\nIn the Trump campaign's first major ad purchase for television, it shows Harris dancing as it accuses her of failing as a \"border czar.\" It also calls her \"failed,\" \"weak,\" and \"dangerously liberal.\"\n\n\"Under Harris, over 10 million illegally here. A quarter of a million Americans dead from fentanyl. Brutal migrant crimes. And ISIS - now here,\" the narrator says.\n\nThe line of attack is not a surprise for the Trump campaign, as experts predicted he would go after Harris on the border, an area that Biden tasked her to assist with early in his presidency. But the new ad solidified the strategy.\n\nThe ad uses a clip of Harris with NBC's Lester Holt in 2021 in which she was asked about why she hadn't visited the border.\n\n\"I haven't been to Europe,\" Harris said. \"I mean, I don't understand the point you're making.\"\n\nHarris, while never in charge of border policy, was tasked with \"leading the Administration's diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of migration from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras,\" according to the White House.\n\nHarris' campaign, for its part, released a dueling ad criticizing Trump as wanting to \"take our country backwards.\" It also highlights her experiences as a prosecutor and attorney general of California.\n\n\"We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead. Where every senior can retire with dignity,\" Harris states in the ad.\n\nHarris is coming off of an energizing week for Democrats, with the vice president in Atlanta Tuesday night as her campaign sees new hope for winning in Georgia.\n\n\"The Vice President is strong in both the Blue Wall and the Sunbelt, and we'll be running hard in both,\" Dan Kanninen of the Harris campaign said on a call with reporters. \"Her record as a fighter for reproductive rights resonates in the suburbs as well as traditionally red and rural communities. Her historic candidacy is mobilizing for the Democratic Party's diverse base. And we've seen enormous enthusiasm from young voters as well.\"\n\nAdditionally, a group of supporters of the vice president called \"White Dudes for Harris\" raised over $4 million for her presidential campaign Monday night.\n\nSome famous \"white dudes\" joined the zoom call, including actor Jeff Bridges, who played \"The Dude\" in \"The Big Lebowski.\"\n\n\"I qualify, man! I'm white, I'm a dude, and I'm for Harris,\" Bridges said. \"A woman president, man, how exciting!\"", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamic State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_Holt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lester Holt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fentanyl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Modern liberalism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Salvador", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "El Salvador"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "El Salvador"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honduras", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Honduras"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Honduras"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guatemala"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Guatemala"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bridges", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Bridges"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rural area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Activism", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/a65917b/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F2c%2Ff0%2F1b942fe64a3992f2ca76d5a4af62%2Fap24210092673298.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773409", "eventUri": "eng-9773409", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Harris will campaign there Tuesday", "body": "ATLANTA (AP) -- Little more than a week ago, Georgia appeared to be slipping out of the Democrats' reach: President Joe Biden 's campaign pledged to concentrate more on holding the Midwestern \" blue wall\" states and indicated they might be willing to forsake \"Sun Belt\" battlegrounds.\n\nBut now that Biden has bowed out of the race and Vice President Kamala Harris is the likely nominee, Democrats say they have new hope for the state. They're betting that a fresh burst of energy and a surge in fundraising has helped make Georgia -- the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020 -- a toss-up again.\n\nHarris is planning to make a show of political force with a rally in Atlanta on Tuesday night that will feature a performance by hip hop star Megan Thee Stallion, the latest example of just how much the race against Republican Donald Trump has shifted since Biden abandoned his reelection bid. She will be appearing in the same city where Biden's dismal performance in a debate against Trump on June 27 sparked a Democratic revolt that ultimately ended his campaign.\n\nHarris is hoping a large rally will help affirm her campaign's momentum. Her campaign argues that Harris' appeal with young people, working-age women and non-white voters have scrambled the dynamics in Georgia and other states that are demographically similar, from North Carolina to Nevada and Arizona.\n\n\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams, a congresswoman from Atlanta. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"\n\nIn a strategy memo released after the president left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who held the same role for Biden, reaffirmed the importance of winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a trio of industrial states that have formed the traditional Democratic blue wall.\n\nBut she also argued that the vice president's place atop the ticket \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" and described them as \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" in places like Georgia.\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nBut they concede that the landscape suddenly looks much closer to 2020 - when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points -- than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt.\n\n\"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"\n\nRobinson said Harris still has plenty of liabilities, including the progressive positions she took in her failed 2020 primary campaign and her various rhetorical stumbles. But he said Harris so far in this campaign has been \"in command,\" and if that continues \"we have a new ballgame and she will be competitive in Georgia.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt did not give similar ground. She dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nDemocrats are betting that a combination of high turnout among traditional, core Democratic constituencies, as well as a strong showing in the suburbs and small pickups elsewhere can be enough for Harris to carry Georgia. That approach was on display at the weekend office openings.\n\nOn Saturday, the venue was East Point, a majority Black municipality and Democratic stronghold south of Atlanta. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., was the featured guest, telling a crowd of mostly Black women that they were the key to victory -- \"the people who are really going to save the country.\"\n\nA day later, it was Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, among several contenders Harris is considering for her running mate, campaigning in Forsyth County. The area is historically very conservative, though Democrats have narrowed the GOP margins in recent cycles.\n\n\"Every county matters,\" Beshear said, holding out his ability to win two governor's races in Kentucky despite Trump's domination of the state in presidential elections.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said in a recent interview that the best GOP campaigns can win comfortably in Georgia but bad efforts -- combined with strong Democratic campaigns -- lose.\n\nDemocrats recently have held wide advantages in the core of metro Atlanta, where Jayapal spoke. The party also performed well in Columbus and Savannah, as well as some rural, majority-Black counties. But Republicans dominated in other rural areas and small towns and cities -- where Trump has held multiple rallies in recent years.\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs, like those where Beshear campaigned on Sunday, offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist -- I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" Smith said.\n\nWeissert reported from Washington.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"},

She has also sparked a newfound energy among groups such as young voters that Biden had been struggling to win over.\n\nAfter months of attacks on Biden's fitness for office, Trump's campaign has had to pivot to find a new message to use against the younger and more dynamic Harris, 59, less than 100 days until the Nov. 5 election.\n\nOn Monday, Trump, 78, released an ad on his Truth Social platform using Harris's own words from old interviews, campaign events and debates to try to portray her as an extreme liberal out of touch with everyday Americans, particularly in the Rust Belt.\n\nIn response, Harris accused the Trump campaign of lying about her record.\n\n\"Vice President Harris has been a key leader in working across the aisle to pass the Biden-Harris administration's historic, popular agenda,\" said Harris spokesperson Sarafina Chitika.\n\nSince she emerged as her party's candidate, Harris has focused on Trump's felony convictions in a New York hush-money trial and the other criminal charges he faces, and portrayed him as responsible for a wave of anti-abortion measures in Republican-led states around the country.\n\nA super PAC supporting Trump, MAGA Inc., kicked off a parallel ad blitz when it said last week it will spend $32 million in three states with new ads criticizing Harris.\n\nUnlike presidential campaigns, there are no limits on donations to super PACs, meaning they often have more money to spend. But they are not permitted to coordinate with campaigns on strategy.\n\nFuture Forward, a Democratic super PAC, said it is launching a $50 million effort to back Harris in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the six states seen as pivotal to deciding the election because their voting preferences can swing either way.\n\nHarris' campaign said on Sunday that it raised $200 million in new campaign funds last week.\n\nWhile Harris is well known, her policy positions are not.\n\n\"She has a second chance to make a first impression,\" said pollster Evan Roth Smith of the Democratic polling firm Blueprint.\n\nBut the danger for Harris lies in whether the Trump campaign can define her in voters' minds before her campaign can make it to the airwaves, he said.\n\nBrian Schimming, chair of Wisconsin's Republican Party, said Republicans are moving to do just that.\n\n\"It's about letting people know that if you didn't like Joe Biden, you're really not going to like Kamala Harris,\" he said.\n\nAs a candidate for president during the 2020 election, Harris adopted several left-leaning positions on immigration and healthcare in a bid to court liberals. But as Biden's vice president, she has has stayed true to the administration's more pragmatic policies.\n\n(Reporting by James Oliphant and Tim Reid; Additional reporting by Alexandra Ulmer; Editing

They're betting that a fresh burst of energy and a surge in fundraising has helped make Georgia -- the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020 -- a toss-up again.\n\nHarris is planning to make a show of political force with a rally in Atlanta on Tuesday night that will feature a performance by hip hop star Megan Thee Stallion, the latest example of just how much the race against Republican Donald Trump has shifted since Biden abandoned his reelection bid. She will be appearing in the same city where Biden's dismal performance in a debate against Trump on June 27 sparked a Democratic revolt that ultimately ended his campaign.\n\nHarris is hoping a large rally will help affirm her campaign's momentum. Her campaign argues that Harris' appeal with young people, working-age women and non-white voters have scrambled the dynamics in Georgia and other states that are demographically similar, from North Carolina to Nevada and Arizona.\n\n\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams, a congresswoman from Atlanta. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"\n\nIn a strategy memo released after the president left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who held the same role for Biden, reaffirmed the importance of winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a trio of industrial states that have formed the traditional Democratic blue wall.\n\nBut she also argued that the vice president's place atop the ticket \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" and described them as \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" in places like Georgia.\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nBut they concede that the landscape suddenly looks much closer to 2020 - when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points -- than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt.\n\n\"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"\n\nRobinson said Harris still has plenty of liabilities, including the progressive positions she took in her failed 2020 primary campaign and her various rhetorical stumbles. But he said Harris so far in this campaign has been \"in command,\" and if that continues \"we have a new ballgame and she will be competitive in Georgia.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt did not give similar ground. She dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nDemocrats are betting that a combination of high turnout among traditional, core Democratic constituencies, as well as a strong showing in the suburbs and small pickups elsewhere can be enough for Harris to carry Georgia. That approach was on display at the weekend office openings.\n\nOn Saturday, the venue was East Point, a majority Black municipality and Democratic stronghold south of Atlanta. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., was the featured guest, telling a crowd of mostly Black women that they were the key to victory -- \"the people who are really going to save the country.\"\n\nA day later, it was Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, among several contenders Harris is considering for her running mate, campaigning in Forsyth County. The area is historically very conservative, though Democrats have narrowed the GOP margins in recent cycles.\n\n\"Every county matters,\" Beshear said, holding out his ability to win two governor's races in Kentucky despite Trump's domination of the state in presidential elections.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said in a recent interview that the best GOP campaigns can win comfortably in Georgia but bad efforts -- combined with strong Democratic campaigns -- lose.\n\nDemocrats recently have held wide advantages in the core of metro Atlanta, where Jayapal spoke. The party also performed well in Columbus and Savannah, as well as some rural, majority-Black counties. But Republicans dominated in other rural areas and small towns and cities -- where Trump has held multiple rallies in recent years.\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs, like those where Beshear campaigned on Sunday, offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist -- I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" Smith said.", "source": {"uri": "wgxa.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "WGXA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "will_weissert@wgxa.tv", "name": "Will Weissert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikema_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikema Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Belt_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sun Belt Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jen_O'Malley_Dillon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jen O'Malley Dillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State governments of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

But Republicans dominated in other rural areas and small towns and cities -- where Trump has held multiple rallies in recent years.\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs, like those where Beshear campaigned on Sunday, offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist -- I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" Smith said.", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anchorage Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikema_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikema Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jen_O'Malley_Dillon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jen O'Malley Dillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Belt_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sun Belt Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

She's broken donation records and secured enough delegates to clinch the Democratic Party's nomination at the convention next month.\n\nPublicly, the Trump campaign has said that Harris replacing Biden has not changed the race. Trump allies have targeted Harris's role in the Biden administration, particularly on immigration and inflation, and suggested she misled the public about Biden's fitness.\n\nAfter Biden dropped out, Vance joked that he was \"kind of pissed off\" that he won't be able to debate Harris as vice presidential candidates now that she's poised to take on Trump. He also warned voters that Harris was a \"million times worse\" than Biden.\n\nAt the weekend fundraiser, Vance didn't offer as strong of an opinion about Harris.\n\n\"We have a very unique opportunity, but also a very unique challenge, because, let's be honest, 10 days ago, the two candidates who were running for president, everybody had an opinion about 'em,\" Vance said, according to the Post. \"Love 'em or hate 'em, everybody has an opinion about Donald Trump and Joe Biden after the past eight years.

Harris will campaign there Tuesday", "body": "ATLANTA -- Little more than a week ago, Georgia appeared to be slipping out of the Democrats' reach: President Joe Biden's campaign pledged to concentrate more on holding the Midwestern \"blue wall\" states and indicated they might be willing to forsake \"Sun Belt\" battlegrounds.\n\nBut now that Biden has bowed out of the race and Vice President Kamala Harris is the likely nominee, Democrats say they have new hope for the state. They're betting that a fresh burst of energy and a surge in fundraising has helped make Georgia - the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020 - a toss-up again.\n\nHarris is planning to make a show of political force with a rally in Atlanta on Tuesday night that will feature a performance by hip hop star Megan Thee Stallion, the latest example of just how much the race against Republican Donald Trump has shifted since Biden abandoned his reelection bid. She will be appearing in the same city where Biden's dismal performance in a debate against Trump on June 27 sparked a Democratic revolt that ultimately ended his campaign.\n\nHarris is hoping a large rally will help affirm her campaign's momentum. Her campaign argues that Harris' appeal with young people, working-age women and non-white voters have scrambled the dynamics in Georgia and other states that are demographically similar, from North Carolina to Nevada and Arizona.\n\n\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams, a congresswoman from Atlanta. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"\n\nIn a strategy memo released after the president left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who held the same role for Biden, reaffirmed the importance of winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a trio of industrial states that have formed the traditional Democratic blue wall.\n\nBut she also argued that the vice president's place atop the ticket \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" and described them as \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" in places like Georgia.\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nBut they concede that the landscape suddenly looks much closer to 2020 - when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points - than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt.\n\n\"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"\n\nRobinson said Harris still has plenty of liabilities, including the progressive positions she took in her failed 2020 primary campaign and her various rhetorical stumbles. But he said Harris so far in this campaign has been \"in command,\" and if that continues \"we have a new ballgame and she will be competitive in Georgia.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt did not give similar ground. She dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nDemocrats are betting that a combination of high turnout among traditional, core Democratic constituencies, as well as a strong showing in the suburbs and small pickups elsewhere can be enough for Harris to carry Georgia. That approach was on display at the weekend office openings.\n\nOn Saturday, the venue was East Point, a majority Black municipality and Democratic stronghold south of Atlanta. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., was the featured guest, telling a crowd of mostly Black women that they were the key to victory - \"the people who are really going to save the country.\"\n\nA day later, it was Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, among several contenders Harris is considering for her running mate, campaigning in Forsyth County. The area is historically very conservative, though Democrats have narrowed the GOP margins in recent cycles.\n\n\"Every county matters,\" Beshear said, holding out his ability to win two governor's races in Kentucky despite Trump's domination of the state in presidential elections.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said in a recent interview that the best GOP campaigns can win comfortably in Georgia but bad efforts - combined with strong Democratic campaigns - lose.\n\nDemocrats recently have held wide advantages in the core of metro Atlanta, where Jayapal spoke. The party also performed well in Columbus and Savannah, as well as some rural, majority-Black counties. But Republicans dominated in other rural areas and small towns and cities -- where Trump has held multiple rallies in recent years.\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs, like those where Beshear campaigned on Sunday, offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist -

They're betting that a fresh burst of energy and a surge in fundraising has helped make Georgia -- the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020 -- a toss-up again.Harris is planning to make a show of political force with a rally in Atlanta on Tuesday night that will feature a performance by hip hop star Megan Thee Stallion, the latest example of just how much the race against Republican Donald Trump has shifted since Biden abandoned his reelection bid. She will be appearing in the same city where Biden's dismal performance in a debate against Trump on June 27 sparked a Democratic revolt that ultimately ended his campaign. Harris is hoping a large rally will help affirm her campaign's momentum. Her campaign argues that Harris' appeal with young people, working-age women and non-white voters have scrambled the dynamics in Georgia and other states that are demographically similar, from North Carolina to Nevada and Arizona.\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams, a congresswoman from Atlanta. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"In a strategy memo released after the president left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who held the same role for Biden, reaffirmed the importance of winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a trio of industrial states that have formed the traditional Democratic blue wall. But she also argued that the vice president's place atop the ticket \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" and described them as \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" in places like Georgia.Republicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.But they concede that the landscape suddenly looks much closer to 2020 - when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points -- than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt. \"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"Robinson said Harris still has plenty of liabilities, including the progressive positions she took in her failed 2020 primary campaign and her various rhetorical stumbles. But he said Harris so far in this campaign has been \"in command,\" and if that continues \"we have a new ballgame and she will be competitive in Georgia.\"Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt did not give similar ground. She dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\" The Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.Democrats are betting that a combination of high turnout among traditional, core Democratic constituencies, as well as a strong showing in the suburbs and small pickups elsewhere can be enough for Harris to carry Georgia. That approach was on display at the weekend office openings.On Saturday, the venue was East Point, a majority Black municipality and Democratic stronghold south of Atlanta. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., was the featured guest, telling a crowd of mostly Black women that they were the key to victory -- \"the people who are really going to save the country.\" A day later, it was Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, among several contenders Harris is considering for her running mate, campaigning in Forsyth County. The area is historically very conservative, though Democrats have narrowed the GOP margins in recent cycles.\"Every county matters,\" Beshear said, holding out his ability to win two governor's races in Kentucky despite Trump's domination of the state in presidential elections.Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said in a recent interview that the best GOP campaigns can win comfortably in Georgia but bad efforts -- combined with strong Democratic campaigns -- lose.Democrats recently have held wide advantages in the core of metro Atlanta, where Jayapal spoke.

Harris Will Campaign There Tuesday", "body": "But now that Biden has bowed out of the race and Vice President Kamala Harris is the likely nominee, Democrats say they have new hope for the state. They're betting that a fresh burst of energy and a surge in fundraising has helped make Georgia -- the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020 -- a toss-up again.\n\nHarris is planning to make a show of political force with a rally in Atlanta on Tuesday night that will feature a performance by hip hop star Megan Thee Stallion, the latest example of just how much the race against Republican Donald Trump has shifted since Biden abandoned his reelection bid. She will be appearing in the same city where Biden's dismal performance in a debate against Trump on June 27 sparked a Democratic revolt that ultimately ended his campaign.\n\nHarris is hoping a large rally will help affirm her campaign's momentum. Her campaign argues that Harris' appeal with young people, working-age women and non-white voters have scrambled the dynamics in Georgia and other states that are demographically similar, from North Carolina to Nevada and Arizona.\n\n\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams, a congresswoman from Atlanta. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"\n\nIn a strategy memo released after the president left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who held the same role for Biden, reaffirmed the importance of winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a trio of industrial states that have formed the traditional Democratic blue wall.\n\nBut she also argued that the vice president's place atop the ticket \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" and described them as \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" in places like Georgia.\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nBut they concede that the landscape suddenly looks much closer to 2020 - when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points -- than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt.\n\n\"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"\n\nRobinson said Harris still has plenty of liabilities, including the progressive positions she took in her failed 2020 primary campaign and her various rhetorical stumbles. But he said Harris so far in this campaign has been \"in command,\" and if that continues \"we have a new ballgame and she will be competitive in Georgia.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt did not give similar ground. She dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nDemocrats are betting that a combination of high turnout among traditional, core Democratic constituencies, as well as a strong showing in the suburbs and small pickups elsewhere can be enough for Harris to carry Georgia. That approach was on display at the weekend office openings.\n\nOn Saturday, the venue was East Point, a majority Black municipality and Democratic stronghold south of Atlanta. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., was the featured guest, telling a crowd of mostly Black women that they were the key to victory -- \"the people who are really going to save the country.\"\n\nA day later, it was Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, among several contenders Harris is considering for her running mate, campaigning in Forsyth County. The area is historically very conservative, though Democrats have narrowed the GOP margins in recent cycles.\n\n\"Every county matters,\" Beshear said, holding out his ability to win two governor's races in Kentucky despite Trump's domination of the state in presidential elections.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said in a recent interview that the best GOP campaigns can win comfortably in Georgia but bad efforts -- combined with strong Democratic campaigns -- lose.\n\nDemocrats recently have held wide advantages in the core of metro Atlanta, where Jayapal spoke. The party also performed well in Columbus and Savannah, as well as some rural, majority-Black counties. But Republicans dominated in other rural areas and small towns and cities -- where Trump has held multiple rallies in recent years.\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs, like those where Beshear campaigned on Sunday, offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist -- I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" Smith said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Since then, Harris's election campaign has raised $200 million, signed up 170,000 new volunteers and she has significantly outperformed Biden in recent polling among young people, Black voters and Hispanic voters.\n\nA New York Times/Siena College national poll published Thursday found Harris has narrowed a sizable Trump lead; Trump had a two percentage point lead in a Wall Street Journal poll published on Friday. A Reuters/Ipsos poll published July 23 showed a two point lead for Harris.\n\nBiden's campaign saw a narrowing path to victory with the \"Sun Belt states,\" including Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, as unlikely wins. Georgia backed Biden by 0.2 percentage points, just under 12,000 votes in 2020, and Trump by around 5 percentage points in 2016.\n\nAndy Beshear, the twice-elected Democratic governor of deep-red Kentucky, visited Georgia over the weekend to campaign for Harris in the Republican stronghold of Forsyth County.\n\nThe Harris campaign is vetting him along with Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Govs. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Tim Walz of Minnesota as possible vice presidential candidates. A decision is expected by Aug. 7.\n\nHarris is leaning into her resume as a former district attorney and California attorney general, seeking to draw a contrast with Trump who is the first former president to be convicted of felony crimes.\n\nTrump and 14 co-defendants are accused of racketeering and other charges for their role in attempting to overturn Biden's narrow win in Georgia.

But we are not going back.\"\n\nThe former president's ad, I Don't Understand, used a snippet of Harris answering a question about immigration policy to bolster a hardline message about drugs, crime, terrorism and the southern border.\n\nShowing footage of her dancing, Trump's ad called Harris \"failed, weak, dangerously liberal\".\n\nHarris's campaign hit back against Trump, pointing to the Republican's role in directing congressional Republicans to reject bipartisan border reform.\n\n\"After killing the toughest border deal in decades, Donald Trump is running on his trademark lies because his own record and 'plans' are extreme and unpopular,\" Ammar Moussa, a Harris campaign spokesperson, told reporters.\n\nHarris has been the presumptive Democratic nominee for little more than a week - but she has made an extremely strong start, reeling in more than $200m and appearing to make up ground in the polls.\n\nShe is still considering her own vice-presidential pick. But on Monday, Trump's Republican running mate, the hardline Ohio senator JD Vance, was revealed to have made a telling admission about the strength of Harris's start.\n\nIn remarks at a fundraiser in Minnesota last weekend, reported by the Washington Post and referring to Biden's decision to give in to those who said he was too old for a second term, Vance said: \"All of us were hit with a little bit of a political sucker punch.\n\n\"The bad news is that Kamala Harris does not have the same baggage as Joe Biden, because whatever we might have to say, Kamala is a lot younger. And Kamala Harris is obviously not struggling in the same ways that Joe Biden did.\"\n\nBiden is 81, and Harris is 59. Trump is 78, making him the oldest presidential nominee of all time. The language of Harris's new ad pointed to Democratic determination to target Trump's age - and to portray him as backward-looking and a thing of the past, now that their own old man is out of the campaign picture.\n\nThe Harris campaign is also keen to point to its fundraising efforts, which as the new ad was released saw a \"White Dudes for Harris\" call featuring celebrities including the actor Jeff Bridges, who famously played Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski. The campaign said it raised $4m.\n\nFive years before Bridges made The Big Lebowski, he played the lead role in Fearless, a 1993 movie about a man whose behaviour is changed after he survives a plane crash.\n\nIn a statement accompanying the Fearless ad, the Harris campaign chairperson, Jen O'Malley Dillon, saluted Democrats' own dramatic shift in fortunes, from plummeting polls under Biden to soaring hopes under Harris.\n\n\"Kamala Harris has always stood up to bullies, criminals and special interests on behalf of the American people - and she's beaten them,\" O'Malley Dillon said, echoing the ad's citation of Harris's work as attorney general of California, as well as her time as a US senator and vice-president.\n\n\"This $50m paid media campaign, bolstered by our record-setting fundraising haul and a groundswell of grassroots enthusiasm, is one crucial way we will reach and make our case to the voters who will decide this election.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign plans to air its ad prominently over three weeks, including amid coverage of the Olympic Games in Paris.\n\nThe Trump campaign is also reportedly focusing on Arizona, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada, Georgia and Michigan - the key battleground states.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martin_pengelly@theguardian.com", "name": "Martin

Some Democrats now see Georgia, which Democrats barely won in a hard-fought battle in 2020, as a possible victory again in 2024.\n\nHarris will hold a political event in Atlanta at 7:00 p.m. EDT (2300 GMT), the White House said, without providing more details. Megan Thee Stallion will join Harris in Atlanta, Billboard and Rolling Stone reported, citing a source.\n\nGeorgia Senator Jon Ossoff said on MSNBC over the weekend that Harris' entry into the race \"has put Georgia in play\" for Democrats and predicted she will win.\n\nSwing states like Georgia are fiercely contested because they can lean either to Republicans or Democrats and play a decisive role in presidential elections.\n\nFiveThirtyEight, the poll aggregation site, shows Republican Donald Trump leading Harris by between one and five percentage points in surveys taken after Harris became the likely Democratic candidate.\n\nPresident Joe Biden ended his reelection bid on July 22 and endorsed Harris for the Nov. 5 vote against Trump. Since then, Harris's election campaign has raised $200 million, signed up 170,000 new volunteers and she has significantly outperformed Biden in recent polling among young people, Black voters and Hispanic voters.\n\nA New York Times/Siena College national poll published Thursday found Harris has narrowed a sizable Trump lead; Trump had a two percentage point lead in a Wall Street Journal poll published on Friday. A Reuters/Ipsos poll published July 23 showed a two point lead for Harris.\n\nBiden's campaign saw a narrowing path to victory with the \"Sun Belt states,\" including Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, unlikely wins. Georgia backed Biden by 0.2 percentage points, just under 12,000 votes in 2020, and Trump by around 5 percentage points in 2016.\n\nAndy Beshear, the twice-elected Democratic governor of deep-red Kentucky, visited Georgia over the weekend to campaign for Harris in the Republican stronghold of Forsyth County.\n\nThe Harris campaign is vetting him along with Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Govs. Josh eShapiro of Pennsylvania and Tim Walz of Minnesota as possible vice presidential candidates. A decision is expected by Aug. 7.\n\nHarris is leaning into her resume as a former district attorney and California attorney general, seeking to draw a contrast with Trump who is the first former president to be convicted of felony crimes.\n\nTrump and 14 co-defendants are accused of racketeering and other charges for their role in attempting to overturn Biden's narrow win in Georgia.\n\n(Reporting by Nandita Bose in Washington; Editing by Heather Timmons and Stephen Coates)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"},

The campaign is also boasting 170,000 new volunteers who have signed up to back Harris. This past weekend to commemorate the 100-day mark from November's election, the campaign hosted 2,300 events across the battleground states with more than 29,000 volunteers participating.\n\nHarris -- who will be introduced by a graduate of Morehouse College, a historically Black university -- will be joined by Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock as well as former Rep. Stacey Abrams along with several other special guests. One of those special guests will rapper Megan Thee Stallion, who is expected to give a special performance at the rally, a source confirmed to ABC News.\n\nHarris' remarks at the rally will follow a meeting with local reproductive rights leaders and activists.\n\nGeorgia played a crucial role in Biden's 2020 victory, going blue for the first time since 1992 due, in significant part, to organizing efforts from Abrams, who spent years spearheading get-out-the-vote efforts in Black communities. Harris' campaign will be looking to replicate success in Georgia by shoring up support among Black voters, a key group of voters that both Harris and former President Donald Trump will work to connect with as the November election approaches.\n\nBiden only won the state by some 12,000 votes in 2020, a win heavily contested by Trump, who is currently in the midst of an election interference case in the state. Trump hasn't held a campaign event in Georgia since his debate with Biden in June.\n\nKanninen said although the Harris campaign has achieved an impressive fundraising haul in a short amount of time, they are not getting \"comfortable.\"\n\n\"I continue to be very clear with our partners and with our own staff. This campaign will not get comfortable. We jumped in with just 100 days ago against an opponent who has shown he's willing to do anything to win,\" said Kannien. \"This is going to be an incredibly close race just like it was in 2020. But just like four years ago, we are going to win this thing.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign told reporters they expect the state to be just as \"competitive\" this election, claiming that their infrastructure in the state gives them an advantage.\n\n\"We expect it to be as close as competitive this year,\" said Communications Director Michael Tyler. \"That's why we have the team and the operation in place to make sure that we can turn out every single Harris voter in the state of Georgia.\"\n\nAccording to the campaign, they have more than 170 coordinated staff and 24 offices across the state with three of those opening this past weekend. The Trump campaign only recently opened its first campaign office in the state in June.\n\n\"We're making these investments across the entire map because the data is clear.

In several polls, Harris has performed at least somewhat better than Biden did against Trump before the incumbent stepped aside. But election forecasts remain offline while analysts recalibrate their models for a new matchup, meaning time is needed to better understand what these numbers signify for November.\n\nScott Tranter, the director of data science for Decision Desk HQ, said he could make an argument that either Trump or Harris is in the preferable position in the race, underscoring how up in the air the race is.\n\n\"I could probably give you one or two good points, case for either of them, and that's the mark of a true 50-50 race,\" he said.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to Biden's calamitous debate with Trump just over a month ago, the general trend for polls had been the two candidates locked in a tight matchup nationally, with Trump arguably ahead slightly. He had a clearer advantage across the roughly half-dozen battleground states that will likely decide the winner of the election.\n\nThat began to shift somewhat after the debate, with Trump taking more of a lead in national and state polling. Some polls of more traditionally liberal-leaning states, like New Hampshire and Maine, also started showing Biden's lead over Trump decreasing, giving Republicans hope that they could be in play and expand their map.\n\nTrump's lead in national polling especially grew as calls mounted both publicly and privately within the Democratic Party for Biden to step aside as the nominee. The GOP nominee led in the national polling average from Decision Desk HQ and The Hill by 3.3 points on July 21, the day that Biden announced he would end his reelection bid.\n\nTrump had not previously had a lead that large in the average during the race.\n\nAfter Biden dropped out, the election forecast models went dark. Trump leads Harris in the DDHQ national polling average by 2 points, but this includes relatively few polls released since last Sunday.\n\nDemocratic rallying around Harris as the likely nominee has been swift over the past week, starting with Biden's prompt endorsement of her shortly after announcing the end of his run. And that has seemed to be reflected in some of the polls that have come out over the past week showing greater support for the Democratic candidate.\n\nOne of the first national polls to be released after Harris threw her hat in the ring showed her ahead of Trump nationwide. She led by 2 points in a Reuters/Ipsos poll, which was within the margin of error. The same poll taken one week prior had Trump up on Biden by 2 and tied with Harris.\n\nJust as notable, Harris led by 4 points in a three-way race including independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In many instances when Biden had led Trump in a head-to-head matchup, the former president's position relative to Biden improved when respondents could choose among additional candidates.\n\nA majority of respondents said Harris is \"mentally sharp and able to deal with challenges,\" 7 points higher than the percentage that said the same about Trump. Meanwhile, only a fifth said the same about Biden.\n\nA poll released Thursday from The New York Times and Siena College, which FiveThirtyEight ranked as the most trustworthy pollster, gave Trump a 1-point lead, 48 percent to 47 percent, among likely voters. The lead ticks up to 2 points among registered voters. Both are much narrower than the 6-point lead among likely voters and 9-point lead among registered voters that Trump had in the last poll taken before Biden dropped out.\n\nSimilarly, an NPR/PBS News/Marist poll found Trump and Harris almost exactly even, with Trump up 1.\n\nAs some of these polls started coming out, Trump's pollster issued a memo predicting a \"Harris Honeymoon\" phase that would see her poll numbers rise as she receives widespread media coverage. But he said the phase will be temporary and not change the \"fundamentals\" of the race.\n\nTranter agreed that Harris is in a \"honeymoon phase,\" but noted that what could be key is how long the phase lasts. He said even if it lasts just 60 days, early voting will have started already. He said she has the momentum, which can be reversed, but it could still impact the results.\n\nSurveys of the key battleground states have also shown Harris competitive with Trump, in certain cases improving on Biden's numbers in states that were getting a bit further away from his reach.\n\nA survey from Emerson College Polling and The Hill released last week showed Trump leading Harris in most of the key states, but within the margin of error in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia, the last of which Biden had been regularly trailing Trump in throughout the campaign. Trump and Harris were tied in Wisconsin, and he led by 5 points in Arizona.\n\nAcross the board, these numbers are a significant improvement for Democrats compared to a similar survey from earlier this month with Biden. Harris outperformed Biden by 3 points in Michigan and Pennsylvania, 4 points in Arizona and Wisconsin and 5 points in Georgia.\n\nFox News polls of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin -- three states that gave Trump the presidency in 2016 before flipping back to Biden in 2020 -- found the race similarly competitive. Trump was up 1 point in Wisconsin and tied with Harris in Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nTranter pointed to polling of bluer states like Virginia and Minnesota \"snapping back\" toward Harris at least initially after some had shown Trump possibly making inroads in them against Biden.\n\n\"At the national level, we have Harris is still trailing Trump, but at a much smaller margin than Biden was trailing Trump,\" he said. \"So that indicates that we should see that trend continue down at the individual battleground states.\"\n\nAt the same time the race has tightened, both Harris and Trump have experienced boosts in their popularity.\n\nTrump's favorability rating from the DDHQ and The Hill average reached 45 percent in the aftermath of the assassination attempt on him at his Pennsylvania rally this month, while his unfavorable rating has fallen from 57 percent to 51 percent.\n\nHarris's rating rose particularly as calls for Biden to step aside mounted, reaching 44 percent in the polling average. The polling of the past week has observed this increase, and seven in 10 Democratic respondents in the Times/Siena poll said they want the party to consolidate around Harris.\n\nTranter said Harris's favorability numbers are better than Biden's but still not much ahead of Trump. Both are slightly underwater with their favorability but within range of each other.\n\nStill, all of these numbers have been taken before the Trump-Harris race has fully gotten underway. Harris is just starting to ramp up her campaign with rallies and ads hitting the airwaves, and Republicans are still honing their attacks on her after previously having run against a different candidate.\n\nHarris campaigning could raise her numbers further, or the attacks could cause them to drop.\n\n\"There's quite a few more innings left in this campaign cycle for these numbers to move either up or down, but I would say it's equal chance they go up as they go down,\" Tranter said.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jared_gans@thehill.com", "name": "Jared Gans", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_Desk_HQ", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Decision Desk HQ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena_College", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Siena College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

They're betting that a fresh burst of energy and a surge in fundraising has helped make Georgia -- the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020 -- a toss-up again.\n\nHarris is planning to make a show of political force with a rally in Atlanta at 7 p.m. ET on Tuesday, the latest example of just how much the race against Republican Donald Trump has shifted since Biden abandoned his reelection bid. She will be appearing in the same city where Biden's dismal performance in a debate against Trump on June 27 sparked a Democratic revolt that ultimately ended his campaign.\n\nHarris is hoping a large rally, featuring a performance by hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion, will help affirm her campaign's momentum. The campaign argues that Harris' appeal with young people, working-age women and non-white voters has scrambled the dynamics in Georgia and other states that are demographically similar, from North Carolina to Nevada and Arizona.\n\n\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams, a congresswoman from Atlanta. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"\n\nIn a strategy memo released after the president left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who held the same role for Biden, reaffirmed the importance of winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a trio of industrial states that have formed the traditional Democratic blue wall.\n\nBut she also argued that the vice president's place atop the ticket \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" and described them as \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" in places like Georgia.\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nBut they concede that the landscape suddenly looks much closer to 2020 - when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points -- than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt.\n\n\"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"\n\nRobinson said Harris still has plenty of liabilities, including the progressive positions she took in her failed 2020 primary campaign and her various rhetorical stumbles. But he said Harris so far in this campaign has been \"in command,\" and if that continues \"we have a new ballgame and she will be competitive in Georgia.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt did not give similar ground. She dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nDemocrats are betting that a combination of high turnout among traditional, core Democratic constituencies, as well as a strong showing in the suburbs and small pickups elsewhere can be enough for Harris to carry Georgia. That approach was on display at the weekend office openings.\n\nOn Saturday, the venue was East Point, a majority Black municipality and Democratic stronghold south of Atlanta. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., was the featured guest, telling a crowd of mostly Black women that they were the key to victory -- \"the people who are really going to save the country.\"\n\nA day later, it was Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, among several contenders Harris is considering for her running mate, campaigning in Forsyth County. The area is historically very conservative, though Democrats have narrowed the GOP margins in recent cycles.\n\n\"Every county matters,\" Beshear said, holding out his ability to win two governor's races in Kentucky despite Trump's domination of the state in presidential elections.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said in a recent interview that the best GOP campaigns can win comfortably in Georgia but bad efforts -- combined with strong Democratic campaigns -- lose. Kemp, for example, won reelection by 7.5 percentage points in 2022 over national Democratic star Stacey Abrams. Yet in the same election cycle, Georgians reelected Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock over his Republican challenger Herschel Walker, who was endorsed by Trump.\n\nIn recent elections, Democrats have held wide advantages in the core of metro Atlanta, where Jayapal spoke. The party also performed well in Columbus and Savannah, as well as some rural, majority-Black counties. But Republicans dominated in other rural areas and small towns and cities -- where Trump has held multiple rallies in recent years.\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs, like those where Beshear campaigned on Sunday, offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist -- I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" Smith said.", "source": {"uri": "keyt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsChannel 3-12"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@keyt.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikema_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikema Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Belt_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sun Belt Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jen_O'Malley_Dillon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jen O'Malley Dillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Weak. Dangerously Liberal.\"\n\nThe words flash on the screen as she dances, footage from an event celebrating the 50th anniversary of hip-hop.\n\nIt is the Trump campaign's first major television ad purchase of the election since Harris became the de facto Democratic nominee. The campaign began making a two-week ad reservation on Monday, buying time in the six top battlegrounds.\n\nThe spending by state, according to data from AdImpact, the ad-tracking service, is $2.7 million in Pennsylvania, $2.3 million in Georgia, $2.3 million in Michigan, $1.9 million in Arizona, $1.8 million in Nevada and $1.3 million in Wisconsin.\n\nAlso read | Trump says he 'probably' will debate Harris but can 'make a case for not.' Her team says he's scared\n\nThe ad also makes use of an interview Harris did with NBC's Lester Holt in 2021 when, as she was facing pressure from Republicans to visit the border, she said that she did not understand why her presence would be so important. \"I haven't been to Europe,\" Harris said. \"I mean, I don't understand the point you're making.\"\n\nThe ad also mentions crimes committed by migrants and raises the specter of a potential terror attack. \"ISIS, now here,\" the narrator states.\n\nThat claim is an apparent reference to the arrests of eight Tajik men being investigated for potential ties to the Islamic State group.\n\nThe men have not been charged with any terrorism-related offenses, but Republicans have long raised concerns about the potential that terrorists might be among the migrants illegally crossing the U.S. border with Mexico.\n\nAmmar Moussa, a spokesperson for Harris, accused Trump of \"running on his trademark lies\" and noted that he had opposed a bipartisan border deal that would have stiffened some enforcement.\n\n\"As a former district attorney, attorney general and now vice president, Kamala Harris has spent her career taking on and prosecuting violent criminals and making our communities safer,\" Moussa said. \"She'll do the same as president.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign had spent months laying the groundwork for a brutal general election campaign against President Joe Biden -- casting him as mentally diminished and weak -- but his last-minute withdrawal this month has upended the dynamics of the race.\n\nAlso read | Trump slams 2024 Paris Olympics' opening ceremony, says 'it was a disgrace'\n\nTrump, 78, is now the oldest candidate, and Harris, 59, can make the case that it is time to turn the page generationally.\n\nBut the Trump team still sees Harris as vulnerable on the two issues inflation and immigration that had underpinned its policy argument against Biden.\n\nIn speeches over the past week, Trump repeatedly criticized Harris' work as the \"border czar,\" a position she was never officially given but that refers to her being deputized by Biden to try to address the root issues causing people to flee countries in Central America. Harris was not charged with overseeing border security.\n\n\"Kamala Harris' deadly destruction of America's borders is completely and totally disqualifying for her to be president,\" Trump said Saturday at a rally in St. Cloud, Minnesota.\n\nAlso read | US Secret Service acting director 'ashamed' about Trump shooting\n\nThe ad reflects an effort by Trump and his team to make immigration central to his 2024 presidential campaign that predates Harris' sudden ascension atop the ticket. As he has campaigned this year, Trump often laments not making the border and immigration, which helped fuel his political rise in 2016, central to his failed 2020 campaign.\n\nTrump and his allies have also spent the time since Biden ended his campaign working to define Harris as ultraliberal, hoping to sway undecided moderate voters.\n\nIn recent speeches, Trump has called Harris a \"radical-left lunatic,\" tried to tie her to progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and attacked her past support of left-wing positions on criminal justice.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors":

More than 170,000 new volunteers have reportedly signed up.\n\nOpinion polls also show Harris narrowing the gap former President Trump had been enjoying over Biden.\n\nBut Trump retains a lead in most surveys and virtually everyone, including the most fervent Harris loyalists, knows her honeymoon period will end soon enough.\n\n\"We are the underdogs in this race,\" Harris said at a weekend fundraiser in Massachusetts.\n\nHere are five big questions for Harris and her campaign.\n\nWill she make a strong VP choice?\n\nThis is the biggest decision looming over Harris.\n\nIt could come any time. During an interview Monday on \"CBS Mornings,\" Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) said she expected Harris to decide in \"the next six, seven days.\" Whitmer strongly implied she would not be Harris's running mate.\n\nThe front-runners for the position are Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D). Other figures such as Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear (D) and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg could have a shot.\n\nIt's easy to make an argument for any of the top three: Kelly because of his perceived capacity to ease Harris's vulnerability on migration issues, Shapiro because he is the popular governor of the largest battleground state, and Walz because he has a plain-spoken Midwest appeal.\n\nBut running mate choices that look good on paper can easily go wrong. On the GOP side, there is significant unease over Sen. JD Vance's (Ohio) rocky start as Trump's vice presidential pick. The GOP is still haunted by then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's 2008 performance as then-Sen. John McCain's (Ariz.) running mate.\n\nIt's vital for Harris's chances that her vice presidential choice doesn't misfire.\n\nCan she blunt attacks over her previous positions?\n\nThe overarching Trump campaign attack on Harris is that she is too liberal for the American public.\n\nThere is a genuine vulnerability here, particularly when it comes to Harris's comments and policy positions as she sought the Democratic nomination in 2020.\n\nAt that time, she supported a ban on fracking, had already been a Senate co-sponsor of the Green New Deal, and wanted fundamental reform of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nThere is some controversy over exactly where Harris stood on some of these positions.\n\nFor example, when she was asked during this period whether she agreed with calls to abolish ICE she said that it was necessary to \"critically reexamine ICE\" and added, \"we need to probably even think about starting from scratch.\"\n\nTeam Harris counters that her record as a former prosecutor is a big asset in the battle to define her, helping to cast her as willing to stand up to powerful interests.\n\nShe also appears likely to position herself in a more centrist way than she did during the 2020 primary. For example, her campaign revealed to The Hill late last week that she no longer supports a ban on fracking.\n\nBut the jabs from the Trump campaign are going to keep coming.\n\nOn Monday, the Trump campaign posted a comment from an old interview in which Harris said, \"Yeah, I am radical. I do believe that we need to get radical about what we are doing and take it seriously.\"\n\nCan she win over voters angry about Israel's assault on Gaza?\n\nThere is deep discontent among the Democratic voter base over Biden's strong support for Israel in its war on Gaza.\n\nA Gallup poll last month showed just 23 percent of Democrats approving of the military action Israel has taken in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's joint address to Congress last week was boycotted by more than 100 Democratic representatives and senators.\n\nBiden's stance on Israel and Gaza is especially electorally dangerous in Michigan, a key swing state that has the highest concentration of Arab Americans in the nation.\n\nHarris sounded a notable change in tone after she met Netanyahu, separately from Biden, late last week.\n\nAlthough she affirmed her \"unwavering commitment\" to Israel and its security, Harris also described what had happened in Gaza as \"devastating\" and lamented \"the death of far too many innocent civilians.\"\n\n\"We cannot allow ourselves to be numb to the suffering, and I will not be silent,\" Harris added.\n\nShe will still have a needle to thread, however. Voters sympathetic to the Palestinians want to see an actual shift in policy while pro-Israel voters will be very sensitive to any slackening of support.\n\nCan she win the key battlegrounds?\n\nFor all the euphoria in Democratic ranks about Harris, Trump remains the favorite in November's election, especially if the polling is to be believed.\n\nHarris backers note that the polling since Biden stepped aside has been fairly sparse and that it has moved in her direction.\n\nBut she has significant ground to make up, especially in the battlegrounds of Arizona, Georgia and Nevada. In the polling averages maintained by The Hill and Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ), Trump leads in these states by about 6 points, 4 points and 9 points respectively.\n\nHarris will head to Georgia on Tuesday. It is plausible that her potential to be the first Black female president could help her significantly in a state where roughly 1-in-3 voters are Black.\n\nHarris is down by smaller margins in the three \"blue wall\" states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nThe Harris campaign believe she has significant upside with as-yet undecided voters. But there's no mistaking it is a tough road ahead.\n\nCan she differentiate herself from Biden?\n\nHarris is in an inherently tough spot in one respect. She wears two hats, as a candidate in November and as the incumbent vice president to a president with mediocre approval ratings.\n\nA challenge in the months between now and Election Day will be how to differentiate herself from Biden -- if she wants to -- without appearing outright disloyal.\n\nThere are elements of the Biden record that Harris will want to associate herself with, including increased infrastructure spending, a measure of student debt relief and concrete achievements such as capping the cost of insulin at $35 per month for millions of seniors.\n\nBut other elements of the Biden record -- notably immigration and the unhealed political scar created by 2022's inflation spike -- are far more problematic.\n\nIn the months ahead, Harris will have to outline a distinct vision for the future without appearing too harsh toward the man in the White House.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

PRICE\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign has raised $200 million since she emerged as the likely Democratic presidential nominee last week, an eyepopping haul in her race against the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe campaign, which announced its latest fundraising total on Sunday, said the bulk of the donations -- 66% -- comes from first-time contributors in the 2024 election cycle and were made after President Joe Biden announced his exit from the race and endorsed Harris.\n\nOver 170,000 volunteers have also signed up to help the Harris campaign with phone banking, canvassing and other get-out-the-vote efforts. Election Day is 100 days away.\n\n\"The momentum and energy for Vice President Harris is real -- and so are the fundamentals of this race: this election will be very close and decided by a small number of voters in just a few states,\" Michael Tyler, the campaign's communications director, wrote in a memo.\n\nHer campaign said it held some 2,300 organizing events in battleground states this weekend as several high-profile Democrats under consideration to serve as Harris' running mate stumped for her.\n\nHarris campaigned in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, on Saturday, drawing hundreds to a fundraiser that had been organized when Biden was still at the top of the Democratic ticket. The fundraiser had originally been expected to raise $400,000 but ended bringing in about $1.4 million, according to the campaign.\n\nMandy Robbins, 45, of Decatur, Georgia, drove to one of those organizing events Sunday in the northern suburbs of Atlanta to hear Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a potential Harris running mate.\n\nShe thought Biden did a \"great job\" in the White House, but acknowledged she \"would not have been nearly this excited\" if he remained in the race.\n\n\"I finally feel hopeful now,\" Robbins said. She added, \"We can win this with Harris.\"\n\nBeshear spoke from experience to supporters, telling them their work could be the difference in what's expected to be a close race. Beshear won his 2019 campaign by a margin of about 5,000 votes of 1.41 million ballots cast. He was reelected in November by a relatively comfortable margin.\n\n\"Every door knock mattered. Every phone call mattered. Every difficult conversation that people had with their uncle at Thanksgiving mattered,\" Beshear said of his 2019 race. \"Everyone here today that signs up to volunteer ... you might be the difference in winning this race for Vice President Harris.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump, running mate Sen. JD Vance and their surrogates stepped up efforts to frame Harris as a far-left politician out of touch with with the American mainstream.\n\nVance said after a stop at a diner in Waite Park, Minnesota, on Sunday that Harris has \"got a little bit of a bump from her introduction\" but predicted it would soon dissipate.\n\n\"Look, the people are going to learn her record,\" Vance said. \"They're going to learn that she's a radical. They're going to learn that she's basically a San Francisco liberal who wants to take San Francisco policies to the entire country.\"\n\nVance was echoing Trump, who in a campaign appearance with Vance in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday, called Harris a \"crazy liberal,\" accused her of wanting to \"defund the police\" and said she was an \"absolute radical\" on abortion. Harris, a vocal proponent of abortion rights, has made clear that she will make Republican-backed efforts to restrict reproductive rights a key plank in her campaign.\n\n\"There is no liberal horse that she has chosen not to ride,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.\n\nTrump backer Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., also tried to brand Harris as a full partner for \"a lot of the worst decisions of the Biden administration,\" including the chaotic August 2021 pullout of U.S. troops led to the swift collapse of the Afghan government and military.\n\nCotton also accused Harris of emboldening Iranian proxies Hamas and Hezbollah by pressing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over civilian casualties in the war in Gaza.\n\nNetanyahu met separately with Harris and Biden at the White House on Thursday. Afterward, Harris said she urged Netanyahu to reach a cease-fire deal soon with Hamas so that dozens of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza since Oct. 7 can return home. Harris said she also affirmed Israel's right to defend itself but expressed deep concern about the high death toll in Gaza and the \"dire\" humanitarian situation there. Hamas has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, Canada and the European Union.\n\nTensions in the Mideast intensified on Saturday after Israeli authorities said a rocket from Lebanon struck a soccer field in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, killing 12 children and teenagers. The strike raised fears of a broader regional war between Israel and Hezbollah, which denied a role in the attack.\n\nTrump at his Saturday rally said the Golan Heights incident \"will go down as another moment in history created by a weak and ineffective United States president and vice president.\" And Vance on Sunday accused Harris of being \"a disaster\" on the conflict.\n\nStill, some Republicans are concerned that Harris' entrance has given Democrats a spark and that Trump needs to recalibrate.\n\nGov. Chris Sununu, R-N.H., said Harris is in a \"honeymoon\" period that will probably last a month, but he also said that both Trump and Vance should stop the personal attacks against Harris because those will not drive people to vote. Instead, he said they must stick to the issues and \"stay away from the insults.\"\n\nHe said Trump missed an opportunity to do that in recent campaign events, but \"hopefully they can get back on track.\" Sununu, however, acknowledged that \"nobody can get Donald Trump to do anything\" he doesn't want to do.\n\n\"But hopefully the numbers, the polls, will get Donald Trump to realize what was working and what didn't,\" Sununu said\n\nGraham was on CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" Sununu was on ABC's \"This Week,\" and Cotton was on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"", "source": {"uri": "chicoer.com",

More than 170,000 new volunteers have reportedly signed up.\n\nOpinion polls also show Harris narrowing the gap former President Trump had been enjoying over Biden.\n\nBut Trump retains a lead in most surveys and virtually everyone, including the most fervent Harris loyalists, knows her honeymoon period will end soon enough.\n\n\"We are the underdogs in this race,\" Harris said at a weekend fundraiser in Massachusetts.\n\nHere are five big questions for Harris and her campaign.\n\nWill she make a strong VP choice?\n\nThis is the biggest decision looming over Harris.\n\nIt could come any time. During an interview Monday on \"CBS Mornings,\" Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) said she expected Harris to decide in \"the next six, seven days.\" Whitmer strongly implied she would not be Harris's running mate.\n\nThe front-runners for the position are Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D). Other figures such as Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear (D) and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg could have a shot.\n\nIt's easy to make an argument for any of the top three: Kelly because of his perceived capacity to ease Harris's vulnerability on migration issues, Shapiro because he is the popular governor of the largest battleground state, and Walz because he has a plain-spoken Midwest appeal.\n\nBut running mate choices that look good on paper can easily go wrong. On the GOP side, there is significant unease over Sen. JD Vance's (Ohio) rocky start as Trump's vice presidential pick. The GOP is still haunted by then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's 2008 performance as then-Sen. John McCain's (Ariz.) running mate.\n\nIt's vital for Harris's chances that her vice presidential choice doesn't misfire.\n\nCan she blunt attacks over her previous positions?\n\nThe overarching Trump campaign attack on Harris is that she is too liberal for the American public.\n\nThere is a genuine vulnerability here, particularly when it comes to Harris's comments and policy positions as she sought the Democratic nomination in 2020.\n\nAt that time, she supported a ban on fracking, had already been a Senate co-sponsor of the Green New Deal, and wanted fundamental reform of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nThere is some controversy over exactly where Harris stood on some of these positions.\n\nFor example, when she was asked during this period whether she agreed with calls to abolish ICE she said that it was necessary to \"critically reexamine ICE\" and added, \"we need to probably even think about starting from scratch.\"\n\nTeam Harris counters that her record as a former prosecutor is a big asset in the battle to define her, helping to cast her as willing to stand up to powerful interests.\n\nShe also appears likely to position herself in a more centrist way than she did during the 2020 primary. For example, her campaign revealed to The Hill late last week that she no longer supports a ban on fracking.\n\nBut the jabs from the Trump campaign are going to keep coming.\n\nOn Monday, the Trump campaign posted a comment from an old interview in which Harris said, \"Yeah, I am radical. I do believe that we need to get radical about what we are doing and take it seriously.\"\n\nCan she win over voters angry about Israel's assault on Gaza?\n\nThere is deep discontent among the Democratic voter base over Biden's strong support for Israel in its war on Gaza.\n\nA Gallup poll last month showed just 23 percent of Democrats approving of the military action Israel has taken in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's joint address to Congress last week was boycotted by more than 100 Democratic representatives and senators.\n\nBiden's stance on Israel and Gaza is especially electorally dangerous in Michigan, a key swing state that has the highest concentration of Arab Americans in the nation.\n\nHarris sounded a notable change in tone after she met Netanyahu, separately from Biden, late last week.\n\nAlthough she affirmed her \"unwavering commitment\" to Israel and its security, Harris also described what had happened in Gaza as \"devastating\" and lamented \"the death of far too many innocent civilians.\"\n\n\"We cannot allow ourselves to be numb to the suffering, and I will not be silent,\" Harris added.\n\nShe will still have a needle to thread, however. Voters sympathetic to the Palestinians want to see an actual shift in policy while pro-Israel voters will be very sensitive to any slackening of support.\n\nCan she win the key battlegrounds?\n\nFor all the euphoria in Democratic ranks about Harris, Trump remains the favorite in November's election, especially if the polling is to be believed.\n\nHarris backers note that the polling since Biden stepped aside has been fairly sparse and that it has moved in her direction.\n\nBut she has significant ground to make up, especially in the battlegrounds of Arizona, Georgia and Nevada. In the polling averages maintained by The Hill and Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ), Trump leads in these states by about 6 points, 4 points and 9 points respectively.\n\nHarris will head to Georgia on Tuesday. It is plausible that her potential to be the first Black female president could help her significantly in a state where roughly 1-in-3 voters are Black.\n\nHarris is down by smaller margins in the three \"blue wall\" states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nThe Harris campaign believe she has significant upside with as-yet undecided voters. But there's no mistaking it is a tough road ahead.\n\nCan she differentiate herself from Biden?\n\nHarris is in an inherently tough spot in one respect. She wears two hats, as a candidate in November and as the incumbent vice president to a president with mediocre approval ratings.\n\nA challenge in the months between now and Election Day will be how to differentiate herself from Biden -- if she wants to -- without appearing outright disloyal.\n\nThere are elements of the Biden record that Harris will want to associate herself with, including increased infrastructure spending, a measure of student debt relief and concrete achievements such as capping the cost of insulin at $35 per month for millions of seniors.\n\nBut other elements of the Biden record -- notably immigration and the unhealed political scar created by 2022's inflation spike -- are far more problematic.\n\nIn the months ahead, Harris will have to outline a distinct vision for the future without appearing too harsh toward the man in the White House.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Harris 2024 Polls: Harris Leads Trump By 1 Point In Latest Survey", "body": "Vice President Kamala Harris has cut into former President Donald Trump's advantage over President Joe Biden in the week since Biden dropped out of the race, according to polls -- with the latest survey showing Harris leading Trump in a hypothetical matchup.\n\nThe New York Times/Siena poll found voters are more tuned into the race in the aftermath of the June 27 Biden-Trump debate. Some 64% percent of respondents now say they're paying a lot of attention to the contest, compared to 48% prior to the debate.\n\nTrump leads Harris by five or fewer points in four of five battleground states, according to an Emerson College survey released Thursday that found them tied in Wisconsin. Harris performs better than Biden in all five states: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Georgia, in addition to Wisconsin.\n\nDemocrats are far more enthusiastic about Harris than they were about Biden, the Times/Siena survey found, with nearly 80% of voters who lean Democrat saying they would like Harris to be the nominee, compared to 48% of Democrats who said the same about Biden three weeks ago. In a stark contrast with sentiment surrounding Biden's mental fitness, 56% of voters polled by Reuters/Ipsos said Harris was \"mentally sharp and able to deal with challenges,\" compared to 49% who said the same about Trump and 22% for Biden. A 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll found 87% of Americans agreed with Biden's decision to end his campaign, and more Americans think the decision will help the Democratic Party (45%) than the Republican Party (29%). In addition to showing Trump up by one point over Harris, the 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll found 87% of Americans agreed with Biden's decision to end his campaign, and more Americans think the decision will help the Democratic Party (45%) than the Republican Party (29%). The 19th News survey also showed Americans are split on whether Harris' gender and race will help or hurt her: 31% think being a woman will help her, compared to 33% who think it will hurt her and 34% who see no impact. Respondents were more optimistic that Harris being Black and Indian American will benefit her, with 32% seeing it as helpful compared to 24% seeing it as harmful -- though 41% expected it to have no impact.\n\n1.9. That's how many points Trump leads Harris by in Real Clear Politics' polling average. Trump led Biden by 3.1 points when Biden dropped out of the race, a 1.6-point increase from June 27, the day of the debate, according to Real Clear Politics' polling average.\n\nTrump campaign pollster Tony Fabrizio predicted a \"short term\" bump in polls for Harris in the coming weeks as her entrance into the race is expected to re-energize Democrats, referring to the anticipated boost as a \"Harris Honeymoon,\" in a memo released shortly after the Reuters/Ipsos poll was made public.\n\nBiden dropped out of the race on July 21 after resisting growing calls from within his own party to end his re-election bid in the wake of the June 27 debate. Biden immediately endorsed Harris and she announced plans to seek the nomination. The party has quickly coalesced around her, with all Democratic governors and the majority of Democrats in Congress backing her. She has effectively clinched the Democratic nomination as more than half of all delegates have announced plans to formally vote to nominate her -- something the party is expected to do in the first week of August.\n\nTrump's Lead Over Biden And Harris Jumped After RNC, HarrisX/Forbes Poll Finds (Forbes)", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emerson College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsos", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ipsos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealClearPolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RealClearPolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Americans", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Americans"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66a0023f79933504cab0fd65/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773409", "eventUri": "eng-9773409", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 356, "textEnd": 363, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-21", "textStart": 2847, "textEnd": 2854}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

The fundraiser took place on Saturday in Golden Valley, Minnesota.\n\nOn July 21, Harris became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee after Biden announced he was leaving the race and endorsed her as his replacement. In the days that followed, Harris swiftly gained support from leading figures in the Democratic Party and now has enough declared Democratic National Convention delegates to be confirmed as her party's 2024 nominee.\n\nSpeaking at the fundraiser, Vance said, \"All of us were hit with a little bit of a political sucker punch.\"\n\n\"The bad news is that Kamala Harris does not have the same baggage as Joe Biden, because whatever we might say, Kamala Harris is a lot younger. And Kamala Harris is obviously not struggling in the same ways that Joe Biden did,\" he added.\n\nNewsweek contacted Vance and a spokesperson for Harris for comment by email outside usual office hours.\n\nVance's private remarks contrasted with what he told reporters publicly on July 22, the day after Biden announced his withdrawal.\n\n\"I don't think the political calculus changes at all,\" Vance said at the time. \"We were running against Joe Biden's open border, Kamala Harris's open border. Kamala Harris supported the green new scam. Kamala Harris, frankly, covered Joe Biden even though it was obvious he was mentally incompetent for a very long time.\"\n\nDuring an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham that aired on Monday, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said Harris was a \"worse\" nominee for the White House than Biden.\n\n\"I think she's a worse candidate than him,\" the former president said. \"She's far more radical left. She's younger -- she's 60 years old. I didn't realize she was 60. I thought she was a little younger.\"\n\nA recent Morning Consult survey of 11,538 registered voters found that 50 percent of respondents had a favorable view of Harris against 46 percent who had an unfavorable perception. The pollster said the 4-point net favorability was a \"higher rating than Biden or Trump have posted all [election] cycle.\"\n\nThe result was a stark improvement on a Morning Consult poll conducted a week ago, which found 43 percent of voters viewed Harris favorably, against 51 percent who had an unfavorable view.\n\nDuring a Fox News interview broadcast on Friday, Trump defended Vance after comments from 2021 reemerged in which the senator described members of the Democratic Party as \"childless cat ladies.\"\n\nTrump said: \"He's not against anything. He loves family. It's very important to him.\"\n\nHe added: \"He grew up in a very interesting family situation, and he feels family is good.

Some Democrats now see Georgia, which Democrats barely won in a hard-fought battle in 2020, as a possible victory again in 2024.\n\nHarris will hold a political event in Atlanta at 7:00 p.m. ET (2300 GMT), the White House said, without providing more details. Megan Thee Stallion will join Harris in Atlanta, Billboard and Rolling Stone reported, citing a source.\n\nSen. Jon Ossoff, R-Ga., told MSNBC over the weekend that Harris' entry into the race \"has put Georgia in play\" for Democrats and predicted she will win.\n\nSwing states like Georgia are fiercely contested because they can lean either to Republicans or Democrats and play a decisive role in presidential elections.\n\nFiveThirtyEight, the poll aggregation site, shows Republican Donald Trump leading Harris by between one and 5 percentage points in surveys taken after Harris became the likely Democrat candidate.\n\nPresident Joe Biden ended his reelection bid July 22 and endorsed Harris for the Nov. 5 vote against Trump. Since then, Harris's election campaign has raised $200 million, signed up 170,000 new volunteers and she has significantly outperformed Biden in recent polling among young people, Black voters and Hispanic voters.\n\nA New York Times/Siena College national poll published Thursday found Harris has narrowed a sizable Trump lead; Trump had a two percentage point lead in a Wall Street Journal poll published on Friday. A Reuters/Ipsos poll published July 23 showed a two point lead for Harris.\n\nBiden's campaign saw a narrowing path to victory with the \"Sun Belt states,\" including Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, unlikely wins. Georgia backed Biden by 0.2 percentage points, just under 12,000 votes in 2020, and Trump by around 5 percentage points in 2016.\n\nAndy Beshear, the twice-elected Democrat governor of deep-red Kentucky, visited Georgia over the weekend to campaign for Harris in the Republican stronghold of Forsyth County.\n\nThe Harris campaign is vetting him along with Sen. Mark Kelly, R-Ariz., and Govs. Josh Shapiro, D-Pa., and Tim Walz, D-Minn., as possible vice presidential candidates. A decision is expected by Aug. 7.\n\nHarris is leaning into her resume as a former district attorney and California attorney general, seeking to draw a contrast with Trump who is the first former president to be convicted of felony crimes.\n\nTrump and 14 co-defendants are accused of racketeering and other charges for their role in attempting to overturn Biden's narrow victory in Georgia.",

In several polls, Harris has performed at least somewhat better than Biden did against Trump before the incumbent stepped aside. But election forecasts remain offline while analysts recalibrate their models for a new match-up, meaning time is needed to better understand what these numbers signify for November.\n\nScott Tranter, the director of data science for Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ), said he could make an argument that either Trump or Harris is in the preferable position in the race, underscoring how up in the air the race is.\n\n\"I could probably give you one or two good points, case for either of them, and that's the mark of a true 50-50 race,\" he said.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to Biden's calamitous debate with Trump just over a month ago, the general trend for polls had been the two candidates locked in a tight match-up nationally, with Trump arguably ahead slightly. He had a clearer advantage across the roughly half-dozen battleground states that will likely decide the winner of the election.\n\nThat began to shift somewhat after the debate, with Trump taking more of a lead in national and state polling. Some polls of more traditionally liberal-leaning states, like New Hampshire and Maine, also started showing Biden's lead over Trump decreasing, giving Republicans hope that they could be in play and expand their map.\n\nTrump's lead in national polling especially grew as calls mounted both publicly and privately within the Democratic Party for Biden to step aside as the nominee. The GOP nominee led in the national polling average from Decision Desk HQ and The Hill by 3.3 points on July 21, the day that Biden announced he would end his reelection bid.\n\nTrump had not previously enjoyed a lead that large in the average during the race.\n\nAfter Biden dropped out, the election forecast models went dark. Trump leads Harris in the DDHQ national polling average by 2 points, but this includes relatively few polls released since last Sunday.\n\nDemocratic rallying around Harris as the likely nominee has been swift over the past week, starting with Biden's prompt endorsement of her shortly after announcing the end of his run. And that has seemed to be reflected in some of the polls that have come out over the past week showing greater support for the Democratic candidate.\n\nOne of the first national polls to be released after Harris threw her hat in the ring showed her ahead of Trump nationwide. She led by 2 points in a Reuters/Ipsos poll, which was within the margin of error. The same poll taken one week prior had Trump up on Biden by 2 and tied with Harris.\n\nJust as notable, Harris led by 4 points in a three-way race including independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In many instances when Biden had led Trump in a head-to-head match-up, the former president's position relative to Biden improved when respondents could choose among additional candidates.\n\nA majority of respondents said Harris is \"mentally sharp and able to deal with challenges,\" 7 points higher than the percentage that said the same about Trump. Meanwhile, only a fifth said the same about Biden.\n\nA poll released Thursday from The New York Times and Siena College, which FiveThirtyEight ranked as the most trustworthy pollster, gave Trump a 1-point lead, 48 percent support to 47 percent, among likely voters. The lead ticks up to 2 points among registered voters. Both are much narrower than the 6-point lead among likely voters and 9-point lead among registered voters that Trump had in the last poll taken before Biden dropped out.\n\nSimilarly, an NPR/PBS News/Marist poll found Trump and Harris almost exactly even, with Trump up 1.\n\nAs some of these polls started coming out, Trump's pollster issued a memo predicting a \"Harris Honeymoon\" phase that would see her poll numbers rise as she receives widespread media coverage. But he said the phase will be temporary and not change the \"fundamentals\" of the race.\n\nTranter agreed that Harris is in a \"honeymoon phase,\" but noted that what could be key is how long the phase lasts. He said even if it lasts just 60 days, early voting will have started already. He said she has the momentum, which can be reversed, but it could still impact the results.\n\nSurveys of the key battleground states have also shown Harris performing competitively with Trump, in certain cases improving on Biden's numbers in states that were getting a bit further away from his reach.\n\nA survey from Emerson College Polling and The Hill released last week showed Trump leading Harris in most of the key states, but within the margin of error in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia, the last of which Biden had been regularly trailing Trump in throughout the campaign. Trump and Harris were tied in Wisconsin, and he led by 5 points in Arizona.\n\nAcross the board, these numbers are a significant improvement for Democrats compared to a similar survey from earlier this month with Biden. Harris outperformed Biden by 3 points in Michigan and Pennsylvania, 4 points in Arizona and Wisconsin and 5 points in Georgia.\n\nFox News polls of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin -- three states that gave Trump the presidency in 2016 before flipping back to Biden in 2020 -- found the race similarly competitive. Trump was up 1 point in Wisconsin and tied with Harris in Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nTranter pointed to polling of bluer states like Virginia and Minnesota \"snapping back\" toward Harris at least initially after some had shown Trump possibly making inroads in them against Biden.\n\n\"At the national level, we have Harris is still trailing Trump, but at a much smaller margin than Biden was trailing Trump,\" he said. \"So that indicates that we should see that trend continue down at the individual battleground states.\"\n\nAt the same time the race has tightened, both Harris and Trump have experienced boosts in their popularity.\n\nTrump's favorability rating from the DDHQ and The Hill average reached 45 percent in the aftermath of the assassination attempt on him at his Pennsylvania rally this month, while his unfavorable rating has fallen from 57 percent to 51 percent.\n\nHarris's rating rose particularly as calls for Biden to step aside mounted, reaching 44 percent in the polling average. The polling of the past week has observed this increase, and 7 in 10 Democratic respondents in the Times/Siena poll said they want the party to consolidate around Harris.\n\nTranter said Harris's favorability numbers are better than Biden's but still not much ahead of Trump. Both are slightly underwater with their favorability but within range of each other.\n\nStill, all of these numbers were taken before the Trump-Harris race could fully get underway. Harris is just starting to ramp up her campaign with rallies and ads hitting the airwaves, and Republicans are still honing their attacks on her after previously having run against a different candidate.\n\nHarris campaigning could raise her numbers further, or the attacks could cause them to drop.\n\n\"There's quite a few more innings left in this campaign cycle for these numbers to move either up or down, but I would say it's equal chance they go up as they go down,\" Tranter said.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Kamala Harris will campaign there Tuesday", "body": "November ballot will ask Miami-Dade voters if they want countywide Wi-Fi\n\nLittle more than a week ago, Georgia appeared to be slipping out of the Democrats' reach: President Joe Biden's campaign pledged to concentrate more on holding the Midwestern \"blue wall\" states and indicated they might be willing to forsake \"Sun Belt\" battlegrounds.\n\nBut now that Biden has bowed out of the race and Vice President Kamala Harris is the likely nominee, Democrats say they have new hope for the state. They're betting that a fresh burst of energy and a surge in fundraising has helped make Georgia -- the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020 -- a toss-up again.\n\nHarris is planning to make a show of political force with a rally in Atlanta at 7 p.m. ET on Tuesday, the latest example of just how much the race against Republican Donald Trump has shifted since Biden abandoned his re-election bid. She will be appearing in the same city where Biden's dismal performance in a debate against Trump on June 27 sparked a Democratic revolt that ultimately ended his campaign.\n\nHarris is hoping a large rally, featuring a performance by hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion, will help affirm her campaign's momentum. The campaign argues that Harris' appeal with young people, working-age women and non-white voters has scrambled the dynamics in Georgia and other states that are demographically similar, from North Carolina to Nevada and Arizona.\n\n\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chair Nikema Williams, a Congresswoman from Atlanta. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"\n\nBut she also argued that the vice president's place atop the ticket \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" and described them as \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" in places like Georgia.\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nBut they concede that the landscape suddenly looks much closer to 2020 -- when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points -- than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt.\n\n\"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"\n\nRobinson said Harris still has plenty of liabilities, including the progressive positions she took in her failed 2020 Primary campaign and her various rhetorical stumbles. But he said Harris so far in this campaign has been \"in command,\" and if that continues \"we have a new ballgame and she will be competitive in Georgia.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt did not give similar ground. She dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the Vice President would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\"\n\nThe former President's campaign announced Tuesday, hours ahead of Harris' rally, that he would travel to Atlanta on Saturday for a rally in the same venue where Harris will appear on the Georgia State University campus.\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nDemocrats are betting that a combination of high turnout among traditional, core Democratic constituencies, as well as a strong showing in the suburbs and small pickups elsewhere can be enough for Harris to carry Georgia. That approach was on display at the weekend office openings.\n\nOn Saturday, the venue was East Point, a majority Black municipality and Democratic stronghold south of Atlanta. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat, was the featured guest, telling a crowd of mostly Black women that they were the key to victory -- \"the people who are really going to save the country.\"\n\nA day later, it was Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, among several contenders Harris is considering for her running mate, campaigning in Forsyth County. The area is historically very conservative, though Democrats have narrowed the GOP margins in recent cycles.\n\n\"Every county matters,\" Beshear said, holding out his ability to win two Governor's races in Kentucky despite Trump's domination of the state in Presidential Elections.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said in a recent interview that the best GOP campaigns can win comfortably in Georgia but bad efforts -- combined with strong Democratic campaigns -- lose. Kemp, for example, won re-election by 7.5 percentage points in 2022 over national Democratic star Stacey Abrams. Yet in the same election cycle, Georgians re-elected Democratic U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock over his Republican challenger Herschel Walker, who was endorsed by Trump.\n\nIn recent elections, Democrats have held wide advantages in the core of metro Atlanta, where Jayapal spoke. The party also performed well in Columbus and Savannah, as well as some rural, majority-Black counties. But Republicans dominated in other rural areas and small towns and cities -- - where Trump has held multiple rallies in recent years.\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs, like those where Beshear campaigned on Sunday, offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a White suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist -- I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" Smith said.\n\n___\n\nRepublished with permission of The Associated Press.", "source": {"uri": "floridapolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections.

Some Democrats now see Georgia, which Democrats barely won in a hard-fought battle in 2020, as a possible victory again in 2024.\n\nHarris will hold a political event in Atlanta at 7:00 p.m. EDT (2300 GMT), the White House said, without providing more details. Megan Thee Stallion will join Harris in Atlanta, Billboard, opens new tab and Rolling Stone reported, citing a source.\n\nGeorgia Senator Jon Ossoff said on MSNBC over the weekend that Harris' entry into the race \"has put Georgia in play\" for Democrats and predicted she will win.\n\nSwing states like Georgia are fiercely contested because they can lean either to Republicans or Democrats and play a decisive role in presidential elections.\n\nFiveThirtyEight, the poll aggregation site, shows Republican Donald Trump leading Harris by between one and five percentage points in surveys taken after Harris became the likely Democratic candidate.\n\nPresident Joe Biden ended his reelection bid on July 22 and endorsed Harris for the Nov. 5 vote against Trump. Since then, Harris's election campaign has raised $200 million, signed up 170,000 new volunteers and she has significantly outperformed Biden in recent polling among young people, Black voters and Hispanic voters.\n\nA New York Times/Siena College national poll published Thursday found Harris has narrowed a sizable Trump lead; Trump had a two percentage point lead in a Wall Street Journal poll published on Friday. A Reuters/Ipsos poll published July 23 showed a two point lead for Harris.\n\nBiden's campaign saw a narrowing path to victory with the \"Sun Belt states,\" including Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, unlikely wins. Georgia backed Biden by 0.2 percentage points, just under 12,000 votes in 2020, and Trump by around 5 percentage points in 2016.\n\nAndy Beshear, the twice-elected Democratic governor of deep-red Kentucky, visited Georgia over the weekend to campaign for Harris in the Republican stronghold of Forsyth County.\n\nThe Harris campaign is vetting him along with Sen.

While many voters were similarly concerned about Trump's readiness, polls suggested more Americans questioned Biden.\n\nNow, the 78-year-old Trump is running against a 59-year-old candidate. And that turns the age question more on him.\n\nThe Democrats now have enthusiasm and more funding\n\nHarris has generated massive enthusiasm and money that Biden could not generate. Her supporters are organizing Zoom calls and raising millions of dollars at a time, the latest being a White Dudes for Harris call that generated $3.7 million for her campaign.\n\nThe question is how does she turn that into votes. Can Democrats leverage all of that enthusiasm when they're organizing efforts and turning out voters?\n\nTrump has to find new arguments\n\nHarris comes into the campaign relatively fresh. Trump and his allies are trying to saddle her with the liabilities of the Biden administration but also run against her as a distinct candidate.\n\nTrump on Monday launched a 30-second advertisement that targets Harris' work on migration issues, dubbing her the \"border czar\" and blaming her for illegal crossings into the United States. After displaying headlines about crime and drugs, the video brands Harris as \"Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal.\"\n\nHarris has to pave her own path\n\nThe vice president needs to show what kind of candidate she could be. Biden was pitching ideas for a second term as president but also asking to be rewarded for his administration's accomplishments.\n\nHarris, as his second in command, inherits some of his liabilities, particularly on inflation and the border. She will also get to take credit for the administration's accomplishments, but she has to spin it forward and set her own policy priorities.\n\nHer first campaign for the presidency ended before she could reach the Iowa caucuses. The early promise of her 2020 presidential campaign met a more complicated reality as she spent the next 10 months struggling to break through a crowded field of candidates and churning through staff and cash.\n\nThe Electoral College math has shifted\n\nBiden's struggles had made many Democrats fear that their electoral map was reduced to Rust Belt states that Trump won in 2016 and Biden flipped in 2020 -- Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nStrategists on both sides believed that Georgia and Arizona, Sun Belt states that Biden also flipped, were moving away from the Democratic president.\n\nNow, with Harris in the race, packed Zoom gatherings and interviews with supporters are signs of rekindled enthusiasm among key Democratic voting blocs: younger voters, voters of color and Black women. That could make Democrats more confident that they're facing a competitive Electoral College map and perhaps changes the Trump team's assumptions on states it could flip.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The campaign is also boasting 170,000 new volunteers who have signed up to back Harris. This past weekend to commemorate the 100-day mark from November's election, the campaign hosted 2,300 events across the battleground states with more than 29,000 volunteers participating.\n\nHarris -- who will be introduced by a graduate of Morehouse College, a historically Black university -- will be joined by Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock as well as former Rep. Stacey Abrams along with several other special guests. One of those special guests will rapper Megan Thee Stallion, who is expected to give a special performance at the rally, a source confirmed to ABC News.\n\nHarris' remarks at the rally will follow a meeting with local reproductive rights leaders and activists.\n\nGeorgia played a crucial role in Biden's 2020 victory, going blue for the first time since 1992 due, in significant part, to organizing efforts from Abrams, who spent years spearheading get-out-the-vote efforts in Black communities. Harris' campaign will be looking to replicate success in Georgia by shoring up support among Black voters, a key group of voters that both Harris and former President Donald Trump will work to connect with as the November election approaches.\n\nBiden only won the state by some 12,000 votes in 2020, a win heavily contested by Trump, who is currently in the midst of an election interference case in the state. Trump hasn't held a campaign event in Georgia since his debate with Biden in June.\n\nKanninen said although the Harris campaign has achieved an impressive fundraising haul in a short amount of time, they are not getting \"comfortable.\"\n\n\"I continue to be very clear with our partners and with our own staff. This campaign will not get comfortable. We jumped in with just 100 days ago against an opponent who has shown he's willing to do anything to win,\" said Kannien. \"This is going to be an incredibly close race just like it was in 2020. But just like four years ago, we are going to win this thing.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign told reporters they expect the state to be just as \"competitive\" this election, claiming that their infrastructure in the state gives them an advantage.\n\n\"We expect it to be as close as competitive this year,\" said Communications Director Michael Tyler. \"That's why we have the team and the operation in place to make sure that we can turn out every single Harris voter in the state of Georgia.\"\n\nAccording to the campaign, they have more than 170 coordinated staff and 24 offices across the state with three of those opening this past weekend. The Trump campaign only recently opened its first campaign office in the state in June.\n\n\"We're making these investments across the entire map because the data is clear.

While many voters were similarly concerned about Trump's readiness, polls suggested more Americans questioned Biden.\n\nNow, the 78-year-old Trump is running against a 59-year-old candidate. And that turns the age question more on him.\n\nThe Democrats now have enthusiasm and more funding\n\nHarris has generated massive enthusiasm and money that Biden could not generate. Her supporters are organizing Zoom calls and raising millions of dollars at a time, the latest being a White Dudes for Harris call that generated $3.7 million for her campaign.\n\nThe question is how does she turn that into votes. Can Democrats leverage all of that enthusiasm when they're organizing efforts and turning out voters?\n\nTrump has to find new arguments\n\nHarris comes into the campaign relatively fresh. Trump and his allies are trying to saddle her with the liabilities of the Biden administration but also run against her as a distinct candidate.\n\nTrump on Monday launched a 30-second advertisement that targets Harris' work on migration issues, dubbing her the \"border czar\" and blaming her for illegal crossings into the United States. After displaying headlines about crime and drugs, the video brands Harris as \"Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal.\"\n\nHarris has to pave her own path\n\nThe vice president needs to show what kind of candidate she could be. Biden was pitching ideas for a second term as president but also asking to be rewarded for his administration's accomplishments.\n\nHarris, as his second in command, inherits some of his liabilities, particularly on inflation and the border. She will also get to take credit for the administration's accomplishments, but she has to spin it forward and set her own policy priorities.\n\nHer first campaign for the presidency ended before she could reach the Iowa caucuses. The early promise of her 2020 presidential campaign met a more complicated reality as she spent the next 10 months struggling to break through a crowded field of candidates and churning through staff and cash.\n\nThe Electoral College math has shifted\n\nBiden's struggles had made many Democrats fear that their electoral map was reduced to Rust Belt states that Trump won in 2016 and Biden flipped in 2020 -- Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nStrategists on both sides believed that Georgia and Arizona, Sun Belt states that Biden also flipped, were moving away from the Democratic president.\n\nNow, with Harris in the race, packed Zoom gatherings and interviews with supporters are signs of rekindled enthusiasm among key Democratic voting blocs: younger voters, voters of color and Black women. That could make Democrats more confident that they're facing a competitive Electoral College map and perhaps changes the Trump team's assumptions on states it could flip.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP's

(Kyle Mazza/Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nIt's hard to believe that it's been only a week. I've been looking for the word to describe the feeling of the change that happened since Joe Biden suspended his campaign in favor of Kamala Harris. I found it today: amazement. You can't look at the transformation of the Democratic Party and the presidential campaign in any other way than amazement.\n\nThere are stories being written now about how it happened, most recently by Michael Scherer and Tyler Pager in the Washington Post, \"How Kamala Harris took control of the Democratic Party,\" recounting the details, one by one, hour by hour. Not seemingly hour by hour, but in real time. It happened that way, and that fast - the phone calls, the social media posts, the flood of support by state party leaders, the flood of money that poured in without any serious push or organized solicitation.\n\nThe Post story describes how Biden's decision was posted to his social media account. Biden had decided he was going to suspend his campaign on Saturday night, and \"slept on it,\" according to the Post. He called Vice President Harris early Sunday morning. The story doesn't lay out in steps what Harris did or exactly whom she called in what order, but in a matter of hours, campaign and White House staff had arrived at the vice president's house at the Naval Observatory and began making preparations. What the campaign called \"the letter\" went out on social media at 1:45 p.m. and then, as the Post describes it, \"They gave Biden some time alone in the world, but not much. Twenty-seven minutes after that, Biden endorsed Harris on the same account.\"\n\nThat's fast. So is what happened afterwards: Harris made 100 calls to party leaders on Sunday; the campaign had to flip 30 social media accounts from saying \"Biden\" to \"Harris.\" The Post names all the campaign and White House officials who sprang into action. Harris' communications director was adamant that the veep appear on television on Monday, so preparations had to be made for that. The Post reported that \"for years,\" the site KamalaHarris.com had simply redirected to Biden's website. That had to be changed, but it could only be done by someone with power over that domain, so there was a scramble at the Democratic National Committee to find that person and get the change done.\n\nAnd we're still talking about things that happened on Sunday.\n\nWithin hours, all 50 state Democratic Party chairs had endorsed Harris. Part of what was happening was a concerted effort close the door on anyone who was thinking of challenging her at the Democratic National Convention in late August, of course, but by Sunday night, that concern had been put to bed -- along with exhausted campaign staff and Harris herself.\n\nWhat happened after that is by now well known: the Zoom call by an independent group of 44,000 Black women that raised $1.4 million in a matter of three hours. Other groups began to form and have Zoom calls of their own - \"Moms Demand Action\" was one, and \"White Dudes for Harris\" was another. The money flooded in, heading toward the $200 million that would be raised by the end of the week.\n\nAll the behind-the-scenes stories of what went on with party professionals are fascinating, especially when you consider that the party had not made a single public move in any direction other than President Biden until Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe Democratic Party may be headquartered in Washington, but the people who vote for Democrats live in every county of the 50 states that vote in presidential elections. It was out there that the real earthquake shook the ground. Looking back over the last week, it was as if the entire party not only exhaled at once but began dancing in the streets. Social media accounts blew up. There was relief that the Dark Three Weeks following the Biden-Trump debate were over, replaced immediately by enthusiasm that the party had Harris standing in the door and ready to go.\n\nThere was something special at work in the transfer that took place from Biden to Harris as the party's nominee. Harris had spent four years in Biden's shadow, as every vice president must, especially while the president in question is in his first term with a re-election campaign on the horizon. In fact, Harris came under withering criticism for appearing to play such a quiet second fiddle to Biden. She was called \"low energy,\" her speaking style was criticized and in Republican corners ridiculed.\n\nBut when you look back at the last four years, Harris did what any vice president is required to do in any administration: She made the speeches to various groups and gatherings around the country; she attended the requisite meetings; she made the overseas trips that the White House determined were not presidential enough to demand Biden's presence of President Biden. She was even criticized for some of the trips she made on behalf of the president, most recently when she attended the Munich Security Conference along with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan. Harris was said to have taken a back seat while the two men in the room came away with the headlines about the expansion of NATO and plans by EU nations to support Ukraine.\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nIn retrospect, however, the \"back seat\" Kamala Harris took as vice president has served her well after Biden's sudden departure as a presidential candidate. Harris' reputation as a \"low energy\" vice president looks wholly different when you consider that most energy in politics is expressed as ambition. So, when Biden stepped aside and Harris stepped up, she couldn't be taken to task for having been too ambitious a vice president who was eager to push him out of the way. She wasn't.\n\nWhat she was, was ready, and that truth came across in the speed and efficiency with which, in the words of the Washington Post, she \"took control of the Democratic Party.\" Sure, the party was ready for someone to take control after the Dark Days of Biden's apparent decline after the Trump debate. That Harris was as prepared as she has shown herself to be surprised a lot of people, and positively delighted Democrats who were ready for a change.\n\nEnergy and excitement are where the power is in politics. Period. Stop. Go no further. It's just plain true. And we got proof of it this week as the Democratic Party was swept up in a tsunami not only of support for Harris, but of people expressing their enthusiasm in phone calls, emails, text messages - all the ways that energy is measured in today's politics.\n\nI'll give you just one example. I had coffee with the mayor of my small town in northeast Pennsylvania, Milford, yesterday. He told me that on Saturday, he had mistakenly taken a call from an unknown number he saw on his cell phone, thinking it was probably a solicitation for money from the Democrats. Instead, it was the Harris campaign coordinator for the Pennsylvania counties east of Scranton. He was calling to see if there was anything he could do to help the Harris campaign effort in Milford and Pike County. Mayor Sean Strub told me that in all the years he has spent in Democratic politics, he had never gotten a call like it, from someone who wasn't just asking for money, but was reaching out to see if there was any way that he could help. Strub agreed to host a pizza dinner for county Democratic leaders and the Harris campaign folks in this region.\n\nThat's the kind of stuff that's been happening behind the scenes of what's going on in Washington. Energy and enthusiasm like you wouldn't believe is focused on the campaign to elect Kamala Harris as our next president. That's how elections are won.", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type":

How can they attack likely Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris after spending years focusing the strategy on Biden?\n\nWhile most of the strategic foundation should stay the same, given Harris' role in the Biden administration, there are new opportunities against the vice president and a few pitfalls that Republicans would be wise to avoid but have already stepped in.\n\nWhile attacking politicians personally has become a staple of American politics, the Republican Party should tread carefully. Certain attacks, which include how Harris laughs, come off as childish and ignore the real issues that matter to Americans, which Harris and the Democrats are weak on.\n\nIf Republicans believe we have a better platform for Americans, this is an opportunity to show it.\n\nRepublican Party has many policy opportunities to attack Harris\n\nThe through line of the GOP strategy against Harris should be holding her accountable for the Biden administration's record that has given the Republicans any momentum they had before he dropped out. Highlighting that Harris has already been in the White House under an extremely unpopular administration should be the center of their attacks.\n\nHammering Harris on the economy, immigration and other issues Donald Trump holds more favorability on should be the GOP focus. Most Americans disapproved of Biden. Harris, as his vice president, was part of that disapproval.\n\nIn this sense, the GOP attack plan should remain the same. Simply asking Americans if they are better off now than they were under the Trump administration is a powerful question.\n\nHarris VP pick? Republicans, pay attention to who Harris picks for VP. One of them should scare us.\n\nAdditionally, Harris has no shortage of personal weak points.\n\nWhen she ran for president in 2020, then-Sen. Harris of California attempted to differentiate herself by leaning into progressive policy. She said she opposed hydraulic fracturing to extract oil and gas, would consider abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, opposed hiring more law enforcement officers and supported mandatory buyback programs for certain firearms.\n\nThe immigration stances are particularly damning for Harris, given the record high level of illegal crossing attempts our country faced last year and her critical role in addressing the root causes of migration for Biden.\n\nHowever, these radical stances can and should be used as a preview of what a Harris administration could bring. If she walks these stances back, as she has when it comes to her position on fracking, then the GOP should highlight her disingenuous nature.\n\nThen there is the question of how much Harris was complicit in attempts to hide Biden's mental decline from voters. This is important for the election and for accountability.\n\nHarris was in the White House alongside Biden as it became clear he was not fit for office, and she certainly had insight into how fragile the president had become. The vice president consistently defended Biden's mental fitness against criticisms from the news media, despite what she must have known from her interactions with him. She had to have seen that Biden was not mentally fit for office.\n\nCongress should investigate Harris' role in covering up the truth. She will have a lot to answer for there.\n\nRepublican Party should avoid attacking Harris' characteristics\n\nDemocrats have been eager to label Republicans as sexist, racist, homophobic or any other -ism in the book for how they've responded to Harris. Republicans should deprive them of chances to do so by stopping some of the reaction that came immediately after Harris took over for Biden.\n\nGOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance quickly came under fire for referring to prominent Democrats as \"childless cat ladies.\" Harris, who has stepchildren, was one of the names he highlighted.\n\nThese sorts of remarks are not helpful to the Republican cause of winning in November and will not be popular among suburban female voters, an important group for former President Trump's chances at reelection. In fact, early polling shows Harris gaining ground that Biden had lost with women voters. Vance's comments will make that worse for Republicans.\n\nTrump GOP abandons pro-life activists: New Republican platform makes one thing clear. We've dropped the anti-abortion effort.\n\nOne misguided attack against her has been the charge that she is a \"DEI\" candidate due to Biden's promise in the 2020 election to pick a woman to be his vice president, as well as his focus on Black women throughout the search.\n\nRepublicans can call Harris unqualified without a framing that is off-putting to some moderates. Instead, highlighting the failed record of the Biden administration will force the vice president to either take credit for it or admit she had no control in the White House the past four years.\n\nAccording to news reports, the National Republican Senatorial Committee issued a memo last week that outlined attacks against Harris, including a section simply labeled \"weird,\" which included her laugh, her love of Venn diagrams and her enthusiasm for school buses. None of these attacks are actually productive, and I'm not sure why Republicans insist on including them in official memos.\n\nHarris has no shortage of policy decisions -both hers and Biden's - that leave her vulnerable to attack, and the GOP would be wise to stick to that.

Her task ahead is monumental.\n\nAt the same time, the full intensity of Republican candidate Donald Trump's attacks is yet to unfold in the most unpredictable election season in generations.\n\nHarris started off with a rousing speech at the White House to solidify the transition.\n\nAfter laying out her prosecutorial case against Trump, Harris cast the contest as \"two different versions of what we see as the future of our country.\"\n\nThe most significant moment happened when she notched the endorsement of her fellow Californian, former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose backdoor maneuvering was critical in ending Biden's stalled re-election bid.\n\nBy the day's evening, the vice president had been backed by well more than the 1,976 pledged delegates she'll need to win the nomination on the first ballot, according to CNN's delegate estimate.\n\nAnd after the freezing of donor cash also helped force Biden out of the race, Democratic wallets opened generously. Harris raked in more than US $ Dollar 100 million in the first two days, boasting more than 1.1 million unique donors - 62 % percent of them first-time contributors.\n\nThe vice president's swift consolidation of power has been impressive.\n\nHer multi-hour phone blitz to Democratic Party power players immediately after Biden bowed out hinted at an operation primed ahead of time but that was kept secret and didn't leak.\n\nThe operation strangled any hope of alternative candidates and the aspirations of some in the party for a lightning primary to find a new nominee who could argue that they had won a contested bid for the party banner.\n\nHarris must be wary\n\nHarris must sustain the sudden new momentum in a party that until Sunday believed it was heading to certain defeat as Democratic lawmaker after lawmaker deserted the president following his disastrous debate performance.\n\nThe pressure on Harris from Democrats is also immense, according to Collinson.\n\nThe vice president has shown signs of improving her political skills recently, but that was not her forte previously.\n\nThis year, party leaders and the party faithful are not just investing in her as the last barrier to a new era of unrestrained conservative rule that could obliterate the achievements of the Biden and Obama presidencies.\n\nAfter replacing Biden as the mascot of the campaign, Harris is now leading an effort that has as its foundation the very attempt to save democracy from Trump.\n\nTrump seemed momentarily thrown off by the swift shift in Democratic candidates after Biden recognized the unsustainable nature of his bid for a second term that would have ended when he is 86.\n\nBut very soon there were signs that Trump's political operation was readjusting to the new reality and sharpening its attacks against the vice president.\n\nTrump campaign managers cast her as the 'copilot\" of some of Biden's most \"egregious failures\".\n\nThey signaled that the vice president's singular lack of success in addressing the causes in Latin America of US southern border crossings would morph into a narrative that she's soft on illegal immigration.\n\n\"She's had a lower approval rating than Joe Biden. Harris is the least popular vice president in history - which is no surprise given her terrible record,\" the Trump campaign memo said.\n\n\"She makes just as much sense as Joe Biden. By that we mean, none at all.\"\n\nHarris Scores Early Success\n\nIn spite of the above poor and demeaning assessment, the Trump campaign has apparently fully - at the start -underestimated Harris.\n\nThe dramatic push by Harris for the Democratic nomination was the latest stunning twist of a presidential race that has defied convention as the oldest president in US history launched a re-election bid and then stepped back at a very late hour.\n\nThe Republican nominee is another unpopular old man who tried to crush US democracy to stay in power after losing the last election. He's also a convicted felon.\n\nIn spite of this, Trump was hailed at the Republican party convention as a strongman hero miraculously touched by divine providence following a failed assassination that, along with the debate and the elevation of Harris, represented three of the most momentous events in the history of modern White House campaigns within a four-week span (Collinson).\n\nBut something most important has undeniably shifted.\n\nSince months voters have told pollsters that they do not appreciate two old men as the presidential candidates, i.e. they would prefer a choice of candidate who is not named Biden or Trump.\n\nOnly the Democratic Party has now given voters that choice.\n\nThe pre-eminent question now is whether Harris, who has exhibited considerable political liabilities as vice president, has the skills, staying power and luck to take advantage.\n\nHarris did move swiftly to unify the party behind her, supported by the burning desire by key power brokers to avoid a divisive fight for the nomination at the Democratic convention next month in Chicago Governors, senators and Congressional and state delegations rushed to support her.\n\nThe quickening momentum reflects a party desperate to prevent a second Trump term.\n\nAs Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairman put it after 89 of the state's 95 delegates pledged support to Harris, there had been a \"flowering of unity\" after Biden stepped down.\n\nHarris on Foreign Policy Issues\n\nHundreds of former Democratic foreign policy leaders have backed Vice President Kamala Harris in her bid for the White House, despite her limited experience in matters of diplomacy (New York Times/NYT, Aug. 29).\n\nMs. Harris has played a narrow role in the Biden administration's shaping of US foreign policy.\n\nTrump's campaign has sought to paint her as inexperienced.\n\nNevertheless, she has key foreign policy positions.\n\nThe war in Gaza\n\nMs. Harris has been on the same page with President Biden regarding U.S. support for Israel.\n\nShe has reaffirmed the administration's position that Israel has a right to defend itself.\n\nHowever, she has struck a sharper tone about the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza.\n\n\"What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating,\" Ms. Harris said after a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Bejamin Netanyahu.\n\n\"The images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time - we cannot look away in the face of these tragedies,\" she said, adding, \"I will not be silent.\"\n\nIn March, she had called for an \"immediate cease-fire\" in Gaza and said the situation was a \"humanitarian catastrophe.\"\n\nPutin's war in Ukraine\n\nMs. Harris's complete support for Ukraine in the war against Russia represents a crucial moment for the vice president on the world stage and is in stark contrast to Trump's position.\n\nShe has accused Russia of \"crimes against humanity\" and said it must be held accountable for its \"barbaric\" actions.\n\nMs. Harris also warned China against providing Russia with support in its war efforts.\n\nMigration\n\nBiden had assigned Harris to address the root causes of migration in Central America, such as poverty, crime rates and corruption.\n\nSha has warned migrants hoping to reach the U.S. southern border: \"Do not come\".\n\nRepublicans have sought to blame her for the high numbers of migrant crossings, branding her the \"border czar\".\n\nShe recently endorsed a bipartisan border security proposal that was terminated by Republicans at Trump's express urging.\n\nThe deal would have closed the Mexico border if crossings hit a fixed number and would have funded more Border Patrol agents and asylum officers.\n\nIndo-Pacific Region\n\nDuring a speech in Singapore in 2021, Ms. Harris condemned China's maritime actions in the South China Sea.\n\nThese included intimidating the fishing fleets of other countries and building artificial islands on submerged reefs.\n\nDuring a speech aboard a U.S. Navy ship off the coast of Japan in 2022, Ms. Harris reiterated America's unofficial policy to back Taiwan.\n\n\"We will continue to support Taiwan's self-defence, consistent with our longstanding policy,\" she said.\n\nAccording to the NYT, a consistent picture of Harris in the international arena emerges: \"warm but steely on occasion; authoritative but personable.\"\n\nShe has represented the United States frequently during trips to Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas, and has met with more than 150 world leaders.\n\nShe has attended three Munich Security Conferences -- the foremost annual pow wow for top-level foreign policy officials from around the world to meet and set the defence agenda.\n\nIn recent months, she has also become more directly involved with global leaders on the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\nThe consensus among foreign officials and diplomats is that Harris has a firm grip on international affairs.\n\nShe was paid glowing praise by German chancellor Olaf Scholz recently: \"She is a competent and experienced politician who knows exactly what she is doing and has a very clear idea of her country's role, of developments in the world, and of the challenges we face.\"\n\n[We can make an intelligent guess of what he thinks of Trump!]\n\nShe has also been prepared to displease people to focus on issues she cares about.\n\nIn 2022 in South Korea, female leaders she met at the U.S. ambassador's residence were moved by her visit - and by her message.\n\n\"I was most impressed when she said that a society that helps its women fulfill their dreams and pursue their professional careers without discrimination is an advanced society,\" said Dr. Baik Hyun-wook, who at the time was the head of the Korean Medical Women's Association.\n\nState of the Race\n\nThe 2024 presidential election is now less than 100 days following a historic month of political shake-ups that upended the race.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is seeing a rise in favourability ratings with polls showing multiple paths to victory (CNN).\n\nTrump responded to Harris's momentum with a series of personal attacks: he referred to her as \"evil\", mocked her laugh and the pronunciation of her name, and said that \"the American\n\nThe vice president pushed back on her opponent's \"wild lies\" and goaded him about debating her. Trump and Vance have lately been characterized as \"weird\" by the Harris campaign.\n\nTrump selection of Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his running mate could be a major liability and is shaping the race.\n\nDemocrats and the nation are now closely watching Harris' vetting process for her own vice presidential nominee in the coming days and weeks.", "source": {"uri": "peoplesreview.com.np", "dataType": "news", "title": "People's Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Harris will campaign there Tuesday. - The Boston Globe", "body": "Harris is planning to make a show of political force with a rally in Atlanta on Tuesday night that will feature a performance by hip hop star Megan Thee Stallion, the latest example of just how much the race against Republican Donald Trump has shifted since Biden abandoned his reelection bid. She will be appearing in the same city where Biden's dismal performance in a debate against Trump on June 27 sparked a Democratic revolt that ultimately ended his campaign.\n\nHarris is hoping a large rally will help affirm her campaign's momentum. Her campaign argues that Harris' appeal with young people, working-age women and non-white voters have scrambled the dynamics in Georgia and other states that are demographically similar, from North Carolina to Nevada and Arizona.\n\n\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams, a congresswoman from Atlanta. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"\n\nIn a strategy memo released after the president left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who held the same role for Biden, reaffirmed the importance of winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a trio of industrial states that have formed the traditional Democratic blue wall.\n\nBut she also argued that the vice president's place atop the ticket \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" and described them as \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" in places like Georgia.\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nBut they concede that the landscape suddenly looks much closer to 2020 - when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points -- than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt.\n\n\"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"\n\nRobinson said Harris still has plenty of liabilities, including the progressive positions she took in her failed 2020 primary campaign and her various rhetorical stumbles. But he said Harris so far in this campaign has been \"in command,\" and if that continues \"we have a new ballgame and she will be competitive in Georgia.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt did not give similar ground. She dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nDemocrats are betting that a combination of high turnout among traditional, core Democratic constituencies, as well as a strong showing in the suburbs and small pickups elsewhere can be enough for Harris to carry Georgia. That approach was on display at the weekend office openings.\n\nOn Saturday, the venue was East Point, a majority Black municipality and Democratic stronghold south of Atlanta. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., was the featured guest, telling a crowd of mostly Black women that they were the key to victory -- \"the people who are really going to save the country.\"\n\nA day later, it was Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, among several contenders Harris is considering for her running mate, campaigning in Forsyth County. The area is historically very conservative, though Democrats have narrowed the GOP margins in recent cycles.\n\n\"Every county matters,\" Beshear said, holding out his ability to win two governor's races in Kentucky despite Trump's domination of the state in presidential elections.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said in a recent interview that the best GOP campaigns can win comfortably in Georgia but bad efforts -- combined with strong Democratic campaigns -- lose.\n\nDemocrats recently have held wide advantages in the core of metro Atlanta, where Jayapal spoke. The party also performed well in Columbus and Savannah, as well as some rural, majority-Black counties. But Republicans dominated in other rural areas and small towns and cities -- where Trump has held multiple rallies in recent years.\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs, like those where Beshear campaigned on Sunday, offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

advertising blitz on Tuesday, capitalizing on the momentum of a fledgling campaign against Republican rival Donald Trump with a one-minute spot titled \"Fearless.\"\n\nIt was Harris' first big ad buy since consolidating support for the Democratic nomination after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race on July 21 and endorsed her.\n\nIn addition to garnering the backing of big-money donors, Harris has sparked newfound energy among groups such as young voters that Biden had been struggling to win over.\n\nPublic opinion polls in the last week have shown Harris, 59, closing the gap with 78-year-old Trump, who still leads in some national surveys.\n\nThe ads will be rolled out on television as well as streaming and social channels across election battleground states in the weeks before the Democratic National Convention that starts on Aug. 19.\n\nThe first ad in the campaign begins with images of Harris as a little girl and follows her progression to a prosecutor, attorney general and U.S. vice president. \"The one thing Kamala Harris has always been: fearless,\" the ad says.\n\nSince stepping into her new role, Harris has focused on Trump's felony convictions in a hush-money trial involving a porn star and the other criminal charges he faces, and portrayed him as responsible for a wave of anti-abortion measures in Republican-led states around the country.\n\nThe Harris campaign's ad buy dwarfed the $10 million advertising buy announced by Trump's campaign on Monday, to be launched in six battleground states this week as it tries to counter a surge of voter enthusiasm and donations for Harris.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nThat was Trump's biggest ad buy since January.\n\n(This story has not been edited by

Her supporters are organizing Zoom calls and raising millions of dollars at a time, the latest being a White Dudes for Harris call that generated $3.7 million for her campaign.\n\nThe question is how does she turn that into votes. Can Democrats leverage all of that enthusiasm when they're organizing efforts and turning out voters?\n\nHarris comes into the campaign relatively fresh. Trump and his allies are trying to saddle her with the liabilities of the Biden administration but also run against her as a distinct candidate.\n\nTrump on Monday launched a 30-second advertisement that targets Harris' work on migration issues, dubbing her the \"border czar\" and blaming her for illegal crossings into the United States. After displaying headlines about crime and drugs, the video brands Harris as \"Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal.\"\n\nThe vice president needs to show what kind of candidate she could be. Biden was pitching ideas for a second term as president but also asking to be rewarded for his administration's accomplishments.\n\nHarris, as his second in command, inherits some of his liabilities, particularly on inflation and the border. She will also get to take credit for the administration's accomplishments, but she has to spin it forward and set her own policy priorities.\n\nHer first campaign for the presidency ended before she could reach the Iowa caucuses. The early promise of her 2020 presidential campaign met a more complicated reality as she spent the next 10 months struggling to break through a crowded field of candidates and churning through staff and cash.\n\nBiden's struggles had made many Democrats fear that their electoral map was reduced to Rust Belt states that Trump won in 2016 and Biden flipped in 2020 -- Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nStrategists on both sides believed that Georgia and Arizona, Sun Belt states that Biden also flipped, were moving away from the Democratic president.\n\nNow, with Harris in the race, packed Zoom gatherings and interviews with supporters are signs of rekindled enthusiasm among key Democratic voting blocs: younger voters, voters of color and Black women. That could make Democrats more confident that they're facing a competitive Electoral College map and perhaps changes the Trump team's assumptions on states it could flip.", "source": {"uri":

It is a series of calls that her supporters have done that target different demographic groups.\n\nTrump, the Republican presidential nominee and former president, leads Harris in most national polls and key battleground states, according to Real Clear Politics averages of polls. Some polls show the margins slightly closer with Harris as the Democratic presidential choice compared to Biden, who ended his re-election campaign on July 21st.\n\nDeidre DeJear, a former Democratic nominee for secretary of state and governor, led Harris' presidential caucus campaign in 2020. Harris, who has served as U.S. senator from California and state attorney general, dropped out a month before the caucuses during that cycle. Biden later earned his party's nomination and chose Harris as his vice presidential running mate.\n\nSeveral hours after Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and endorsed Harris, her supporters organized fundraising calls. DeJear, who has maintained a relationship with Harris following the 2020 caucus cycle, joined a fundraising call targeted to Black women.\n\nReports vary on the total number of participants on that call. But \"Black women for Harris\" and other targeted calls like \"White dudes for Harris\" have helped raise more than $200 million to help elected Harris, according to Politico.\n\nHarris believes the speed at which these calls were organized, along with the dollars they raised, demonstrate the newfound enthusiasm and commitment that supporters are bringing to the presidential race.\n\nHarris would have a lot to overcome to win in Iowa.

(Atlanta News First) - Vice President Kamala Harris will be in Atlanta Tuesday for her sixth trip to Georgia this year, but the first as the Democrat Party's presumptive White House nominee.\n\nHer visit also comes three weeks before the start of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where she would solidify her nomination, if not before.\n\nThe shake-up has voters and elected officials on both sides of the aisle paying close attention.\n\n\"Especially here in Georgia, we've seen enthusiasm increase dramatically,\" said State Sen. Jason Esteves (D-Atlanta). \"We have seen young people very excited. We've seen Black voters excited. We've seen voters all across the state really galvanized by this move by Vice President Harris run for president.\"\n\nEsteves, like many other Democrats, is encouraged by Harris' swift presence in the state of Georgia after launching her budding campaign. Georgia, Esteves said, is still in play even if Republicans are touting a similar sense of confidence going into the final months of the campaign cycle.\n\n\"We are a true battleground state. Which means every presidential cycle, every election cycle, it's going to be a horse race until the end,\" he said.\n\n\"My home state of Georgia, I've lived here all my life, it's hard to believe that they call it purple,\" said U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Rome) at a Trump campaign event in Dunwoody to train poll watchers and vote canvassers. \"I believe it's red, and I believe it's ruby red, and I think we're going to prove that in November.\"\n\nHarris has previously appeared at events focused on topics like gun safety and economic opportunity. But this week's visit will be her first President Joe Biden dropped a political bombshell two weeks ago when he announced he is ending his 2024 reelection bid.\n\nAtlanta Mayor Andre Dickens has endorsed Harris, as have all Georgia Democrats in the state House and Senate and much of Georgia's congressional delegation.\n\nLess than 100 days remain before the general election that could decide whether Harris becomes the Oval Office's first woman of color or if former President Donald Trump becomes only the second man ever elected to non-consecutive terms.\n\nHarris' trip to Atlanta comes as Biden is pushing for a series of U.S. Supreme Court reforms, including imposing term limits on the justices and requiring them to comply with binding ethics rules.\n\nSeveral polls came out last week that all show a potential Harris-Trump race to be virtual tossups. An NPR/PBS News Marist Poll conducted July 22, 2024, shows Trump leading Harris 46% to 45%, with 9% of voters undecided. Marist's one-day survey of 1,309 adults was conducted on July 22, 2024.\n\nIn a Reuters poll, Harris has opened a two-percentage-point lead over Trump, as she continues to consolidate the Democratic Party's support after Biden's stunning announcement of ending his 2024 reelection bid.\n\nThose polls were released after Monday's national poll by Quinnipiac University that also showed the potential matchup - Harris has not been officially chosen as the Democratic Party's White House nominee - a dead heat.\n\nThe Quinnipiac poll, conducted from Friday, July 19-21, showed Trump receiving 49% support and Harris getting 47% support.\n\nBiden's withdrawal quickly became the nation's hottest political topic and, for the moment, eclipsed the attempted assassination of Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, along with a completely unified GOP after the Republican National Convention.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention is set to convene in Chicago Aug. 19-22, 2024. Harris seems to have secured enough delegates to win the nomination; now, all eyes are focused on who she will choose as her vice presidential running mate.\n\nHad Biden faced Trump, it would have been the first time two presidential candidates would have faced each other in consecutive elections since 1956, when GOP President Dwight D. Eisenhower again defeated Democrat Adlai Stevenson in a repeat of the 1952 election.\n\nBiden is the first sitting president since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968 to end his reelection bid. He is also the first presidential candidate in modern political history to withdraw from the race after winning virtually all of his party's delegates.\n\nFull political coverage from Atlanta News First\n\nAlso, for the first time since 1976, a general election presidential ballot will be without the names \"Biden,\" \"Bush\" or \"Clinton\" appearing on the ticket:\n\nTrump's selection of U.S. Sen.

Billboard was the first to report about Stallion giving a \"special performance\" at the rally.\n\nDemocrats have quickly rallied behind the vice president after President Joe Biden announced that he was dropping out of the 2024 race a little over a week ago. Harris has also earned endorsements from several pop-culture stars, including British artist Charli XCX, whose latest album Brat has become a branding tool for the vice president's campaign.\n\nOther celebrities to endorse Harris early into her campaign include singer and actress Demi Lovato, singer-songwriter John Legend, American actor George Clooney and Star Wars icon Mark Hamill. The vice president was also granted permission from Beyonc\u00e9 to use the Grammy-Award winning artist's song, Freedom, at her first rally in Wisconsin last week.\n\nHarris is also not short on endorsements from party leaders. Within her first 48 hours of running for president, the vice president was backed by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Representative and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Former President Barack Obama endorsed Harris along with his wife, former first lady Michelle Obama, late last week.\n\nFormer President and GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump had a wave of public figures show their support for his reelection campaign during the Republican National Convention this month. Model and rapper Amber Rose gave a passionate speech endorsing Trump on the first day of the convention, and singer and rapper Kid Rock performed his hit American Bad Ass before the former president gave his keynote address on the last day of the event.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Trump's campaign via email for comment on Harris' plans for Tuesday's rally.\n\nThe momentum behind Harris has helped Democrats close the gap on Trump and Republicans in national polling. Voter surveys have also shown the former president's lead shrink in key swing states like Georgia, which Biden flipped in the 2020 election when he defeated Trump. According to a recent poll by Landmark Communications, Trump was trailing Harris by 1.3 percentage points (48 percent to 46.7 percent) in a hypothetical head-to-head match among likely voters in the Peach State. When other candidates were included, Trump beat Harris by 1.5 points (45.8 percent to 44.3 percent).\n\nIn a separate poll last week by Emerson College Polling and The Hill, Trump was leading Harris by 2 percentage points in Georgia, which fell within the survey's margin of error of 3.4 points. The gap was also a notable improvement from Biden's performance against Trump in Georgia. Earlier this month, a separate poll from Emerson and The Hill found the president trailing by 5 percentage points.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"},

Just this weekend, dozens of surrogates are joining Team Harris on the campaign trail, he asserted.\n\n\"Since last Sunday, we've seen unprecedented grassroots support for the campaign across the country, with over 170,000 new volunteers joining Team Harris. We are not taking that excitement for granted - just this weekend, the campaign will mobilise thousands of grassroots supporters with more than 2,300 events in battleground states. We are also engaging supporters online and through traditional media, with the VP herself joining TikTok and gaining millions of followers since,\" he said.\n\nHarris will be formally announced presidential nominee in next month's Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago.\n\nTyler said this week, hundreds of thousands of supporters came together via calls to support the Vice President, raising millions in the process -- including shows of support from coalitions of Black women and men, Latinas, white women, the LGBTQ community, and more.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump, her Republican rival, is scrambling, Tyler said, adding that he's scared to debate Harris.\n\n\"While the Harris coalition is unified and growing, Donald Trump is weighed down by his extensive vulnerabilities, for example, his Friday comments about ending elections in this country,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grassroots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidential nominee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Communications_Director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Communications Director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_community", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LGBT community"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hispanic and Latino Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2020/09/AP20240707731497.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773409", "eventUri": "eng-9773409", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 474, "textEnd": 484}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 710, "textEnd": 717}], "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Under Harris, over 10 million illegally here, a quarter of a million Americans dead from fentanyl, brutal migrant crimes, and ISIS now here,\" a narrator in the ad says, followed by an interview clip of Harris appearing to admit she hasn't visited the border.\n\n\"Kamala Harris. Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal,\" the narration continues.\n\nAccording to AdImpact, the Trump campaign has reserved $12 million worth of airtime across Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin.\n\nAfter a week of working to determine the best language to attack Harris since Biden left the 2024 race, this ad campaign reflects the Trump campaign's push to focus on the border -- a major campaign issue for voters.\n\nIn response to the Trump campaign's ad, the Harris campaign suggests that the vice president was focused on addressing the root causes of migration and claimed that at no point in her tenure was she in charge of managing the border.\n\nHarris' first ad, titled \"Fearless\" and featuring pictures of Harris over the years -- from a toddler to college graduate to vice president -- highlights her background as a former prosecutor who is \"uniquely suited to take on\" the former president, who is now a convicted felon.\n\n\"As a prosecutor, she put murderers and abusers behind bars,\" a narrator says in the one-minute ad. \"As California's attorney general, she went after the big banks and won $20 billion for homeowners. And as vice president, she took on the big drug companies to cap the cost of insulin for seniors. Because Kamala Harris has always known who she represents.\"\n\nThe spot then leads into laying out Harris' vision and attacking Trump, using footage from her first rally of the campaign last week in a high school gym just outside Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\n\"We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead. Where every senior can retire with dignity,\" Harris said in the footage from the rally. \"But Donald Trump wants to take our country backward, to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and end the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nThis ad is scheduled to run on local and national broadcast, cable programming, streaming and social channels over the next three weeks, including during the Olympic Games, as well as programs like \"The Bachelorette,\" \"Big Brother\" and \"The Daily Show.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign has reserved airtime in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina, according to ad tracking firm Medium Buying.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

What the polls show (so far).", "body": "With fewer than 100 days until America votes, the 2024 presidential race has officially been reset.\n\nPresident Biden bowed out a little over a week ago. Democrats immediately picked Vice President Kamala Harris as their new de facto nominee. And now her Republican rival, former President Donald Trump, is returning to the campaign trail after surviving an assassination attempt earlier this month.\n\nSo what do the latest polls say? Here are four key trends that have emerged since Harris took Biden's place at the top of the ticket:\n\nThe latest Yahoo News/YouGov poll -- conducted when Biden was on the brink of ending his campaign -- was one of the first to test Harris vs. Trump in this new environment. It showed them tied nationally at 46% among registered voters.\n\nThe previous Yahoo News/YouGov poll, which went into the field right after Biden's damaging June 27 debate performance, put Harris (45%) 2 points behind Trump (47%). Biden trailed Trump by 2 points in that survey as well.\n\nSubsequent national polls have confirmed Yahoo News' initial finding: that Harris is reversing Biden's decline and pulling even with Trump. The New York Times/Siena College survey, for instance, showed Trump leading Biden among likely voters by 6 points after the debate, 49% to 43%.\n\nNow it has Harris at 47% to Trump's 48%.\n\nOn average, Harris is polling a few points better than Biden was -- while Trump's numbers have remained the same. The result is a closer race.\n\nSwing-state polls matter more than national polls; the path to 270 electoral votes runs straight through Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nBut they're also trickier to conduct, and they tend to take more time. So new numbers are hard to come by right now.\n\nWhat data has surfaced, however, suggests a pattern similar to the national one: Harris on the rise.\n\nBefore Biden dropped out, most battlegrounds seemed to be slipping away from the Democratic candidate. Polling averages calculated by the New York Times showed Trump leading by 7 points in Nevada; 6 points in Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina; 5 points in Michigan; and 4 points in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Trump was even catching up to Biden in blue states such as Minnesota and Virginia.\n\nYet a new round of Fox News polls hints at an improved picture for the Democratic ticket. In Michigan, Harris and Trump are tied at 49%; the same goes for Pennsylvania. In Wisconsin, Harris (49%) trails Trump (50%) by 1 point; in Minnesota, she leads by 6 (52% to 46%).\n\nMeanwhile in Georgia and Arizona, new surveys from The Hill/Emerson College show Harris still lagging behind Trump -- but by smaller margins than Biden. Earlier this month, the president was down at 40%-41% in both Sun Belt states; Trump was at 47%. Now Harris is at 44% in Arizona and 46% in Georgia, while Trump is at 49% and 48%, respectively.\n\nIn other words, both candidates have gained a little ground. But Harris has gained more.\n\nThe biggest change since Harris replaced Biden as the de facto Democratic nominee has centered on favorable ratings.\n\nIn an ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted July 19 to 20 -- immediately prior to the president's withdrawal -- 35% of Americans said they viewed Harris favorably compared to 46% who said they viewed her unfavorably.\n\nJust one week later, Harris's numbers had flipped: 43% favorable to 42% unfavorable.\n\nThe same poll measured Trump's rating as 36% favorable to 52% unfavorable. Before dropping out, Biden's rating had been 32% favorable to 55% unfavorable -- even worse than Trump's.\n\nHarris's numbers improved most among independents, who shot up from 28% favorable (before she entered the race) to 44% favorable (after she jumped in). In contrast, just 27% of independents viewed Trump favorably in the latest ABC News/Ipsos poll.\n\nAgain, the initial numbers hint at a similar trend in key swing states. According to this week's Fox News surveys, Harris now enjoys a higher favorable rating than Trump in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Minnesota; in Michigan, the two candidates are on equal footing at 49% apiece.\n\nBiden was seen less favorably than both Harris and Trump in all four states.\n\nEnthusiasm is the final piece of the polling puzzle. In February, the Monmouth University Poll asked Democratic voters how \"enthusiastic\" they were feeling about Biden as the nominee; just 62% said somewhat or very enthusiastic.\n\nTrump's number among Republicans back then? 80%.\n\nLast week, ABC News/Ipsos asked essentially the same question about Harris. In that poll, a full 88% of Democrats now said they were feeling enthusiastic -- higher than the 82% of Republicans who said the same about Trump.\n\nEnthusiasm drives turnout, of course. But it could also pull some wavering demographic groups back into the Democratic fold.\n\nThe latest Yahoo News/YouGov poll offered some early clues about Harris's appeal. Compared to Biden, it found her performing 3 points better among women, 7 points better among Americans ages 18 to 29, 7 points better among independents, 8 points better among Black Americans and 13 points better among those who view both Biden and Trump unfavorably (so-called double haters).", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!

"body": "Nearly half of Americans believe Democrats replacing President Joe Biden as their 2024 nominee with Kamala Harris gives the party a better chance of winning the November election, according to a poll.\n\nA Redfield & Wilton Strategies poll of 1,750 eligible voters, conducted exclusively for Newsweek, found that 48 percent believe Democrats are \"more likely\" to win with the vice president leading the ticket, including 23 percent who believe it makes it \"significantly\" more likely.\n\nIn comparison, just under one-quarter (24 percent) of U.S. voters think the Democratic Party is now less likely to defeat former President Donald Trump and Republican running mate JD Vance in November with Harris at the top of the ticket.\n\nThe results are the last sign of enthusiasm for Harris' White House campaign since Biden confirmed he would be ending his reelection bid on July 21.\n\nEven before Biden's languished performance at the CNN debate performance on June 27, the 81-year-old had long faced calls that he was too old to run for a second term, with polls frequently suggesting voters were not enthused at the prospect of the race being a rematch of the 2020 election.\n\nNow, the momentum appears to be in Harris' favor, with her approval rating rising in the days since she began her White House bid, and more polls suggesting she is leading Trump.\n\nHarris has also seen a surge in fundraising, with her campaign reporting it raised more than $200 million in its first week, about two-thirds of which came from first-time donors.\n\nElsewhere, the Redfield & Wilton Strategies survey found that more than one-third (36 percent) of U.S. voters said they are now more likely to vote for the Democratic nominee in November now that Harris has replaced Biden, compared to 27 percent who say it makes them less likely.\n\nA clear majority of (69 percent) of voters said they support Biden's decision to end his campaign and allow a new candidate to win the Democratic nomination.\n\nHarris' and Trump's offices have been contacted for comment via email.\n\nIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, on Monday, Harris acknowledged the enthusiasm her campaign has seen in its first few days.\n\n\"In the week since the launch of our campaign, we have: Signed up more than 170,000 new volunteers, held more than 2,300 events across the country, raised over $200 million (66% came from first-time donors),\" Harris wrote.\n\n\"Thank you to all who have knocked doors, made calls, and chipped in.\"\n\nAt a recent rally in Minnesota, Trump attacked Harris as \"evil\" and suggested her poor record on controlling rising illegal migrant crossings at the southern border makes her unfit for office.\n\n\"Kamala Harris' deadly destruction of America's borders is completely and totally disqualifying for her to be president,\" Trump said. \"You can't have a person like this as president.\"\n\nThe Redfield & Wilton Strategies

But can she expand the map?", "body": "During the first whirlwind week of her second presidential campaign, Kamala Harris locked up the support of the Democratic Party, recruited thousands of volunteers and hauled in $200 million in donations.\n\nBut the challenge over the next 98 days will be whether she can harness that energy to power electoral victories in both traditional party strongholds and the newer battlegrounds that had appeared to be slipping away under President Joe Biden.\n\nThe next test of Harris' appeal will take place Tuesday in Georgia, where her campaign is hosting an Atlanta rally. The vice president will be joined by Democratic Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, two-time Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams and other guests. Rapper Megan Thee Stallion is set to perform.\n\nThat Harris would make a high-profile visit to Georgia early in her White House bid indicates the renewed push the campaign is making in a state that's now back in play for Democrats.\n\n\"The groundswell of support around the vice president is real and it is meaningful,\" Dan Kanninen, Harris' battleground state director, told reporters Monday. \"Our task now is to translate that enthusiasm into action.\"\n\nAny Democratic path to victory almost certainly runs through the so-called \"Blue Wall\" states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where polls showed a tied race between former President Donald Trump and his then-Democratic opponent, Biden, for months. But, with Harris now the party's presumptive nominee, keeping Sun Belt states like Georgia - as well as Arizona, Nevada and North Carolina - competitive could give Democrats much needed breathing room.\n\nDemocrats became disillusioned months ago with the prospect of winning in Georgia, according to party strategists involved in conversations. Frustrations over inflation and the suffering in Gaza were mounting among voters, whose turnout was becoming increasingly uncertain. A mid-May commencement address by Biden at Morehouse College was marked by drama around the possibility of protests over his handling of the war in Gaza.\n\nFollowing the presidential debate in Atlanta in late June, Biden flew directly to North Carolina to rally voters there, a decision that sources involved suggested was rooted in the greater likelihood at that point of flipping the Tar Heel State - with its heavily college-educated, suburban voter base and growing minority population - than keeping Georgia, which he won in 2020 with a narrow majority, this year.\n\nNow, Georgia again is seen as within the party's grasp - with a senior Democratic strategist describing Harris's candidacy as a \"defibrillator,\" jolting voters back into awareness. For young people and voters of color, the strategist said, that jolt was more noticeable, and producing an expectation that Harris could engender more support among the African Americans who comprise roughly a third of Georgia's population.\n\nBut the opportunity in the state, whose former Republican lieutenant governor says is \"absolutely\" back in play, could extend well beyond those coalitions.\n\n\"Any electoral advantage Donald Trump had has been erased,\" Geoff Duncan told CNN. \"The suburbs of Atlanta are back up for grabs.\"\n\nIn a new campaign memo shared with CNN Monday evening, Harris' Georgia state director Porsha White outlined what the campaign hopes is a winning strategy in the state.\n\n\"We turned Georgia blue for the first time in three decades in 2020, and we're feeling the energy we need to win the state again in 2024,\" White wrote. \"Tomorrow, Vice President Harris' visit will highlight her brighter vision for the future, where our freedoms are protected and every American has a fair shot. And we're going to make the choice clear to every voter across our state.\"\n\nPer the campaign, more than 7,500 volunteers have signed up in the week since Harris moved to the top of the ticket, with more than 1,000 signed up on the day after Biden announced his decision to withdraw from the 2024 race. The campaign has 24 coordinated offices and 170 Democratic coordinated campaign staff across the state.\n\nGeorgia Rep. Nikema Williams, who is also the chair of the state Democratic Party, told CNN her Georgia Democrats gained 1,000 volunteers and saw a more than 300% uptick in donations in the last week.\n\n\"The last eight days have been a whole vibe in battleground Georgia,\" Williams, who will appear at the Atlanta rally, told CNN. \"We are seeing people energized and volunteering in ways that we have not seen in the past.\"\n\nEarly polls have shown Harris outperforming Biden against Trump with key groups within the Democratic coalition and erasing much of the popular vote lead Trump held over Biden.\n\nA Siena/New York Times poll released last week found that, in a head-to-head match up against Trump with likely voters, Hispanic voters favored Harris over the former president by a 24-point margin and voters ages 18-29 favored her by a 21-point margin. In an earlier poll released July 2, Biden held only 3- and 1-point leads with those groups, respectively, against Trump, within the margin of error.\n\nFor Democratic organizers, winning in Georgia isn't just about keeping the White House, but maintaining hard won gains in a state that has been promising to tilt blue for years.\n\nBiden's 2020 win in Georgia, when he beat former Trump by just under 12,000 votes, marked the first time a Democratic presidential candidate won the state in nearly 30 years. Weeks later, voters sent two Democratic senators - Ossoff and Warnock - to Washington.\n\nJay Williams, a Georgia-based Republican strategist, argued that those races were unique. \"At the end of the day, Georgia still is a right-leaning state,\" he said. \"It's not wildly right, but it is a right-leaning state.\"\n\nDespite the gains in late 2020 and early 2021, Abrams, Democrats' gubernatorial pick, was unable to win in a 2022 rematch against Republican Gov. Brian Kemp.\n\nDemocrats are hoping for a different outcome this November. Hillary Holley, who leads Care in Action, a group that advocates for domestic workers, said she believed the Democratic base was consolidating around Harris.\n\n\"Georgia was looking for something refreshing, something new that we could bring to voters and a sense of renewed hope,\" she said. \"And I think that's what we are now seeing.\"\n\nLaTosha Brown, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter, said Harris has invested a lot of time in the state, which could help her now that she's the presumptive nominee. But the vice president may also benefit from the work grassroots groups in the state have done to help make the state more competitive, Brown said.\n\n\"I think we're breaking up this red wall that many of us feel has created an agenda and policies that have been hurtful and harmful,\" Brown said. \"We have been working diligently over the last decade to actually build a real movement infrastructure.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kayla_tausche@cnn.com", "name": "Kayla Tausche", "type": "author", "isAgency": false},

JD Vance, who is expected to accept the GOP vice presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention, and his admission that in the past he had described Donald Trump as America's Hitler.\n\nWhen the chair of the Republican National Committee came to Arizona in early July, his mind was somewhere else. Donald Trump had a comfortable lead in Arizona polls and had just trounced Joe Biden in the first presidential debate of 2024.\n\n\"We are going to be here as often as it takes and we're really focusing on states like Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia. But we also have new states that are going on the map,\" RNC Chair Michael Whatley said July 2 at a Trump office opening in Casa Grande. \"We've now started to engage in Minnesota and in Virginia and in New Hampshire. So we're playing offense all around the country.\"\n\nHe didn't know the presidential race was about to turn upside down.\n\nOver the next three weeks, Trump would survive an assassination attempt, accept his party's nomination and then be forced to recalibrate his entire campaign against a new Democratic opponent. And Democrats, who were all but writing off Arizona's presidential election thanks to Biden's anemic approval ratings, have an uncharacteristic pep in their step and say they are seeing a deluge of new donors.\n\n\"This is gonna be one of those kind of totally crazy, whac-a-mole elections. We don't know what's coming next. We really don't,\" said Brian Murray, former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party. \"A lot of times I feel like you can predict out and say, 'This is how we expect things to happen.' But with Trump, you really just can't.\"\n\nThe new dynamic is hardly a guarantee that presumptive nominee Vice President Kamala Harris could carry Arizona. Biden won here by fewer than 11,000 votes in 2020, and Harris has her own challenges, especially when it comes to immigration. But the race certainly shows signs of being a closer contest than it was when Whatley came to open Trump's campaign outpost and Democrats were in crisis over Biden's bad poll numbers.\n\nTrump's campaign activity is ramping up in Arizona, too. The former president still has a much lighter footprint than the Biden and Harris campaigns in Arizona, but he is dispatching running mate JD Vance to Glendale for a rally this week and has opened two new campaign offices over the last several weeks.\n\nVance will take aim at Harris during his visit, rushing to define her as the new dynamics of the race take shape.\n\n\"People are really excited,\" Arizona Democratic Party chair Yolanda Bejarano told reporters last week. \"We are going to take advantage of the moment.\"\n\nHarris \"probably has a better shot\" in Arizona than Biden did, said Emerson College pollster Matt Taglia, but the vice president starts her campaign behind Trump. His latest Arizona poll showed Trump with 49% of support and Harris with 44%. Harris outperformed Biden by four percentage points: the president had 40% of support in the last Emerson poll before he dropped out of the race.\n\n\"We have seen some real shifts. That said, she's still behind in Arizona by about five points to Trump,\" Taglia said.\n\nArizona is a crucial battleground state for both presidential campaigns. Biden won here by the most narrow margin of any state in 2020, and Republicans challenged the election results for years. Before he dropped out, Biden's campaign said he would focus on the so-called Blue Wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to score an Electoral College victory.\n\nThe early days of the Harris campaign could indicate she sees Arizona as more central to a win, especially if she chooses Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., as her running mate. Kelly's name on the ballot could force Republicans to spend more time and money in Arizona to protect their lead rather than spending that cash to flip blue states such as Minnesota.\n\n\"If they pick Kelly, what they're saying is they think they can win Arizona,\" Murray said. \"Trump's got this place pretty well locked down. Their only chance would be to take Kelly, and I'm not certain that that's even enough for them to retake Arizona.\"\n\nKelly has a more optimistic view. Arizona is \"100% winnable\" for Democrats, he told reporters last week.\n\n\"I won it twice, President Biden won it in 2020, and Kamala Harris is going to win it here,\" said Kelly, who Harris reportedly invited to submit vice presidential vetting materials as she weighs who to tap as her second in command.\n\nA frequent criticism from Democrats is that Trump is not in Arizona enough and has a smaller ground game than the vice president, who took over Biden's campaign operation. Trump has fewer offices than Harris (Trump has 8 and Harris has 12), and Democrats are using a $1.5 million transfer from the Democratic National Committee to grow their staff even larger.\n\n\"Rushing to open offices after months of overlooking the state won't distract Arizonans from Trump's Project 2025 agenda of banning abortion nationwide, raising costs on hardworking families and making our communities less safe. There is no question this is going to be a close race, but Team Harris isn't taking a single voter for granted, and we have the energy, the momentum, and strong campaign infrastructure to win,\" Jacques Petit, Harris's Arizona communications director, said in a written statement.\n\nTrump has been to Arizona once this election cycle for a large rally. Harris has taken six trips here during her time in the Biden administration, although she hasn't visited since becoming the presumptive nominee last week. The Harris campaign has also held more events and news conferences to get its message out to voters.\n\nThe Harris campaign said more than 1,300 people engaged with the 67 events it hosted across Arizona over the weekend, which included canvasses, phone banks, watch parties and other gatherings. The campaign had 140 volunteers and supporters knock on 5,000 doors, and made nearly 5,500 calls across 152 phone banking sessions.\n\nAlthough he's spent less time in Arizona, Trump is giving the state some extra attention lately. The former president teamed up with a Border Patrol agent from Arizona to make the case against Harris on an immigration-focused press call, and his Arizona campaign recently held a \"Trump Campaign's 100 Day Weekend of Action\" event to mark the last 100 days before the election.\n\nThe pro-Trump super PAC Maga Inc. says it will spend $12 million a week on battleground state TV ads attacking Harris in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Georgia through Labor Day.\n\n\"For months, our staff and volunteers have been recruiting thousands of volunteers to be poll watchers and poll workers, and activating thousands of Trump Force 47 captains, who are talking neighbor-to-neighbor about the key issues Arizonans care about,\" Halee Dobbins, the RNC Arizona state communications director, said in a written statement.\n\nTrump's backers in Arizona say the former president does not need to make a personal trip to Arizona any time soon.\n\n\"He's a busy guy,\" said Joe Arpaio, the former Maricopa County sheriff who Trump kissed on stage at a Phoenix rally in June.\n\nThe Democratic and Republican candidates are so different, said another Trump supporter, that few voters will be swayed ahead of November.\n\n\"Is it going to be a sales pitch that gets someone undecided over the line? I don't see it, so I'm not the least bit critical of the Trump campaign,\" said Jim O'Connor, a Republican on the Arizona Corporation Commission who served as a Trump elector in 2016. \"Just as one strong Republican influential voter, I don't need Trump to make another visit to Arizona if he can spend his time elsewhere.\"", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AZ Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arizona_republic@azcentral.com", "name": "Arizona Republic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Democratic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Democratic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emerson College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidential nominee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Republican_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Republican Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts said in a statement the group is sticking to its original timeline and director Paul Dans' exit comes after the project \"completed exactly what it set out to do\" and that the \"tool was built for any future administration to use.\"\n\nBut the news came after former President Donald Trump has increasingly disavowed and criticized Project 2025, prompting speculation that his campaign forced the exit.\n\n\"President Trump's campaign has been very clear for over a year that Project 2025 had nothing to do with the campaign, did not speak for the campaign, and should not be associated with the campaign or the President in any way,\" Trump campaign advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said in a statement.\n\nMany Trump allies and former top aides contributed to the project, which proposes a mass firing of government employees and sweeping changes to American life. Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign and top Democrats have repeatedly tied Trump to Project 2025 as they argue against a second Trump term. A statement from Harris' campaign manager Julie Ch\u00e1vez Rodr\u00edguez called Project 2025 Trump's \"agenda, written by his allies, for Donald Trump to inflict on our country.\"\n\nKari Lake aims to win GOP primary for closely watched Arizona Senate race\n\nKari Lake is looking to easily win the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in Arizona on Tuesday, setting up a fierce battle against Democratic U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego for a seat that could be crucial to deciding Senate control.\n\nIn Maricopa County, which includes metro Phoenix and 60% of Arizona's voters, Republicans will also choose between a slate of incumbents who have stood up to former President Donald Trump's lies about the 2020 election and challengers who claim it was stolen.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department said it will monitor compliance with federal voting rights laws in Maricopa County for Tuesday's primary. County Sheriff's officials told Phoenix radio station KTAR that any attempts to disrupt vote centers, harass poll workers or prevent voting will be punished.\n\nThe primary will give insights about where the narrowly divided state is headed going into the final sprint of the 2024 election, when Arizona is central to the fight for control of the White House and Congress.\n\nDonald Trump to attend Black journalists' convention in Chicago\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is planning to attend the National Association of Black Journalists' annual convention in Chicago on Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement released Monday night, the Trump campaign said the Republican presidential nominee would participate in a question and answer session \"that will concentrate on the most pressing issues facing the Black community.\"\n\nTrump's campaign has spent months scheduling appearances in areas outside his traditional strongholds of support, including when he attended -- and was roundly booed at -- the Libertarian Party convention in Washington earlier this year.\n\nIn its announcement, the campaign trumpeted Trump policies that it argued benefited Black Americans during his first term.\n\nHarris pivots to convincing Arab American voters of her leadership\n\nVice President Kamala Harris appears to be trying to convince Arab American voters in crucial Michigan that she is someone they can unite behind. Community leaders are watching closely for signals that she will be more vocal in pressing for a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nMany in metro Detroit, home to the nation's largest Muslim population, have expressed a willingness to listen, and some have had initial conversations with Harris' team. Many had grown exasperated with President Joe Biden after they felt months of outreach had not yielded many results.\n\n\"The door is cracked open since Biden has stepped down,\" said Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud. \"There's an opportunity for the Democratic nominee to coalesce the coalition that ushered in Biden's presidency four years ago. But that responsibility will now fall on the vice president.\"\n\nHarris did not attend Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent address to Congress, and some Arab American leaders interpret her absence as a sign of good faith with them.\n\nTrump says Harris, married to a Jewish man, doesn't like Jewish people\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said in a radio interview Tuesday that Vice President Kamala Harris, who is married to a Jewish man, \"doesn't like Jewish people\" and appeared to agree with a radio host who called second gentleman Doug Emhoff \"a crappy Jew.\"\n\nTrump, speaking on radio station WABC, claimed Harris looked uncomfortable while meeting last week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\"You can see the disdain,\" he said. \"No. 1, she doesn't like Israel. No. 2, she doesn't like Jewish people. You know it, I know it and everybody knows it, and nobody wants to say it.\"\n\nThe Republican former president then said, \"If you're Jewish, if you vote for a Democrat, you're a fool, an absolute fool. They have let Jewish people down since Obama at a level that nobody could believe.\"\n\nAs the interview went on, Trump again said Harris \"dislikes Jewish people.\" The interview host, Sid Rosenberg, then mentioned Emhoff and said, \"He's Jewish like Bernie Sanders is Jewish. Are you kidding me?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Trump said.\n\n\"He's a crappy Jew,\" Rosenberg said.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Trump said again.\n\nRosenberg went on, saying of Emhoff, \"He's a horrible Jew.\"\n\nJames Singer, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, said, \"America is better than the fear, hate, and despicable insults of Donald Trump. Vice President Harris believes Americans want a president who unites our country instead of divides it, uses the power of the presidency to help families instead of hurt them, and has a vision for our future, instead of taking us backwards.\"\n\nHarris' potential running mates walk a fine line\n\nDemocratic governors and other officials under consideration to be Democrat Kamala Harris' vice presidential running mate are practicing a time-honored tradition in presidential campaigns. They're walking the line between open self-promotion and loyal advocacy for the potential boss in what amounts to unofficial auditions.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro campaigned for Harris on Monday outside Philadelphia. He blasted Republican former President Donald Trump and called Harris ready to lead. But he also showcased his own accomplishments.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear took a similar approach over the weekend. He told voters in Georgia that Harris has the makings of \"a great president,\" and then highlighted the elections he has won as a Democrat in Republican territory.\n\nHarris is said to also be considering Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, among others.\n\nSecret Service head, FBI's No. 2 grilled by Senate lawmakers\n\nThe acting director of the Secret Service said Tuesday he \"cannot defend\" why the roof used by the gunman in the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump was not secured.\n\nRonald Rowe, testifying before two Senate committees, said that he recently traveled to the Pennsylvania shooting site where Trump had been holding a campaign rally, and that \"what I saw made me ashamed.\"\n\nRowe was joined at a joint hearing of the Senate committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security by FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate.\n\nThe FBI's No. 2 official said a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from when the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, would have been in high school.\n\nTrump plans rally at same Georgia venue as Harris event\n\nRepublican Donald Trump's campaign announced Tuesday, hours ahead of a rally planned by Vice President Kamala Harris at Georgia State University, that he will travel to Atlanta on Saturday for a rally in the same venue.\n\nDemocrats say they have new hope for winning Georgia in November after President Joe Biden bowed out of the race and endorsed Harris. They're betting that a fresh burst of energy and a surge in fundraising has helped make Georgia -- the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020 -- a toss-up again.\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nTrump ad blasts Harris for problems at the border\n\nRepublican candidate Donald Trump's campaign released a new advertisement Tuesday, blasting Vice President Kamala Harris for problems at the U.S. southern border.\n\nThe advertisement dubs Harris the \"border czar,\" a reference to her work on migration issues. It includes a parade of headlines about drugs and criminals entering the country, as well as a clip from a controversial interview that Harris did three years ago in which she brushed off a suggestion that she would visit the border.\n\n\"Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal,\" the advertisement brands Harris.\n\nNew $50 million ad portrays Harris as 'fearless'\n\nVice President Kamala Harris' campaign is kickstarting a $50 million advertising campaign with a new television spot calling the likely Democratic presidential nominee \"fearless\" throughout her career.\n\n\"Throughout her career as a courtroom prosecutor, attorney general, United States senator, and now as vice president, Kamala Harris has always stood up to bullies, criminals and special interests on behalf of the American people - and she's beaten them,\" said a statement from Jen O'Malley Dillon, the campaign chair.\n\n\"She's uniquely suited to take on Donald Trump, a convicted felon who has spent his entire life ripping off working people, tearing away our rights, and fighting for himself.\"\n\nThe advertisement is slated to run during the Olympics, \"The Bachelorette,\" \"The Daily Show\" and other popular programs. It's an attempt to even the score with Republicans, who have been outspending Democrats on the airwaves during a chaotic summer when President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed Harris.\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion to campaign for Harris\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion will join Vice President Kamala Harris for a special performance during her campaign stop in Atlanta on Tuesday.\n\nA Harris campaign spokesperson confirmed the hip-hop star's performance alongside the vice president in a post on X on Monday night.\n\nThe Harris campaign is promising a large rally in Atlanta, on par with the large events that Republican former President Donald Trump has made his signature.\n\nHarris has America focused on multiracial identity\n\nIf Vice President Kamala Harris were to ascend to the presidency, she would become the first female president, but also one who is also multiracial.\n\nThe daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, both of whom immigrated to the U.S. during the Civil Rights Movement, Harris' historic presidential bid has again put a spotlight on American identity politics and the growing number of people who say they are multiracial.\n\nDifferent countries divide people into categories depending on different national traditions. The U.S., with its slavery-molded history, divides people into Black or white, and nine million people identified as multiracial in 2010.\n\nWhen Harris ran for vice president in 2020, 33.8 million people in the U.S. identified as being more than one race, according to the census.", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima Herald-Republic"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Her campaign has raised a record $200 million in just a week, she is polling better than Biden nationwide and in swing states and the enthusiasm gap to vote for each candidate has been erased in the days since she became the party's likely nominee.\n\nWhile she has made an immediate impact on the race there are still questions about whether that momentum will be sustained once the race calms back down from the last two weeks of jarring events and how undecided voters will break between the Republican and Democratic tickets.\n\n\"We got a fight ahead of us, and we are the underdogs in this race, OK?\" Harris said at a fundraiser over the weekend, acknowledging a long road ahead in the 99 days until Election Day.\n\nSurveys released over the last week have mostly found the race is effectively tied, with Trump holding leads over Harris nationally but within the margin of error. Polling from the Wall Street Journal released over the weekend found Trump had a two-point lead in a head-to-head with Harris and trailed by 1% when including third parties, falling within the margin of error and effectively indicating the race is tied.\n\n\"This is very much like what we've seen in '12 and '16 and '20. It's a traditional presidential campaign even after all the unusual circumstances of the last three weeks,\" McLennan said. \"Democrats are fired up, Republicans are fired up. It's really gonna be a mobilization kind of election -- who turns out their base?\"\n\nThe close race comes after a whirlwind month in the presidential election.\n\nBiden saw his support sink after a disastrous debate performance on June 27 instantly sparked panic from voters and within the party about his ability to win the race and serve another four years in office, helping Trump build up a bigger lead in a race that had been within the margins for months.\n\nJust a few weeks later, the race got another shock when a 20-year-old opened fire at Trump during a rally in Pennsylvania on July 13. The attempt on his life was the most serious assassination effort since former President Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981 and brought on calls for unity and cooling the political tensions that have been ailing the country. He formally accepted the Republican presidential nomination at the party's convention the following week in a four-day event that displayed party unity and enthusiasm for Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance.\n\nThe attempted assassination of Trump brought a brief respite for Biden as he tried to salvage his campaign but pressure continued to mount on Biden to drop out of the race with more high-profile lawmakers and donors calling for him to step down publicly and behind the scenes. It culminated with an announcement posted to social media on a Sunday afternoon in a move that surprised even his own campaign staff.\n\nHarris entered the race and quickly had the party rally around her as she scooped up commitments from delegates to support her at the upcoming Democratic National Convention and endorsements from the party's biggest figures. Without having to fight for the nomination against other Democrats, she and other campaign surrogates have been able to go right into general election campaigning against Trump.\n\nTrump has also quickly shifted his approach and began with the attacks toward Harris, trying to tie her to the administration's struggles with voters when it comes to their handling of the border, the economy and inflation. The former president will be in Pennsylvania again this week while Vance will be in western battleground states of Nevada and Arizona, where the border is likely to be prominently featured in his appearances and speeches.\n\nHarris is continuing a blitz of public events and speaking engagements with a trip to Georgia on Tuesday, a swing state that barely went for Biden in 2020 and had been favoring Trump this year as she tries to continue to reverse the momentum Trump had gained prior to Biden's withdrawal from the race.\n\n\"In many ways, it's back to where the campaign was pre-debate, except we have a new candidate at the top of the Democratic ticket,\" McLennan said. \"You do see some changes in terms of the types of voters that are favoring Harris or Trump but the bottom line is it's tight.\"", "source": {"uri": "wsbt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WSBT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "austin_denean@wsbt.com", "name": "Austin Denean", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Harris' campaign began on July 21, immediately after President Joe Biden said he would end his reelection campaign.\n\nSince then, in Florida and across the country, Democrats have reported enthusiastic support for their new candidate as Republicans have switched gears from opposing Biden to opposing Harris.\n\n\"While voters may be responding to the prospect of a new candidate in these results,\" Luzmarina Garcia, an FAU political scientist said in a statement, \"they are also not sure what the Harris campaign messaging is, but the lead-up to the election will clarify that picture.\"\n\nDemographic breakdowns:\n\n-- American voters quickly assumed their partisan positions. Among Democratic likely voters surveyed, Harris has support of 82%. Among Republicans, Trump has support of 87%. Independent likely voters are closely divided, with 45% for Harris and 43% for Trump.\n\n-- There is a gender gap. Among women, Harris is at 50% and Trump at 43%. Among men, Harris has 45% and Trump is at 49%.\n\n-- Democrats have touted Harris' appeal to younger voters. The Florida Democratic Party put out an email blast Tuesday morning that proclaimed, \"The youth vote will decide the election.\"\n\nThat doesn't show up in the FAU poll. Among likely voters younger than 50, Harris is at 41% to 49% for Trump. Among likely voters 50 and older, Harris is at 52% and Trump is at 44%.\n\nA week ago, an FAU national poll found 49% for Trump, the Republican nominee, to 44% for Harris, among likely voters. It's not a direct comparison, since the poll released on July 23 was conducted immediately after the conclusion of the Republican National Convention with questioning halted immediately after Biden dropped out. So the matchup was hypothetical, without people actually seeing the rollout of her campaign.\n\nWhen likely voters were given the additional choice the the new poll of independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr., he gets 8% in a three-way matchup.\n\nWith Kennedy in a hypothetical matchup, Harris is at 44% and Trump at 43%.\n\nFine print\n\nThe poll of 997 U.S. registered voters was conducted July 26 to July 27 by Mainstreet Research for Florida Atlantic University's PolCom Lab, which is a collaboration of the School of Communication and Multimedia Studies and Department of Political Science.\n\nThe survey used an online panel and automated phone calls to reach other voters. It has a margin of error equivalent to plus or minus 3 percentage points for the full survey of Democrats, Republicans and independents.\n\nHowever, the margin of error for smaller groups, such as Republicans or Democrats or men and women, would be higher because the sample sizes are smaller.", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "m.arcamax.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arcamax_publishing@m.arcamax.com", "name": "ArcaMax Publishing", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Atlantic_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida Atlantic University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Democratic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida Democratic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Margin of error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

But, with Harris now the party's presumptive nominee, keeping Sun Belt states like Georgia - as well as Arizona, Nevada and North Carolina - competitive could give Democrats much needed breathing room.\n\nDemocrats became disillusioned months ago with the prospect of winning in Georgia, according to party strategists involved in conversations. Frustrations over inflation and the suffering in Gaza were mounting among voters, whose turnout was becoming increasingly uncertain. A mid-May commencement address by Biden at Morehouse College was marked by drama around the possibility of protests over his handling of the war in Gaza.\n\nFollowing the presidential debate in Atlanta in late June, Biden flew directly to North Carolina to rally voters there, a decision that sources involved suggested was rooted in the greater likelihood at that point of flipping the Tar Heel State - with its heavily college-educated, suburban voter base and growing minority population - than keeping Georgia, which he won in 2020 with a narrow majority, this year.\n\nNow, Georgia again is seen as within the party's grasp - with a senior Democratic strategist describing Harris's candidacy as a \"defibrillator,\" jolting voters back into awareness. For young people and voters of color, the strategist said, that jolt was more noticeable, and producing an expectation that Harris could engender more support among the African Americans who comprise roughly a third of Georgia's population.\n\nBut the opportunity in the state, whose former Republican lieutenant governor says is \"absolutely\" back in play, could extend well beyond those coalitions.\n\n\"Any electoral advantage Donald Trump had has been erased,\" Geoff Duncan told CNN. \"The suburbs of Atlanta are back up for grabs.\"\n\nIn a new campaign memo shared with CNN Monday evening, Harris' Georgia state director Porsha White outlined what the campaign hopes is a winning strategy in the state.\n\n\"We turned Georgia blue for the first time in three decades in 2020, and we're feeling the energy we need to win the state again in 2024,\" White wrote. \"Tomorrow, Vice President Harris' visit will highlight her brighter vision for the future, where our freedoms are protected and every American has a fair shot. And we're going to make the choice clear to every voter across our state.\"\n\nPer the campaign, more than 7,500 volunteers have signed up in the week since Harris moved to the top of the ticket, with more than 1,000 signed up on the day after Biden announced his decision to withdraw from the 2024 race. The campaign has 24 coordinated offices and 170 Democratic coordinated campaign staff across the state.\n\nGeorgia Rep. Nikema Williams, who is also the chair of the state Democratic Party, told CNN her Georgia Democrats gained 1,000 volunteers and saw a more than 300% uptick in donations in the last week.\n\n\"The last eight days have been a whole vibe in battleground Georgia,\" Williams, who will appear at the Atlanta rally, told CNN. \"We are seeing people energized and volunteering in ways that we have not seen in the past.\"\n\nEarly polls have shown Harris outperforming Biden against Trump with key groups within the Democratic coalition and erasing much of the popular vote lead Trump held over Biden.\n\nA Siena/New York Times poll released last week found that, in a head-to-head match up against Trump with likely voters, Hispanic voters favored Harris over the former president by a 24-point margin and voters ages 18-29 favored her by a 21-point margin. In an earlier poll released July 2, Biden held only 3- and 1-point leads with those groups, respectively, against Trump, within the margin of error.\n\nFor Democratic organizers, winning in Georgia isn't just about keeping the White House, but maintaining hard won gains in a state that has been promising to tilt blue for years.\n\nBiden's 2020 win in Georgia, when he beat former Trump by just under 12,000 votes, marked the first time a Democratic presidential candidate won the state in nearly 30 years. Weeks later, voters sent two Democratic senators - Ossoff and Warnock - to Washington.\n\nJay Williams, a Georgia-based Republican strategist, argued that those races were unique. \"At the end of the day, Georgia still is a right-leaning state,\" he said. \"It's not wildly right, but it is a right-leaning state.\"\n\nDespite the gains in late 2020 and early 2021, Abrams, Democrats' gubernatorial pick, was unable to win in a 2022 rematch against Republican Gov. Brian Kemp.\n\nDemocrats are hoping for a different outcome this November. Hillary Holley, who leads Care in Action, a group that advocates for domestic workers, said she believed the Democratic base was consolidating around Harris.\n\n\"Georgia was looking for something refreshing, something new that we could bring to voters and a sense of renewed hope,\" she said. \"And I think that's what we are now seeing.\"\n\nLaTosha Brown, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter, said Harris has invested a lot of time in the state, which could help her now that she's the presumptive nominee. But the vice president may also benefit from the work grassroots groups in the state have done to help make the state more competitive, Brown said.\n\n\"I think we're breaking up this red wall that many of us feel has created an agenda and policies that have been hurtful and harmful,\" Brown said. \"We have been working diligently over the last decade to actually build a real movement infrastructure.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

But the searing experience remains an indelible stain on her image. ... In short, there is no margin for the kind of errors that plagued her first presidential bid.\"\n\nTHE BURDEN OF WHAT IS -- The DONALD TRUMP attack-ad onslaught begins today.\n\nAfter being knocked off-kilter for a week by President JOE BIDEN's decision to end his re-election bid and the Democratic Party's quick embrace of Harris, the former president's campaign is ready to try and knock his new opponent down a few pegs.\n\nThe Trump campaign's first $12 million ad flight targeting Harris goes live in six swing states this morning, and it's all about the border -- tagging the VP as \"failed, weak, dangerously liberal.\"\n\n\"Under Harris, over 10 million illegally here. A quarter of a million Americans dead from fentanyl. Brutal migrant crimes. And ISIS -- now here,\" the voiceover says, cutting to footage from Harris'widely panned 2021 interview with NBC's Lester Holt, where she scoffs at a question about visiting the border. Watch the ad\n\nThe new offensive suggests that, after a week of scrambling to find the best message for attacking Trump's new rival, his campaign admakers are sticking with the tried-and-true. What's conspicuously not included are suggestions that she's a \"DEI hire,\" allegations she covered up Biden's mental state, clips of her laughing, mentions of Venn diagrams or any of the other attacks that have gone viral among the MAGA faithful but do little to move the needle among a broader audience.\n\nTrump won't have the airwaves to himself this week, of course. We're told the Harris campaign is expected to announce their own large media buy later this morning, coming on the heels of a $50 million commitment last week from the Future Forward super PAC. Expect to see upbeat, biographical efforts to reintroduce the VP as the new Democratic standard-bearer.\n\nBut Trump insiders aren't fretting. Far from it, according to our conversations last night with senior GOP officials, who remain confident that the sheen surrounding Harris will soon fade and their attacks on her record will sink in with critical swing voters.\n\n\"So Harris has a good week because Democrats are in such disarray that they had to force the sitting president to no longer run for president?\" one of those officials sarcastically asked. \"Has the Democratic base coalesced? Yes. But what we have yet to see is a true Kamala Harris. The vanity and rah-rah homecoming that they're having right now, it will wear off, and they'll come back down to earth.\"\n\nAccording to their theory of the case, Harris is actually a more tantalizing target than Biden ever was: In addition to targeting her record on the border, inflation and other policies as part of the Biden administration, Republicans are ready to exploit a trove of old clips from Harris' days trying to outflank other progressives during the 2020 presidential primary.\n\nWhile Republicans always struggled to convince voters that the relatively moderate Biden was a liberal boogeyman, they argue that Harris has the makings of a NANCY PELOSI 2.0. -- the former speaker whom Republicans relentlessly used in attack ads against all sorts of Democratic candidates over the years.\n\nSo far it's down-ballot Republicans who have seized most effectively on Harris' five-year-old utterances -- ranging from her vow to end private insurance (\"Let's move on\") to her dalliance with abolishing Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (\"We need to probably think about starting from scratch\") to her anti-fossil-fuels stances (\"There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking\") and her indulgence of the idea that incarcerated felons should be able to vote (\"I think we should have that conversation\").\n\nWe're told to expect Trump's campaign and the RNC to eventually follow suit. While those attacks aren't on broadcast TV yet, they've already started to post clips online of old Harris interviews, while the former president has tweaked Harris for some of those old positions on the campaign trail.\n\nThe Harris campaign is starting to rein in many of those old positions, starting with her erstwhile push to end fracking, which she first disavowed Friday in a campaign statement to The Hill's Rachel Frazin. Yesterday she backed off of her past support for a single-payer health system and mandatory assault weapon buybacks while insisting she supports increased border enforcement, as NYT's Reid J. Epstein reported -- essentially aligning her agenda with Biden's.\n\n\"The Harris campaign will rebut most of Republicans' attacks by arguing that they are exaggerating or lying about her record,\" Epstein continued, later quoting Harris campaign spokesman BRIAN FALLON arguing that Harris' \"years spent in law enforcement and her record in the Biden-Harris administration defy Trump's attempts to define her through lies.\"\n\nBut the Republicans we spoke to believe the mountain of video clips they have at the ready will speak louder than any campaign spokesperson's statement. And echoing what campaign insiders told the Daily Caller's Henry Rodgers, they don't believe Harris will be able to remain so disciplined once she finds herself in unscripted scenarios, such as sit-down interviews or the debate(s) that Trump is now acknowledging they'll \"probably\" have.\n\nIn short, the Harris bubble is deflating, they believe. Trump's favorability numbers are as high as they've ever been, insiders say, while the combination of Biden's sudden exit and running mate JD VANCE's rocky rollout combined to give Harris an undeniable early boost (one, they gripe, that got a big mainstream-media assist).\n\n\"It will come back down to earth,\" the senior GOP official said, \"when she is defined as the radical that she is.\"\n\nRelated reads: \"Kamala Harris' call for 'reproductive freedom' means restoring Roe,\" by Megan Messerly and Alice Miranda Ollstein ... \"Vance tells donors Harris change was a 'sucker punch,' at odds with campaign,\" by WaPo's Isaac Arnsdorf ... \"Vance had a bad week.

ROY COOPER withdrew his name from contention yesterday. \"Two Democrats close to Cooper cited three factors: His desire to potentially run for Senate, his age and fears that North Carolina's divisive Republican lieutenant governor would take over each time Cooper traveled out of state,\" Christopher Cadelago, Holly Otterbein, Meridith McGraw and Elena Schneider report.\n\nAs for a name that seems to gain more traction by the day? Look no further than Minnesota Gov. TIM WALZ, who some Dems argue could provide the ideal balance for Harris.\n\n\"Democrats running in rural, competitive districts this fall fear the former California senator and attorney general is poised to do even worse there than the president -- especially in battleground states in the upper Midwest. The 60-year-old Walz, who served 12 years in Congress representing a red, mostly rural southern Minnesota district, could bring the 'guy you would meet at a backyard barbecue in the Midwest' vibes to the ticket, they argue, which could help hold off another Democratic free fall in rural regions,\" Meredith Lee Hill and Elena Schneider report.\n\nVeep vetting: \"How a sexual harassment scandal involving a Josh Shapiro aide could affect the Pa. governor's VP chances,\" by the Philly Inquirer's Jeremy Roebuck and Gillian McGoldrick: \"His silence [about the departure of top aide MIKE VEREB] has drawn criticism from female state lawmakers in both parties, who have called for a more transparent accounting of what Shapiro knew about his aide's conduct and when.\"\n\nKeep dreaming: \"Organized labor is leading a quiet push for Vice President Kamala Harris to consider Sen.

Today, Arizona heads to the polls with a handful of interesting contests to keep an eye on.\n\nThe big name: KARI LAKE, who fell short in her 2022 gubernatorial campaign, is back in the mix, facing three other GOP opponents in the Senate primary. She is the overwhelming favorite to clinch the nomination, with Trump endorsing her and joining a campaign call last night.\n\n\"Speaking to listeners on a telephone call Monday for Lake's campaign, Trump called President Joe Biden's departure from the race a 'coup' by Democrats, repeatedly mispronounced Vice President Kamala Harris' name and said Lake would help him implement his plans for a second term,\" the Arizona Republic's Ronald Hansen reports.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Rep. RUBEN GALLEGO is running unopposed in his primary.\n\nThe big battle: In Arizona's 8th Congressional District, there's a big rivalry to watch between BLAKE MASTERS and ABE HAMADEH in the crowded and bitter GOP primary. Prior to this weekend, only Hamadeh carried the backing of Trump. But the former president also issued an endorsement for Masters (a close ally of JD VANCE and PETER THIEL). Both candidates had failed runs in 2022, with Masters falling short in his Senate bid and Hamadeh losing out on state AG. They face two other big-name opponents in state House Speaker BEN TOMA and former Rep. TRENT FRANKS.\n\nDem showdowns: In Arizona's 1st District, Democrats have a messy six-way primary to choose a candidate to take on GOP Rep. DAVID SCHWEIKERT. But the crowded race could leave the eventual nominee weakened for the general election against the vulnerable incumbent. And in the race to succeed Gallego in the deep-blue 3rd District, former state Sen. RAQUEL TER\u00c1N holds the blessing of the incumbent and home-state Sen. MARK KELLY. But a crypto-linked super PAC has been spending in the race to boost a different candidate, Phoenix City Councilor YASSAMIN ANSARI.\n\nMore top reads:\n\nAMERICA AND THE WORLD\n\nUNREST IN VENEZUELA -- The U.S. and several other countries yesterday raised doubts about Venezuelan President NICOL\u00c1S MADURO's reelection while the opposition leaders in the country claim that Maduro's victory over EDMUNDO GONZ\u00c1LEZ was fraudulent, WaPo's Samantha Schmidt, Leo Sands, Ana Vanessa Herrero and Marina Dias report from Caracas.\n\nThe details: \"The move by the electoral authority to declare victory but not release detailed voting results, which it had routinely done in past elections, intensified the sense among many Venezuelans and international observers that the election essentially had been stolen,\" NYT's Frances Robles, Jack Nicas and Alejandro Cegarra report.\n\nU.S. officials yesterday noted their \"concern\" about the election results, though they stopped short of demanding a recount or weighing sanctions.

After Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear stumped for Harris in Forsyth County on Sunday, the Harris campaign has maintained unprecedented momentum.\n\nAhead of today's rally in Atlanta, the Harris campaign has attracted new volunteers. 190,000 new volunteers signed up over the weekend, bringing the total to 360,000. Additionally, Vice President Harris's campaign has raised over $200 million in less than a week. Two-thirds of these contributions are from first-time donors.\n\n\"The infrastructure this campaign built to have the staffing, the volunteer infrastructure, the training, the collateral, the voter contact guidance and mechanisms, has been built diligently from the winter,\" said Battleground States Director Dan Kanninen. \"When you add to that, this incredible groundswell of support, all of those people get plugged in infrastructure that already exists. That's primed and ready to turn that into direct action.\"\n\nDuring a White Dudes for Harris call Monday evening, more than 120,000 White men raised $2 million for the Harris campaign in the first 20 minutes. This comes on the heels of a zoom call with Win With Black Women that hosted 44,000 attendees and raised more than $1.5 million on Sunday, July 21st. The following day, a group of Black men under a similar banner, Win With Black Men. Hosted by Roland Martin, attracted nearly 54,000 attendees and raised $1.3 million.\n\nDuring a press call Monday afternoon, the Harris campaign realizes the election will be close. That's why mobilizing the coalitions is the key for the Democrats.\n\n\"The last campaign ultimately ended when Georgia was famously decided by 11,780 votes in 2020,\" said Michael Tyler, the Harris campaign's communications director. \"And we expected to be as close as competitive this year. That's why we have the team and the operation in place to make sure that we can turn out every single voter in the state of Georgia.\"\n\nAccording to the latest polling conducted by Emerson, Trump leads Harris by two points Georgia (48% to 46%). 7% of voters are undecided. In their previous poll, Trump was leading President Joe Biden by six points.\n\nMegan Thee Stallion will join Vice President Harris in Atlanta today. The three-time GRAMMY Award Winner confirmed the news on her Instagram page Monday evening. Megan's endorsement of Harris follows those from Cardi B, Lizzo, Charli XCX and more. Last week, Beyonc\u00e9 permitted Harris to use \"Freedom\" as her walk out music.

How can they attack likely Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris after spending years focusing the strategy on Biden?\n\nWhile most of the strategic foundation should stay the same, given Harris' role in the Biden administration, there are new opportunities against the vice president and a few pitfalls that Republicans would be wise to avoid but have already stepped in.\n\nWhile attacking politicians personally has become a staple of American politics, the Republican Party should tread carefully. Certain attacks, which include how Harris laughs, come off as childish and ignore the real issues that matter to Americans, which Harris and the Democrats are weak on.\n\nIf Republicans believe we have a better platform for Americans, this is an opportunity to show it.\n\nThe through line of the GOP strategy against Harris should be holding her accountable for the Biden administration's record that has given the Republicans any momentum they had before he dropped out. Highlighting that Harris has already been in the White House under an extremely unpopular administration should be the center of their attacks.\n\nHammering Harris on the economy, immigration and other issues Donald Trump holds more favorability on should be the GOP focus. Most Americans disapproved of Biden. Harris, as his vice president, was part of that disapproval.\n\nIn this sense, the GOP attack plan should remain the same. Simply asking Americans if they are better off now than they were under the Trump administration is a powerful question.\n\nHarris VP pick? Republicans, pay attention to who Harris picks for VP. One of them should scare us.\n\nAdditionally, Harris has no shortage of personal weak points.\n\nWhen she ran for president in 2020, then-Sen. Harris of California attempted to differentiate herself by leaning into progressive policy. She said she opposed hydraulic fracturing to extract oil and gas, would consider abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, opposed hiring more law enforcement officers and supported mandatory buyback programs for certain firearms.\n\nThe immigration stances are particularly damning for Harris, given the record high level of illegal crossing attempts our country faced last year and her critical role in addressing the root causes of migration for Biden.\n\nHowever, these radical stances can and should be used as a preview of what a Harris administration could bring. If she walks these stances back, as she has when it comes to her position on fracking, then the GOP should highlight her disingenuous nature.\n\nThen there is the question of how much Harris was complicit in attempts to hide Biden's mental decline from voters. This is important for the election and for accountability.\n\nHarris was in the White House alongside Biden as it became clear he was not fit for office, and she certainly had insight into how fragile the president had become. The vice president consistently defended Biden's mental fitness against criticisms from the news media, despite what she must have known from her interactions with him. She had to have seen that Biden was not mentally fit for office.\n\nCongress should investigate Harris' role in covering up the truth. She will have a lot to answer for there.\n\nDemocrats have been eager to label Republicans as sexist, racist, homophobic or any other -ism in the book for how they've responded to Harris. Republicans should deprive them of chances to do so by stopping some of the reaction that came immediately after Harris took over for Biden.\n\nGOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance quickly came under fire for referring to prominent Democrats as \"childless cat ladies.\" Harris, who has stepchildren, was one of the names he highlighted.\n\nThese sorts of remarks are not helpful to the Republican cause of winning in November and will not be popular among suburban female voters, an important group for former President Trump's chances at reelection. In fact, early polling shows Harris gaining ground that Biden had lost with women voters. Vance's comments will make that worse for Republicans.\n\nTrump GOP abandons pro-life activists: New Republican platform makes one thing clear. We've dropped the anti-abortion effort.\n\nOne misguided attack against her has been the charge that she is a \"DEI\" candidate due to Biden's promise in the 2020 election to pick a woman to be his vice president, as well as his focus on Black women throughout the search.\n\nRepublicans can call Harris unqualified without a framing that is off-putting to some moderates. Instead, highlighting the failed record of the Biden administration will force the vice president to either take credit for it or admit she had no control in the White House the past four years.\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app? Download it for free from your app store.\n\nAccording to news reports, the National Republican Senatorial Committee issued a memo last week that outlined attacks against Harris, including a section simply labeled \"weird,\" which included her laugh, her love of Venn diagrams and her enthusiasm for school buses. None of these attacks are actually productive, and I'm not sure why Republicans insist on including them in official memos.\n\nHarris has no shortage of policy decisions -both hers and Biden's - that leave her vulnerable to attack, and the GOP would be wise to stick to that. Anything else is unnecessary and a distraction from what matters.\n\nDace Potas is an opinion columnist for USA TODAY and a graduate of DePaul University with a degree in political science.\n\nYou can

Harris will campaign there Tuesday", "body": "ATLANTA (AP) -- Little more than a week ago, Georgia appeared to be slipping out of the Democrats' reach: President Joe Biden 's campaign pledged to concentrate more on holding the Midwestern \" blue wall\" states and indicated they might be willing to forsake \"Sun Belt\" battlegrounds.\n\nBut now that Biden has bowed out of the race and Vice President Kamala Harris is the likely nominee, Democrats say they have new hope for the state. They're betting that a fresh burst of energy and a surge in fundraising has helped make Georgia -- the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020 -- a toss-up again.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nHarris is planning to make a show of political force with a rally in Atlanta on Tuesday night that will feature a performance by hip hop star Megan Thee Stallion, the latest example of just how much the race against Republican Donald Trump has shifted since Biden abandoned his reelection bid. She will be appearing in the same city where Biden's dismal performance in a debate against Trump on June 27 sparked a Democratic revolt that ultimately ended his campaign.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHarris is hoping a large rally will help affirm her campaign's momentum. Her campaign argues that Harris' appeal with young people, working-age women and non-white voters have scrambled the dynamics in Georgia and other states that are demographically similar, from North Carolina to Nevada and Arizona.\n\n\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams, a congresswoman from Atlanta. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"\n\nIn a strategy memo released after the president left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who held the same role for Biden, reaffirmed the importance of winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a trio of industrial states that have formed the traditional Democratic blue wall.\n\nBut she also argued that the vice president's place atop the ticket \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" and described them as \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" in places like Georgia.\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut they concede that the landscape suddenly looks much closer to 2020 - when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points -- than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt.\n\n\"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"\n\nRobinson said Harris still has plenty of liabilities, including the progressive positions she took in her failed 2020 primary campaign and her various rhetorical stumbles. But he said Harris so far in this campaign has been \"in command,\" and if that continues \"we have a new ballgame and she will be competitive in Georgia.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt did not give similar ground. She dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDemocrats are betting that a combination of high turnout among traditional, core Democratic constituencies, as well as a strong showing in the suburbs and small pickups elsewhere can be enough for Harris to carry Georgia. That approach was on display at the weekend office openings.\n\nOn Saturday, the venue was East Point, a majority Black municipality and Democratic stronghold south of Atlanta. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., was the featured guest, telling a crowd of mostly Black women that they were the key to victory -- \"the people who are really going to save the country.\"\n\nA day later, it was Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, among several contenders Harris is considering for her running mate, campaigning in Forsyth County. The area is historically very conservative, though Democrats have narrowed the GOP margins in recent cycles.\n\n\"Every county matters,\" Beshear said, holding out his ability to win two governor's races in Kentucky despite Trump's domination of the state in presidential elections.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said in a recent interview that the best GOP campaigns can win comfortably in Georgia but bad efforts -- combined with strong Democratic campaigns -- lose.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDemocrats recently have held wide advantages in the core of metro Atlanta, where Jayapal spoke. The party also performed well in Columbus and Savannah, as well as some rural, majority-Black counties. But Republicans dominated in other rural areas and small towns and cities -- where Trump has held multiple rallies in recent years.\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs, like those where Beshear campaigned on Sunday, offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist -- I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" Smith said.\n\n___\n\nWeissert reported from Washington.\n\nRead more on the U.S. Election at thestar.com", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "will_weissert@thestar.com", "name": "Will Weissert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikema_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikema Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Belt_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sun Belt Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jen_O'Malley_Dillon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jen O'Malley Dillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State governments of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

The Harris and Trump campaigns both launched attempts to define the all-but-certain Democratic nominee with major new television advertisements out Tuesday, the first since President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race.\n\nA new 60-second ad from Harris, titled \"Fearless,\" is heavy on biographical details, portraying her ascent to the vice presidency as a yearslong crusade of holding banks, drug companies and criminals accountable as a prosecutor. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump is going all-in on the \"border czar\" tagline, attacking Harris as \"failed, weak and dangerously liberal\" in two 30-second spots that include footage from Harris' 2021 interview with NBC News' Lester Holt in Guatemala, where she was criticized for dismissing a question about why she hadn't visited the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe new ads are part of major new campaigns, the first since Biden's exit reshaped the race and upended both candidates' plans of attack. And they represent the opening salvo of a 100-day election sprint unlike any presidential campaign in modern history: Harris is hoping to ride her honeymoon phase -- and high favorables -- into November, while Trump aims to put an end to Democrats' newfound invigoration as quickly as possible, reverting to similar attack lines that he used against Biden.\n\nThe \"Fearless\" Harris ad is part of a $50 million national placement through the Democratic National Convention on Aug. 19, Harris' campaign said. According to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact, the campaign was reserving airtime in the seven states where Biden had been advertising -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- and also adding the Omaha, Nebraska, market.\n\nThe ad will run on local and national broadcast television, cable programming, streaming and social channels, the campaign said -- including spots during the Paris Olympics and major shows like \"The Bachelorette\" and \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.\" Though the Harris campaign released the ad on Tuesday, it won't begin airing on broadcast TV until Wednesday, according to AdImpact.\n\nThe campaign has $175.4 million in future reservations through Election Day, according to AdImpact. The Harris ad comes on the heels of a $50 million advertising pledge announced by the Future Forward super PAC, which had previously supported Biden, last week.\n\nWhile Harris' ad concludes with a warning of Trump's desire to \"take our country backward\" by providing tax breaks to billionaires and repealing the Affordable Care Act, the former president's campaign continues to hit Harris as \"America's border czar\" in its ad.\n\nThe first Trump ad, which began airing on Tuesday, portrays Harris dancing to hip hop at a White House party and deflecting questions during an interview about visiting the border while the narrator argues that millions of people have illegally crossed the border, and 250,000 Americans have died from fentanyl, \"on Harris's watch.\"\n\nThe second new Trump spot makes a similar argument, using footage from the same NBC News interview while swapping in a clip of Harris laughing. Both are part of a $12.2 million ad buy through Aug. 12 and distributed across six swing states: Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan and Nevada. The Trump campaign, which is not matching Harris' ads in North Carolina or Omaha, has $112.7 million in future reservations through Election Day, according to AdImpact.", "source": {"uri":

Donald Trump had a comfortable lead in Arizona polls and had just trounced Joe Biden in the first presidential debate of 2024.\n\n\"We are going to be here as often as it takes and we're really focusing on states like Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia. But we also have new states that are going on the map,\" RNC Chair Michael Whatley said July 2 at a Trump office opening in Casa Grande. \"We've now started to engage in Minnesota and in Virginia and in New Hampshire. So we're playing offense all around the country.\"\n\nHe didn't know the presidential race was about to turn upside down.\n\nOver the next three weeks, Trump would survive an assassination attempt, accept his party's nomination and then be forced to recalibrate his entire campaign against a new Democratic opponent. And Democrats, who were all but writing off Arizona's presidential election thanks to Biden's anemic approval ratings, have an uncharacteristic pep in their step and say they are seeing a deluge of new donors.\n\n\"This is gonna be one of those kind of totally crazy, whac-a-mole elections. We don't know what's coming next. We really don't,\" said Brian Murray, former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party. \"A lot of times I feel like you can predict out and say, 'This is how we expect things to happen.' But with Trump, you really just can't.\"\n\nThe new dynamic is hardly a guarantee that presumptive nominee Vice President Kamala Harris could carry Arizona. Biden won here by fewer than 11,000 votes in 2020, and Harris has her own challenges, especially when it comes to immigration. But the race certainly shows signs of being a closer contest than it was when Whatley came to open Trump's campaign outpost and Democrats were in crisis over Biden's bad poll numbers.\n\nTrump's campaign activity is ramping up in Arizona, too. The former president still has a much lighter footprint than the Biden and Harris campaigns in Arizona, but he is dispatching running mate JD Vance to Glendale for a rally this week and has opened two new campaign offices over the last several weeks.\n\nVance will take aim at Harris during his visit, rushing to define her as the new dynamics of the race take shape.\n\n\"People are really excited,\" Arizona Democratic Party chair Yolanda Bejarano told reporters last week. \"We are going to take advantage of the moment.\"\n\nHarris \"probably has a better shot\" in Arizona than Biden did, said Emerson College pollster Matt Taglia, but the vice president starts her campaign behind Trump. His latest Arizona poll showed Trump with 49% of support and Harris with 44%. Harris outperformed Biden by four percentage points: the president had 40% of support in the last Emerson poll before he dropped out of the race.\n\n\"We have seen some real shifts. That said, she's still behind in Arizona by about five points to Trump,\" Taglia said.\n\nArizona is a crucial battleground state for both presidential campaigns. Biden won here by the most narrow margin of any state in 2020, and Republicans challenged the election results for years. Before he dropped out, Biden's campaign said he would focus on the so-called Blue Wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to score an Electoral College victory.\n\nThe early days of the Harris campaign could indicate she sees Arizona as more central to a win, especially if she chooses Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., as her running mate. Kelly's name on the ballot could force Republicans to spend more time and money in Arizona to protect their lead rather than spending that cash to flip blue states such as Minnesota.\n\n\"If they pick Kelly, what they're saying is they think they can win Arizona,\" Murray said. \"Trump's got this place pretty well locked down. Their only chance would be to take Kelly, and I'm not certain that that's even enough for them to retake Arizona.\"\n\nKelly has a more optimistic view. Arizona is \"100% winnable\" for Democrats, he told reporters last week.\n\n\"I won it twice, President Biden won it in 2020, and Kamala Harris is going to win it here,\" said Kelly, who Harris reportedly invited to submit vice presidential vetting materials as she weighs who to tap as her second in command.\n\nA frequent criticism from Democrats is that Trump is not in Arizona enough and has a smaller ground game than the vice president, who took over Biden's campaign operation. Trump has fewer offices than Harris (Trump has 8 and Harris has 12), and Democrats are using a $1.5 million transfer from the Democratic National Committee to grow their staff even larger.\n\n\"Rushing to open offices after months of overlooking the state won't distract Arizonans from Trump's Project 2025 agenda of banning abortion nationwide, raising costs on hardworking families and making our communities less safe. There is no question this is going to be a close race, but Team Harris isn't taking a single voter for granted, and we have the energy, the momentum, and strong campaign infrastructure to win,\" Jacques Petit, Harris's Arizona communications director, said in a written statement.\n\nTrump has been to Arizona once this election cycle for a large rally. Harris has taken six trips here during her time in the Biden administration, although she hasn't visited since becoming the presumptive nominee last week. The Harris campaign has also held more events and news conferences to get its message out to voters.\n\nThe Harris campaign said more than 1,300 people engaged with the 67 events it hosted across Arizona over the weekend, which included canvasses, phone banks, watch parties and other gatherings. The campaign had 140 volunteers and supporters knock on 5,000 doors, and made nearly 5,500 calls across 152 phone banking sessions.\n\nAlthough he's spent less time in Arizona, Trump is giving the state some extra attention lately. The former president teamed up with a Border Patrol agent from Arizona to make the case against Harris on an immigration-focused press call, and his Arizona campaign recently held a \"Trump Campaign's 100 Day Weekend of Action\" event to mark the last 100 days before the election.\n\nThe pro-Trump super PAC Maga Inc. says it will spend $12 million a week on battleground state TV ads attacking Harris in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Georgia through Labor Day.\n\n\"For months, our staff and volunteers have been recruiting thousands of volunteers to be poll watchers and poll workers, and activating thousands of Trump Force 47 captains, who are talking neighbor-to-neighbor about the key issues Arizonans care about,\" Halee Dobbins, the RNC Arizona state communications director, said in a written statement.\n\nTrump's backers in Arizona say the former president does not need to make a personal trip to Arizona any time soon.\n\n\"He's a busy guy,\" said Joe Arpaio, the former Maricopa County sheriff who Trump kissed on stage at a Phoenix rally in June.\n\nThe Democratic and Republican candidates are so different, said another Trump supporter, that few voters will be swayed ahead of November.\n\n\"Is it going to be a sales pitch that gets someone undecided over the line? I don't see it, so I'm not the least bit critical of the Trump campaign,\" said Jim O'Connor, a Republican on the Arizona Corporation Commission who served as a Trump elector in 2016. \"Just as one strong Republican influential voter, I don't need Trump to make another visit to Arizona if he can spend his time elsewhere.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Democratic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Democratic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emerson College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidential nominee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Republican_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Republican Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

It's an attempt to even the score with Republicans, who have been outspending Democrats on the airwaves during a chaotic summer when President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed Harris.\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion will join Vice President Kamala Harris for a special performance during her campaign stop in Atlanta on Tuesday.\n\nA Harris campaign spokesperson confirmed the hip-hop star's performance alongside the vice president in a post on X on Monday night.\n\nThe Harris campaign is promising a large rally in Atlanta, on par with the large events that Republican former President Donald Trump has made his signature.\n\nIf Vice President Kamala Harris were to ascend to the presidency, she would become the first female president, but also one who is also multiracial.\n\nThe daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, both of whom immigrated to the U.S. during the Civil Rights Movement, Harris' historic presidential bid has again put a spotlight on American identity politics and the growing number of people who say they are multiracial.\n\nDifferent countries divide people into categories depending on different national traditions. The U.S., with its slavery-molded history, divides people into Black or white, and nine million people identified as multiracial in 2010.\n\nWhen Harris ran for vice president in 2020, 33.8 million people in the U.S. identified as being more than one race, according to the census.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The rapidly increasing donations show that \"Democrats are also united,\" West noted.\n\nPrior to this week, Trump was running on the discontent people have had throughout the Biden administration. \"I think that's a weaker play now that Biden himself is no longer on the ballot,\" Galdieri said.\n\nMoreover, at 59 years old, Harris is much younger than Trump, which could go a long way with young voters, experts said.\n\nClay Ramsay, a researcher at the Center for International and Security Studies at the University of Maryland, noted that Harris has inherited all the money of the Biden campaign.\n\nShe has also inherited experienced people and a large ground operation to get out the vote, Ramsay told Xinhua.\n\nHarris has been the number two person in an unpopular administration.\n\nIn a Gallup poll conducted between July 1-July 21 -- almost entirely before he announced withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race -- Biden received a 36 percent job approval rating from the American people, his lowest to date.\n\nGaldieri said Harris could struggle being blamed for the same things voters blamed Biden for.\n\nIndeed, the last few years have seen surging prices for food, rent and the purchase of homes. Millions of migrants continue to illegally surge over the southern U.S. border -- a crucial issue for Americans.\n\nChristian Holland, an IT professional outside of Washington, told Xinhua: \"People see Harris as an extension of Biden\" and won't vote for her.\n\nHarris's far left record could also prove to be an obstacle for her. She served as California attorney general and as a senator representing the blue state.\n\nHarris was criticized by conservative media for voicing support for the \"defund the police\" movement in June 2020, amid the riots that terrorized residents of cities nationwide for months.\n\nThat occurred before she was vice president.\n\nMoreover, she's been a low-profile vice president, and might not do well in terms of name recognition, experts said.\n\nBy sharp contrast, many are embracing Trump as a candidate who has shown courage under fire during an attempted assassination earlier this month.\n\nAfter a bullet grazed his ear, a defiant Trump stood up and yelled \"Fight! Fight!\" to supporters at a rally, while blood ran down his face.\n\nImages of the event have grabbed headlines worldwide, and garnered sympathy even from Trump's enemies.\n\nRamsay said Harris's most important weakness is that anything she does and says that looks \"unprepared\" will be seized upon.\n\nIf that occurs, \"she will be labeled as a lightweight, and not just by Trump's side -- much of the U.S. media won't give her a chance either,\" Ramsay said.\n\nIn Friday's RealClearPolitics' average of polls, Harris trailed Trump in the key battleground states Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona and Georgia.\n\nIn Wisconsin and Michigan, Trump led only by 0.7 percentage point and 1.0 point, respectively. That's well within the margin of error.\n\nBut Trump led Harris in Arizona at a hefty 6.4 percent, and in Georgia with a sizable 4.5 percent. In Pennsylvania, Trump led by 3.0 percent. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xinhua News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Anselm_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint Anselm College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallup,_Inc.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gallup, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_out_the_vote", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Get out the vote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brookings_Institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brookings Institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maryland,_College_Park", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Maryland, College Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defund_the_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defund the police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Here's how she stacks up against former President Donald Trump and his running mate, J.D. Vance.\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, are hoping that Biden's declining popularity and concerns about rising consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nBut they acknowledge that a recent surge in support for the expected Democratic nominee has made the political landscape suddenly look a lot closer to 2020 -- when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points -- than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and survived an assassination attempt.\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee only recently opened their first offices in Georgia.\n\nDemocrats are betting that a strong turnout in traditional Democratic constituencies, plus a strong showing in suburban and small districts elsewhere, will be enough for Harris to win Georgia. That approach was on display at polling stations this weekend.\n\nGeorgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp said in a recent interview that the best Republican campaigns can win easily in Georgia, but bad efforts -- combined with strong Democratic campaigns -- lose. Kemp, for example, won reelection by 7.5 percentage points in 2022 over national Democratic star Stacey Abrams. Yet in the same election cycle, Georgians reelected Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock over his Republican opponent Herschel Walker, who was endorsed by Trump.\n\nIn recent elections, Democrats had a large advantage in the heart of metro Atlanta. The party also did well in Columbus and Savannah, as well as in some rural, majority-black counties.

JD Vance (R-Ohio), privately told donors that running against Vice President Harris instead of President Biden made the race more challenging -- an admission at odds with the Donald Trump campaign's public projections of confidence.\n\n\"All of us were hit with a little bit of a political sucker punch,\" Vance said about Biden's withdrawal on July 21, according to a recording of his remarks at a Saturday fundraiser in Golden Valley, Minn. \"The bad news is that Kamala Harris does not have the same baggage as Joe Biden, because whatever we might have to say, Kamala is a lot younger. And Kamala Harris is obviously not struggling in the same ways that Joe Biden did.\"\n\nPublicly, the Trump campaign has insisted that Harris replacing Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket has not changed the race, arguing that she shares responsibility for public dissatisfaction with Biden's leadership. Vance told reporters on July 22, a day after Biden dropped out of the race, that there was no difference in running against Harris vs. Biden.\n\nRead more: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/29/jd-vance-kamala-harris-campaign/", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773409", "eventUri": "eng-9773409", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-21", "textStart": 679, "textEnd": 686}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "textStart": 1254, "textEnd": 1261}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

And Kamala Harris is obviously not struggling in the same ways that Joe Biden did,\" he said.\n\nMr Vance's admission comes in stark contrast with the messaging from Donald Trump's campaign, which has repeatedly insisted that Mr Biden's replacement has not changed the November race.\n\nTrump has dismissed Ms Harris as \"worse than Joe\", while Jason Miller, one of Trump's advisors, said in a recent interview: \"Democrats are a bit of jumping out of the frying pan into the fire. And they may have gotten rid of one problem with Joe Biden, but they've inherited a whole new problem with Kamala Harris.\"\n\nSpeaking on Saturday, Mr Vance reportedly said that Republicans will now work to shape public opinion of Ms Harris.\n\n\"We have a very unique opportunity, but also a very unique challenge, because, let's be honest, 10 days ago, the two candidates who were running for president, everybody had an opinion about 'em.

Ms Harris also denounced the \"defund the police\" movement after becoming Mr Biden's running mate, while the current administration opposes decriminalising border crossings.\n\nRecent polls have indicated that Ms Harris and Trump are essentially tied, setting the stage for a tight campaign race.\n\nSince her endorsement, Ms Harris's election campaign has raised $200 million, signed up 170,000 new volunteers and secured support from the majority of delegates at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nThe official vote on whether she will become the party's nominee for president will take place on August 1.\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, who briefly served as Trump's communications director during his term in office, said Mr Vance would be fired eventually.\n\n\"This will be one of the main reasons,\" he said, referring to the leaked clip. \"They will barely talk to one another after this.\"", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "harriet_barber@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Harriet Barber", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fracking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defund_the_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defund the police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Scaramucci", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Scaramucci"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Communications_Director", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Communications Director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/en-us/politics/2024/07/30/TELEMMGLPICT000387438753_17223339409180-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqRo0U4xU-30oDveS4pXV-Vv4Xpit_DMGvdp2n7FDd82k.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773409", "eventUri": "eng-9773409", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-21", "textStart": 299, "textEnd": 306}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 2695, "textEnd": 2703}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Billboard was the first to report about Stallion giving a \"special performance\" at the rally.\n\nDemocrats have quickly rallied behind the vice president after President Joe Biden announced that he was dropping out of the 2024 race a little over a week ago. Harris has also earned endorsements from several pop-culture stars, including British artist Charli XCX, whose latest album Brat has become a branding tool for the vice president's campaign.\n\nOther celebrities to endorse Harris early into her campaign include singer and actress Demi Lovato, singer-songwriter John Legend, American actor George Clooney and Star Wars icon Mark Hamill. The vice president was also granted permission from Beyonc\u00e9 to use the Grammy-Award winning artist's song, Freedom, at her first rally in Wisconsin last week.\n\nHarris is also not short on endorsements from party leaders. Within her first 48 hours of running for president, the vice president was backed by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Representative and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Former President Barack Obama endorsed Harris along with his wife, former first lady Michelle Obama, late last week.\n\nFormer President and GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump had a wave of public figures show their support for his reelection campaign during the Republican National Convention this month. Model and rapper Amber Rose gave a passionate speech endorsing Trump on the first day of the convention, and singer and rapper Kid Rock performed his hit American Bad Ass before the former president gave his keynote address on the last day of the event.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Trump's campaign via email for comment on Harris' plans for Tuesday's rally.\n\nThe momentum behind Harris has helped Democrats close the gap on Trump and Republicans in national polling. Voter surveys have also shown the former president's lead shrink in key swing states like Georgia, which Biden flipped in the 2020 election when he defeated Trump. According to a recent poll by Landmark Communications, Trump was trailing Harris by 1.3 percentage points (48 percent to 46.7 percent) in a hypothetical head-to-head match among likely voters in the Peach State. When other candidates were included, Trump beat Harris by 1.5 points (45.8 percent to 44.3 percent).\n\nIn a separate poll last week by Emerson College Polling and The Hill, Trump was leading Harris by 2 percentage points in Georgia, which fell within the survey's margin of error of 3.4 points. The gap was also a notable improvement from Biden's performance against Trump in Georgia. Earlier this month, a separate poll from Emerson and The Hill found the president trailing by 5 percentage points.\n\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections

Liberals circulated on social media that conservative Fox host Brian Kilmeade said Harris planned to speak to a \"colored\" sorority when in fact Kilmeade said \"college sorority.\"\n\nThe media and Democrats, including DNC chair Jaime Harrison, circulated the false claim anyway.\n\nIt shows what the public is going to see for the next four months.\n\nHarris supporters have also been trying to make Harris seem hip by showing videos of her dancing and calling her \"brat\" - a term of endearment from a Charli XCX song.\n\nIt's an attempt to reintroduce and rebrand the unpopular Harris, but it's a persona that Harris doesn't possess. And to voters, it's questionable whether it will work.\n\nDemocrats tried the same thing with Hillary Clinton eight years ago - remember the \"I'm with Her\" t-shirts? - and Donald Trump clobbered her on Election Day anyway.\n\nThe Boston Globe claimed in a story that Democrats are bracing for a \"perfect storm\" of the \"Godzilla of racial and misogynistic campaigning\" in the next few months.\n\nThey based it on the fact that Trump made fun of Hillary Clinton's appearance in 2016 and circulated the claim that Barack Obama was not born in the U.S.\n\nTrump has also made fun of Harris's \"cackling\" laugh.\n\n\"Hear me when I say I know Donald Trump's type,\" Harris said at a campaign event. \"And in this campaign, I promise you, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week.\"\n\nHarris's record is fair game in this election, despite what Democrats may say.\n\nShe has an abysmal record on immigration, and can get defensive when criticized - like she did when Republicans blasted her for not going to the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\"And I haven't been to Europe,\" Harris retorted snidely.\n\nOn a trip to Mexico and Central America, Harris told migrants \"do not come\" to the U.S. - a clip that was widely panned by immigration advocates and liberals.\n\nHarris could ride the wave of feel-good stories to close on Trump in the polls in the coming weeks, especially after the Democratic convention coronates her.\n\nBut so far there's little evidence Democrats have gotten a big boost. Harris in fact has a much different image to moderate and young voters especially.\n\nA poll conducted by Quinnipiac University in the last few days showed Trump actually crushing Harris among younger voters.\n\nIn the 18-34 age group, Trump got 58% of voters while Harris trailed with just 39%.\n\nThe poll was surprising because most pundits have assumed the younger Harris would fare much better than 81-year-old Joe Biden among voters in that age group.\n\n\"The dramatic reset at the top of the Democratic ticket does little to move the race as Vice President Harris enters the fray with numbers similar to President Biden,\" polling analyst Tim Malloy said.\n\nVisit at bostonherald.com.

Republicans are promising renewed energy of their own. And Harris' visit signals Georgia could be even more hotly contested than expected.\n\nThroughout her visit, Harris will be surrounded by living symbols of her party's breakthrough success in Georgia. She'll be greeted by U.S. Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, whose 2021 runoff victories helped secure Biden's policy agenda in the Senate.\n\nBut she'll also be reminded of Democratic limitations in Georgia, a state once so solidly Republican that presidential contenders didn't bother to campaign here.\n\nAmong those expected to welcome the vice president is Stacey Abrams, who was twice unable to channel enthusiasm and energy around her campaigns for governor into a winning coalition.\n\nAnd Harris will get a glimpse of the party's potential reach. Former Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, one of the most prominent Republicans to endorse Harris, has become a de facto spokesman for disaffected conservatives. He's scheduled to be on hand during the Harris event.\n\nThe visit comes at a pivotal moment in her nascent presidential bid. Social media is exploding with sunny pro-Harris memes, and her campaign coffers are bursting with fresh donations. Aides report thousands of volunteers staffed dozens of Georgia events for Harris this weekend.\n\nBut she is also facing escalating attacks from Trump and his allies, along with mounting pressure to pick a running mate before an Aug. 7 deadline.\n\nIn Georgia, Harris and her allies must fight to reassemble the fractious coalition of Black voters, independents, suburbanites and frustrated Republicans who propelled Biden's narrow victory in Georgia in 2020.\n\nAnd she must balance the tricky task of running for president on her shared record with Biden even while pushing to create her own policy platform that separates from the president's agenda without conflicting with it.\n\nDemocrats are competing for Georgia with a vast campaign apparatus, boasting more than 170 staffers scattered throughout 24 offices. Harris spokesman Michael Tyler calls it the \"largest in-state operation of any Democratic presidential campaign cycle ever.\"\n\nIt's fueled a guarded optimism that wasn't there before. Gov. Roy Barnes, the last Democrat to hold Georgia's highest office, acknowledged what few party leaders would say publicly a few weeks ago: The race in Georgia was tilting decisively toward Trump.\n\n\"Initially, because of all the angst, if I were betting that I'd have to say that Trump was going to win,\" he said Monday on \"Politically Georgia.\" Then came Biden's withdrawal and Republican struggles to blunt what they call the \" Harris honeymoon. \"\n\nNow, Barnes said he's confident that Harris has more than a \"fighting chance\" to keep Georgia in the blue column.\n\nHis advice to her strategists: focus on younger Georgians, \"quit worrying about angry old white men\" and contrast her background as a prosecutor with Trump's legal troubles.\n\n\"Because who's on the other side? Someone convicted of 34 felonies and still has felony cases pending here in Georgia.\"\n\nA presidential 'pathway'\n\nSenior Republicans also say Georgia is suddenly more competitive, but for different reasons.\n\nGeorgia GOP Chair Josh McKoon has crisscrossed the state for months warning conservatives not to get complacent, and he headlined a weekend event that drew more than 200 volunteers who trained to be poll watchers.\n\nHe said Harris' ascension to the top of the ticket has \"narrowed the electoral map considerably\" by shifting the focus from the Rust Belt states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to other battlegrounds.\n\nTrump and his newly christened running mate, U.S. Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, are set to headline events this week in other competitive states: Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania.\n\n\"While President Biden had a plausible path to victory without Georgia, it seems virtually impossible for a Harris win without our state,\" McKoon said. \"So I would expect her to campaign in Georgia to try to establish a pathway.\"\n\nPolls throughout the past year have largely showed Trump with a lead over Biden, though the few that have been published since Harris became the presumptive nominee indicate the race has tightened.\n\nBrian Robinson, a veteran GOP strategist who was one of then-Gov. Nathan Deal's chief advisers, said Harris' success might hinge on a factor that emerged in many of the polls: lagging Democratic support among Black men.\n\n\"I'm open-minded until I see data on that, but it's my hunch this doesn't move the needle with those voters,\" he said. \"I think it's status quo.\"\n\nThe 30-30 formula\n\nAt the center of Harris' campaign argument in Georgia is support for expanded abortion rights, which she hopes will both galvanize party loyalists and middle-of-the-road voters two years after Trump's appointees to the U.S. Supreme Court helped reverse Roe v. Wade.\n\nSonja Adcock, an Oconee County Democratic organizer, said she's confident Harris will put forward a plan to reinstate abortion protections \"so we don't have to live in fear of basic human rights being taken away every transfer of power from one president to the next.\"\n\nShe speaks of Harris as many stalwart supporters do -- in lofty terms, as a ray of hope who can \"turn the tide\" against Trump. But veteran Democrats still warn the vice president faces an uphill battle.\n\nRick Dent was a top adviser to then-Gov. Zell Miller and other party officials, carving out a reputation as an unvarnished truth-teller. He said Democrats would be foolish to grow overconfident by metrics that indicate soaring Black turnout in Georgia.\n\n\"The math never changes. It's the 30-30 rule -- the only way a Democrat can win in the state of Georgia,\" Dent said.\n\nThat rule posits that Democrats must win 30% of the white vote and Black voters must make up at least 30% of the overall turnout for the party to have a solid chance of prevailing.\n\n\"You have to energize the African American vote,\" Dent said. \"But if you don't hit those thresholds of white voters, you're not going to win Georgia.\"\n\nHarris' campaign said it's battling for voters on several fronts and has opened offices in often-overlooked parts of the state, including rural Jenkins and Washington counties.\n\nTyler, her spokesman, noted that Tuesday's journey will mark 15 times that Harris has traveled to Georgia since becoming vice president. There will be more visits to come in the next few weeks, he added.\n\n\"We know the next 99 days will be a marathon at a sprint's pace,\" he said.\n\n-------\n\n\u00a92024 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

After his announcement, Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor.\n\nMajor Democratic Party figures including Clintons and Obamas quickly rallied behind her, and with ample delegate support, Harris is now poised to become the Democratic presidential nominee. Her campaign launch has revitalised Democratic hopes of preventing a second Trump presidency. New polls indicate a tight race with no clear leader, showing a shift from Trump's previous lead.\n\nKamala Harris's journey is historic. As the first Black woman and Asian American vice president, she is now set to potentially lead a major party ticket. The daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, Harris began her career as a prosecutor and spent nearly three decades in law enforcement.\n\nShe started as a local prosecutor, became district attorney of San Francisco, and was elected California attorney general in 2011. Notably, she has never lost a general election, including her Senate run in 2017, where she became the second Black woman ever elected to the US Senate. In the Senate, Harris gained a reputation for her sharp questioning and prosecutorial style, particularly during high-profile hearings.\n\nRead more by Prof Ashok Swain ICJ ruling on Israel: Turning point the West cannot ignore Dangerous Heatwaves: Climate change unleashes its fury Nato' strategic pivot: Trump's influence and security concerns Battling racism and misogyny\n\nIn 2020, Harris's first presidential run ended abruptly before it could gain traction, despite early excitement. Her campaign concluded before any votes were cast, raising doubts about her ability to campaign effectively and win a national election. The memory of that failure lingers, casting doubt on her ability to unite the party and appeal to the independent voters, while battling racism and misogyny.\n\nYet, the 2024 election brings a unique opportunity for Harris to shine, making her the Democratic candidate most likely to defeat Donald Trump. History is full of politicians who lost before winning.\n\nBiden himself had two failed presidential campaigns in 1988 and 2008 before his 2020 victory. Presidents like George H.W. Bush, Ronald Reagan, and Richard Nixon all became president after losing earlier bids. Their wins were often about being in the right place at the right time and learning from past mistakes.\n\nHarris would face a short, intense general election campaign of about three months -- a scenario that might play to her strengths. This brief campaign could refocus voter attention from generalised disillusionment to a direct choice between two contentious alternatives. Harris has a strong record of being progressive and liberal. At 59, she presents a stark contrast to Trump, avoiding extremes in behaviour and maintaining a perception of reliability.\n\nHarris might carry some baggage from the Biden administration, but she wouldn't be weighed down by all his problems. Her energy alone would be a significant improvement over Biden as a campaigner. For instance, Muslim Americans who are angry with Biden over his support for the Israeli government might view Harris as a fresh start.\n\nGet exclusive content with Gulf News WhatsApp channel Closely contested race\n\nLast week, she engaged in frank talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu regarding the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, emphasising her commitment to not remain silent on the issue.\n\nHarris described the situation in Gaza over the past nine months as devastating, highlighting the tragic images of dead children and displaced, starving people. Younger voters who haven't been thrilled with Biden might also see her differently.\n\nHarris's legal background positions her well to prosecute the case against Donald Trump, a role that she could fulfil more effectively than Biden. Her ability to provoke Trump could lead him to make remarks that remind the public why they disapprove of him.\n\nAbortion remains a pivotal issue in the US, especially after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Harris has emerged as the administration's leading advocate for reproductive rights, speaking with passion and conviction on a topic that Biden often approached with discomfort. This could be a decisive issue in the campaign, galvanising voters who prioritise personal freedom over government intervention.\n\nFollowing Biden's withdrawal, Harris has faced a barrage of Republican attack ads targeting her personality, progressive record, and her role in Biden's administration. Media scrutiny will be intense, yet this is a challenge any Democratic nominee would face.\n\nHarris's candidacy could reinvigorate the disenchanted Democratic voters, offering a fresh alternative to Biden. Her campaign's first video, featuring Beyonc\u00e9's \"Freedom,\" emphasises themes of safety and economic opportunity, aiming to inspire voters to support her vision for America's future.\n\nThe race promises to be closely contested, with Harris navigating both opportunities and challenges ahead. Her approval ratings have varied, but recent polls show Harris leading over Trump in key swing states. Her experience, prosecutorial background, and ability to energise Democratic voters position her as a formidable candidate capable of making significant impacts on the political landscape.\n\nKamala Harris stepping in to rescue a party in crisis and facing the most unpredictable candidate in modern history might be her clearest path to the presidency. In politics, timing is everything, and this unprecedented moment could be her best chance.\n\nThe United States stands on the brink of potentially electing its first progressive, female president.\n\nAshok Swain\n\n@ProfAshokSwain\n\nAshok Swain is a professor of peace and conflict research at Uppsala University, Sweden", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GULF NEWS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashok_swain@gulfnews.com", "name": "Ashok Swain", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_District_Attorney's_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco District Attorney's Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_voter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent voter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Nixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George H.

She officially declared her candidacy for president last week after incumbent President Joe Biden withdrew from the race for a second term on July 20. She is, however, yet to be officially declared as the presidential candidate by the Democrats.\n\nThe Harris campaign said on Sunday it has intensified its effort after raising a whopping USD 200 million in a week and with 17,000 volunteers having signed up.\n\nOver the weekend, the campaign mobilised thousands of grassroots supporters who have signed up to volunteer since the campaign launch -- through thousands of events, phone banks, and canvass launches across the battleground states.\n\nHarris will be up against former president Donald Trump, the Republican Party's presidential candidate for the high-stakes November 5 general elections.\n\nTaking to X, 'Harris for President' Battleground States Director Dan Kanninen said, \"100 days out! Our teams in battleground states have been building and were ready for it. 1,300+ staff (and growing), 250+ offices, (and) tens of thousands of volunteers. Talking to millions of voters. 2,300 events in battlegrounds. Just this weekend.\" \"One hundred days before Election Day, Team Harris is leveraging the historic grassroots enthusiasm we've seen for our campaign and putting it to work. For over a year, our team has been building the battleground infrastructure needed to reach and persuade the voters who will decide this election -- and now, we're kicking it into overdrive,\" Kanninen said.\n\n\"We have an enormous battleground advantage over Donald Trump, and this weekend, that is going to be painfully clear to the Trump-Vance campaign. Our campaign is off to a running start and doing the work to defeat Donald Trump and send Vice President Harris to the Oval Office,\" he said.\n\nThe battleground States are Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nAccording to the campaign, this weekend, Team Harris held Kamala coffee hours, soul food potlucks, Pride trivia nights, office openings and other events to reach voters wherever they are and talk to them about all that's at stake in the November 5 election.\n\nLeaders like Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff and many volunteers hit the doors to talk directly to voters.\n\nIn addition, 'Harris for President' organised phone banks for bilingual Spanish speakers, labour organisers, and senior citizens.\n\nThe campaign also held youth, women, labour, and LGBTQ+ national organising calls with thousands of supporters.\n\nIt also hosted watch parties so volunteers and supporters could watch Harris on RuPaul's Drag Race and learn more about how they can volunteer with and support her White House bid.\n\n\"In a close election and a fragmented media environment, our campaign is leveraging trusted messengers and preexisting community ties to break through to voters and drive home the stakes of this election,\" a statement by the campaign said.\n\nIn addition, dozens of high-profile surrogates representing the broad, diverse coalition the campaign represents were on the road and in their home states campaigning for Harris this weekend.\n\n\"While Donald Trump still has little to no infrastructure in the battlegrounds, the Vice President inherits more than 250 coordinated battleground offices and 1,300 staff who have been building strong relationships and volunteer bases on the ground for months,\" the Harris Campaign said.\n\n\"This week, the Vice President also raised more money in 48 hours than Donald Trump did in all of June -- on top of the quarter billion war chest she inherited from the Biden-Harris campaign,\" it said.\n\n\"With a popular message, a strong record, multiple pathways to 270 electoral voters, and unprecedented funding and enthusiasm on her side, the Vice President is in a strong position to take on Donald Trump and win in 100 days,\" the campaign said.

Donald Trump had a comfortable lead in Arizona polls and had just trounced Joe Biden in the first presidential debate of 2024.\n\n\"We are going to be here as often as it takes and we're really focusing on states like Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia. But we also have new states that are going on the map,\" RNC Chair Michael Whatley said July 2 at a Trump office opening in Casa Grande. \"We've now started to engage in Minnesota and in Virginia and in New Hampshire. So we're playing offense all around the country.\"\n\nHe didn't know the presidential race was about to turn upside down.\n\nOver the next three weeks, Trump would survive an assassination attempt, accept his party's nomination and then be forced to recalibrate his entire campaign against a new Democratic opponent. And Democrats, who were all but writing off Arizona's presidential election thanks to Biden's anemic approval ratings, have an uncharacteristic pep in their step and say they are seeing a deluge of new donors.\n\n\"This is gonna be one of those kind of totally crazy, whac-a-mole elections. We don't know what's coming next. We really don't,\" said Brian Murray, former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party. \"A lot of times I feel like you can predict out and say, 'This is how we expect things to happen.' But with Trump, you really just can't.\"\n\nThe new dynamic is hardly a guarantee that presumptive nominee Vice President Kamala Harris could carry Arizona. Biden won here by fewer than 11,000 votes in 2020, and Harris has her own challenges, especially when it comes to immigration. But the race certainly shows signs of being a closer contest than it was when Whatley came to open Trump's campaign outpost and Democrats were in crisis over Biden's bad poll numbers.\n\nTrump's campaign activity is ramping up in Arizona, too. The former president still has a much lighter footprint than the Biden and Harris campaigns in Arizona, but he is dispatching running mate JD Vance to Glendale for a rally this week and has opened two new campaign offices over the last several weeks.\n\nVance will take aim at Harris during his visit, rushing to define her as the new dynamics of the race take shape.\n\n\"People are really excited,\" Arizona Democratic Party chair Yolanda Bejarano told reporters last week. \"We are going to take advantage of the moment.\"\n\nHarris \"probably has a better shot\" in Arizona than Biden did, said Emerson College pollster Matt Taglia, but the vice president starts her campaign behind Trump. His latest Arizona poll showed Trump with 49% of support and Harris with 44%. Harris outperformed Biden by four percentage points: the president had 40% of support in the last Emerson poll before he dropped out of the race.\n\n\"We have seen some real shifts. That said, she's still behind in Arizona by about five points to Trump,\" Taglia said.\n\nArizona is a crucial battleground state for both presidential campaigns. Biden won here by the most narrow margin of any state in 2020, and Republicans challenged the election results for years. Before he dropped out, Biden's campaign said he would focus on the so-called Blue Wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to score an Electoral College victory.\n\nThe early days of the Harris campaign could indicate she sees Arizona as more central to a win, especially if she chooses Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., as her running mate. Kelly's name on the ballot could force Republicans to spend more time and money in Arizona to protect their lead rather than spending that cash to flip blue states such as Minnesota.\n\n\"If they pick Kelly, what they're saying is they think they can win Arizona,\" Murray said. \"Trump's got this place pretty well locked down. Their only chance would be to take Kelly, and I'm not certain that that's even enough for them to retake Arizona.\"\n\nKelly has a more optimistic view. Arizona is \"100% winnable\" for Democrats, he told reporters last week.\n\n\"I won it twice, President Biden won it in 2020, and Kamala Harris is going to win it here,\" said Kelly, who Harris reportedly invited to submit vice presidential vetting materials as she weighs who to tap as her second in command.\n\nA frequent criticism from Democrats is that Trump is not in Arizona enough and has a smaller ground game than the vice president, who took over Biden's campaign operation. Trump has fewer offices than Harris (Trump has 8 and Harris has 12), and Democrats are using a $1.5 million transfer from the Democratic National Committee to grow their staff even larger.\n\n\"Rushing to open offices after months of overlooking the state won't distract Arizonans from Trump's Project 2025 agenda of banning abortion nationwide, raising costs on hardworking families and making our communities less safe. There is no question this is going to be a close race, but Team Harris isn't taking a single voter for granted, and we have the energy, the momentum, and strong campaign infrastructure to win,\" Jacques Petit, Harris's Arizona communications director, said in a written statement.\n\nTrump has been to Arizona once this election cycle for a large rally. Harris has taken six trips here during her time in the Biden administration, although she hasn't visited since becoming the presumptive nominee last week. The Harris campaign has also held more events and news conferences to get its message out to voters.\n\nThe Harris campaign said more than 1,300 people engaged with the 67 events it hosted across Arizona over the weekend, which included canvasses, phone banks, watch parties and other gatherings. The campaign had 140 volunteers and supporters knock on 5,000 doors, and made nearly 5,500 calls across 152 phone banking sessions.\n\nAlthough he's spent less time in Arizona, Trump is giving the state some extra attention lately. The former president teamed up with a Border Patrol agent from Arizona to make the case against Harris on an immigration-focused press call, and his Arizona campaign recently held a \"Trump Campaign's 100 Day Weekend of Action\" event to mark the last 100 days before the election.\n\nThe pro-Trump super PAC Maga Inc. says it will spend $12 million a week on battleground state TV ads attacking Harris in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Georgia through Labor Day.\n\n\"For months, our staff and volunteers have been recruiting thousands of volunteers to be poll watchers and poll workers, and activating thousands of Trump Force 47 captains, who are talking neighbor-to-neighbor about the key issues Arizonans care about,\" Halee Dobbins, the RNC Arizona state communications director, said in a written statement.\n\nTrump's backers in Arizona say the former president does not need to make a personal trip to Arizona any time soon.\n\n\"He's a busy guy,\" said Joe Arpaio, the former Maricopa County sheriff who Trump kissed on stage at a Phoenix rally in June.\n\nThe Democratic and Republican candidates are so different, said another Trump supporter, that few voters will be swayed ahead of November.\n\n\"Is it going to be a sales pitch that gets someone undecided over the line? I don't see it, so I'm not the least bit critical of the Trump campaign,\" said Jim O'Connor, a Republican on the Arizona Corporation Commission who served as a Trump elector in 2016. \"Just as one strong Republican influential voter, I don't need Trump to make another visit to Arizona if he can spend his time elsewhere.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: JD Vance to schedule more visits to battleground Arizona", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Democratic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Democratic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emerson College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidential nominee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Republican_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Republican Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

But the mainstream press has what influential blogger Andrew Sullivan calls \"amnesia,\" writing that while she might even win, \"Harris is one of the weakest and wokest Democratic candidates there is. She cannot credibly appeal to the center after such extreme-left posturing.\"\n\nHARRIS CLAIMS BIDEN FIT TO CONTINUE IN OFFICE, DESPITE MORE THAN 80 DOCUMENTED ENCOUNTERS IN PAST YEAR\n\nSo if and when the Harris Honeymoon wears off, that is the vice president's challenge. She has to tell voters why she no longer holds these positions, if that's the case. Maybe it's because she \"evolved.\" Maybe it's because she was largely representing San Francisco at the time. Maybe her time as VP has changed her outlook. But she can't simply let it slide.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEven the sympathetic press will get over its amnesia eventually.\n\nSome examples: During the BLM riots in the summer of 2020, after George Floyd's murder, Harris helped promote a bail fund to get the criminals out of jail.\n\nShe said in one interview: \"They're not going to let up and they should not. And we should not.\"\n\nHarris said in another interview: \"It is outdated, and it is actually wrong and backward to think that more police officers will create more safety.\"\n\nAnd during her 2020 campaign she said: \"Private prisons are making money off the incarceration and suffering of human beings. One of my first acts of business as president will be to begin phasing out detention centers and private prisons.\"\n\nDuring the same campaign, Harris favored Medicare for All - a Bernie favorite -while acknowledging that would abolish private health insurance. Joe Biden refused to go that far left.\n\nHarris also promised to ban fracking - but has backed off that through an aide's comments.\n\nHISTORIAN WHO PREDICTED ALMOST EVERY ELECTION SINCE 1984 GIVES TAKE ON TRUMP-HARRIS MATCHUP\n\nWhen the media instantaneously switched their allegiance from Biden (of course he can serve another four years!) to Harris (she's a young, fresh voice!), they quickly formed a defensive squad.\n\nSeveral top news organizations tried to debunk the notion that she'd ever been named border czar. The most embarrassing case was Axios, which said that \"the Trump campaign and Republicans have tagged Harris repeatedly with the 'border czar' title -- which she never actually had.\"\n\nIt's true that it was just journalistic shorthand, and that Harris was assigned to work on the root causes of illegal immigration, and did work diplomatically with Mexico and Guatemala. But why deny that she had that unofficial title?\n\nThose who call the vice president a DEI pick justify it by saying Biden had essentially promised to pick a Black woman.\n\nOne guest on FOX Business went far lower by comparing Harris to the Hawk-Tuah girl. (It involves a sexual act. Google it if you need to.)\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has accused Harris of engineering a \"coup.\" (Nobody ran against her.) He also said Jews should have their heads examined if they vote for the Democrats (Kamala, of course, is married to a Jewish guy).\n\nThe former president may have lowered expectations by calling Harris \"dumb as a rock,\" given the almost flawless execution of her first week.\n\nI get the impression that Trump is still trying to figure out how to run against the 59-year-old Harris. (The Washington Post has a nice TikTok on how Donna Brazile and other allies spent weeks planning a Kamala candidacy in case Biden bowed out.)\n\nNow contrast that with the media's treatment of JD Vance, where no older remark is deemed too small to be resurrected.\n\nThe Harris team is trying to paint both Trump and Vance as weird, with a statement referring to his \"weird and extreme views.\" The Trump camp is trying to depict Harris as weird. The whole thing is, uh, very strange.\n\nKAMALA RIDES TSUNAMI OF POSITIVE PRESS, BUT SKEPTICS SEE A RISKY CHOICE\n\nVance's biggest controversy is his 2021 Fox interview saying that a \"childless cat lady,\" naming Harris among others, doesn't have a \"direct stake\" in society and are miserable in their own lives. He has broadened that to include childless media people.\n\nThe remarks got him into a spat with Jennifer Aniston, which is not exactly where you want to be - and brought him a scolding by the Wall Street Journal editorial page.\n\nAt first, the Ohio senator told Megyn Kelly he was being sarcastic and loves cats.\n\nOn Sunday, Fox host Trey Gowdy, a former GOP congressman, told Vance that George Washington and James Madison were among those who had no biological children.\n\n\"If you look at what the left has done,\" said Vance. \"They have radically taken this out of context and, in fact, aggressively lied about what I've said. What I do think is true, Trey, and this goes to the heart of what I was talking about three years ago in those comments, but it's going to be something I continue to talk about, is that the left has increasingly become explicitly anti-child and anti-family.\n\n\"They've encouraged young families not to have children at all because of concerns over climate change. They've suggested that people who do have children are somehow being selfish when I think being a parent is actually the most selfless thing that you can do, and again, really does transform your perspective.\n\n\"So this is not a criticism. It was never a criticism, Trey, of everybody without children.\"\n\nHarris, by the way, has been deeply involved in raising her husband Doug Emhoff's children -- so says a statement from Doug's ex-wife.\n\nThis is, without question, the most bizarre campaign in American history - and could well turn on perceptions of weirdness. But it sure seems like there's a double standard, given the media consensus that Trump is a danger to democracy.\n\nFootnote: With Trump backing off a debate or debates with Harris for now -claiming he's still not sure who the nominee will be - it's important to remember one thing.\n\nTrump negotiated those terms with Joe Biden, accepting Biden's terms. Now he has every right to renegotiate with Harris because she abruptly became the new nominee. Fox News has pitched a debate in September after Trump rejected ABC as biased. I don't know if any debates will happen, but the former president has every right to work out a new deal.\n\nBy the way, it was Biden who insisted on an early debate with Trump so he could shake up the campaign. It was the beginning of the end. Knowing what we know now, how could his team have sent him out there?\n\nOriginal article source: The 'weird' campaign: The stunning difference between Harris and Vance coverage", "source": {"uri":

Moreover, the campaign fired back at former President Donald Trump's 30-second ad that took aim at Harris today.\n\nA Look At Kamala Harris' Ad Campaign\n\nThe first ad, titled \"Fearless,\" highlights Kamala Harris' extensive legal background and her tenure as Vice President. Moreover, it brands her as a champion for the American people. \"This campaign is about who we fight for,\" Harris states in the ad. She added:\n\n\"We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead. Where every senior can retire with dignity.\"\n\nFurthermore, the ad emphasizes her career milestones as a prosecutor and California Attorney General. It showcases her reputation for standing up to bullies, criminals, and special interests. In addition, Kamala Harris' campaign chair, Jen O'Malley Dillon, reinforced this narrative by stating:\n\n\"Throughout her career as a courtroom prosecutor, Attorney General, United States Senator, and now as Vice President, Kamala Harris has always stood up to bullies, criminals and special interests on behalf of the American people - and she's beaten them.\"\n\nDillon even went to say that Harris is capable of defeating Trump. The campaign chair stated, \"She's uniquely suited to take on Donald Trump, a convicted felon who has spent his entire life ripping off working people, tearing away our rights, and fighting for himself.\"", "source": {"uri": "coingape.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Coingape"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kritika_mehta@coingape.com", "name": "Kritika Mehta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jen_O'Malley_Dillon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jen O'Malley Dillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Free_Classifieds", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Free Classifieds", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/kamala_harris_vs_trump.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773409", "eventUri": "eng-9773409", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 170, "textEnd": 177}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Already the oldest US president ever, Biden would be 86 at the end of a second four-year term. In both national and swing-state surveys, voters expressed serious doubts about his ability to maintain the mental acuity needed to run the country at such an advanced age.\n\nBiden's disastrous debate performance on June 27 seemed to vindicate voter concerns. His support dipped significantly, but not catastrophically, buoyed only by the profound unpopularity of his opponent, Donald Trump. If Trump was even a marginally more \"normal\" candidate, his gains may well have been far larger.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, while Biden, his family, and his inner circle wrestled with the question of whether he should drop out of the race, Trump went to ground, spending more time on the golf course than in the public eye. When he emerged for a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on July 13, America's electoral saga grew more dramatic: while Trump was delivering his speech, shots rang out, and a would-be assassin's bullet grazed his ear.\n\nEven after the shooting -- which Trump turned into a cunning photo-op, thrusting his fist into the air before the crowd, cheek smeared with blood -- support for Trump didn't surge. Nor did he gain much traction after the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where he officially accepted his nomination as the Republican's presidential candidate with a rambling, incoherent, and divisive speech that defied his campaign's calls for \"unity\" in the face of political violence.\n\nHow could all that drama fail to sway independents, undecided voters, or anti-Trump Republicans? Simply put, most Americans did not like either of their options. Biden is old, but at 78, Trump is not much younger. Trump is also chaotic, corrupt, irrational, and likely to implement policies that enjoy little support outside his narrow, extremist base.\n\nThe Democrats also made important strategic blunders. While Biden deliberated on whether to remain in the race, his campaign and the entire Democratic political apparatus should have been making the case against Trump and his newly announced, Kremlin-endorsed running mate, JD Vance. Instead, the Democrats stayed stuck in a kind of holding pattern -- and not for the first time.\n\nIn fact, in my nearly five years working alongside the Democratic Party apparatus, I have seen firsthand how an unwillingness or inability to act quickly and decisively has left the party overly dependent on external factors to strengthen its position\n\nDobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization -- the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v Wade, the 1973 case which established a constitutional right to abortion -- is a case in point. The Democrats could have cemented Roe by federal statute in 2009, when they controlled the White House and both houses of Congress. But President Barack Obama decided that abortion rights were not a high priority.\n\nSo, perhaps we should not be surprised that so little happened on the Democrats' side between the June debate debacle and the Biden campaign's announcement, nearly a month later, that he was stepping aside as the party's presumptive nominee and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris. What was previously a rematch between two old, unpopular candidates has become a captivating contest for the future of the United States.\n\nThe twenty-first century has brought many firsts in American politics: the first African-American president, followed by the first would-be authoritarian president, the first election conducted amid a global pandemic, and now a major party candidate leaving the race after winning his party's primary\n\nSoon there may be another first: if Harris wins in November, she will be America's first female president. That prospect has proved invigorating. In just over 24 hours, donors shelled out a record-breaking $81 million for the Harris campaign, and her first appearances have featured roaring crowds. The Democratic Party -- from its leaders to its donors -- has done what it needed to do, expressing unreserved support for its new candidate.\n\nThe Trump team's response has been entirely predictable. Trump argued that he should get a refund for the millions of dollars he spent campaigning against Biden, and claimed that anointing Harris amounted to a \"coup.\" Several Republican members of Congress have referred to Harris as a \"DEI\" (diversity, equity, and inclusion) candidate, suggesting that she was chosen for her identity, not her record. The Republican party is throwing everything it can at Harris, but so far, nothing has stuck.\n\nOver the following three months, the contrast between the two candidates will continue to sharpen. Standing beside the young, energetic Harris, the nearly 80-year-old Trump will look even more decrepit. Whereas Harris has the wind at her back, Trump's lack of broad appeal will continue to drag him down. And as Harris (one hopes) makes a clear, forceful, and enthusiastic case for entering a new post-Baby Boom political era, Trump, inept and retrograde, will continue to lean on ugly rhetoric and scare tactics.\n\nAs the late President George H W Bush suggested, in politics, one should bet on the team with \"Big Mo\" (momentum). And, right now, that is Team Harris. If she manages to build on that momentum -- to raise enthusiasm for her campaign to fever pitch -- she may well get the chance to inflict a crushing defeat on Trump and the Republican Party.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Because Kamala Harris has always known who she represents,\" the narrator says, just before Harris herself is heard stating: \"This campaign is about who we fight for.\"\n\n\"We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead; where every senior can retire with dignity. But Donald Trump wants to take our country backward, to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and end the Affordable Care Act. But we are not going back,\" she says.\n\nA press release from her campaign announcing the television spot says the ad is meant to \"remind voters of who she is\" and calls Harris \"a fighter who has never been afraid to take on the powerful and special interests on behalf of the American people.\"\n\nJen O'Malley Dillon, the vice president's campaign chair, said in a statement that Harris \"has always stood up to bullies, criminals and special interests on behalf of the American people - and she's beaten them.\"\n\n\"She's uniquely suited to take on Donald Trump, a convicted felon who has spent his entire life ripping off working people, tearing away our rights, and fighting for himself. This $50 million paid media campaign, bolstered by our record-setting fundraising haul and a groundswell of grassroots enthusiasm, is one crucial way we will reach and make our case to the voters who will decide this election,\" O'Malley Dillon said.\n\nThe new advertisement is hitting airwaves in battleground states between Tuesday and the start of the Democratic National Convention next month. According to Harris campaign sources, the introductory, biographical ad is meant to give voters a picture of who Harris is, since polling and other research shows Americans aren't aware of her record despite her time as vice president over the last three and a half years.\n\nIt comes as her Republican opponent, former president Donald Trump, is rolling out an ad campaign of his own with the aim of defining the vice president as a toxic and extreme figure with \"dangerously liberal\" policy positions.\n\nThe Trump ad focuses on Harris' record as what Republicans call her \"border czar\" role -- in reality a diplomatic portfolio focusing on reducing migration from South and Central America rather than one focused on stopping border crossings.\n\nThe television spot accuses her of believing in \"open borders\" and suggests that she \"plans on not only allowing millions more illegal aliens into our country, but also rewarding them with taxpayer-funded benefits and amnesty.\"\n\nA Trump campaign adviser, Danielle Alvarez, said in a statement that Harris's \"failure\" to reduce crossings \"has made America less safe.\"\n\n\"Migrant crime is up, terrorists have entered through her open border, fentanyl deaths are exploding, and human trafficking is impacting every states. Harris is dangerously liberal and Americans are paying the price,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_Care_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Affordable Care Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jen_O'Malley_Dillon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jen O'Malley Dillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insulin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_border", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open border"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fentanyl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amnesty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grassroots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/29/17/GettyImages-2162559923.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773409", "eventUri": "eng-9773409", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

He observed that the Vice President \"is not struggling in the same ways that Joe Biden did\".\n\nVance's remarks, first reported by The Washington Post, were captured in an audio recording by someone present at the private meeting, just ahead of his appearance alongside Trump at a rally.\n\nThe 39-year-old senator argued that Harris's elevation to the position of presumed Democratic presidential nominee does not change the Republicans' \"political calculus\" in the campaign. \"Kamala Harris, frankly, covered for Joe Biden even though it was obvious he was mentally incompetent for a very long time,\" he said.\n\nHis comments reveal the extent to which Republicans were unprepared for Biden to exit the race. While the Trump team quickly launched an early TV advertisement tying Harris to what Republicans argue are Biden's failed policies, particularly with regard to illegal immigration into the United States, they appear more broadly to have been pole-axed by the rapid, unprecedented changes in the campaign's topography.\n\nWhile Harris has been on the receiving end of swooning enthusiasm by grassroots Democrats (a \"sugar rush\", as Politico called it this week), Trump has struggled to voice a cogent, rehearsed critique of her during his rallies. Instead, he continues targeting Biden, in the same way that he was still levelling attacks against \"Crooked Hillary\" Clinton long after the 2016 election was over and she ceased to represent a political threat to him.\n\nOne sure sign of Trump's uncertainty: he still has not assigned Harris one of his signature nicknames, although he has toyed with \"Crooked Kamala\" and \"Laffin' Kamala\" (a reference to the Vice President's full-throated laugh that has attracted attention in the days since she launched her presidential campaign). \"You can tell a lot by a laugh ... she is nuts,\" Trump told supporters in Michigan earlier this month.\n\nRepublicans had hoped that Biden would remain in the election race. Trump and his top lieutenants avoided fuelling Democrat efforts to defenestrate the President, reflecting opinion polls that led many analysts to conclude the stage was set for a possible Republican landslide in November.\n\nThose days are over, according to political analysts who say the Republicans urgently need to slow Harris's momentum by tying her firmly to Biden's policies and record, and raising questions about whether she was honest with the American public when she denied the President was suffering from any kind of mental or physical deterioration.\n\n\"Bag the stupid crap and just focus on her record, statements and work under President Joe Biden,\" Republican strategist Scott Jennings warned Trump and Vance in comments to Politico on Monday.\n\n\"With any luck she will spend the next two weeks disavowing her entire record which will... make her seem hollow to voters.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign insists there is no chaos behind the scenes as it pivots to targeting a new opponent. \"Kamala Harris is just as incompetent as Joe Biden and even more liberal,\" campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said. \"A vote for Kamala is a vote to continue inflation, open borders, high gas prices and war around the world.\"\n\nBut Vance's comments suggest that at a high level, Republicans may be spooked by Harris's unexpected elevation, and anxious about maintaining Trump's slim lead in the key battleground states where the election will be won or lost.\n\nTrump's VP pick has had a poor start in the polls, with Vance facing widespread criticism over some of his resurfaced remarks from the past, including denigrating the former president and saying he \"hated the police\" - positions unlikely to go down well with Republicans.\n\nThe Republican candidate on Monday defended his running mate's controversial claim \"childless cat ladies\" were damaging America by saying he simply cared about family values.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Trump campaign launched a TV ad previewing a fresh tagline for a more co-ordinated assault on Harris.\n\n\"Kamala Harris.

And DANGEROUSLY Liberal\" thunders the closing sequence.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_marks@inews.co.uk", "name": "Simon

To give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and end the Affordable Care Act\".\n\nWhile Harris is trying to strike a contrast with Trump on his approach to big business, the former president and Republican nominee launched his own $12mn ad campaign by attacking the vice-president for her record on immigration policy.\n\nEarly in Biden's administration Harris was tasked with handling the root causes of migration across the border with Mexico, including through high level diplomatic engagement with several central American countries.\n\nBut Republicans have accused her of failing to contain a jump in illegal border crossings that unfolded during Biden's presidency, making it one of her biggest political vulnerabilities.\n\n\"This is America's border tsar and she's failed us,\" the narrator in the Trump ad says, speaking over footage of Harris dancing at an outdoor party, pointing to the 10mn undocumented immigrants in the country, and what it claimed were the fentanyl deaths, \"brutal\" crimes, and Isis terrorism that came along with the surge.\n\nThe ad also mocks Harris for an NBC interview in 2021 during which she struggled to explain why she had not visited the border with Mexico.\n\nThe Trump ad comes after the Republican former president was able to rally big party donors to his side in recent months, and boost fundraising on the back of his criminal conviction in New York as well as the assassination attempt against him earlier this month.\n\nSince entering the race on July 21, Harris has raised more than $200mn, a reflection of the Democratic enthusiasm surrounding her candidacy. The party's fundraising had slowed sharply in previous weeks amid donor unhappiness with Biden's candidacy.\n\nPrevious Biden TV ad campaigns in battleground states had failed to improve his polling numbers, so the Harris campaign will hope her spots will be more effective.\n\n\"We are the underdogs in this race, but the groundswell of support around the vice-president is real and it is

Our teams in battleground states have been building and were ready for it. 1,300+ staff (and growing), 250+ offices, (and) tens of thousands of volunteers. Talking to millions of voters. 2,300 events in battlegrounds. Just this weekend.\"\n\n\"One hundred days before Election Day, Team Harris is leveraging the historic grassroots enthusiasm we've seen for our campaign and putting it to work. For over a year, our team has been building the battleground infrastructure needed to reach and persuade the voters who will decide this election -- and now, we're kicking it into overdrive,\" Kanninen said.\n\n\"We have an enormous battleground advantage over Donald Trump, and this weekend, that is going to be painfully clear to the Trump-Vance campaign. Our campaign is off to a running start and doing the work to defeat Donald Trump and send Vice President Harris to the Oval Office,\" he said.\n\nThe battleground States are Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nAccording to the campaign, this weekend, Team Harris held Kamala coffee hours, soul food potlucks, Pride trivia nights, office openings and other events to reach voters wherever they are and talk to them about all that's at stake in the November 5 election.\n\nLeaders like Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff and many volunteers hit the doors to talk directly to voters.\n\nIn addition, 'Harris for President' organised phone banks for bilingual Spanish speakers, labour organisers, and senior citizens.\n\nThe campaign also held youth, women, labour, and LGBTQ+ national organising calls with thousands of supporters.\n\nIt also hosted watch parties so volunteers and supporters could watch Harris on RuPaul's Drag Race and learn more about how they can volunteer with and support her White House bid.\n\n\"In a close election and a fragmented media environment, our campaign is leveraging trusted messengers and preexisting community ties to break through to voters and drive home the stakes of this election,\" a statement by the campaign said.\n\nIn addition, dozens of high-profile surrogates representing the broad, diverse coalition the campaign represents were on the road and in their home states campaigning for Harris this weekend.\n\n\"While Donald Trump still has little to no infrastructure in the battlegrounds, the Vice President inherits more than 250 coordinated battleground offices and 1,300 staff who have been building strong relationships and volunteer bases on the ground for months,\" the Harris Campaign said.\n\n\"This week, the Vice President also raised more money in 48 hours than Donald Trump did in all of June -- on top of the quarter billion war chest she inherited from the Biden-Harris campaign,\" it said.\n\n\"With a popular message, a strong record, multiple pathways to 270 electoral voters, and unprecedented funding and enthusiasm on her side, the Vice President is in a strong position to take on Donald Trump and win in 100 days,\" the campaign said.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Her fundraising surge also counters a Republican blitz that put Trump ahead in the money race.\n\nIt's the latest demonstration of how Democrats are coalescing behind the vice president, who launched her candidacy last week after President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign and endorsed her.\n\nHarris' campaign said 66% of her fundraising tally came from first-time donors. The latest haul expands the $81 million she raised in the first day after Biden's exit, which the campaign called the largest 24-hour fundraise of any candidate in history.\n\n\"It's just a whole new vibe to the campaign,\" Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who's on a short list of potential Harris running mates, said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday.\n\nBiden's exit has forced the Trump-Vance campaign to shift focus to a younger opponent with a different ideological profile. Walz sought to project confidence, claiming \"there isn't going to be a pivot because they don't have any new plans.\"\n\nBoth candidates were on the attack over the weekend, with Trump courting the crypto industry, saying he'd fire Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler and branding Harris an \"out-of-touch San Francisco liberal\" at a rally in Minnesota.\n\nHarris made a previously scheduled fundraising stop at a theater in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where she labeled rhetoric by Trump and his Republican running mate JD Vance \"weird.\" She plans to campaign in Atlanta on Tuesday.\n\nNew Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, a Republican who endorsed Nikki Haley for president before falling in line to back Trump, said the contest is likely to settle back into \"essentially a neck-and-neck race\" after a Harris surge.\n\n\"I mean, this is the honeymoon period,\" he said on ABC's This Week. \"The first poll, I believe, that will actually matter is the Wednesday after Labor Day.\"\n\nHarris has already sewn up the support of enough delegates to clinch the nomination. A key endorsement -- by former President Barack Obama -- came on Friday.\n\nBiden's debate debacle and the ensuing intra-party fight over his future damaged his campaign's finances as donors backed away from an 81-year-old president, who faced questions about his mental acuity and ability to beat Trump in the election in November.\n\nThe Biden campaign entered July with $96 million cash on hand following a spending spree that depleted about 93% of the money it raised in June. The burn rate far exceeded Trump's, whose campaign spent just 46% of the money it raised in June and had $128 million in the bank. Biden's campaign continued to spend even as some polls showed Trump with an edge after their debate and as calls for the incumbent to end his bid grew.\n\nIt was a stunning turnaround from earlier in the contest, when Biden built up a sizable money advantage, aided in part by the lack of a serious Democratic challenger and with Trump dealing with an at-times bitter GOP primary and multiple court cases that drained his coffers.\n\nTrump's fundraising has surged in recent months - bolstered by appeals to big-dollar Republican donors and support from Wall Street and corporate executives drawn to his economic agenda.\n\nTesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, the world's richest person according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, said he is \"making some donations\" to a super political action committee supporting the former president, though at a \"much lower level\" than has been reported. People familiar with the matter had said Musk is pledging to pour $45 million a month into the pro-Trump group.\n\nTrump and the Republican National Committee raised $331 million in the second quarter, beating the $264 million Biden and the Democratic National Committee raised.\n\nDemocratic Wall Street donors are also mobilizing to tap their networks and help Harris close the fundraising gap with Trump.\n\nTrump's campaign filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission claiming Biden's transfer of his $96 million violates the law. It poses a novel legal question, but many campaign finance experts say the transfer is probably allowed.\n\n(With assistance from Eric Martin.)\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P. Visit bloomberg.com.

But the mainstream press has what influential blogger Andrew Sullivan calls \"amnesia,\" writing that while she might even win, \"Harris is one of the weakest and wokest Democratic candidates there is. She cannot credibly appeal to the center after such extreme-left posturing.\"\n\nHARRIS CLAIMS BIDEN FIT TO CONTINUE IN OFFICE, DESPITE MORE THAN 80 DOCUMENTED ENCOUNTERS IN PAST YEAR\n\nSo if and when the Harris Honeymoon wears off, that is the vice president's challenge. She has to tell voters why she no longer holds these positions, if that's the case. Maybe it's because she \"evolved.\" Maybe it's because she was largely representing San Francisco at the time. Maybe her time as VP has changed her outlook. But she can't simply let it slide.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEven the sympathetic press will get over its amnesia eventually.\n\nSome examples: During the BLM riots in the summer of 2020, after George Floyd's murder, Harris helped promote a bail fund to get the criminals out of jail.\n\nShe said in one interview: \"They're not going to let up and they should not. And we should not.\"\n\nHarris said in another interview: \"It is outdated, and it is actually wrong and backward to think that more police officers will create more safety.\"\n\nAnd during her 2020 campaign she said: \"Private prisons are making money off the incarceration and suffering of human beings. One of my first acts of business as president will be to begin phasing out detention centers and private prisons.\"\n\nDuring the same campaign, Harris favored Medicare for All - a Bernie favorite -while acknowledging that would abolish private health insurance. Joe Biden refused to go that far left.\n\nHarris also promised to ban fracking - but has backed off that through an aide's comments.\n\nHISTORIAN WHO PREDICTED ALMOST EVERY ELECTION SINCE 1984 GIVES TAKE ON TRUMP-HARRIS MATCHUP\n\nWhen the media instantaneously switched their allegiance from Biden (of course he can serve another four years!) to Harris (she's a young, fresh voice!), they quickly formed a defensive squad.\n\nSeveral top news organizations tried to debunk the notion that she'd ever been named border czar. The most embarrassing case was Axios, which said that \"the Trump campaign and Republicans have tagged Harris repeatedly with the 'border czar' title -- which she never actually had.\"\n\nExcept that in 2021, Axios said: \"Harris, appointed by Biden as border czar...\"\n\n(Axios updated its story.)\n\nIt's true that it was just journalistic shorthand, and that Harris was assigned to work on the root causes of illegal immigration, and did work diplomatically with Mexico and Guatemala. But why deny that she had that unofficial title?\n\nThose who call the vice president a DEI pick justify it by saying Biden had essentially promised to pick a Black woman.\n\nOne guest on FOX Business went far lower by comparing Harris to the Hawk-Tuah girl. (It involves a sexual act. Google it if you need to.)\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has accused Harris of engineering a \"coup.\" (Nobody ran against her.) He also said Jews should have their heads examined if they vote for the Democrats (Kamala, of course, is married to a Jewish guy).\n\nThe former president may have lowered expectations by calling Harris \"dumb as a rock,\" given the almost flawless execution of her first week.\n\nI get the impression that Trump is still trying to figure out how to run against the 59-year-old Harris. (The Washington Post has a nice TikTok on how Donna Brazile and other allies spent weeks planning a Kamala candidacy in case Biden bowed out.)\n\nNow contrast that with the media's treatment of JD Vance, where no older remark is deemed too small to be resurrected.\n\nThe Harris team is trying to paint both Trump and Vance as weird, with a statement referring to his \"weird and extreme views.\" The Trump camp is trying to depict Harris as weird. The whole thing is, uh, very strange.\n\nKAMALA RIDES TSUNAMI OF POSITIVE PRESS, BUT SKEPTICS SEE A RISKY CHOICE\n\nVance's biggest controversy is his 2021 Fox interview saying that a \"childless cat lady,\" naming Harris among others, doesn't have a \"direct stake\" in society and are miserable in their own lives. He has broadened that to include childless media people.\n\nThe remarks got him into a spat with Jennifer Aniston, which is not exactly where you want to be - and brought him a scolding by the Wall Street Journal editorial page.\n\nAt first, the Ohio senator told Megyn Kelly he was being sarcastic and loves cats.\n\nOn Sunday, Fox host Trey Gowdy, a former GOP congressman, told Vance that George Washington and James Madison were among those who had no biological children.\n\n\"If you look at what the left has done,\" said Vance. \"They have radically taken this out of context and, in fact, aggressively lied about what I've said. What I do think is true, Trey, and this goes to the heart of what I was talking about three years ago in those comments, but it's going to be something I continue to talk about, is that the left has increasingly become explicitly anti-child and anti-family.\n\n\"They've encouraged young families not to have children at all because of concerns over climate change. They've suggested that people who do have children are somehow being selfish when I think being a parent is actually the most selfless thing that you can do, and again, really does transform your perspective.\n\n\"So this is not a criticism. It was never a criticism, Trey, of everybody without children.\"\n\nHarris, by the way, has been deeply involved in raising her husband Doug Emhoff's children -- so says a statement from Doug's ex-wife.\n\nThis is, without question, the most bizarre campaign in American history - and could well turn on perceptions of weirdness. But it sure seems like there's a double standard, given the media consensus that Trump is a danger to democracy.\n\nFootnote: With Trump backing off a debate or debates with Harris for now -claiming he's still not sure who the nominee will be - it's important to remember one thing.\n\nTrump negotiated those terms with Joe Biden, accepting Biden's terms. Now he has every right to renegotiate with Harris because she abruptly became the new nominee. Fox News has pitched a debate in September after Trump rejected ABC as biased. I don't know if any debates will happen, but the former president has every right to work out a new deal.\n\nBy the way, it was Biden who insisted on an early debate with Trump so he could shake up the campaign. It was the beginning of the end. Knowing what we know now, how could his team have sent him out there?\n\nOriginal article source: The 'weird' campaign: The stunning difference between Harris and Vance coverage", "source": {"uri":

leading the ticket, including 23 percent who believe it makes it \"significantly\" more likely.\n\nIn comparison, just under one-quarter (24 percent) of U.S. voters think the Democratic Party is now less likely to defeat former President Donald Trump and Republican running mate JD Vance in November with Harris at the top of the ticket.\n\nThe results are the last sign of enthusiasm for Harris' White House campaign since Biden confirmed he would be ending his reelection bid on July 21.\n\nEven before Biden's languished performance at the CNN debate performance on June 27, the 81-year-old had long faced calls that he was too old to run for a second term, with polls frequently suggesting voters were not enthused at the prospect of the race being a rematch of the 2020 election.\n\nNow, the momentum appears to be in Harris' favor, with her approval rating rising in the days since she began her White House bid, and more polls suggesting she is leading Trump.\n\nHarris has also seen a surge in fundraising, with her campaign reporting it raised more than $200 million in its first week, about two-thirds of which came from first-time donors.\n\nElsewhere, the Redfield & Wilton Strategies survey found that more than one-third (36 percent) of U.S. voters said they are now more likely to vote for the Democratic nominee in November now that Harris has replaced Biden, compared to 27 percent who say it makes them less likely.\n\nA clear majority of (69 percent) of voters said they support Biden's decision to end his campaign and allow a new candidate to win the Democratic nomination.\n\nHarris' and Trump's offices have been contacted for comment via email.\n\nIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, on Monday, Harris acknowledged the enthusiasm her campaign has seen in its first few days.\n\n\"In the week since the launch of our campaign, we have: Signed up more than 170,000 new volunteers, held more than 2,300 events across the country, raised over $200 million (66% came from first-time donors),\" Harris wrote.\n\n\"Thank you to all who have knocked doors, made calls, and chipped in.\"\n\nAt a recent rally in Minnesota, Trump attacked Harris as \"evil\" and suggested her poor record on controlling rising illegal migrant crossings at the southern border makes her unfit for office.\n\n\"Kamala Harris' deadly destruction of America's borders is completely and totally disqualifying for her to be president,\" Trump said. \"You can't have a person like this as president.\"\n\nThe Redfield & Wilton Strategies poll was conducted on July 29 among 1,750

Why Harris became the only possible opponent for Trump - Conservative Angle", "body": "Guest Post by Alan Lolaev, visiting researcher at the Laboratory for Political Geography and Contemporary Geopolitics, Higher School of Economics (Moscow)\n\nA rivalry with the Republican could make or break vice president's political career, while campaign duration will play key role.\n\nAfter the apparent loss of the first presidential debate, the obvious question concerning presidential elections was \"How long until Biden drops off from the election?\"\n\nThe final days of Biden's presidential campaign after the debate were reminiscent of the sinking of the Titanic: the inexorability of the crash was matched only by its swiftness. Everyone whose support seemed unshakable back in the fall, like Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives and Senate, prominent left-leaning journalists and major donors to the Democratic Party, turned away from Biden.\n\nFinally, in a very rare but not unexpected decision, Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the election, saying that it was time to \"pass the torch to a new generation.\" In social media posts, he explained his decision as \"best for the party, the presidency and American democracy.\"\n\nBiden became one of the few sitting American presidents who decided not to run for a second term. This moment is unique in US political history, since Biden's decision was made shortly before the next presidential election, after he had already effectively received the Democratic nomination. The primaries ran from January to June but, by March 2024, Biden had secured enough votes to become the presumptive Democratic nominee.\n\nThere have already been similar precedents in US history: in the 20th century, Lyndon B Johnson and Harry S Truman also did not run for a second term. However, they took office after the death of the sitting presidents and eventually served more than just one presidential term. Truman served all but 82 days of almost two terms.\n\nThe last time Lyndon B Johnson was the one to announce his decision not to run for reelection in 1968. Like Biden, Johnson had health problems: he died two days after the end of his supposed second full term as president. In addition, he also lost the support of important factions within his own party, in his case due to his failure to overcome the foreign-policy stalemate of the Vietnam War. Fearing a split in the Democratic Party and failure in the primaries, he announced at the end of a lengthy televised address on the War in Vietnam that he would not seek or accept his party's nomination for a second term.\n\nBiden's support for Vice President Kamala Harris for the Democratic nomination was obvious and perhaps the only possible option in the absence of time for full-fledged primaries. Delegates to the party's convention in Chicago in mid-August are likely to support it. Any internal conflicts within the Democrats will benefit Trump, something Biden and Harris will emphasize at every opportunity leading up to the convention in order to secure the nomination of the sitting Vice President.\n\nTrump has long argued that Biden is not capable of governing the country, but after the president announced his withdrawal from the 2024 race, he definitely did not actually become the beneficiary of this decision. For the Republican nominee, maintaining the status quo would have been much more profitable, since it almost guaranteed him another four years in the Oval Office.\n\nStill, Trump showed his strength and political might, as in just a few days he not only survived an assassination attempt but also, in a powerful move, ousted his opponent from office after a single debate.\n\nThe lack of alternatives to Harris' candidacy for Democrats, however, does not invalidate a number of problematic issues related to her nomination.\n\nShe faces an uphill battle: She has only about 100 days to convince American voters to support her in the presidential election. That short time frame stands in stark contrast to former President Donald Trump's campaign, which began in November 2022. His campaign was more than full of bright events, many of which, however, had negative consequences. But this does not change the fact that the Republican nominee was the number one newsmaker, enjoying an absurd amount of publicity unlike Harris, who stayed in Biden's shadow for almost four years.\n\nElections in the United States are more personalized, which means they require more time and money for media promotion of the candidate. A comparison of US election campaigns with European countries reveals this key difference. Parliamentary systems tend to be centralized, with candidates going to elections with well-known party agendas, which reduces differences between candidates within the same party. This means that if, for any reason, a candidate is replaced, voter support is less dependent on candidate recognition and policy track record, unlike in the US.\n\nHarris, who raised more than $100 million in just a few days after Biden dropped out of the presidential race, should continue her vigorous fundraising as campaigns quickly burn through funds. Therefore, Democrats must maintain high levels of fundraising to support Harris' campaign and counter significant donations supporting Trump and his advertising strategy.\n\nOn the other hand, Harris may benefit from a relatively short campaign period. Long campaigns can lead to voter fatigue and the accumulation of high anti-ratings, as happened with Trump and Biden. The relatively brief campaigning could also reduce the margin for error and limit the time Republicans can spend building negative media perceptions of Harris.\n\nBut still the biggest challenge for Democrats is Harris' relations with voters. Despite serving as Vice President, the Californian remains less familiar to many voters, mostly known for her mediocre debate performances during the 2020 Democratic primary, which eventually forced her to drop out and seek Biden's decision to pick her as his running mate.\n\nHarris has strong support from Democratic leaders and has access to Biden's significant financial and political resources, but her success will depend on her ability to build a broad coalition of voters who believe she can lead the country as the next president. In the pretty fractional Democratic Party, Harris must balance between different policy groups (from centrists like Biden to left-wing figures like Bernie Sanders), in order to become a unifying candidate for voters as diverse as white suburbanites, metropolitan racial minorities, union members and college students.\n\nEfforts to challenge Harris' nomination from other prominent Democratic leaders are unlikely. The safest strategy for them is to take a cautious position and move according to the \"party line.\" They will be looking ahead to the 2028 presidential election, with the opportunity to mount a full-fledged campaign without a formidable challenger in Donald Trump. After all, losing the election to Trump now means ruining your political career, which could very well happen to Harris, as it happened to Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nOf course, the presidential election is the most important but by no means the only important election this fall.\n\nOn November 5, 2024, Americans will elect not only the Commander-in-Chief and the Vice President of the United States. At the same time, all 435 members of the House of Representatives and 34 of the 100 members of the Senate will be elected to form the 119th US Congress. There will also be elections for thirteen state and territory governors, as well as many other state and local elections.\n\nThe political balance of power at the state level is of enormous importance in American politics. States still retain a high degree of autonomy from Washington and can, albeit with some difficulty, implement their own ideological course based on which party the governor belongs to and which party has a majority in the local legislature.\n\nMoreover, Congress has far greater influence, with the power of the purse, including funding government programs and military spending, and significant powers to limit the president's decisions. In the current political polarization in the United States, without the support of Congress, the President's agenda may be stalled or blocked. The system of checks and balances allows Congress to control the executive branch and investigate, challenge, and limit the actions of the president. Congress also controls federal spending and budget allocation, which mean far-reaching influence in foreign policy as well. In this situation, Democrats can smooth out the effect of a likely defeat in the presidential election by successfully completing the election to Congress, securing a majority in order to minimize the consequences of another four-year term for Donald Trump.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

His withdrawal followed weeks of pressure from Democrats concerned about whether he could defeat Trump in November following a poorly received debate performance last month that fueled questions about his age, as well as polls showing him trail Trump in key swing states.\n\nDemocrats quickly coalesced around Harris, who has appeared to secure enough delegates to win the nomination ahead of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in August. Prior to Biden's exit, polls showed Harris performing similarly, if not worse, than Biden in swing states. But as her candidacy generates new enthusiasm among Democrats, polls have shown her standing in the polls rise in recent days.\n\nA new survey of 600 likely voters in Pennsylvania found Harris leading Trump by 4 points in the state.\n\nForty-seven percent of respondents said they are planning to back Harris in November, while 43 percent said they are voting for Trump. An additional 3 percent said they are planning to vote for independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.\n\nThe poll was conducted by Susquehanna Polling & Research from July 22 to July 28.\n\nSusquehanna was among the most accurate pollsters of Pennsylvania in 2020. Their final poll showed Trump leading Biden by one point (49 percent to 48 percent). Biden ultimately carried Pennsylvania b 1.2 points, meaning there was only a roughly 2-point difference between the poll and final result.\n\nPennsylvania is viewed as a must-win for Harris due to the state's 19 Electoral College votes, making it the largest swing state in the country.\n\nHarris is reportedly considering Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro as a potential running mate. His supporters believe he could help her carry the state in November, though some Democrats fear his positions on issues including Israel and charter schools could alienate progressive voters.\n\nIt backed former President Barack Obama in both 2008 and 2012, but Trump flipped it in 2016 due to his strength with rural voters. However, Biden's inroads with suburban voters, as well as his strength in cities like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, helped him win it back for Democrats in 2020.\n\nOn Monday, a Commonwealth Foundation poll found Harris leading Trump by 1 point in a head-to-head (48 percent to 47 percent). When other candidates were polled, Harris and Trump were tied, each receiving 44 percent support.

When other candidates were included, Harris led Trump by two points (45 percent to 43 percent).\n\nHowever, one poll delivered better news for Trump.\n\nA poll from The Telegraph, conducted by Redfield & Wilton Strategies, found Trump leading by four points (46 percent to 42 percent) among 851 likely voters from July 22 to July 24.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the Harris and Trump campaigns for comment via email", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_stanton@newsweek.com", "name": "Andrew Stanton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Just this weekend, dozens of surrogates are joining Team Harris on the campaign trail, he asserted.\n\n\"Since last Sunday, we've seen unprecedented grassroots support for the campaign across the country, with over 170,000 new volunteers joining Team Harris. We are not taking that excitement for granted - just this weekend, the campaign will mobilise thousands of grassroots supporters with more than 2,300 events in battleground states. We are also engaging supporters online and through traditional media, with the VP herself joining TikTok and gaining millions of followers since,\" he said.\n\nHarris will be formally announced presidential nominee in next month's Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago.\n\nTyler said this week, hundreds of thousands of supporters came together via calls to support the Vice President, raising millions in the process -- including shows of support from coalitions of Black women and men, Latinas, white women, the LGBTQ community, and more.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump, her Republican rival, is scrambling, Tyler said, adding that he's scared to debate Harris.\n\n\"While the Harris coalition is unified and growing, Donald Trump is weighed down by his extensive vulnerabilities, for example, his Friday comments about ending elections in this country,\" he said.

Vance heads to Arizona for border visit\n\nSen. J.D. Vance is heading to Arizona's southern border to highlight Vice President Kamala Harris' failures as 'border czar.'\n\nSince Harris took over as the de facto Democratic nominee last week, a main attack line has been for Donald Trump and Vance to go after her role in Biden's administration whre she was meant to mitigate the southern border crisis.\n\nVance will appear in Conchise County, Arizona - a southern border town - for remarks Thursday morning. It follows the vice presidential candidate's remarks Wednesday evening in Glendale, Arizona.\n\nA statement announcing the stop notes:\n\nFor 39 months straight since weak, failed, and dangerously liberal Kamala Harris became Joe Biden's border czar, monthly encounters have routinely surpassed the highest month under President Trump's administration. Since Joe Biden and Kamala Harris took office, nearly 10 MILLION illegal immigrants have crossed into our country.\n\nTo make matters worse, if elected,\u202fKamala Harris promises to decriminalize illegal border crossings and take executive action to provide mass amnesties for millions of illegal immigrants.\n\nPresident Donald J.

Then-President Trump bragged about his negotiating skills with company, saying that he said saved taxpayers money.\n\nAnd he was so proud of his plan he kept a model of the new Air Force One - painted dark blue, deep red, and pure white - on the coffee table in the Oval Office where it popped up in numerous photographs during his administration.\n\nActing Secret Service director says he's 'ashamed' gunman was able to get on the Trump rally roof\n\nI went to the roof of the AGR building where the assailant fired shots, and I laid in a prone position to evaluate his line of sight.\n\nWhat I saw made me ashamed as a career law enforcement officer and a 25 year veteran with the Secret Service. I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\n\nBreaking: FBI discovers social media account they believe belongs to Trump gunman Thomas Crooks\n\nFBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate told the Senate on Tuesday agents have found a social media account they believe belonged to Donald Trump's would-be assassin Thomas Crooks.\n\nAbbate said there were over 700 comments posted from this account, including some that included 'anti-Semitic and anti-immigration themes' that 'espoused political violence'.\n\nThe FBI is still working to verify the account.\n\nButtigieg reveals if Biden is 'hurt' over Kamala hype\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said he found out about President Joe Biden ending his reelection campaign through his post to social media last weekend.\n\nButtigieg said in a Monday night interview when asked about enthusiasm over Vice President Kamala Harris' candidacy:\n\nPeople are clearly really fired up and excited about it. I know I am.\n\nThe Daily Show host Jon Steward asked if the excitement has 'hurt Biden's feelings,' acknowledging it was a 'strange question.'\n\nI don't know. I think even now we might be underselling how world-historically rare it is to be literally the most powerful person in the world, to lay power aside - just because it's the right thing to do.\n\nRand Paul: Secret Service was warned of rooftop where Crooks fired shots\n\nSen. Rand Paul revealed in a joint hearing on the Trump assassination attempt that local law enforcement had told his office they'd warned the Secret Service about the vulnerabilities of the rooftop where Thomas Matthew Crooks fired shots at the president.\n\n'Local law enforcement told my staff that they specifically flagged the vulnerability of the building to the Secret Service, and were told that it would be taken care of.

And I don't think there's anything wrong in saying that.\n\nVance, the vice presidential nominee, said in a 2021 interview with then-Fox host Tucker Carlson that the U.S. is being run by Democratic 'childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.'\n\nHarris drops first paid TV ad while Trump campaign hits her over the airwaves\n\nVice President Kamala Harris released her first TV ad titled 'Fearless' on Tuesday as part of a $50 million paid ad campaign leading up to the Democratic National Convention.\n\nThe ad features images of Harris over the years and introduces her to the American people as a prosecutor before becoming vice president.\n\n'As a prosecutor, she put murderers and abusers behind bars. As California's Attorney General, she went after the big banks and won $20 billion for homeowners, and as Vice President, she took on the big drug companies to cap the cost of insulin for seniors,' the narrator says. 'Because Kamala Harris has always known who she represents.'\n\nThe minute-long ad ends with her slamming Donald Trump by name and stating 'we're not going back.'\n\nIt's the first ad in the blitz that will play across battleground states.\n\nIt comes as the Trump campaign dropped its first anti-Harris ad.\n\n'This is America's border czar, and she's failed us. Under Harris, over 10 million illegal a year,' the narrator says as video of Harris dancing at an event plays.

'She was watching live. It was all over the place. It was on television.'\n\nTrump added that his wife is unable to even speak to him about that horrible day, though he's able to see it as a sign she truly cares for him.\n\nDonald Trump or Kamala Harris?

Amid the rallies, endorsements and speaking engagements, Harris is yet to sit down for a TV or print interview.\n\nOn the contrary, Biden, who has repeatedly dodged traditional media appearances and press conferences, rapidly arranged sit-downs in the final weeks of his campaign as a way to prove his fitness for office. The president sat down for two TV interviews, the first with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos and then NBC News' Lester Holt. The president also did a sit-down that ran online for Complex. (RELATED: Joe Biden Repeatedly Denies Reality In Primetime ABC Interview)\n\nThe president also did a solo press conference at D.C.'s NATO Summit, a showing that temporarily quelled concerns about his bid for reelection. But nine days into the Harris campaign, she is yet to do anything similar, despite the president's old campaign being converted into her own, according to Politico.\n\n\"We're building the plane while we're flying it,\" former Democratic South Carolina State Rep. Bakari Sellers told Politico. \"She's going to be everywhere. Her message will be everywhere. This is going to be unlike anything we've seen before. These won't be baby steps. She'll explode on the scene.\"\n\nHarris has participated in several rallies without many unscripted moments. Throughout her vice presidency, Harris has been more accessible than Biden, though in 2021 her office took a more careful approach to the media, Semafor reported. Even more so, at the conclusion of her 2020 presidential campaign, Harris was on rocky footing with the media, a relationship she is now seeking to repair.\n\nHarris' shift in media strategy began after a sit down interview with Holt in 2021 where she admitted she still hadn't visited the southern border, according to Semafor. The clip continues to circulate years later, and Harris' retreat from media appearances in the aftermath has allowed such moments to linger for longer, the outlet reported.\n\nIn the past, the vice president has been hesitant to participate in any events that aren't highly controlled, Harris and Biden aides told Axios. The vice president was invited in April 2022 to attend a salon-type dinner at David Bradley's home, an event that caused Harris so much anxiety her staff was forced to simulate it as practice ahead of time, Axios reported.\n\nAs the Harris team rides out a \"honeymoon phase,\" the Daily Caller previously reported that the Trump campaign is working on getting the vice president off-script as a part of its campaign strategy. Allies close to the Trump campaign told the Caller that Harris' tendency for gaffes and awkward moments in unscripted environments will turn voters away from the vice president.(RELATED: Trump Says He Will 'Absolutely' Debate Kamala Harris, Says He Would Do 'More Than One')\n\n\"Every time Kamala Harris opens her mouth she's off-script.

In the space of just four weeks, the race for the US presidency has been twisted, turned, upended, and reset. Now, with just about 100 days to go until the election, Americans begin the race's home stretch.\n\nFrom the start of the campaign, voters' top concern about President Joe Biden was his age. Already the oldest US president ever, Biden would be 86 at the end of a second four-year term. In both national and swing-state surveys, voters expressed serious doubts about his ability to maintain the mental acuity needed to run the country at such an advanced age.\n\nBiden's disastrous debate performance on June 27 seemed to vindicate voter concerns. His support dipped significantly, but not catastrophically, buoyed only by the profound unpopularity of his opponent, Donald Trump. If Trump was even a marginally more \"normal\" candidate, his gains may well have been far larger.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, while Biden, his family, and his inner circle wrestled with the question of whether he should drop out of the race, Trump went to ground, spending more time on the golf course than in the public eye. When he emerged for a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on July 13, America's electoral saga grew more dramatic: while Trump was delivering his speech, shots rang out, and a would-be assassin's bullet grazed his ear.\n\nEven after the shooting - which Trump turned into a cunning photo-op, thrusting his fist into the air before the crowd, cheek smeared with blood - support for Trump didn't surge. Nor did he gain much traction after the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where he officially accepted his nomination as the GOP's presidential candidate with a rambling, incoherent, and divisive speech that defied his campaign's calls for \"unity\" in the face of political violence.\n\nHow could all that drama fail to sway independents, undecided voters, or anti-Trump Republicans? Simply put, most Americans did not like either of their options. Biden is old, but at 78, Trump is not much younger. Trump is also chaotic, corrupt, irrational, and likely to implement policies that enjoy little support outside his narrow, extremist base.\n\nThe Democrats also made important strategic blunders. While Biden deliberated on whether to remain in the race, his campaign and the entire Democratic political apparatus should have been making the case against Trump and his newly announced, Kremlin-endorsed running mate, J.D. Vance. Instead, the Democrats stayed stuck in a kind of holding pattern - and not for the first time.\n\nIn fact, in my nearly five years working alongside the Democratic Party apparatus, I have seen firsthand how an unwillingness or inability to act quickly and decisively has left the party overly dependent on external factors to strengthen its position. Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization - the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case which established a constitutional right to abortion - is a case in point. The Democrats could have cemented Roe by federal statute in 2009, when they controlled the White House and both houses of Congress. But President Barack Obama decided that abortion rights were not a high priority.\n\nSo, perhaps we should not be surprised that so little happened on the Democrats' side between the June debate debacle and the Biden campaign's announcement, nearly a month later, that he was stepping aside as the party's presumptive nominee and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris. What was previously a rematch between two old, unpopular candidates has become a captivating contest for the future of the United States.\n\nThe twenty-first century has brought many firsts in American politics: the first African-American president, followed by the first would-be authoritarian president, the first election conducted amid a global pandemic, and now a major party candidate leaving the race after winning his party's primary.\n\nSoon there may be another first: if Harris wins in November, she will be America's first female president. That prospect has proved invigorating. In just over 24 hours, donors shelled out a record-breaking $81 million for the Harris campaign, and her first appearances have featured roaring crowds. The Democratic Party - from its leaders to its donors - has done what it needed to do, expressing unreserved support for its new candidate.\n\nThe Trump team's response has been entirely predictable. Trump argued that he should get a refund for the millions of dollars he spent campaigning against Biden, and claimed that anointing Harris amounted to a \"coup.\" Several Republican members of Congress have referred to Harris as a \"DEI\" (diversity, equity, and inclusion) candidate, suggesting that she was chosen for her identity, not her record. The GOP is throwing everything it can at Harris, but so far, nothing has stuck.\n\nOver the next 100 days, the contrast between the two candidates will continue to sharpen. Standing beside the young, energetic Harris, the nearly 80-year-old Trump will look even more decrepit. Whereas Harris has the wind at her back, Trump's lack of broad appeal will continue to drag him down. And as Harris (one hopes) makes a clear, forceful, and enthusiastic case for entering a new post-Baby Boom political era, Trump, inept and retrograde, will continue to lean on ugly rhetoric and scare tactics.\n\nAs the late President George H.W. Bush suggested, in politics, one should bet on the team with \"Big Mo\" (momentum). And, right now, that is Team Harris. If she manages to build on that momentum - to raise enthusiasm for her campaign to fever pitch - she may well get the chance to inflict a crushing defeat on Trump and the Republican Party.", "source": {"uri": "stabroeknews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stabroek News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

The burn rate far exceeded rival Trump, whose campaign spent just 46% of the money it raised in June and had $128 million in the bank. Biden's campaign continued to spend even as some polls showed Trump with an edge after the debate and as calls for the incumbent to end his bid grew.\n\nThat situation marked a stunning turnaround from earlier in the contest, which saw Biden build up a sizeable money advantage, aided in part by the lack of a serious Democratic challenger and with Trump dealing with an at-times bitter GOP primary and multiple court cases that drained his coffers.\n\nTrump's fundraising has surged in recent months -- bolstered by appeals to big-dollar Republican donors and support from Wall Street and corporate executives drawn to his economic agenda. Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, the world's richest person according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, said he is \"making some donations\" to a super political action committee supporting the former president, though at a \"much lower level\" than has been reported. People familiar with the matter had said Musk is pledging to pour $45 million a month into the pro-Trump group.\n\nTrump and the Republican National Committee raised $331 million in the second quarter, beating the $264 million Biden and the Democratic National Committee raised.\n\nDemocratic Wall Street donors are also mobilizing to tap their networks and help Harris close the fundraising gap with Trump.\n\nTrump's campaign filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission claiming Biden's transfer of his $96 million violates the law. It poses a novel legal question but many campaign finance experts say the transfer is probably allowed.", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GULF NEWS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

That, coupled with criticism levied at Mr. Trump by in-state Republicans, will play in Ms. Harris' favor, he said.\n\nPolitical analysts in the state both say their side is going to pull out a victory.\n\nStanley Forth, the Democratic chair of Putnam County, Georgia, said Ms. Harris has changed the race in Georgia and she will soon pass Mr. Trump and win the state.\n\n\"She has reenergized the electorate and will get more people out to vote,\" he said. \"I think her economic and abortion messages will resonate with voters in the rural areas.\"\n\nJay Wiliams, a Republican strategist, dismissed Ms. Harris' surge in recent polls as a \"sugar high\" from replacing Mr. Biden atop the ticket.\n\n\"It's a right-leaning state,\" he said. \"She will have to make a good case for herself if you are not right-leaning, and she won't be able to make that case because she is a California liberal.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"},

The poll was conducted on July 22, the day after President Joe Biden ended his bid for the Democrat nomination for president and endorsed Harris.\n\nOverall, 15% of respondents said they planned to leave their state and/or the U.S. if the candidate they oppose in the 2024 presidential election ends up winning the race. Nineteen percent of Harris' supporters planned to relocate, as did 12% of Trump supporters.\n\n\"Of Harris voters considering moving, 62% are thinking about moving to a state and 74% to a country that better aligns with their political views,\" the survey found. \"Of Trump voters considering moving, 67% are thinking about moving to a state and 60% to a country that better aligns with their political views.\"\n\nThe most commonly cited concerns about a Trump presidency that would prompt Harris voters to relocate include increased social inequality (62%), a federal abortion ban (60%), the overturning of progressive rights (58%) and a lack of gun regulation (53%). Meanwhile, 62% of Trump voters thinking of relocating listed both the higher cost of living and taxes as their biggest concerns about a Harris presidency.\n\nAs for states that Harris voters would like to move to if Trump wins the election, 13% said they wanted to relocate to New Jersey followed by 8% who preferred California and 7% who expressed an interest in moving to New York. Meanwhile, 38% of Harris voters who plan on leaving the country if Trump wins election would make Canada their new home followed by 16% who picked the United Kingdom and 7% who favored moving to Mexico.\n\nFifteen percent of Trump voters thinking of moving to a place that better reflects their values if Harris wins the election would choose Florida as their destination state. Thirteen percent said the same about California, while 9% would prefer to move to Texas.\n\nThe countries seen by Trump voters as destinations if Harris wins are the exact same ones chosen by Harris voters. Twenty-four percent of Trump voters who want to move would go to Canada if Harris wins, while 13% would pick the United Kingdom and 11% would select Mexico.\n\nCommenting on the results of the survey, real estate expert James Heartquist asserted: \"The division within the United States has become increasingly pronounced in recent years. This polarization is evident in the way people are aligning themselves with political ideologies, often to the extend of considering relocation. The reasons for this division are multifaceted, including differing views on social issues, economic policies and governance styles.\"\n\n\"This polarization is not just a political phenomenon but also a social one, affecting how communities interact and how individuals perceive their place within the country,\" he added. \"The stakes of the 2024 election are incredibly high. The outcome will shape the country's direction on critical issues such as climate change, healthcare, immigration, and economic inequality. The polarization is so intense that some Americans are willing to uproot their lives to live in a place that aligns more closely with their political beliefs.\"\n\nHeartquist also predicted that \"the real estate market is likely to be significantly impacted by this political migration,\" forecasting \"increased demand in certain areas and decreased demand in others\" that could end up \"driving up property prices in politically favorable regions.\"\n\nHe further maintained that \"policy changes proposed by presidential candidates can influence market sentiment\" by proposing \"changes in tax laws or housing regulations.\"\n\nEven as Harris has replaced Biden as the Democrats' presumptive nominee for president, polarization surrounding both of the major party candidates continues. Both candidates find themselves underwater when it comes to favorability ratings among the American public.\n\nThe RealClearPolitics average of polls measuring the candidates' favorability ratings finds that 50.9% of Americans have an unfavorable view of Harris compared to 41.7% who have a favorable view of her, indicating a net disapproval rating of 9.2 percentage points.\n\nMeanwhile, 43.8% of Americans view Trump favorably, while 52.5% have an unfavorable opinion of him. At 8.7 percentage points, Trump's net disapproval rating is slightly lower than Harris.'\n\nBoth Trump and Harris have much higher favorability ratings than Biden, who has a net disapproval rating of 16.1% percentage points. Just 39.8% of Americans have a favorable opinion of Biden compared to 55.9% who have the opposite view of the president.\n\nAccording to the RealClearPolitics average of polls taken over the past three weeks, 47.9% of Americans plan to back Trump in the election, while 46.2% prefer Harris, a difference of 1.7 percentage points.\n\nIn a five-way race featuring Trump and Harris as well as independent candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, 44.5% of voters plan to back Trump while 42.7% would back Harris. Kennedy's support is measured at 5.8%, followed by Stein at 1.1% and West at 0.8%.\n\nThe RealClearPolitics \"No Toss Ups Map,\" which predicts the outcome of the 2024 presidential election based on polling averages at the state level, shows Trump winning 312 electoral votes to Harris' 226. This makes the former president a slight favorite to win the White House at this point.", "source": {"uri": "christianpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Some were also motivated by their desire to beat GOP nominee Donald Trump.\n\n\"I've talked to more people who have been just in a general sense more reserved about President Biden, who are now very enthusiastic,\" said Mozelle Thompson, a former Federal Trade Commission commissioner and Democratic donor. \"The enthusiasm gap, the excitement gap, has been erased.\"\n\nIt's still early days, but so far the stream of money has been so strong that one donor adviser has even cautioned some donors to slow down until the dynamics of the race make it clearer where money is most needed.\n\nVenture capitalist Bradley Tusk had decided not to donate significantly to Biden's reelection campaign - but with Harris as the Democratic candidate, he said, he planned to give at least $100,000 to back her. With Biden at the top of the ticket, he reasoned, the funding would not have paid off, but Harris' chances were markedly better than Biden's. And unlike the president, Harris wasn't \"falling asleep\" or giving \"crazy answers.\"\n\n\"I understand why people might grumble, and she might not be their first choice,\" Tusk said. \"But in reality, it comes down to this, which is: Do you want Trump back or not? And if the answer is no, there's now a candidate that is viable.\"\n\nHarris' 2020 bid for the White House ended two months before the first Democratic caucus or primary. At the time, her campaign's financial resources had been dwindling, and the then-senator from California explained that her campaign didn't \"have the financial resources we need to continue.\"\n\n\"As the campaign has gone on, it's become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete,\" Harris said when she announced she was dropping out.\n\nEven after she assumed the vice presidency, donors remained skeptical of Harris. Some discussed replacing her, with one unlikely suggestion that Biden should nominate Harris to the Supreme Court so that she had an off-ramp from the 2024 ticket.\n\nBut in the beginning stages of the current race, her team appears to have elevated her standing with the party's funders, scheduling opportunities to schmooze with donors at events. One Democratic donor, a longtime Harris supporter, emphasized that she had \"materially enhanced her brand in a short period of time.\" The person, who was granted anonymity to discuss private conversations among the donor class, said that even those who had initially wanted an open convention had quickly come around to Harris' candidacy.\n\nStill, there were some donors who did not think she could win, the person said, adding that it was a small group.\n\nThe tension between Harris and the donor class highlights how much of the party's fundraisers are, like the ticket's former principal, older white men. Among those who cast doubt on Harris' fundraising abilities, \"The skepticism was universally from white men,\" said donor adviser Alexandra Acker-Lyons.\n\nAnd while Harris' identity as a Black and South Asian woman may have at one time caused doubts among that traditional donor base, her candidacy also brings in money from new corners of the party. Among South Asian donors, enthusiasm for Harris' rise to the top of the ticket has been \"off the charts,\" said Raj Goyle, a former Kansas state representative who bundled for Barack Obama's 2012 campaign and co-founded Indian American Impact, a voter mobilization nonprofit.\n\n\"I think people have tried for years to use her biracial identity and her multiethnic background as a criticism, whereas I think many of us view it as a strength,\" Goyle said.\n\nAcker-Lyons argued that Harris' earlier financial struggles were a product of the competitive 2020 primary. During that cycle, the party's money was spread out among Democratic candidates, and Harris had not yet been introduced to a national audience, Acker-Lyons said. But now, for example, following endorsements from California Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, their networks of donors are now part of Harris' network, she said.\n\nAcker-Lyons said she has gotten calls from people who had not given in a significant way since 2020 or 2022, asking, \"Where do I give?\" Those donors are primarily giving five or six figures, she said. \"They're excited again, right? They have hope and optimism that we can win again.\"\n\nAcker-Lyons has even advised donors to pause their giving until Harris announces a vice presidential candidate and new polling results emerge. At that point, she said, priorities for investment will be clearer.\n\nBiden had struggled to raise money toward the end of his campaign and entirely lost what had been a significant fundraising advantage over Trump's operation. As of the end of June, the Democratic operation, including Biden's campaign, joint fundraising committees and the Democratic National Committee, had a total of $237 million cash on hand, compared to $281 million across Trump's operation.\n\nAfter the debate, the mounting calls for Biden to step aside, including from Democratic donors like Netflix executive chair Reed Hastings and actor George Clooney, only added to the chaos among Democratic Party officials and operatives.\n\nBut Biden's withdrawal and Harris' ascendancy offered a new sense of optimism among donors who had lost hope in the Democratic ticket. One donor, who requested anonymity to describe uncomfortable dynamics within the Democratic Party, had said they simply could not give to Biden again after the debate.\n\n\"When the debate happened, and it looked like, this was just a catastrophe, we were not going to be re-upping,\" the donor said of their decision with their partner not to give to the Biden campaign again. \"And so now with Kamala Harris as the presumptive nominee, we're definitely going to give more and support more.\"\n\nNot all the party's biggest donors are getting behind Harris. Donor and lawyer John Morgan, who has repeatedly voiced his distaste for the vice president, said he would not bundle for her or give more money to the campaign. Morgan said he had consistently bundled for Democratic tickets since former President Bill Clinton's 1996 campaign.\n\nBiotech venture capitalist Neil Exter conceded that Harris probably would not have been his first choice to lead the ticket. Nobody knows \"whether she will be a good candidate for the next 100 days or not,\" he said. Still, if need be, he would give money to support the ticket because at this point, he said, Democrats do not have a choice.\n\n\"I wouldn't be giving her money because of who she is -- it's rather, I'm giving money because I really don't want Trump to be president,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We don't need a fortune teller to know that this presidential election is going to get really ugly.\n\nNow that Vice President Kamala Harris has emerged as the likely Democratic presidential nominee, and with Donald Trump already having been named the Republican nominee, it's not difficult to imagine what it's going to look like when these two finally square off .\n\nTo say that Harris and Trump don't like each other would be a massive understatement.\n\nFor Harris this election is a choice between a felon and a former prosecutor. And she's confident she is in the stronger position because of her life experience.\n\n\"Before I was elected as vice president, before I was elected a United States senator, I was elected attorney general ... to California. Before that I was a courtroom prosecutor. In those roles I took on perpetrators of all kinds,\" Harris told staffers just one day after President Biden exited the race and endorsed her to take his place. \"Predators who abused women. Fraudsters who ripped off consumers. Cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump's type.\"\n\nThe vice president isn't pulling any punches, and she is just getting warmed up. Harris' campaign is also likely to flip the age script on the Republicans and argue that, at 78, Trump is too old to serve another term in the White House. Expect Democrats to bring up Trump's age and mental acuity often.\n\nHarris is 59, and Trump's running mate, JD Vance, is 39. Voters have eyes, and they're going to draw contrasts between the candidates -- even those on the same ticket. Trump will not fare well in the process.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is starting to zero in on Harris. He challenged her intelligence in a social media post .\n\n\"Wow, just watching the Fake News, and they're doing their very best to turn the Worst President in the History of our Country into a 'Brilliant and Heroic Leader' (He was heroic because he quit!), and to turn 'Dumb as a Rock' Kamala Harris from a totally failed and insignificant Vice President into a future 'Great' President. No, it just doesn't work that way!\" he wrote with indignation.\n\nThe Harris campaign is going to hit Trump on what he might do if elected, such as implement Project 2025 -- a wish list of far-right policies drafted by the ultraconservative Heritage Foundation with input from former Trump staffers. The Trump campaign will counterpunch by looking backward and criticizing Harris for something she didn't do: alleviate the border crisis by addressing the \"root causes\" of migration -- as she was tasked to do by Biden.\n\nYou can bet that conservatives are going to dedicate their best eff orts to caricature the former district attorney and attorney general as \"anti-law enforcement\" and favoring an open border.\n\nReality is more complicated. Living in Southern California, one of the epicenters of immigration into the United States, I know a lot of people in the pro-immigrant movement. They can't stand Harris, who has never shown much interest in the immigrant community or done much to make their lives better.\n\nSadly, Harris' idea of a solution was to tell desperate migrants with few options to stay home. During a quick visit to Guatemala in June 2021, the vice president told those who might be thinking of going north: \"Do not come. Do not come. The United States will continue to enforce our laws and secure our borders.\" To that end, she warned: \"If you come to our border, you will be turned back.\"\n\nAccording to Republicans -- who have a long track record of telling whoppers about immigration -- Harris wants to open the border and welcome even more migrants.\n\nThat reminds me. You know what's really ugly? Dishonesty.\n\nNavarrette writes for The Washington Post.", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heritage_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Heritage Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guatemala"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Guatemala"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/custom/image/9595a7a2-2379-11e7-b3c5-13eacc36a918.jpg?resize=600%2C315", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773409", "eventUri": "eng-9773409", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

This is a boost from the 51% support Biden received in the previous Wall Street Journal poll, though still below the 73% of nonwhite voters who backed him in the 2020 election.\n\nThe vice president's appeal among young voters under 30 has also grown compared to Biden's earlier this month, but not to the level of his 2020 victory.\n\nThe poll highlights a surge of enthusiasm for Harris among Democrats, with about 80% of voters from each party now expressing eagerness for their respective candidates. This marks a dramatic increase from the mere 37% of Biden voters who showed enthusiasm for him in early July.\n\nFurthermore, Harris has consolidated more Democratic support, securing the backing of 92% of those who voted for Biden in 2020.\n\nIn contrast, Biden had maintained the support of just 84% of his voters in an earlier survey.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Two days later, he declared Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance as his running mate.\n\nLess than a week later, President Joe Biden announced he would no longer seek re-election, and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. Since then, the Democratic party has coalesced around her as the de-facto nominee, and she is in the process of choosing a running mate before the August convention.\n\nSo -- with less than 100 days left until the November election -- where do things stand in the dramatically reshaped race?\n\nAccording to multiple recent national and swing state polls, Trump holds a slight lead, but it appears to be narrowing.\n\nNational polls\n\nOne of the first nationwide polls taken after Biden stepped down showed Harris slightly ahead of Trump.\n\nShe topped him by two points in a July 23 Reuters/Ipsos poll, which sampled 1,241 U.S. adults, though her lead was within the 3 percentage point margin of error. One week prior, the same poll had Biden down two points to Trump.\n\nA July 25 New York Times/Siena poll similarly found that, by throwing her hat into the ring, Harris had narrowed the race with Trump. The poll -- which sampled 1,142 registered voters and had a margin of error of 3.3 points -- showed her trailing the former president by one point nationwide among likely voters.\n\nMeanwhile, the same poll, taken when Biden was in the race, found him down six points against Trump.\n\nA July 23 NPR/PBS News/Marist poll found the same result, with Harris down one point against Trump among registered voters nationwide. The poll sampled 1,309 U.S. adults and had a margin of error of 3.2 points.\n\nSwing state polls\n\nPolls taken in swing states -- which will likely determine the winner of the election -- similarly show Harris improving upon Biden's margins and now, in some cases, within striking distance of Trump.\n\nBefore Biden bowed out, battleground states appeared to be falling out of his reach, with him down against Trump in nine key states, according to a New York Times polling average. He trailed Trump by 7 points in Nevada and 4 points in Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona.\n\nA July 25 Emerson College set of polls, taken after Harris entered the race, show her behind Trump in four swing states, but by narrow margins.\n\nShe was down by 5 points in Arizona, 2 in Georgia and Pennsylvania, and 1 in Michigan, according to the poll, which sampled 800 registered voters per state and had a margin of error of 3.3 points.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Harris and Trump were tied, both receiving 47% support.\n\nAnd in a round of Fox News swing state polls released on July 26, Harris tied Trump in Michigan and Pennsylvania, while trailing him by 1 point in Wisconsin, according to The Hill. The poll sampled 3,092 registered voters living in the three states and had a margin of error of 3 points.\n\nPolling averages conducted by Nate Silver, a political statistician, also show the race narrowing in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin since Biden dropped out.\n\nWhen Biden withdrew from the race on July 21, Harris was down against Trump by about 5 points in Pennsylvania. Now, she is down less than 1 point, according to Silver's polling average. Similarly, on July 21, Harris was down about 8 points against Trump in Georgia, whereas she is now down by about 4 points.\n\nIt's likely that Harris will continue closing in on Trump as she chooses a vice presidential nominee and takes the stage at the Democratic National Convention in August, David Barker, a professor of government at American University, told McClatchy News.\n\nIn the fall, after some of the excitement surrounding her new campaign dies down and Republican attacks against her ramp up, her numbers will likely \"drop back down a little bit,\" Barker said.\n\n\"But I suspect that on Election Day, she will be at least where she is now or perhaps even a little bit higher,\" Barker added.", "source": {"uri": "thestate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The State"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brendan_rascius@thestate.com", "name": "Brendan Rascius", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Margin of error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

While many voters were similarly concerned about Trump's readiness, polls suggested more Americans questioned Biden.\n\nNow, the 78-year-old Trump is running against a 59-year-old candidate. And that turns the age question more on him.\n\nHarris has generated massive enthusiasm and money that Biden could not generate. Her supporters are organizing Zoom calls and raising millions of dollars at a time, the latest being a White Dudes for Harris call that generated $3.7 million for her campaign.\n\nThe question is how does she turn that into votes. Can Democrats leverage all of that enthusiasm when they're organizing efforts and turning out voters?\n\nHarris comes into the campaign relatively fresh. Trump and his allies are trying to saddle her with the liabilities of the Biden administration but also run against her as a distinct candidate.\n\nTrump on Monday launched a 30-second advertisement that targets Harris' work on migration issues, dubbing her the \"border czar\" and blaming her for illegal crossings into the United States. After displaying headlines about crime and drugs, the video brands Harris as \"Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal.\"\n\nThe vice president needs to show what kind of candidate she could be. Biden was pitching ideas for a second term as president but also asking to be rewarded for his administration's accomplishments.\n\nHarris, as his second in command, inherits some of his liabilities, particularly on inflation and the border. She will also get to take credit for the administration's accomplishments, but she has to spin it forward and set her own policy priorities.\n\nHer first campaign for the presidency ended before she could reach the Iowa caucuses. The early promise of her 2020 presidential campaign met a more complicated reality as she spent the next 10 months struggling to break through a crowded field of candidates and churning through staff and cash.\n\nBiden's struggles had made many Democrats fear that their electoral map was reduced to Rust Belt states that Trump won in 2016 and Biden flipped in 2020 -- Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nStrategists on both sides believed that Georgia and Arizona, Sun Belt states that Biden also flipped, were moving away from the Democratic president.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_caucuses", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa caucuses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Belt_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sun Belt Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Modern liberalism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_Belt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rust Belt"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/wYutS3YJZ7gAf85JlOBWrsktOz0=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/NQTBAZ5X22KCM54N3IWAXPMNT4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773409", "eventUri": "eng-9773409", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

Here's why big donors are actually lining up in droves.", "body": "Major Democratic donors are already flocking to Kamala Harris, and they say the main reason is straightforward: She's not Joe Biden.\n\nHer presidential campaign raised more than $200 million in its first week, and the Democratic super PAC Future Forward said it had received $150 million in commitments after Biden bowed out. The wave of big-dollar donors, which is defying predictions that the vice president would not be able to appeal to the party's fundraising class, has been particularly noticeable because of some donors' previous aversion to giving to a president they saw as a doomed candidate.\n\nDonors told POLITICO that with Harris assuming Biden's spot at the top of the ticket, they are now more willing to support a Democratic presidential candidate again. Some were also motivated by their desire to beat GOP nominee Donald Trump.\n\n\"I've talked to more people who have been just in a general sense more reserved about President Biden, who are now very enthusiastic,\" said Mozelle Thompson, a former Federal Trade Commission commissioner and Democratic donor. \"The enthusiasm gap, the excitement gap, has been erased.\"\n\nIt's still early days, but so far the stream of money has been so strong that one donor adviser has even cautioned some donors to slow down until the dynamics of the race make it clearer where money is most needed.\n\nVenture capitalist Bradley Tusk had decided not to donate significantly to Biden's reelection campaign - but with Harris as the Democratic candidate, he said, he planned to give at least $100,000 to back her. With Biden at the top of the ticket, he reasoned, the funding would not have paid off, but Harris' chances were markedly better than Biden's. And unlike the president, Harris wasn't \"falling asleep\" or giving \"crazy answers.\"\n\n\"I understand why people might grumble, and she might not be their first choice,\" Tusk said. \"But in reality, it comes down to this, which is: Do you want Trump back or not? And if the answer is no, there's now a candidate that is viable.\"\n\nHarris' 2020 bid for the White House ended two months before the first Democratic caucus or primary. At the time, her campaign's financial resources had been dwindling, and the then-senator from California explained that her campaign didn't \"have the financial resources we need to continue.\"\n\n\"As the campaign has gone on, it's become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete,\" Harris said when she announced she was dropping out.\n\nEven after she assumed the vice presidency, donors remained skeptical of Harris. Some discussed replacing her, with one unlikely suggestion that Biden should nominate Harris to the Supreme Court so that she had an off-ramp from the 2024 ticket.\n\nBut in the beginning stages of the current race, her team appears to have elevated her standing with the party's funders, scheduling opportunities to schmooze with donors at events. One Democratic donor, a longtime Harris supporter, emphasized that she had \"materially enhanced her brand in a short period of time.\" The person, who was granted anonymity to discuss private conversations among the donor class, said that even those who had initially wanted an open convention had quickly come around to Harris' candidacy.\n\nStill, there were some donors who did not think she could win, the person said, adding that it was a small group.\n\nThe tension between Harris and the donor class highlights how much of the party's fundraisers are, like the ticket's former principal, older white men. Among those who cast doubt on Harris' fundraising abilities, \"The skepticism was universally from white men,\" said donor adviser Alexandra Acker-Lyons.\n\nAnd while Harris' identity as a Black and South Asian woman may have at one time caused doubts among that traditional donor base, her candidacy also brings in money from new corners of the party. Among South Asian donors, enthusiasm for Harris' rise to the top of the ticket has been \"off the charts,\" said Raj Goyle, a former Kansas state representative who bundled for Barack Obama's 2012 campaign and co-founded Indian American Impact, a voter mobilization nonprofit.\n\n\"I think people have tried for years to use her biracial identity and her multiethnic background as a criticism, whereas I think many of us view it as a strength,\" Goyle said.\n\nAcker-Lyons argued that Harris' earlier financial struggles were a product of the competitive 2020 primary. During that cycle, the party's money was spread out among Democratic candidates, and Harris had not yet been introduced to a national audience, Acker-Lyons said. But now, for example, following endorsements from California Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, their networks of donors are now part of Harris' network, she said.\n\nAcker-Lyons said she has gotten calls from people who had not given in a significant way since 2020 or 2022, asking, \"Where do I give?\" Those donors are primarily giving five or six figures, she said. \"They're excited again, right? They have hope and optimism that we can win again.\"\n\nAcker-Lyons has even advised donors to pause their giving until Harris announces a vice presidential candidate and new polling results emerge. At that point, she said, priorities for investment will be clearer.\n\nBiden had struggled to raise money toward the end of his campaign and entirely lost what had been a significant fundraising advantage over Trump's operation. As of the end of June, the Democratic operation, including Biden's campaign, joint fundraising committees and the Democratic National Committee, had a total of $237 million cash on hand, compared to $281 million across Trump's operation.\n\nAfter the debate, the mounting calls for Biden to step aside, including from Democratic donors like Netflix executive chair Reed Hastings and actor George Clooney, only added to the chaos among Democratic Party officials and operatives.\n\nBut Biden's withdrawal and Harris' ascendancy offered a new sense of optimism among donors who had lost hope in the Democratic ticket. One donor, who requested anonymity to describe uncomfortable dynamics within the Democratic Party, had said they simply could not give to Biden again after the debate.\n\n\"When the debate happened, and it looked like, this was just a catastrophe, we were not going to be re-upping,\" the donor said of their decision with their partner not to give to the Biden campaign again. \"And so now with Kamala Harris as the presumptive nominee, we're definitely going to give more and support more.\"\n\nNot all the party's biggest donors are getting behind Harris. Donor and lawyer John Morgan, who has repeatedly voiced his distaste for the vice president, said he would not bundle for her or give more money to the campaign. Morgan said he had consistently bundled for Democratic tickets since former President Bill Clinton's 1996 campaign.\n\nBiotech venture capitalist Neil Exter conceded that Harris probably would not have been his first choice to lead the ticket. Nobody knows \"whether she will be a good candidate for the next 100 days or not,\" he said. Still, if need be, he would give money to support the ticket because at this point, he said, Democrats do not have a choice.\n\n\"I wouldn't be giving her money because of who she is -- it's rather, I'm giving money because I really don't want Trump to be president,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The Harris rally came just days after the conclusion of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where Trump formally accepted the party's nomination and brought Ohio Sen.

The 'Border Czar' has turned every state into a border state, and Wisconsinites won't forget that. With President Trump's record of success and a stacked line-up of commonsense Wisconsin Republicans like Eric Hovde on the ballot this November, Kamala and her dangerously liberal policies don't stand a chance.\"\n\nIn the week after Harris launched her candidacy, a campaign spokesperson said the Wisconsin Democratic coordinated campaign hosted more than 2,000 volunteers for events, signed up more than 3,500 new volunteers and made more than 175,000 voter contact attempts, knocking on 60,000 doors. The campaign reported that more than 3,500 supporters attended last week's rally in West Allis.\n\nFollowing the rally and throughout the week, the Harris campaign held news conferences with local leaders in Madison, Wausau, La Crosse and Green Bay, and Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff campaigned for his wife in Stevens Point and Wausau.\n\nThe Democratic coordinated campaign has more than 160 staff and 48 offices in Wisconsin.\n\n\"Wisconsin Democrats are fired up to elect Vice President Kamala Harris, and in the past week, our campaign has seen a surge of energy and new volunteers,\" said Wisconsin Democratic coordinated campaign manager Garren Randolph, in a statement. \"The choice in this election is between a prosecutor and a convicted felon, between someone looking to the future and someone trying to drag us to the past, and between someone who wants to safeguard our freedoms and someone who wants to serve as dictator on 'day one.'\"\n\nTrump, on the call with reporters last week, said Harris is \"the same as Biden, but much more radical. She's a radical left person, and this country doesn't want a radical left person today.\"\n\nRepublicans highlight impact of inflation in Wisconsin\n\nThe RNC pointed to a report from the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee that showed, as of June, Wisconsin had seen an inflation rate of 19.9% since January 2021, estimating the average household is currently paying $973 more per month on goods and services in that timeframe.\n\nAccording to the most recent Marquette University Law School poll, released June 26 before Biden withdrew from the race, the presidential race was a virtual tossup, while in the Senate race, Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin led Hovde by 5 points. Hovde, a banking and real estate mogul from Madison, is challenging Baldwin as she seeks a third term.\n\nTrump defeated Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton by about 23,000 votes in Wisconsin in 2016, and lost the state to Biden by about 21,000 votes in 2020.", "source": {"uri": "jsonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Journal Sentinel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Vance Admits to \"Sucker Punch\" by Kamala in Stunning Leaked Audio", "body": "Senator J.D. Vance knows that Vice President Kamala Harris is a big threat. While he may not be willing to say it publicly, he's certainly admitting it to donors.\n\nIn a new recording released Monday by The Washington Post, Vance spoke candidly at a fundraiser in Golden Valley, Minnesota, on Saturday, where the Ohio senator's line to donors was far different than the about-face that he and former President Donald Trump had been presenting publicly.\n\n\"All of us were hit with a little bit of a political sucker punch,\" said Vance. \"The bad news is that Kamala Harris does not have the same baggage as Joe Biden, because whatever we might have to say, Kamala is a lot younger. And Kamala Harris is obviously not struggling in the same ways that Joe Biden did.\"\n\nWhile Vance's admission was not particularly surprising given Harris's slate of high-profile Democratic endorsements, and how successful her initial fundraising efforts have been, it was a tune that the public hasn't heard Vance sing.\n\nAs CNN's Kaitlan Collins pointed out Monday night, this line was extremely different from what Trump was saying concurrently, over on Fox News.\n\n\"I think she's a worse candidate than him,\" Trump said in an interview with Laura Ingraham. She's far more radical left. She is younger, but I mean she's 60 years old. A lotta people -- I didn't know she was 60 years old, I thought she was a little younger.\"\n\nIn general, the \"Kamala's worse than Biden\" line seems to be the main strategy for the Trump campaign, but it certainly isn't the reality they're facing.\n\nIn the leaked audio, Vance admitted that the Trump campaign had the \"unique opportunity\" to shape public perception of a candidate that voters are far less familiar with, trying out different lines of attack to see what has the most impact.\n\n\"Love 'em or hate 'em, everybody has an opinion about Donald Trump and Joe Biden after the past eight years,\" Vance said to the room of donors. \"But Kamala Harris, people don't really know.\"\n\nBut shortly after President Joe Biden dropped out, Vance acted like nothing had changed.\n\n\"I don't think the political calculus changes at all,\" Vance told reporters on July 22. \"We were running against Joe Biden's open border, Kamala Harris's open border. Kamala Harris supported the Green New Scam. Kamala Harris, frankly, covered Joe Biden even though it was obvious he was mentally incompetent for a very long time.\"\n\nVance spokesman Will Martin released a statement Monday in response to the leaked audio. \"Poll after poll shows President Trump leading Kamala Harris as voters become aware of her weak, failed and dangerously liberal agenda,\" Martin said. \"Her far-left ideas are even more radioactive than Joe Biden, particularly in the key swing states that will decide this election like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

In 2020, Biden narrowly flipped the state blue by a little more than 11,000 votes and marked the first time Georgia voted for a Democrat for president since 1992.\n\n\"I have not seen this much excitement amongst the Democratic base and Democratic coalition since Barack Obama,\" Tharon Johnson, an Atlanta-based political strategist who has worked for Democratic candidates in the state, told the Wall Street Journal. \"This is the most excitement we've felt in Georgia over the last decade.\"\n\nHarris is set to campaign in Atlanta on Tuesday, where she will be accompanied by Sens.

Harris' campaign began on July 21, immediately after President Joe Biden said he would end his reelection campaign.\n\nSince then, in Florida and across the country, Democrats have reported enthusiastic support for their new candidate as Republicans have switched gears from opposing Biden to opposing Harris.\n\n\"I think it shows that we are a pretty divided country. Part of the deficit for Biden was with Democratic enthusiasm. At least for now, it appears that Harris has captured much of the Democratic base and returned the race to basically a dead heat,\" Kevin Wagner, an FAU political scientist said via text.\n\nWagner -- who also is co-director of FAU's PolCom Lab, a collaboration of the School of Communication and Multimedia Studies and Department of Political Science, which conducted the poll -- said the numbers show \"how much Biden was dragging the ticket.\"\n\nDemographic breakdowns:\n\n-- American voters quickly assumed their partisan positions. Among Democratic likely voters surveyed, Harris has support of 82%. Among Republicans, Trump has support of 87%. Independent likely voters are closely divided, with 45% for Harris and 43% for Trump. \"The presidential race really shows how much partisan identity drives our choices. This has become another election that will be decided by who turns out their voters better,\" Wagner said.\n\n-- There is a gender gap. Among women, Harris is at 50% and Trump at 43%. Among men, Harris has 45% and Trump is at 49%.\n\n-- Democrats have touted Harris' appeal to younger voters. The Florida Democratic Party put out an email blast Tuesday morning that proclaimed, \"The youth vote will decide the election.\"\n\nThat doesn't show up in the FAU poll. Among likely voters younger than 50, Harris is at 41% to 49% for Trump. Among likely voters 50 and older, Harris is at 52% and Trump is at 44%.\n\nWagner said the breakdowns by age are large groups that may not best assess the views of the youngest voters. And, he said, younger voters often are one of the last groups to focus on an electron.\n\nA week ago, an FAU national poll found 49% for Trump, the Republican nominee, to 44% for Harris, among likely voters. It's not a direct comparison, since the poll released on July 23 was conducted immediately after the conclusion of the Republican National Convention with questioning halted immediately after Biden dropped out. So the matchup was hypothetical, without people actually seeing the rollout of her campaign.\n\nWhen likely voters were given the additional choice the the new poll of independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr., he gets 8% in a three-way matchup.\n\nWith Kennedy in a hypothetical matchup, Harris is at 44% and Trump at 43%.\n\nThe poll included a generic question asking people which party they'd vote for in fall elections for U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nLikely voters favored the Democrat over the Republican 47% to 42%, a five-point advantage for Democrats, and among all voters a Democrat was ahead 46% to 42%, a four-point advantage.\n\nA week earlier, Republicans had a one-point advantage among likely voters, and Democrats had a one-point advantage among all voters.\n\nWagner said the small Democratic lead in the latest survey is a \"good measure that Harris' candidacy has brought the base back and will likely help down ballot. This is one of the reasons so many elected Dems wanted Biden to step aside.\"\n\nHarris was viewed favorably by 53% of voters and unfavorably by 44%, which is a net favorability rating of 9 percentage points.\n\nAmong Democrats, 87% viewed her favorably, compared to 17% of Republicans and 48% of independents.\n\nTrump was viewed favorably by 49% of voters and unfavorably by 50%, a net negative of 1 point.\n\nAmong Democrats, 19% viewed him favorably, compared to 86% of Republicans and 43% of independents.\n\nMany voters had positive emotional reactions to Biden's decision to end his reelection and Harris taking his place, the survey found.\n\nAsked about Biden being out and Harris being in, 20% of voters expressed excitement, 18% joy/happiness, 18% fear, 9% pride, 7% sadness and 7% anger.\n\nComparisons:\n\nRepublicans (26%) and independents (28%) were much more likely than Democrats (11%) to say they didn't know how they felt.\n\nThe poll of 997 U.S. registered voters was conducted July 26 to July 27 by Mainstreet Research for Florida Atlantic University's PolCom Lab, which is a collaboration of the School of Communication and Multimedia Studies and Department of Political Science.\n\nThe survey used an online panel and automated phone calls to reach other voters. It has a margin of error equivalent to plus or minus 3 percentage points for the full survey of Democrats, Republicans and independents.\n\nHowever, the margin of error for smaller groups, such as Republicans or Democrats or men and women, would be higher because the sample sizes are smaller.", "source": {"uri": "orlandosentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Orlando Sentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anthony_man@orlandosentinel.com", "name": "Anthony Man", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Atlantic_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida Atlantic University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Political science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Sentinel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sun Sentinel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Democratic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida Democratic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Margin of error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Trump's team unveiling television advertisements that aim to explain her biography to voters in battleground states.\n\nMs. Harris's new ad, her first since becoming the party's de facto nominee, labels her as \"fearless\" while leaning into her time as a local and state prosecutor. \"She put murderers and abusers behind bars,\" a narrator states. \"Kamala Harris has always known who she represents.\"\n\nMr. Trump's new ad, meanwhile, attacks her as being weak on the border. It suggests that she is responsible for millions of border crossings and a quarter-million deaths from fentanyl, which the ad says occurred \"on Harris's watch.\" It closes with a new Trump tagline for Ms. Harris: \"Failed. Weak. Dangerously Liberal.\"\n\nJust over a week ago, Ms. Harris replaced President Biden as the Democratic Party's standard-bearer. Despite being the vice president and having represented the nation's largest state as one of California's senators, Ms. Harris is relatively unknown by many of the voters in battleground states who are likely to decide the presidential election.\n\nThe new ads will cost tens of millions of dollars and run in those key states.\n\nMs. Harris's spot is the beginning of what her campaign has said is a $50 million blitz before the Democratic National Convention, which begins on Aug. 19 in Chicago. (The campaign has announced roughly the same amount of ad spending in the previous several months.)\n\nThe Trump campaign is spending more than $12 million across Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin over the next two weeks, according to data from AdImpact, a media-tracking service -- its first major television ad purchase since Mr. Biden made way for his vice president.\n\nThe Harris campaign said its ads would run in 60-second increments on broadcast television during the Olympics, among other programming, and appear in shorter versions online.\n\n\"Kamala Harris has always stood up to bullies, criminals and special interests on behalf of the American people -- and she's beaten them,\" said Jen O'Malley Dillon, Ms. Harris's campaign chair. \"This $50 million paid media campaign, bolstered by our record-setting fund-raising haul and a groundswell of grass-roots enthusiasm, is one crucial way we will reach and make our case to the voters who will decide this election.\"\n\nMs. Harris's ad also leans into an argument that she represents the future while Mr. Trump, 78, stands for the past -- a case that is far easier for Democrats to press with the vice president, who is 59, at the top of the ticket rather than the 81-year-old Mr. Biden.\n\n\"Donald Trump wants to take our country backward,\" Ms. Harris says in the ad. \"To give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and end the Affordable Care Act. But we are not going back.\"\n\nMr. Trump's ad aims at what his campaign believes is one of Ms. Harris's biggest weaknesses: the Biden administration's border record.\n\nIn speeches over the past week, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized Ms. Harris's work as the \"border czar,\" a position she was never officially given but that refers to her being deputized by Mr. Biden to try to address the root issues causing people to flee countries in Central America.

In other states, she has winnowed the sizable lead Trump had over Biden, all while raking in endorsements and participation from major celebrities -- including Megan Thee Stallion, who is set to perform at a Harris rally in Atlanta on Tuesday.\n\nBut it's the regular, everyday folks who are carrying the show.\n\nKanninen said 300 voters showed up for Harris in \"deep red Forsyth County, Georgia,\" where Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear appeared Sunday morning. A similar number showed up to a rural event in Pennsylvania with Keystone state Gov. Josh Shapiro. Even more turned out for a canvass launch in St. Paul with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nAll three men are considered possible VP picks for Harris. Kanninen also namechecked Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-FL), the first Gen Z member of Congress, who held an event for Harris in the suburbs of Las Vegas.\n\nKanninen boasted a dizzying array of numbers: More than 2,300 campaign-related events in one weekend; 360,000 new volunteers -- double the number from three days prior; 29,000 volunteers knocking on 126,000 doors in 48 hours, then making six times as many phone calls.\n\nThe Democratic battleground states director said the campaign has more than 260 field offices in the swing states that will likely decide the outcome of the 2024 election, along with more than 1,300 staffers.\n\nHundreds of others are already defending the \"blue wall\" for Harris, with more on the way, he said. Georgia opened three new offices over the weekend and the size of the teams in Arizona and North Carolina will soon double.\n\nOn policy, Harris Communications Director Michael Tyler said the campaign will focus on abortion rights. Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff and other high-profile surrogates will hammer the issue this week, he said.\n\nHarris herself is scheduled to meet with reproductive rights leaders in Atlanta before her rally with Georgia politicians who include former gubernatorial hopeful Stacey Abrams.\n\nWhen asked if the campaign was worried about Republicans painting Harris as \"an abortion extremist,\" Tyler reminded reporters of the \"extreme\" candidates on the GOP ticket: Donald Trump and J.D. Vance.\n\n\"They're attacking things like IVF, contraception,\" Tyler said. \"They're attacking people who decide not to have kids, right? I think the only elegy that they should be writing is for their appeals to the mainstream of the American electorate, because they have been falling flat on their face.\"", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_Frost", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maxwell Frost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Thee_Stallion", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Megan Thee Stallion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Beshear", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andy Beshear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Paul,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saint Paul, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint Paul, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forsyth County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Forsyth County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doug Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacey_Abrams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stacey Abrams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Communications_Director", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Communications Director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead. Where every senior can retire with dignity,\" Harris, 59, says in the advertisement.\n\nOn July 21, US President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the American presidential elections. He endorsed Harris, his running mate, as the nominee of the Democratic Party for the November general elections.\n\n\"But Donald Trump wants to take our country backward. To give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and end the Affordable Care Act. But we are not going back,\" she says.\n\n\"Fearless\" will run on local and national broadcast, cable programming, streaming, and social channels.\n\nAs part of the campaign's Olympics presence, Harris for President is planning to air ads both locally and nationally during the Olympic Games, which saw nearly 30 million US viewers for the opening ceremony -- a more-than-60 per cent increase over the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nShorter fifteen-second and six-second versions of the ads will also reach voters on Connected TV, audio, and social platforms.\n\nHarris for President campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said throughout her career as a courtroom prosecutor, Attorney General, United States Senator, and now as Vice President, Kamala Harris has always stood up to bullies, criminals and special interests on behalf of the American people - and she's beaten them.\n\n\"She's uniquely suited to take on Donald Trump, a convicted felon who has spent his entire life ripping off working people, tearing away our rights, and fighting for himself. This USD 50 million paid media campaign, bolstered by our record-setting fundraising haul and a groundswell of grassroots enthusiasm, is one crucial way we will reach and make our case to the voters who will decide this election,\" Dillon said.

The ad was the first since former President Donald Trump won the GOP nomination nearly two weeks ago and since President Joe Biden dropped his 2024 reelection bid and named Harris as his chosen successor.\n\nThe ad will start airing Tuesday and attempts to convey to voters that Harris's blunders at the border are the cause of immigration-related problems within the United States, including violent crime, the tens of thousands of fentanyl-induced deaths each year since 2020, and the release of suspected terrorists into the country from the southern border.\n\n\"Under Harris, over 10 million illegally here. A quarter of a million Americans dead from fentanyl. Brutal migrant crimes. And ISIS -- now here,\" the voiceover states.\n\nHarris is then shown in a 2021 interview with NBC's Lester Holt, who asked why Harris had not visited the U.S.-Mexico border as the number of illegal immigrants arrested surged in Biden's first months in office, and she was tapped to address the root causes of people fleeing certain Central American nations.\n\n\"I haven't been to Europe. I mean, I don't understand the point that you are making,\" Harris told Holt.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nA spokesman for Harris's campaign said in a statement Tuesday that the Trump ad was an attempt to distract people from the Republican candidate's own immigration plans.\n\n\"After killing the toughest border deal in decades, Donald Trump is running on his trademark lies because his own record and 'plans' are extreme and unpopular,\" said Harris campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa. \"As a former district attorney, attorney general, and now vice president, Kamala Harris has spent her career taking on and prosecuting violent criminals and making our communities safer. She'll do the same as president.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anna_giaritelli@washingtonexaminer.com",

The same poll revealed similar results to the Journal: Harris and Trump are tied, each at 42 percent among registered voters. Among likely voters, however, Harris is leading Trump by one percentage point.\n\nHarris' campaign to label vice presidential candidate JD Vance as \"weird and creepy\" also appears to be working, an ABC News poll revealed on Monday. The Ohio senator's negative poll numbers are rising, the survey showed, jumping eight percentage points in the last week.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, called JD Vance \"an incredibly bad choice\" as Trump's running mate and alluded to a deadline for the former president to pick a new candidate.\n\n\"Donald Trump, I know him, and he's probably sitting and watching the TV, and every day it comes out Vance has done something more extreme, more weird, more erratic,\" Schumer said Sunday on weekend news show, Face the Nation.\n\nSchumer went on to argue that the ballot access deadline in Vance's home state of Ohio, August 7, is fast approaching -- though the Ohio secretary of state says it has been extended to September 1.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris is tasked with finding her own running mate.\n\nSeveral lawmakers are in the running, including Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.\n\nPennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who hosted a recent campaign

Kennedy at 4 percent.\n\nThe poll showed 94 percent of self-identified Democrats support Harris, up from 84 percent who supported Biden in May. Meanwhile, 88 percent of Republicans support Trump. Also, 45 percent of independents support Harris, while 33 percent support Trump.\n\nOn July 21, Biden announced he would not seek a second term and endorsed Harris. This came three weeks after a presidential debate in which he lost his train of thought at times and sometimes made halting and disjointed statements.\n\nThe announcement came after a number of nationally prominent Democrats called for him to drop out of the race. It also came after Biden's small lead in some states, including New Hampshire, turned into a small deficit.\n\nIn a post on X, N.H. Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley thanked Biden for his decision and called him a \"True American Patriot.\"\n\nThe party also put up a post saying, \"We are so excited to congratulate Kamala Harris on earning the support to become our presumptive Democratic nominee for President of the United States!\"\n\nCarlos Cardona, a 2024 delegate to the Democratic National Convention, also posted last week, \"The last time I felt this kind of excitement, especially here in New Hampshire, was 2008, and that was Barack Obama when he visited Laconia.\"\n\nThe last Republican to win a presidential general election in the Granite State was George W. Bush in 2000.\n\nRepublican Gov. Chris Sununu predicted more than a year ago that Harris would end up as the Democratic nominee for president. He also initially opposed Trump.\n\nIn an opinion essay in The New York Times on Aug. 21, 2023, Sununu said:\n\n\"If Mr. Trump is the Republican nominee for president in 2024, Republicans will lose up and down the ballot. ... Every candidate with an R next to his or her name, from school board to the statehouse, will be left to answer for the electoral albatross at the top of the ticket.\"\n\nAfter Trump dominated early Republican primaries this year, Sununu said he would support him.\n\nMeanwhile, national polls show an extremely close presidential race.\n\nA poll of 1,000 registered voters across the country, sponsored by the Wall Street Journal, showed support for Harris at 45 percent, with Trump at 44 percent.", "source": {"uri": "sentinelsource.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SentinelSource.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rick_green@sentinelsource.com", "name": "Rick Green", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_Hampshire", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of New Hampshire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

In other states, she has winnowed the sizable lead Trump had over Biden, all while raking in endorsements and participation from major celebrities -- including Megan Thee Stallion, who is set to perform at a Harris rally in Atlanta on Tuesday.\n\nBut it's the regular, everyday folks who are carrying the show.\n\nKanninen said 300 voters showed up for Harris in \"deep red Forsyth County, Georgia,\" where Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear appeared Sunday morning. A similar number showed up to a rural event in Pennsylvania with Keystone state Gov. Josh Shapiro. Even more turned out for a canvass launch in St. Paul with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nAll three men are considered possible VP picks for Harris. Kanninen also namechecked Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-FL), the first Gen Z member of Congress, who held an event for Harris in the suburbs of Las Vegas.\n\nKanninen boasted a dizzying array of numbers: More than 2,300 campaign-related events in one weekend; 360,000 new volunteers -- double the number from three days prior; 29,000 volunteers knocking on 126,000 doors in 48 hours, then making six times as many phone calls.\n\nThe Democratic battleground states director said the campaign has more than 260 field offices in the swing states that will likely decide the outcome of the 2024 election, along with more than 1,300 staffers.\n\nHundreds of others are already defending the \"blue wall\" for Harris, with more on the way, he said. Georgia opened three new offices over the weekend and the size of the teams in Arizona and North Carolina will soon double.\n\nOn policy, Harris Communications Director Michael Tyler said the campaign will focus on abortion rights. Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff and other high-profile surrogates will hammer the issue this week, he said.\n\nHarris herself is scheduled to meet with reproductive rights leaders in Atlanta before her rally with Georgia politicians who include former gubernatorial hopeful Stacey Abrams.\n\nWhen asked if the campaign was worried about Republicans painting Harris as \"an abortion extremist,\" Tyler reminded reporters of the \"extreme\" candidates on the GOP ticket: Donald Trump and J.D. Vance.\n\n\"They're attacking things like IVF, contraception,\" Tyler said. \"They're attacking people who decide not to have kids, right? I think the only elegy that they should be writing is for their appeals to the mainstream of the American electorate, because they have been falling flat on their face.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_Frost", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maxwell Frost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Thee_Stallion", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Megan Thee Stallion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Beshear", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andy Beshear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Paul,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saint Paul, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint Paul, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forsyth County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Forsyth County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doug Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacey_Abrams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stacey Abrams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Communications_Director", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Communications Director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Several show Harris quickly surpassing President Joe Biden when pitted against former President Donald Trump in the polls. But one data point in particular has me feeling optimistic about Harris' odds.\n\nA snap poll conducted by Democratic pollster Blueprint immediately after Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris found that registered voters were split 50-50 on whether she or Trump would do a better job \"bringing down prices\" on goods and services. \"The upside for Harris is huge: Voters do not hold her accountable for Biden's perceived failures on inflation, and she can run hard on economic messaging,\" Blueprint lead pollster Evan Roth Smith told Semafor.\n\nTo use a Bidenism, this is a big f---ing deal.\n\nHarris coming in even with Trump on inflation might not sound all that positive, but it is. Countless polls have shown that Biden was weak against Trump on the economy, and specifically on inflation. Biden struggled to win back voter trust on the economy, despite the fact that inflation has dissipated, wages have grown and the economy is by many metrics, including the unemployment rate, very strong. It seems that, for at least some of the electorate, the memory of high inflation earlier in Biden's term stuck to him and was hard to shake off, particularly as housing inflation remains high.\n\nBut it looks like Harris might have a chance to instantly shed Biden's second-biggest political liability -- behind only questions about his mental acuity.\n\nHarris getting an opportunity to reset the Democrats on the economy is an especially big deal because it looms particularly large in the eyes of undecided voters who could play a decisive role in the election. While Biden's \"defense of democracy\" narrative played well with the plugged-in Democratic base, less politically engaged voters are more focused on their pocketbooks. If Harris is seen as either not responsible for or less responsible for inflation, it could make them more receptive to her pitch on economic issues.\n\nRepublicans are starting to roll out attacks on Harris as liable for inflation during Biden's term; it's unclear how much of it will stick. Inflation has been notably absent from Harris' opening case to voters in speeches and her first campaign video. It's possible she wants to avoid drawing attention to the issue during the initial phase of her campaign, during which she wants to focus in positive terms about her vision for the country and exploit a honeymoon period with the press and the electorate.\n\nBut she won't be able to avoid it indefinitely. Harris will need to settle upon strategies for discussing the Biden administration's record on the issue; unveil her policy plan to address concerns that some costs remain too high (especially housing) or fears that high inflation could return; and determine whether she will home in on Trump's extremist tariff plans as inflationary.\n\nThere are no easy answers here, as the Harris campaign will have to balance trying to focus on narratives that most naturally play to her strengths against addressing voter concerns. But her performance in the polls suggest that there's a window for her to make a case that Biden couldn't.", "source": {"uri": "msnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MSNBC.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/240729-kamala-harris-vl-410p-15060c.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773409", "eventUri": "eng-9773409", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

In fact, members of the establishment media called Harris a \"border czar\" at least eight times since March 2021, when President Joe Biden tasked Harris \"to lead our efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle and the countries that need help in stemming the movement of so many folks, stemming the migration to our southern border,\" as Breitbart News detailed. Media personalities who reported that were from CNN, MSNBC, CBS News, and ABC News.\n\nRELATED -- Fmr.

A quarter of a million Americans dead from fentanyl. Brutal migrant crimes, and ISIS now here,\" the narrator says before the ad shows a moment from Harris's resurfaced interview with Lester Holt, who said to her at the time, \"You haven't been to the border.\"\n\n\"And I haven't been to Europe. I mean, I don't understand the point that you're making,\" Harris responds, gigging.\n\n\"Kamala Harris. Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal,\" the ad ends.\n\nThe new offensive suggests that, after a week of scrambling to find the best message for attacking Trump's new rival, his campaign admakers are sticking with the tried-and-true. What's conspicuously not included are suggestions that she's a \"DEI hire,\" allegations she covered up Biden's mental state, clips of her laughing, mentions of Venn diagrams or any of the other attacks that have gone viral among the MAGA faithful but do little to move the needle among a broader audience.\n\nIn turn, Harris's campaign is expected to announce what Politico Playbook described as a \"large media buy later this morning, coming on the heels of a $50 million commitment last week from the Future Forward super PAC.\" That comes on the heels of Harris raising $1.5 million at a fundraising event featuring Yo Yo Ma, James Taylor, and, of course, Harris. That is significantly less than the $2 million Sen. JD Vance (R-OH), former President Donald Trump's running mate, raised at a lunchtime fundraising event.\n\nIt also comes as the Trump campaign stays the course, reminding voters that criticisms of Harris have nothing to do with her gender or race but do concern her leftist positions.\n\n\"It has everything to do with competence, and Kamala Harris has proven to be just as incompetent as Joe Biden,\" Trump campaign national spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said during a recent appearance on Breitbart News Saturday.\n\n\"The wide open southern border, a weak foreign policy that led to war in Ukraine and strengthened Iranian-backed terrorists in the Middle East to attack Israel,\" she said, noting that Harris also \"supported every single one of Joe Biden's terrible economic policies that created the worst inflation crisis in a generation.\"\n\n\"We will make sure every voter knows where Kamala Harris stands on the issue. She is to the left of Bernie Sanders. She's dangerously liberal. We cannot afford her leadership in the Oval Office, and that will be our goal between now and Election Day for the next 101 days, to ensure every voter knows how radically liberal Kamala Harris is,\"

To give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and end the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nWhile Ms Harris is trying to strike a contrast with Mr Trump on his approach to big business, the former president and Republican nominee launched his own $12 million ad campaign by attacking the vice-president for her record on immigration policy.\n\nEarly in Mr Biden's administration Ms Harris was tasked with handling the root causes of migration across the border with Mexico, including through high level diplomatic engagement with several central American countries.\n\nBut Republicans have accused her of failing to contain a jump in illegal border crossings that unfolded during Mr Biden's presidency, making it one of her biggest political vulnerabilities.\n\n\"This is America's border tsar and she's failed us,\" the narrator in the Trump ad says, speaking over footage of Ms Harris dancing at an outdoor party, pointing to the 10 million undocumented immigrants in the country, and what it claimed were the fentanyl deaths, \"brutal\" crimes and Islamic State terrorism that came along with the surge.\n\nThe ad also mocks Ms Harris for an NBC interview in 2021 during which she struggled to explain why she had not visited the border with Mexico.\n\nThe Trump ad comes after the Republican former president was able to rally big party donors to his side in recent months, and boost fundraising on the back of his criminal conviction in New York as well as the assassination attempt against him earlier this month.\n\nSince entering the race on July 21st, Ms Harris has raised more than $200 million, a reflection of the Democratic enthusiasm surrounding her candidacy. The party's fundraising had slowed sharply in previous weeks amid donor unhappiness with Mr Biden's candidacy.\n\nPrevious Biden TV ad campaigns in battleground states had failed to improve his polling numbers, so the Harris campaign will hope her spots will be more effective.\n\n\"We are the underdogs in this race, but the groundswell of support around the vice-president is real and it is meaningful,\" Harris campaign battleground states director Dan Kanninen told reporters on Monday. \"Our task now is to translate that enthusiasm into action.\" -

Credit: Gage Skidmore from Peoria, AZ, United States of America, CC BY-SA 2.0 , via Wikimedia Commons\n\nA recent Axios/Generation Lab poll reveals that Vice President Kamala Harris is significantly outpacing former President Donald Trump among Gen Z voters. This poll indicates that Harris holds a commanding lead over Trump in the 18 -- to 34-year-old demographic, with 60% supporting Harris compared to 40% for Trump.\n\nThis surge of support from younger voters highlights a critical demographic shift. The poll was conducted shortly after President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the 2024 race and his endorsement of Harris as the Democratic nominee, which appears to have bolstered her standing among younger Americans.\n\nWhen respondents were asked to choose between Biden and Trump, 53% of the 18 to 34 demographic favored Biden, while 47% preferred Trump. This shows a noticeable increase in support for Harris over Biden, suggesting that her candidacy resonates more with the younger electorate.\n\nThe poll, conducted between July 22 and July 24, also asked participants to rate Harris, Biden, and Trump on a favorability scale. Harris emerged as the most favorable, with 45% viewing her positively. Trump followed with 34%, and Biden trailed at 33%. Additionally, Trump had the highest percentage of respondents rating him as \"extremely unfavorable\" at 42%.\n\nHarris's campaign has been in high gear since she announced her intentions to secure the Democratic nomination. Her campaign set a fundraising record by collecting $200 million in just the first week. Furthermore, Harris's social media presence surged, amassing over a million followers on TikTok within hours of her first post. Her ability to dominate headlines and engage with younger voters on platforms like TikTok demonstrates her appeal to a tech-savvy generation.\n\nA pivotal question remains regarding Harris's choice of a running mate. When polled on this issue, 38% of young respondents were unsure, reflecting uncertainty and anticipation. U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg garnered 14% support, while Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro also received notable mentions.\n\nThe enthusiastic support for Harris among Gen Z and younger millennials indicates a shift in the political landscape. This demographic, which has shown increasing political engagement and activism, favors Harris's policies and vision for the future. Her focus on climate change, social justice, and economic equality resonates strongly with younger voters, who are poised to play a crucial role in the upcoming election.\n\nAs Harris continues to build momentum, her campaign will likely leverage this support to galvanize a broader coalition of voters. The significant lead over Trump in the younger demographic could prove decisive as the election approaches, highlighting the growing influence of Gen Z in shaping the future of American politics.", "source": {"uri": "econotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EconoTimes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Demography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generation Z"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gretchen Whitmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Michigan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://f1.econotimes.com/2024/07/cbktmbsqqw_th_1024x0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773409", "eventUri": "eng-9773409", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "dateEnd": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 1142, "textEnd": 1161}], "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

In the video, Michelle Obama expressed her pride in Harris and described the upcoming election as \"historic,\" before the former president shared their endorsement.\n\n\"We called to say, Michelle and I couldn't be prouder to endorse you and do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office,\" Barack Obama said.\n\nThe Obamas, two of the most popular figures in the Democratic Party, had been the most prominent holdouts as the rest of the party quickly coalesced around Harris this week. Barack Obama, known for his draw at events, will likely appear on the campaign trail for Harris in the lead-up to November.\n\nHarris and Barack Obama have maintained contact over the years, with the former president often serving as a sounding board since her days as California state attorney general. They have communicated multiple times in recent days as Harris sought to rally support for her nomination after President Joe Biden exited the race and endorsed her. (Related: RFK Jr. accuses DNC of once again RIGGING the nomination process - this time for Kamala Harris.)\n\nOn the call, Obama acknowledged that Democrats are \"going to be underdogs\" and emphasized that Harris will have to earn the trust of voters across the country.\n\n\"We're absolutely confident that you're gonna be able to make it happen. And I wanna make sure that, you know, we're sending a message out to not just Democrats but every American - Democrat, Republican, Independent and especially young people - that the stakes are high. And your vision for a generous, inclusive, positive, community-minded, responsible, lawful America - that's exactly what we need. So, I know you're gonna be working hard, but you're gonna have a whole bunch of folks working alongside you,\" Obama said, according to excerpts of the phone call.\n\nBarack Obama was reportedly among the top Democratic officials privately urging Biden to reconsider his candidacy in the weeks following a disastrous debate performance. However, the former president refrained from endorsing Harris in recent days, a move that infuriated some Democrats.\n\nObama's delay was intentional, according to a person familiar with his thinking, who noted that the former president did not want to interject with an endorsement while the party determined its nominee process.\n\nThis endorsement is expected to significantly bolster Harris' campaign, as the Obamas remain influential figures within the Democratic Party. Their support is likely to energize the Democratic base and attract undecided voters, giving Harris a crucial advantage as she campaigns for the presidency.\n\nThe endorsement comes at a pivotal moment in Harris' campaign, as she aims to unify the party and present a strong challenge in the upcoming election. With the backing of the Obamas, Harris is poised to make a compelling case to the American electorate, emphasizing her vision for a united and inclusive nation.\n\nNBC News reported that Barack Obama has been in regular contact with Harris throughout the week, providing counsel on how to rapidly build up her campaign operation using the staff, money and logistics from Biden's campaign.

The Harris and Trump campaigns both launched attempts to define the all-but-certain Democratic nominee with major new television advertisements out Tuesday, the first since President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race.\n\nA new 60-second ad from Harris, titled \"Fearless,\" is heavy on biographical details, portraying her ascent to the vice presidency as a yearslong crusade of holding banks, drug companies and criminals accountable as a prosecutor. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump is going all-in on the \"border czar\" tagline, attacking Harris as \"failed, weak and dangerously liberal\" in two 30-second spots that include footage from Harris' 2021 interview with NBC News' Lester Holt in Guatemala, where she was criticized for dismissing a question about why she hadn't visited the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe new ads are part of major new campaigns, the first since Biden's exit reshaped the race and upended both candidates' plans of attack. And they represent the opening salvo of a 100-day election sprint unlike any presidential campaign in modern history: Harris is hoping to ride her honeymoon phase -- and high favorables -- into November, while Trump aims to put an end to Democrats' newfound invigoration as quickly as possible, reverting to similar attack lines that he used against Biden.", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_Holt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lester Holt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guatemala"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Guatemala"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/1561ea5/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/1200x800%3E/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fd4%2Fb9%2F58ba887545f6963302f5ad181ef4%2Felection-2024-harris-62703.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773409", "eventUri": "eng-9773409", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

That's eight points higher than her rating last month, and 11 points higher than Biden's last month.\n\nA Wall Street Journal poll on Friday showed 46% of registered voters liked Harris -- 11 points higher than her showing almost a month ago, and 12 points higher than Biden's at that time.\n\nAnd Fox News polls on Friday in four key Midwestern and Rust Belt states -- Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- showed Harris's favourable rating averaging 49%, which is eight points higher than Biden's present number.\n\nCombine that with earlier CNN and New York Times-Siena College polling, and it all suggests Harris has increased favourable views of the top of the Democratic ticket by at least the high single digits.\n\nSome of the more interesting findings from those polls:\n\nPerhaps most striking in the Times-Siena poll is how much Harris appears to have made the Democratic ticket more palatable to less-reliable voters who could defect from the Democrats or sit out the 2024 election.\n\nWhile just 74% of Biden 2020 voters liked him, 88% of Biden 2020 voters liked Harris. And the poll showed her being viewed favourably by about twice as many people who didn't vote in 2020 (46% vs 24%) and who now support a candidate besides her, Donald Trump or Robert F. Kennedy jnr (33% vs. 17%).\n\nAll of which suggests Harris could not only stem the bleeding of Biden's support, but she could appeal to less-likely voters and claw back some voters who went for left-leaning third-party candidates.\n\nAs with all early polling conducted in the days after the Democrats' switcheroo, it's worth emphasising that it's early. Harris is surely in a honeymoon period that might not last, particularly as attention turns to some of the positions she took during her 2020 Democratic presidential primary campaign.\n\nIt's also important to note that, even with the improved image of the top of the Democratic ticket, Harris' favourable numbers are mostly similar to Trump's in these polls. Trump appears to have received a bit of his own bump after the assassination attempt against him and the Republican National Convention, and he was already generally more popular than he was during his presidency. And the race both nationally and in swing states is very close.\n\nBut there's little question that, at least for now, Harris has put the Democratic ticket back on the map for lots of the most problematic voting groups for Democrats. Democrats looked like they were going to have to win lots of voters who didn't like Biden and who didn't seem to have much reason to vote blue, beyond dislike of Trump. Many of those voters today see a more viable option in Harris.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_Belt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rust Belt"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Polls show a tight race, with Harris gaining ground against Trump compared to Biden in the weeks before he withdrew from the election amid concerns about his age.\n\nData from the OpenSecrets reveals that Trump is outraising Harris among those employed by the U.S. Army.\n\nTrump has raised more than $145,000 from individuals employed by the U.S. Army, according to OpenSecrets. Meanwhile, Harris, who has inherited Biden's fundraising, has raised nearly $89,000, according to the organization.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the Harris and Trump campaigns for comment via email.\n\nRepublican candidate Nikki Haley, who did not win her party's nomination, raised more than $45,000 in her challenge to Trump.\n\nThese figures reflect only individuals employed by the U.S. Army rather than the organization itself and cover donations up to July 16, according to OpenSecrets.\n\nNotably, the data only encompasses individuals who have donated $200 or more, according to the nonprofit's methodology. It remains unclear whether smaller donations are leaning toward Harris or Trump\n\nBoth have raised only a fraction of what Biden and Trump raised four years ago, when the Democratic candidate outraised the former president among U.S. Army members, using the same metrics.\n\nIn 2020, Biden raised $799,675, while Trump raised $721,730, from individuals employed by the Army, according to OpenSecrets.\n\nThe Trump campaign outraised the Biden campaign in the second quarter of 2024, raising $331 million to $264 million, Reuters reported.\n\nBiden faced questions about his fundraising following June's presidential debate, in which he stumbled through several answers, fueling new concerns about his ability to mount a competitive presidential race.\n\nHowever, Harris' campaign touted strong fundraising numbers in the days after she took over at the top of the Democratic ticket. Her campaign said she raised more than $200 million in just one week as her candidacy sparked renewed enthusiasm among Democrats.\n\n\"The momentum and energy for Vice President Harris is real -- and so are the fundamentals of this race: this election will be very close and decided by a small number of voters in just a few states,\" Michael Tyler, the campaign's communications director, wrote in a memo, the Associated Press reported.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_stanton@newsweek.com", "name": "Andrew Stanton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSecrets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenSecrets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2438560/trump-harris-us-army-donations.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=aa19dcb8761b0bb1384e26271a6befae", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773409", "eventUri": "eng-9773409", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-16", "textStart": 1008, "textEnd": 1015}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

(Atlanta News First) - Former President Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, are set to hold a rally in Atlanta on Saturday, only days after the presumptive Democrat nominee Kamala Harris was to hold a rally herself.\n\nThe rally will be held at 5 p.m. at the Georgia State University Convocation Center in downtown.\n\nHarris will be in Atlanta today for her sixth trip to Georgia this year, but the first as the presumptive nominee.\n\nSeveral polls came out last week that all show a potential Harris-Trump race to be virtual tossups. An NPR/PBS News Marist Poll conducted July 22, 2024, shows Trump leading Harris 46% to 45%, with 9% of voters undecided. Marist's one-day survey of 1,309 adults was conducted on July 22, 2024.\n\nIn a Reuters poll, Harris has opened a two-percentage-point lead over Trump, as she continues to consolidate the Democratic Party's support after Biden's stunning announcement of ending his 2024 reelection bid.\n\nThose polls were released after Monday's national poll by Quinnipiac University that also showed the potential matchup - Harris has not been officially chosen as the Democratic Party's White House nominee - a dead heat.\n\nThe Quinnipiac poll, conducted from Friday, July 19-21, showed Trump receiving 49% support and Harris getting 47% support.\n\nBiden's withdrawal quickly became the nation's hottest political topic and, for the moment, eclipsed the attempted assassination of Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, along with a completely unified GOP after the Republican National Convention.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention is set to convene in Chicago Aug. 19-22, 2024. Harris seems to have secured enough delegates to win the nomination; now, all eyes are focused on who she will choose as her vice presidential running mate.\n\nHad Biden faced Trump, it would have been the first time two presidential candidates would have faced each other in consecutive elections since 1956, when GOP President Dwight D. Eisenhower again defeated Democrat Adlai Stevenson in a repeat of the 1952 election.\n\nBiden is the first sitting president since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968 to end his reelection bid. He is also the first presidential candidate in modern political history to withdraw from the race after winning virtually all of his party's delegates.\n\nFull political coverage from Atlanta News First\n\nAlso, for the first time since 1976, a general election presidential ballot will be without the names \"Biden,\" \"Bush\" or \"Clinton\" appearing on the ticket:\n\nTrump's selection of U.S. Sen. JD Vance of Ohio is the first time a so-called millennial has appeared on a presidential ticket.\n\nIf Trump wins in November, he will become the second former President - the first being Grover Cleveland in the 19th century - to be elected to the White House after losing his reelection bid.", "source": {"uri": "atlantanewsfirst.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinnipiac_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quinnipiac University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marist_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marist College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Ms. Harris spent 20 times more than President Trump did during the last full week of July.\n\nAccording to numbers posted by the Meta Ad Library Report, which covers ad spending on Facebook and Instagram, as well as spending reported by the Google Ads Transparency Center, which tracks spending across Google and YouTube, the Harris campaign spent $28.6 million during her first week on the campaign trail, compared to Trump's less than $1.5 million. The amount is 20 times what her Republican opponent spent last week.\n\nAccording to the Google Ads Transparency Center, which provides daily ad spending data, the largest amount of money the Biden campaign spent on a single day this year was on June 27 -- the day of the disastrous presidential debate with Trump that would later help force President Biden from the race. On the day of the debate, the Biden Victory Fund -- now known as the Harris Victory Fund -- spent just less than $700,000.\n\nThe biggest day of spending for Ms. Harris since the start of her campaign was on June 22, the day after Mr. Biden dropped his re-election bid. On that day, the vice president's campaign spent nearly $5 million on digital ads to help cement her place as the dominant front-runner for the Democratic nomination. The daily ad spends have since slowed, with the vice president spending $1.26 million on Monday.\n\nMs. Harris's campaign has enjoyed an historic surge of donations since she launched her bid, raking in more than $200 million since the president announced he would not run for re-election. In polling, Ms. Harris has pulled into a statistical tie with Trump, who was handily beating Mr. Biden up until the moment the president left the race.\n\nMs. Harris has done a few campaign events since announcing her candidacy, though they were all on the schedule before she officially began running for president. In Wisconsin just two days after she launched her bid, she appeared alongside Governor Evers and Senator Baldwin to stake out her claim in the election. She said she would not allow Trump to take America \"back\" to the past.\n\nSince then, she has been vetting potential running mates for the 2024 election. That search had included a number of governors, including Governors Pritzker, Cooper, Walz, and Beshear. Mr. Cooper told the Harris campaign on Monday that he would withdraw from the vetting process in order to stay committed to his day job.\n\nOn Tuesday, Reuters reported that the Harris campaign was planning a tour through \"swing states\" that will decide the 2024 election. It is to be headlined by Ms. Harris and her yet-unnamed running mate. The list of states is not reported, though they will likely include some combination of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType":

Doug Jones Tells ElectionLine Podcast; Kamala Harris' Hollywood Appeal\n\nKamala Harris' presidential campaign is launching its first major ad buy with its initial ad, \"Fearless,\" focused in part on the vice president's background as a prosecutor as well as a central theme that Donald Trump \"wants to take our country backwards.\"\n\nThe spot will air as part of a $50 million buy across battleground states through the Democratic National Convention next month. It will run on local and national broadcast, cable and streaming, as well as on social media. In addition to shows like The Bachelorette, The Simpsons, The Daily Show and Big Brother, the campaign plans to air spots local and nationally during the Olympic Games. Shorter versions -- including 15-second and six-second spots -- will show up on Connected TV, audio and social platforms, the campaign said.\n\nHarris says in the spot, \"This campaign is about who we fight for. We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead. Where every senior can retire with dignity. But Donald Trump wants to take our country backward. To give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and end the Affordable Care Act. But we are not going back.\"\n\nDonald Trump's campaign, meanwhile, has reserved more than $12 million across six battleground states for its first spot since Harris entered the race. The ad hits Harris on the border and immigration, labelling her \"Failed. Weak. Dangerously Liberal.\" The spot uses clips from a 2021 NBC News interview with Lester Holt in which she struggled to explain why she had not yet visited the southern border.\n\nHarris' campaign also has another celebrity endorsement: Megan Thee Stallion.

Although no longer a presidential candidate and fully behind Vice President Harris to make the political case against Trump, the president Monday accused the former president and his acolytes of being extremists who want to trample on the Constitution and U.S. institutions.\n\nBiden accused conservative Supreme Court justices of being so eager to turn back the clock on rights, transparency and freedoms that substantial court reforms, including enforceable ethics rules, are required. Congress won't agree with the president's proposals anytime soon, but Biden and Harris know that polls show the public disapproves of the high court and views the conservative majority on some issues as activist, politicized and unanswerable to outside authority.\n\nSince 2021, the Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade, blocked gun control measures, rejected affirmative action in college admissions, and backed immunity from prosecution for presidents, most prominently Trump. Biden, formerly a Senate Judiciary Committee chair, called immunity a \"dangerous principle\" and has joined Democrats in taking his reform themes directly to voters in an effort to defeat Trump, hold the Senate and try to install Democrats in the majority in the House.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) described as \"radical\" Biden's ambitions to amend the Constitution to bar blanket immunity from prosecution for current or former presidents, limit Supreme Court justices to 18-year terms and create enforceable ethics rules so that justices are no longer self-policing on recusals and receipt of gifts. Biden opposes calls from within his party to expand the high court beyond nine justices.\n\n\"We must restore faith in the Supreme Court,\" Biden said during his speech at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library in Austin, Texas.\n\nTrump, during a pre-taped interview with Fox News Monday, said \"the Democrats are good at spinning things.\" During a friendly conversation with host Laura Ingraham, he said he prefers to run against Harris and defended Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), his running mate, as a Republican who \"likes family.\"\n\nTrump sidestepped a commitment to debate Harris, insisting voters know him and know his opponent. \"Probably,\" was his reply.\n\nPOLLING: Harris, the likely Democratic nominee, has made strides in some polls against Trump, performing somewhat better than Biden before the president withdrew from the contest. But The Hill's Jared Gans writes it's impossible to gauge voter sentiment or make election forecasts as analysts recalibrate survey models to assess a Harris-Trump match-up. Scott Tranter, the director of data science for Decision Desk HQ, said he could make an argument that either Trump or Harris is in the preferable position, underscoring how up in the air the race is.\n\n\"I could probably give you one or two good points, case for either of them, and that's the mark of a true 50-50 race,\" he said.\n\nThe trail: Harris is in Atlanta this evening for her first rally since launching her campaign for president. In addition to nabbing Georgia endorsements, Harris will receive a crowd assist from rapper Megan Thee Stallion (real name Megan Pete), who will perform.\n\nSOME GOP SENATORS think Trump should have picked a female running mate or a person of color to help broaden his general election appeal, but they think Vance may help the ticket in Midwestern states and in battleground Pennsylvania. The Hill's Alexander Bolton reports reception of Vance is divided in the upper chamber, as Trump's running mate faces a barrage of negative press.\n\n\"I would assume he's not real happy,\" one Republican senator said of how Trump is handling the barrage of negative publicity that's hit his running mate over the past ten days. \"I don't think Trump likes any discomfort -- he can create discomfort himself -- but he doesn't like external discomfort coming in and JD's struggling.\"\n\nA number of House Republicans last week privately bashed Trump's choice, warning that Vance will not help -- and could hurt -- the party's chances of winning in November.\n\nMeanwhile, Vance keeps feeling the wrath of childless women across the nation for his resurfaced comment about \"childless cat ladies.\" And the Trump campaign has spent the past week trying to clean up after other controversial comments, including previous interviews in which Vance took a position on abortion much stronger than Trump's (The Washington Post).\n\n\"Some of what he and his running mate are saying, well, it's just plain weird. I mean that's the box you put that in,\" Harris said of Trump on the campaign trail Saturday.\n\nAs Harris's honeymoon ebbs, The Hill's Niall Stanage asks five key questions about her campaign, from how she'll deal with vulnerabilities on migration to if she can win over voters who are angry about Gaza.\n\nVeepstakes: North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, 67, who had been seen as a leading contender to become Harris's running mate, withdrew from the shortlist Monday, The New York Times reports. According to The Associated Press, Cooper opted out in part due to concerns that his GOP lieutenant governor would try to assume control if he left the state to campaign.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, 42, is all over the airwaves as a Democratic surrogate and much-mentioned potential vice presidential pick. What's the reaction among some Democratic strategists?\n\nOrganized labor is leading a quiet push for Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Axios reports. The Great Lake State is a crucial battleground for Democrats, and strong union backing could make Peters an attractive strategic option for Harris.\n\nISRAEL IS WEIGHING a potential response to the deadly Hezbollah attack on a soccer field over the weekend that killed 12 people. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed Hezbollah will \"pay the price\" after the rocket attack in the Israel-occupied Golan Heights in a town dominated by the Druze minority Muslim group, writes The Hill's Brad Dress. The U.S. has tried to defuse tensions between the Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel for months with little success as both sides teeter toward a larger war. Israel is already discussing whether a military operation is needed in Lebanon, and the weekend attack could boost the arguments of those advocating for war.\n\nOn a visit Monday to the site of Saturday's deadly strike, Netanyahu said Israel \"will not, and cannot, ignore this,\" before vowing to retaliate. \"Our response will come, and it will be severe\" (The Washington Post).\n\nAmid the potential for an outbreak of a wider war, The Hill's Laura Kelly reports the Biden administration's efforts to secure a cease-fire and hostage release in Gaza is taking on increased urgency.\n\nCONCERNS OVER the legitimacy of Venezuela's presidential election persist as its entrenched president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, and the country's opposition candidate, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, both claimed victory Monday -- prompting other countries, including the U.S., to hold off on recognizing the results. Maduro has provided continuity to the single-party rule of the Chavistas, the socialist-inspired political movement turned authoritarian regime. It remains unclear what the opposition's next steps will be, but Gonz\u00e1lez said it is not calling for supporters to take to the streets or commit any acts of violence (The Hill and NBC News).\n\nSENATE NEGOTIATORS are punting consideration of their full-year Department of Homeland Security funding bill, which was set for consideration Thursday, as both sides work to find bipartisan agreement. The Senate Appropriations Committee was slated to consider the measure, along with four other full-year funding plans, as it works to pass all 12 annual government funding bills.\n\nCongress has roughly two months until a late-September government shutdown deadline, and the Senate leaves Washington for five weeks starting Monday. While the Senate has yet to pass any of its funding bills across the full floor, the House has so far passed five appropriations bills for fiscal 2025. But the House struggled to pass multiple other funding bills last week and began its recess a week early (The Hill).\n\nBIPARTISAN TASK FORCE: Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) Monday announced the seven Republicans and six Democrats who will sit on the task force to investigate the assassination attempt against Trump. The Republican chair of the panel will be Rep. Mike Kelly (Pa.), who represents Butler, Pa., where the shooting took place and who was present in the front row during the rally (The Hill).\n\nSTATE WATCH\n\nCalifornia and Colorado: The Golden State's Park fire burned more than 726,000 acres in four counties as of Monday, roughly half the size of Rhode Island, and was only 12 percent contained, according to state officials. It's the sixth largest wildfire in California's history. While firefighters worked, the Alexander Mountain Fire in Larimer County, Colo., north of Boulder, ignited in a northern section of the Roosevelt National Park. That fire was initially estimated to be burning about 247 acres at midday Monday, but has now spread to more than 950 acres, according to the National Park Service.\n\nTexas: A GOP-dominated panel sought to blame Houston power outages during Hurricane Beryl on failures by CenterPoint, the Lone Star State's largest utility. A select committee of the Texas state Senate grilled executives from a Houston-area power company Monday about the utility's storm preparations (The Hill).\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve: Oil stockpiles managed by the Energy Department and held in Louisiana and Texas caverns that were drawn down by the Biden administration in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine have been replaced by purchases and sales cancellations, the government said in a detailed accounting Monday.\n\nTHE CLOSER\n\nAnd finally ... \ud83d\ude80 Their trip to space has turned into an unexpected extended stay. NASA astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita Williams left for a planned eight-day mission on the International Space Station in early June on a Boeing Starliner. Now, more than 50 days later, they're still in orbit.\n\nTheir trip to the space station has been extended indefinitely while NASA and Boeing determine what went wrong with their spacecraft. And while engineers on the ground examine why several of the Starliner spacecraft's thrusters failed on the way to the station, the astronauts in space have to work, too.\n\n\"We've been thoroughly busy up here, integrated right into the crew,\" Williams said during a briefing with reporters. \"It feels like coming back home. It feels good to float around. It feels good to be in space and work up here with the International Space Station team. So yeah, it's great to be up here.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alexis_simendinger@thehill.com", "name": "Alexis Simendinger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "kristina_karisch@thehill.com", "name": "Kristina Karisch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Thee_Stallion", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Megan Thee Stallion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

(Atlanta News First) - Former President Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, are set to hold a rally in Atlanta on Saturday, only days after the presumptive Democrat nominee Kamala Harris was to hold a rally herself.\n\nThe rally will be held at 5 p.m. at the Georgia State University Convocation Center in downtown.\n\nHarris will be in Atlanta today for her sixth trip to Georgia this year, but the first as the presumptive nominee.\n\nSeveral polls came out last week that all show a potential Harris-Trump race to be virtual tossups. An NPR/PBS News Marist Poll conducted July 22, 2024, shows Trump leading Harris 46% to 45%, with 9% of voters undecided. Marist's one-day survey of 1,309 adults was conducted on July 22, 2024.\n\nIn a Reuters poll, Harris has opened a two-percentage-point lead over Trump, as she continues to consolidate the Democratic Party's support after Biden's stunning announcement of ending his 2024 reelection bid.\n\nThose polls were released after Monday's national poll by Quinnipiac University that also showed the potential matchup - Harris has not been officially chosen as the Democratic Party's White House nominee - a dead heat.\n\nThe Quinnipiac poll, conducted from Friday, July 19-21, showed Trump receiving 49% support and Harris getting 47% support.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention is set to convene in Chicago Aug. 19-22, 2024. Harris seems to have secured enough delegates to win the nomination; now, all eyes are focused on who she will choose as her vice presidential running mate.\n\nHad Biden faced Trump, it would have been the first time two presidential candidates would have faced each other in consecutive elections since 1956, when GOP President Dwight D. Eisenhower again defeated Democrat Adlai Stevenson in a repeat of the 1952 election.\n\nBiden is the first sitting president since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968 to end his reelection bid. He is also the first presidential candidate in modern political history to withdraw from the race after winning virtually all of his party's delegates.\n\nAlso, for the first time since 1976, a general election presidential ballot will be without the names \"Biden,\" \"Bush\" or \"Clinton\" appearing on the ticket:\n\nTrump's selection of U.S. Sen. JD Vance of Ohio is the first time a so-called millennial has appeared on a presidential ticket.\n\nIf Trump wins in November, he will become the second former President - the first being Grover Cleveland in the 19th century - to be elected to the White House after losing his reelection bid.", "source": {"uri": "wrdw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://www.wrdw.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinnipiac_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quinnipiac University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marist_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marist College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1952_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "1952 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adlai_Stevenson_II", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adlai Stevenson II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts said in a statement the group is sticking to its original timeline and director Paul Dans' exit comes after the project \"completed exactly what it set out to do\" and that the \"tool was built for any future administration to use.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut the news came after former President Donald Trump has increasingly disavowed and criticized Project 2025, prompting speculation that his campaign forced the exit.\n\n\"President Trump's campaign has been very clear for over a year that Project 2025 had nothing to do with the campaign, did not speak for the campaign, and should not be associated with the campaign or the President in any way,\" Trump campaign advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said in a statement.\n\nMany Trump allies and former top aides contributed to the project, which proposes a mass firing of government employees and sweeping changes to American life. Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign and top Democrats have repeatedly tied Trump to Project 2025 as they argue against a second Trump term. A statement from Harris' campaign manager Julie Ch\u00e1vez Rodr\u00edguez called Project 2025 Trump's \"agenda, written by his allies, for Donald Trump to inflict on our country.\"\n\nKari Lake aims to win GOP primary for closely watched Arizona Senate race\n\nKari Lake is looking to easily win the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in Arizona on Tuesday, setting up a fierce battle against Democratic U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego for a seat that could be crucial to deciding Senate control.\n\nIn Maricopa County, which includes metro Phoenix and 60% of Arizona's voters, Republicans will also choose between a slate of incumbents who have stood up to former President Donald Trump's lies about the 2020 election and challengers who claim it was stolen.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department said it will monitor compliance with federal voting rights laws in Maricopa County for Tuesday's primary. County Sheriff's officials told Phoenix radio station KTAR that any attempts to disrupt vote centers, harass poll workers or prevent voting will be punished.\n\nThe primary will give insights about where the narrowly divided state is headed going into the final sprint of the 2024 election, when Arizona is central to the fight for control of the White House and Congress.\n\nDonald Trump to attend Black journalists' convention in Chicago\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is planning to attend the National Association of Black Journalists' annual convention in Chicago on Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement released Monday night, the Trump campaign said the Republican presidential nominee would participate in a question and answer session \"that will concentrate on the most pressing issues facing the Black community.\"\n\nTrump's campaign has spent months scheduling appearances in areas outside his traditional strongholds of support, including when he attended -- and was roundly booed at -- the Libertarian Party convention in Washington earlier this year.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn its announcement, the campaign trumpeted Trump policies that it argued benefited Black Americans during his first term.\n\nHarris pivots to convincing Arab American voters of her leadership\n\nVice President Kamala Harris appears to be trying to convince Arab American voters in crucial Michigan that she is someone they can unite behind. Community leaders are watching closely for signals that she will be more vocal in pressing for a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nMany in metro Detroit, home to the nation's largest Muslim population, have expressed a willingness to listen, and some have had initial conversations with Harris' team. Many had grown exasperated with President Joe Biden after they felt months of outreach had not yielded many results.\n\n\"The door is cracked open since Biden has stepped down,\" said Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud. \"There's an opportunity for the Democratic nominee to coalesce the coalition that ushered in Biden's presidency four years ago. But that responsibility will now fall on the vice president.\"\n\nHarris did not attend Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent address to Congress, and some Arab American leaders interpret her absence as a sign of good faith with them.\n\nTrump says Harris, married to a Jewish man, doesn't like Jewish people\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said in a radio interview Tuesday that Vice President Kamala Harris, who is married to a Jewish man, \"doesn't like Jewish people\" and appeared to agree with a radio host who called second gentleman Doug Emhoff \"a crappy Jew.\"\n\nTrump, speaking on radio station WABC, claimed Harris looked uncomfortable while meeting last week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\"You can see the disdain,\" he said. \"No. 1, she doesn't like Israel. No. 2, she doesn't like Jewish people. You know it, I know it and everybody knows it, and nobody wants to say it.\"\n\nThe Republican former president then said, \"If you're Jewish, if you vote for a Democrat, you're a fool, an absolute fool. They have let Jewish people down since Obama at a level that nobody could believe.\"\n\nAs the interview went on, Trump again said Harris \"dislikes Jewish people.\" The interview host, Sid Rosenberg, then mentioned Emhoff and said, \"He's Jewish like Bernie Sanders is Jewish. Are you kidding me?\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Yeah,\" Trump said.\n\n\"He's a crappy Jew,\" Rosenberg said.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Trump said again.\n\nRosenberg went on, saying of Emhoff, \"He's a horrible Jew.\"\n\nJames Singer, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, said, \"America is better than the fear, hate, and despicable insults of Donald Trump. Vice President Harris believes Americans want a president who unites our country instead of divides it, uses the power of the presidency to help families instead of hurt them, and has a vision for our future, instead of taking us backwards.\"\n\nHarris' potential running mates walk a fine line\n\nDemocratic governors and other officials under consideration to be Democrat Kamala Harris' vice presidential running mate are practicing a time-honored tradition in presidential campaigns. They're walking the line between open self-promotion and loyal advocacy for the potential boss in what amounts to unofficial auditions.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro campaigned for Harris on Monday outside Philadelphia. He blasted Republican former President Donald Trump and called Harris ready to lead. But he also showcased his own accomplishments.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear took a similar approach over the weekend. He told voters in Georgia that Harris has the makings of \"a great president,\" and then highlighted the elections he has won as a Democrat in Republican territory.\n\nHarris is said to also be considering Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, among others.\n\nSecret Service head, FBI's No. 2 grilled by Senate lawmakers\n\nThe acting director of the Secret Service said Tuesday he \"cannot defend\" why the roof used by the gunman in the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump was not secured.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nRonald Rowe, testifying before two Senate committees, said that he recently traveled to the Pennsylvania shooting site where Trump had been holding a campaign rally, and that \"what I saw made me ashamed.\"\n\nRowe was joined at a joint hearing of the Senate committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security by FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate.\n\nThe FBI's No. 2 official said a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from when the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, would have been in high school.\n\nTrump plans rally at same Georgia venue as Harris event\n\nRepublican Donald Trump's campaign announced Tuesday, hours ahead of a rally planned by Vice President Kamala Harris at Georgia State University, that he will travel to Atlanta on Saturday for a rally in the same venue.\n\nDemocrats say they have new hope for winning Georgia in November after President Joe Biden bowed out of the race and endorsed Harris. They're betting that a fresh burst of energy and a surge in fundraising has helped make Georgia -- the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020 -- a toss-up again.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nTrump ad blasts Harris for problems at the border\n\nRepublican candidate Donald Trump's campaign released a new advertisement Tuesday, blasting Vice President Kamala Harris for problems at the U.S. southern border.\n\nThe advertisement dubs Harris the \"border czar,\" a reference to her work on migration issues. It includes a parade of headlines about drugs and criminals entering the country, as well as a clip from a controversial interview that Harris did three years ago in which she brushed off a suggestion that she would visit the border.\n\n\"Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal,\" the advertisement brands Harris.\n\nNew $50 million ad portrays Harris as 'fearless'\n\nVice President Kamala Harris' campaign is kickstarting a $50 million advertising campaign with a new television spot calling the likely Democratic presidential nominee \"fearless\" throughout her career.\n\n\"Throughout her career as a courtroom prosecutor, attorney general, United States senator, and now as vice president, Kamala Harris has always stood up to bullies, criminals and special interests on behalf of the American people - and she's beaten them,\" said a statement from Jen O'Malley Dillon, the campaign chair.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"She's uniquely suited to take on Donald Trump, a convicted felon who has spent his entire life ripping off working people, tearing away our rights, and fighting for himself.\"\n\nThe advertisement is slated to run during the Olympics, \"The Bachelorette,\" \"The Daily Show\" and other popular programs. It's an attempt to even the score with Republicans, who have been outspending Democrats on the airwaves during a chaotic summer when President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed Harris.\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion to campaign for Harris\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion will join Vice President Kamala Harris for a special performance during her campaign stop in Atlanta on Tuesday.\n\nA Harris campaign spokesperson confirmed the hip-hop star's performance alongside the vice president in a post on X on Monday night.\n\nThe Harris campaign is promising a large rally in Atlanta, on par with the large events that Republican former President Donald Trump has made his signature.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHarris has America focused on multiracial identity\n\nIf Vice President Kamala Harris were to ascend to the presidency, she would become the first female president, but also one who is also multiracial.\n\nThe daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, both of whom immigrated to the U.S. during the Civil Rights Movement, Harris' historic presidential bid has again put a spotlight on American identity politics and the growing number of people who say they are multiracial.\n\nDifferent countries divide people into categories depending on different national traditions. The U.S., with its slavery-molded history, divides people into Black or white, and nine million people identified as multiracial in 2010.\n\nWhen Harris ran for vice president in 2020, 33.8 million people in the U.S. identified as being more than one race, according to the census.", "source": {"uri": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com"},

Vance (R-OH), as he holds a rally for the first time with his running mate, in Grand Rapids, Mich., on July 20.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Monday backed his running mate, Senator JD Vance, over past comments about \"childless cat ladies\" that have gone viral and become a political headache for their White House campaign.\n\nVance's 2021 comments criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris and other Democrats as \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives\" resurfaced after Trump selected the Ohio senator as his running mate earlier this month.\n\nThe comments prompted a backlash and warnings from some political strategists that they could cost the Trump campaign valuable votes in a close election that could be decided in a handful of states by a few thousand voters. Harris is the likely Democratic Party presidential nominee for the Nov. 5 election following President Joe Biden's decision to quit the race.\n\nTrump said in an interview on Fox News he did not place a higher value on people with families.\n\n\"You know, you don't meet the right person, or you don't meet any person. But you're just as good, in many cases, a lot better than a person that's in a family situation,\" Trump said.\n\nHarris has two stepchildren with her husband, lawyer Doug Emhoff. Emhoff's ex-wife has called such attacks \"baseless\" and described Harris as a \"loving, nurturing, fiercely protective\" co-parent.\n\nTrump said Vance, who had a tough upbringing in Ohio and was largely raised by his grandmother, was simply trying to show how much he values family life.\n\n\"He grew up in a very interesting family situation, and he feels family is good. And I don't think there's anything wrong in saying that,\" Trump said.\n\nIn the Fox interview, Trump also did little to clear up questions over whether he will participate in a Sept. 10 debate with Harris. The event had been previously scheduled against Biden.\n\n\"I'll probably end up debating,\" Trump said. \"But I can also make a case for not doing it.\"", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@staradvertiser.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Harris' team announced on Sunday that a majority of the donations (66%) came from first-time contributors in the 2024 election cycle, who sent their money after President Joe Biden exited the race.\n\nMichael Tyler, the campaign's communication director, stated in a memo that \"the momentum and energy behind Vice President Harris are real,\" predicting that \"this election will be very close and will be decided by a small number of voters in just a few states.\" Eight days after taking over from Biden, the 59-year-old attorney has amassed around 170,000 volunteers to support her campaign.\n\nJD Vance, running mate of Donald Trump, acknowledged during an event in Waite Park, Minnesota, that the Vice President \"has received a small boost since her announcement,\" though he predicted it would soon fade. Last week, Kamala raised $90 million in just 24 hours, reinforcing the belief within her party that no one can challenge her effectively.\n\nThese $90 million were largely from small contributions, although she also enjoys the backing of major business figures, famous artists, and high-ranking members of her party. According to the New York Times, her campaign reported $81 million on the first day of her candidacy, thanks to donations from 888,000 people, 60% of whom were first-time donors.\n\nHarris has the endorsement of prominent figures such as Barack Obama, who, along with his wife Michelle, called Harris to announce their support in her bid to keep Democrats in the White House.\n\n\"We told her that we believe she will be a fantastic president of the United States and that she has our full support. In this critical moment for our country, we will do everything possible to ensure she wins in November,\" the former president stated on his Twitter account.", "source": {"uri": "cubaheadlines.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CubaHeadlines"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waite_Park,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Waite Park, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Waite Park, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://cdn0.celebritax.com/sites/default/files/styles/watermark_100/public/1722288297-kamala-harris-recauda-200-millones-dolares-primera-semana-campana.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773409", "eventUri": "eng-9773409", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

It suggests that she is responsible for millions of border crossings and a quarter-million deaths from fentanyl, which the ad says occurred \"on Harris's watch.\" It closes with a new Trump tagline for Ms. Harris: \"Failed. Weak. Dangerously Liberal.\"\n\nJust over a week ago, Ms. Harris replaced President Biden as the Democratic Party's standard-bearer. Despite being the vice president and having represented the nation's largest state as one of California's senators, Ms. Harris is relatively unknown by many of the voters in battleground states who are likely to decide the presidential election.\n\nThe new ads will cost tens of millions of dollars and run in those key states.\n\nMs. Harris's spot is the beginning of what her campaign said would be a $50 million blitz before the Democratic National Convention, which begins on Aug. 19 in Chicago. (The campaign has announced roughly the same amount of ad spending in the previous several months.)\n\nThe Trump campaign is spending more than $12 million across Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin over the next two weeks, according to data from AdImpact, a media-tracking service -- its first major television ad purchase since Mr. Biden made way for his vice president.\n\nThe Harris campaign said its ads would run in 60-second increments on broadcast television during the Olympics, among other programming, and appear in shorter versions online.\n\n\"Kamala Harris has always stood up to bullies, criminals and special interests on behalf of the American people -- and she's beaten them,\" said Jen O'Malley Dillon, Ms. Harris's campaign chair. \"This $50 million paid media campaign, bolstered by our record-setting fund-raising haul and a groundswell of grass-roots enthusiasm, is one crucial way we will reach and make our case to the voters who will decide this election.\"\n\nMs. Harris's ad also leans into an argument that she represents the future while Mr. Trump, 78, stands for the past -- a case that is far easier for Democrats to press with the vice president, who is 59, at the top of the ticket rather than the 81-year-old Mr. Biden.\n\n\"Donald Trump wants to take our country backward,\" Ms. Harris says in the ad. \"To give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and end the Affordable Care Act. But we are not going back.\"\n\nMr. Trump's ad aims at what his campaign believes is one of Ms. Harris's biggest weaknesses: the Biden administration's border record.\n\nIn speeches over the past week, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized Ms. Harris's work as the \"border czar,\" a position she was never officially given but that refers to her being deputized by Mr. Biden to try to address the root issues causing people to flee countries in Central America.

Trump's first television ad attacking his new rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, splices together footage of her dancing and images of migrants crossing the border as the ad accuses her of being a failed \"border czar.\"\n\nThe 30-second ad aims to hold Ms. Harris responsible for millions of border crossings and a quarter-million deaths from fentanyl, which the ad says occurred \"on Harris's watch.\" It closes with a new Trump tagline for Ms. Harris: \"Failed. Weak. Dangerously Liberal.\"\n\nThe words flash on the screen as she dances, footage from an event celebrating the 50th anniversary of hip-hop.\n\nIt is the Trump campaign's first major television ad purchase of the election since Ms. Harris became the de facto Democratic nominee. The campaign began making a two-week ad reservation on Monday, buying time in the six top battlegrounds.\n\nThe spending by state, according to data from AdImpact, the ad-tracking service, is $2.7 million in Pennsylvania, $2.3 million in Georgia, $2.3 million in Michigan, $1.9 million in Arizona, $1.8 million in Nevada and $1.3 million in Wisconsin.\n\nThe ad also makes use of an interview Ms. Harris did with NBC's Lester Holt in 2021 when, as she was facing pressure from Republicans to visit the border, she said that she did not understand why her presence would be so important. \"I haven't been to Europe,\" Ms. Harris said. \"I mean, I don't understand the point you're making.\"\n\nThe ad also mentions crimes committed by migrants and raises the specter of a potential terror attack. \"ISIS now here,\" the narrator states.\n\nThe Trump campaign had spent months laying the groundwork for a brutal general election campaign against President Biden -- casting him as mentally diminished and weak -- but his last-minute withdrawal two Sundays ago has upended the dynamics of the race.\n\nMr. Trump, 78, is now the oldest candidate and Ms. Harris, 59, can make the case that it is time to turn the page generationally.\n\nBut the Trump team still sees Ms. Harris as vulnerable on the two issues -- inflation and immigration -- that had underpinned its policy argument against Mr. Biden.\n\nIn speeches over the past week, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized Ms. Harris's work as the \"border czar,\" a position she was never officially given but that refers to her being deputized by Mr. Biden to try to address the root issues causing people to flee countries in Central America. Ms. Harris was not charged with overseeing border security.\n\n\"Kamala Harris's deadly destruction of America's borders is completely and totally disqualifying for her to be president,\" Mr. Trump said on Saturday at a rally in St. Cloud, Minn.\n\nThe ad reflects an effort by Mr. Trump and his team to make immigration central to his 2024 presidential campaign that predates Ms. Harris's sudden ascension atop the ticket. As he has campaigned this year, Mr. Trump often laments not making the border and immigration, which helped fuel his political rise in 2016, central to his failed 2020 campaign.\n\nMr. Trump and his allies have also spent the time since Mr. Biden ended his campaign working to define Ms. Harris as ultraliberal, hoping to sway undecided moderate voters. In recent speeches, Mr. Trump has called Ms. Harris a \"radical-left lunatic,\" tried to tie her to progressives like Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and attacked her past support of left-wing

A Venezuelan immigrant was arrested and charged with her murder.\n\nTrump had previously mentioned Riley during his speech accepting the Republican Party's presidential nomination.\n\nDescribing Riley as a \"brilliant 22-year-old nursing student,\" Trump placed the blame for Riley's death on Biden, Harris, and the rest of the Democratic Party.\n\n\"Yet another American life was stolen by a criminal alien set free by this administration,\" Trump told the crowd at the RNC. \"Tonight, America, this is my vow. I will not let these killers and criminals into our country.\"\n\nTrump and Vance's rally will begin at 5 p.m. Doors open at 1 p.m. You can sign up for free tickets here.\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, are hoping that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration would transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nBut they concede a recent groundswell of support for the expected Democratic candidate has made the political landscape suddenly look much closer to 2020 - when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points -- than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt.\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nDemocrats are betting that a combination of high turnout among traditional, core Democratic constituencies, as well as a strong showing in the suburbs and small pickups elsewhere will be enough for Harris to carry Georgia. That approach was on display at the weekend office openings.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said in a recent interview that the best GOP campaigns can win comfortably in Georgia but bad efforts -- combined with strong Democratic campaigns -- lose. Kemp, for example, won reelection by 7.5 percentage points in 2022 over national Democratic star Stacey Abrams. Yet in the same election cycle, Georgians reelected Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock over his Republican challenger Herschel Walker, who was endorsed by Trump.\n\nIn recent elections, Democrats have held wide advantages in the core of metro Atlanta. The party also performed well in Columbus and Savannah, as well as some rural, majority-Black counties. But Republicans dominated in other rural areas, small towns and small cities -- where Trump has held multiple rallies in recent years.", "source": {"uri": "fox5atlanta.com", "dataType": "news",

We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead. Where every senior can retire with dignity,\" Harris, 59, says in the advertisement.\n\nAlso Read | Team Behind 'Last Supper Act' Paris Olympics 2024 Opening Ceremony: From Barbara Butch, Philippe Katerine, Germain Louvet, Nicky Doll to Thomas Jolly, Meet The Crew.\n\nOn July 21, US President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the American presidential elections.

To give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and end the Affordable Care Act. But we are not going back,\" she says.\n\n\"Fearless\" will run on local and national broadcast, cable programming, streaming, and social channels.\n\nAs part of the campaign's Olympics presence, Harris for President is planning to air ads both locally and nationally during the Olympic Games, which saw nearly 30 million US viewers for the opening ceremony -- a more-than-60 per cent increase over the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nShorter fifteen-second and six-second versions of the ads will also reach voters on Connected TV, audio, and social platforms.\n\nHarris for President campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said throughout her career as a courtroom prosecutor, Attorney General, United States Senator, and now as Vice President, Kamala Harris has always stood up to bullies, criminals and special interests on behalf of the American people - and she's beaten them.\n\n\"She's uniquely suited to take on Donald Trump, a convicted felon who has spent his entire life ripping off working people, tearing away our rights, and fighting for himself. This USD 50 million paid media campaign, bolstered by our record-setting fundraising haul and a groundswell of grassroots enthusiasm, is one crucial way we will reach and make our case to the voters who will decide this election,\" Dillon said.\n\n(This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)", "source":

A quarter of a million Americans dead from fentanyl. Brutal migrant crimes. And ISIS -- now here,\" the ad says.\n\nMore on the new ad blitz - and the mentality behind it - from POLITICO this morning.\n\nThe new offensive suggests that, after a week of scrambling to find the best message for attacking Trump's new rival, his campaign admakers are sticking with the tried-and-true. What's conspicuously not included are suggestions that she's a \"DEI hire,\" allegations she covered up Biden's mental state, clips of her laughing, mentions of Venn diagrams or any of the other attacks that have gone viral among the MAGA faithful but do little to move the needle among a broader audience.\n\nTrump won't have the airwaves to himself this week, of course. We're told the Harris campaign is expected to announce their own large media buy later this morning, coming on the heels of a $50 million commitment last week from the Future Forward super PAC. Expect to see upbeat, biographical efforts to reintroduce the VP as the new Democratic standard-bearer.\n\nBut Trump insiders aren't fretting. Far from it, according to our conversations last night with senior GOP officials, who remain confident that the sheen surrounding Harris will soon fade and their attacks on her record will sink in with critical swing voters.\n\n\"So Harris has a good week because Democrats are in such disarray that they had to force the sitting president to no longer run for president?\" one of those officials sarcastically asked. \"Has the Democratic base coalesced? Yes. But what we have yet to see is a true Kamala Harris. The vanity and rah-rah homecoming that they're having right now, it will wear off, and they'll come back down to earth.\"\n\nHarris may be getting on the air quickly and has had an objectively stellar fundraising cycle since becoming the presumptive nominee, but the campaign is still incomplete. She is currently without a running mate and is running out of time to vet who she wants on the ticket with her.\n\nOn Monday, one prospective running mate, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, dropped out of contention. But there are still a handful of candidates under consideration.\n\nREAD MORE: NC Governor Roy Cooper Withdraws From Kamala's Veepstakes\n\nThe Trump campaign is working to define Harris as far more liberal than she is trying to appear. There have been several attempts by the campaign to moderate her previous positions, and she is getting favorable enough press to do so.\n\nBut if Trump is able to take to the airwaves and make the case against her, the race - which is currently still pretty even between both candidates - that can halt some of the momentum being highlighted by friendly media outlets.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_cunningham@redstate.com", "name": "Joe Cunningham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamic State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fentanyl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political action committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidential nominee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roy Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_vote", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing vote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_North_Carolina", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of North Carolina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/206/a1cd3944-0f08-4127-a2a6-526aa82d1691.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773409", "eventUri": "eng-9773409", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

Jesse Watters spills the tea.", "body": "President Joe Biden's quick endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris after dropping out of the presidential race about a week ago was reportedly his \"f-k you\" to former President Barack Obama.\n\n\"Joe Biden, who said he was dropping out 'in defense of democracy' during his public address ... had been told by Obama to allow delegates at next month's Democratic National Convention in Chicago to decide a new candidate,\" according to the New York Post.\n\nBut instead, the president chose Harris as his replacement.\n\n\"It was Joe's big f-k you,\" the Post's source claimed. \"Joe said, 'If I'm out, then I am endorsing her.'\"\n\nThe Post noted that \"[t]alk among insiders is that Biden saw this as a final way to assert some control over his ouster.\"\n\nA separate source \"well-placed\" within the Democrat Party added that Obama, Senate Democrat leader Chuck Schumer, and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had all wanted to hold \"a mini primary\" because Obama was certain Harris couldn't win.\n\nMultiple other sources confirmed with the Post that Obama had hoped to see Democrat Sen. Mark Kelly \"at the top of the ticket.\"\n\nBiden's endorsement of Harris was therefore \"Joe truly knifing Obama and Pelosi in the back for making him stand down,\" the Democrat Party source told the Post.\n\nAnother source said that the president intends to take an active role in Harris' campaign.\n\n\"It allows Biden to retain leverage as a much more experienced hand at national politics, which will be good for her,\" the source said. \"It means her campaign won't be run by a bunch of insular advisors.\"\n\nAccording to Fox News host Jesse Watters, the proof of all this lies in the fact that Obama didn't immediately endorse Harris after Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed her.\n\n\"Biden backed the party into a corner and jammed Barack, which is why his endorsement video wasn't ready,\" he said Monday on Fox News' \"Jesse Watters Primetime.\" \"It came almost a week later.\"\n\nWatters went on to note how the propaganda corporate press is now praising and propping up Harris as some sort of historic figure after having dissed her one year ago.\n\n\"In Washington, D.C. the words 'President Kamala Harris' used to be an inside joke,\" he noted. \"Last year, party kingmakers tried peeling her off the ticket. The headlines were everywhere.\"\n\nTake a look at a few of them below:\n\nNewsweek - \"The Democrats Shouldn't Ditch Joe Biden -- They Should Replace Kamala Harris\"\n\nNew York Magazine - \"The Case ForBiden To Drop Kamala Harris\"\n\nThe Washington Post - \"For the Country's Sake, Vice President Harris Should Step Aside\"\n\n\"The Kamala coup was in full swing. Her whole staff had quit, and they were leaking that she was a soul-destroying boss and bully,\" Watters continued. \"Biden wasn't the problem; Kamala Harris was.\"\n\nCase in point: \"High-level Democrats are rallying to President Biden's reelection ... because they fear the potential alternative: the nomination of Kamala Harris,\" Politico reported in February of 2023.\n\n\"Joe Biden was fighting father time because he was concerned Kamala wouldn't be able to defeat [former President Donald] Trump,\" according to Watters. \"Alas, Kamala survived her coup; Joe didn't.\"\n\nEverything was perfectly fine with the entire Democrat Party and its corporate media propagandist allies all allied behind Biden until his disastrous debate performance last month with Trump.\n\nImmediately after the debate, the entire party (and the media) began to move against Biden, arguing that his time in the spotlight was done and that he needed to \"pass the torch\" to someone younger.\n\nAs the pressure built, with nearly every corporate media outlet pushing for Biden's ouster, the president finally bent the knee and dropped out of the race, after which he unexpectedly endorsed Harris.\n\nHe then delivered a demagogic speech from the Oval Office in which he endorsed Harris and framed the 2024 presidential election as a veritable battle between good and evil.\n\n\"America is going to have to choose between moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division,\" he said.\n\nAnd then in defending why the American people should choose Harris as their president this November, Biden doubled down on his demagoguery.\n\n\"When Ben Franklin was asked, as he emerged from the convention going on, whether the founders have given America a monarchy or a republic, Franklin's response was: 'A republic, if you can keep it,'\" he said. \"A republic, if you can keep it. Whether we keep our republic is now in your hands.\"\n\nIn other words, Biden told the American people to vote for Harris or lose their republic.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

She also signed up 170,000 new volunteers in the last week.\n\nHarris' campaign announced the tally on Sunday, with communications director Michael Tyler characterizing it as a \"record-shattering haul.\" The campaign said 66% came from first-time donors.\n\nThe latest figures expand the $81 million she raised in the first day after President Joe Biden's exit -- an amount the campaign called the largest 24-hour fundraise of any candidate in history.\n\nThe fundraising is the latest demonstration of how Democrats are coalescing behind the vice president, who only launched her candidacy a week ago after Biden's decision to end his reelection campaign and endorse her. Harris has already sewn up the support of enough delegates to clinch the nomination and is carrying out a search for her running mate. On Friday, she also received the support of former President Barack Obama.\n\nBiden's debate debacle and the ensuing intra-party fight over his future damaged his campaign's finances as donors became reluctant to give money to a president, 81, facing questions about his mental acuity and ability to beat Trump in November's election.\n\nThe Biden campaign entered July with $96 million cash on hand following a spending spree that depleted about 93% of the money it raised in June. The burn rate far exceeded rival Trump, whose campaign spent just 46% of the money it raised in June and had $128 million in the bank. Biden's campaign continued to spend even as some polls showed Trump with an edge after the debate and as calls for the incumbent to end his bid grew.\n\nThat situation marked a stunning turnaround from earlier in the contest, which saw Biden build up a sizable money advantage, aided in part by the lack of a serious Democratic challenger and with Trump dealing with an at-times bitter GOP primary and multiple court cases that drained his coffers.\n\nTrump's fundraising has surged in recent months - bolstered by appeals to big-dollar Republican donors and support from Wall Street and corporate executives drawn to his economic agenda. Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, the world's richest person according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, said he is \"making some donations\" to a super political action committee supporting the former president, though at a \"much lower level\" than has been reported. People familiar with the matter had said Musk is pledging to pour $45 million a month into the pro-Trump group.\n\nTrump and the Republican National Committee raised $331 million in the second quarter, beating the $264 million Biden and the Democratic National Committee raised.\n\nDemocratic Wall Street donors are also mobilizing to tap their networks and help Harris close the fundraising gap with Trump.\n\nTrump's campaign filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission claiming Biden's transfer of his $96 million violates the law. It poses a novel legal question but many campaign finance experts say the transfer is probably allowed.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Communications_Director", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House Communications Director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Election_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Election Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political action committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/07/28/1600x900/Vice-President-Kamala-Harris-is-introduced-during-_1722095494608_1722171857065.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773409", "eventUri": "eng-9773409", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

This is what the Democrats have experienced ever since President Joe Biden decided to end his election campaign. Vice-President Kamala Harris who has secured the support of the required number of delegates is all set to receive the presidential nomination from the party during the national convention from August 19-22.\n\nA survey conducted by the Angus Reid Institute has found that overall, Harris has a two percent lead over her opponent. Different sections of the voters support different candidates and the issues are plenty including security, economy, cost of living and various foreign policy related issues. The upcoming presidential election in November is being seen as the most important election in the country's history with 82% of the registered voters who were surveyed believing in the same.\n\nOverall, 44% of the registered voters have extended their support to Harris and 42% of them support Trump. Harris has a marginal lead of over 2%.\n\nThe young, non-white voters prefer Kamala Harris whereas the white male voters prefer to support Donald Trump. Among the non-white voters, Harris has a clear advantage with over 56% of the respondents reposing their faith in her, in comparison to only 25% of them extending their support to Trump.\n\nThe same outcomes are seen among voters who are below 35-years of age with half of the voters (50%) supporting Harris and only 32% of them supporting Trump.\n\nFor Trump, while he is lagging behind in terms of support from the non-white and voters below the age of 35, he leads among the White voters with 51% of them supporting him in comparison to only 37% extending their support to Harris.\n\nBoth the candidates are tied when it comes to support from those in the age group of 35-54. For the voters who are aged above 55, Trump has a clear 9% lead over Harris with 49% of them supporting him and only 40% of them supporting Harris.\n\nThe Democrats are fighting this upcoming election on issues such as saving democracy, reproductive rights and importance of climate change whereas the Republicans under Trump are fighting the election on issues pertaining to a muscular foreign policy, economy related issues and curbing immigration from the southern border.\n\nOn the issue of security at the southern border, an overwhelming 52% of the respondents believe that Trump will do a better job in comparison to Harris. Similarly, the same has been recorded on the issues of foreign policy and economic revival.\n\nWhereas on the issue of climate change, protection of democracy and reproductive rights, Harris performs better. For example, on the issue of protecting reproductive rights, 55% of the respondents said that Harris is expected to perform better as compared to Trump.\n\nThe survey was conducted among 1743 registered American voters who are part of the Angus Reid Forum USA and this survey was conducted from July 23-25, 2024.\n\nDo the Americans support mass deportation of illegal immigrants?\n\nAccording to this survey, 21% of Harris voters and 87% of Trump supporters support the mass deportation of illegal immigrants. This signifies that Harris cannot afford to ignore this issue as 21% of her voters have an important say on this matter. She will have to speak on this issue and formulate a policy which is neither extreme nor what is viewed as appeasing to a section of the electorate.\n\nWhat are the top three issues the voters will be deciding when they vote for the candidate of their choice?\n\n72% of the voters believe that the economy is the most important issues. The other key issues are the future of American Democracy (69%) and inflation (68%).", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112140978,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-6840,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773409", "eventUri": "eng-9773409", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-19", "dateEnd": "2024-08-22", "textStart": 352, "textEnd": 364}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 2913, "textEnd": 2920}], "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

One key question is how this unique scenario impacts Kamala Harris and the Democrats from a campaign finance perspective.\n\nFirst, Democrats have already renamed the \"Biden for President Committee\" to the \"Harris for President Committee.\" Presumably, this \"new\" entity has already spent some money -- meaning that Democrats are now committed to the proposition that Harris for President is entitled to the cash raised by Biden for President.\n\nThat course matters because of the legal background and related campaign finance rules.\n\nEvery candidate has an \"authorized committee.\" A committee cannot be the \"authorized committee\" for more than one candidate and a candidate's authorized committee can only give $2,000 to another candidate committee. The exception is that, after being nominated, a party's candidates for president and vice president share a single authorized committee.\n\nThe Democratic position is that Harris, therefore, shared the Biden for President Committee with Biden since her nomination as vice president in 2020. This argument proposes that Harris can now access and spend the money. Republicans, however, can be expected to counter that Harris only could access these funds through the 2020 general election.\n\nAt present, and at all times since Nov 2020, she was not the party's nominee for anything, nor was she running a campaign for office on her own -- which would have required her to designate a different \"authorized committee.\" We may all \"know\" that the planned ticket was Biden-Harris, but it wasn't official. Biden, or a delegate revolt, could have dumped her.\n\nBiden was a candidate for reelection as president in his own right, but, officially, Harris was nothing -- not a candidate for president and not her party's nominee for anything.\n\nSo, the GOP will argue that, by spending money from the Biden for President Committee on behalf of Harris for President, both the Biden for President Committee and Harris's campaign violate the law.\n\nAs expected, the Republican response has been swift. The Trump campaign has just filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, alleging that Democrats have violated campaign finance laws by transferring Biden's campaign funds to Harris.\n\nFrom here, the statutory deadlines and enforcement procedure -- the FEC has no control over this -- means it will be at least 60 days before the FEC could sue in federal court for a civil fine or injunction or refer it to the Department of Justice to prosecute as a \"knowing and willful\" and, hence, criminal violation. But that's not allowing any time for the FEC to analyze the case, convene and vote, etc.\n\nThus, even if these procedures were executed at breakneck speed in response to the complaint, it would almost certainly be mid-October before a final vote by the commission to find the Democratic committees in violation. At that point, the Democrats will simply refuse to pay the fine, and the FEC will have to go to federal court to enforce its decision.\n\nOf course, the court is unlikely to conduct a trial or even decide cross-motions for summary judgment before the election. The FEC could seek a preliminary injunction, but what court will issue a preliminary injunction hampering one party just days before the election, where there is at least a colorable argument that the law is on that party's side?\n\nIt's not happening. Even given all the unrealistic assumptions above about how fast the FEC could move, any decision will come after the election. If the Democrats have to pay a fine at that point, well, that's just the cost of winning the election now.\n\nBut in fact, the odds are even longer, because even that scenario assumes that the FEC can get -- as will be necessary -- one of the Democratic commissioners to find a violation. How likely is that outcome, given the Democrats' previously described plausible (if probably incorrect) argument for their interpretation of the law?\n\nIt's worth noting that the commission's structure and processes are intentionally designed to move at a thoughtful, measured pace. The FEC's bipartisan nature, with its equal number of Democratic and Republican commissioners, serves as a crucial safeguard against partisan enforcement of campaign finance law or hasty action that might unduly interfere with political speech.\n\nThis setup, which some mistakenly view as a flaw, is actually a vital feature that protects speech. It ensures that any enforcement action or new regulation requires bipartisan consensus, preventing either party from using the commission to unduly hamper their opponents' political speech -- especially when, as here, the \"other side\" has a plausible argument.\n\nA \"tie,\" in other words, goes to the speaker.\n\nThe bottom line in the present situation is that, despite the Trump campaign's complaint, nothing is likely to happen before the election. Assuming that Harris becomes the nominee, as now seems a given, she will likely be able to spend the money, with any potential penalties or legal consequences dealt with after the fact.\n\nThere are other aspects to consider in all this. For example, operating on the assumption that the Biden for President Committee can seamlessly become the Harris for President Committee, the Democrats have closed off the possibility for donors who have already given the legal maximum to Biden's campaign to contribute now to the Harris campaign. If the Biden-Harris Committee is one and the same such that Harris is entitled to Biden's cash, then donors have a single legal limit.\n\nIf Harris somehow does not win the nomination, the Democrats will have to ask her to transfer any remaining funds to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) or at least to a Super PAC, either of which can then make independent expenditures supporting the nominee.\n\nBeing limited to independent expenditures has two drawbacks for Democrats. First, they can't coordinate their ads, which will be less efficient and effective than if the candidate could spend the money on messages. Second, unlike a candidate, the party doesn't get the \"lowest unit rate\" on ad buys, so broadcast ads will cost them more -- in some cases significantly more.\n\nAnd there is the possibility -- slight but not nonexistent -- that an embittered Harris wouldn't give the money to the DNC, but do something like donate it to her alma mater to create a boffo Kamala Harris Library.\n\nAs should be clear from the above, we are in the midst of an uncertain situation that is only predictable up to a point. There may be more twists and turns to come in what has already been a truly unique campaign season. Nonetheless, the scenarios outlined above are the most plausible in my view.\n\nBradley A.

After a triumphant and unified Republican National Convention this month, it seemed like they were on a glide path to defeat the Democrats, who found themselves forced to swap in Vice President Kamala Harris for the aging President Joe Biden barely three months out from Election Day.\n\nWith voters still uneasy about the direction of the economy and the ongoing dysfunction at the southern border, it seemed like all former President Donald Trump had to do was keep hammering away at the issues where voters trust him more than Democrats and call it a day. Add in a promise to be a president for all Americans, as he did recently when he warned of the dangers of \"discord and division,\" and Trump could even win by a landslide.\n\nBut the former president and the deputies most loyal to him haven't been able to help themselves with Harris as their new target.\n\nAfter months of promising a \"big tent\" Republican Party and showcasing their outreach to women and minority voters, it took them less than 24 hours to unleash a series of personal attacks on the country's first Black female vice president, who is also Indian American, that hearken back to the country's worst days.\n\nFirst Trump called Harris \"Dumb as a Rock Kamala Harris\" on his Truth Social media feed and \"Lyin' Kamala\" at a rally a day later. On Wednesday, he called her \"a radical-left lunatic who will destroy our country.\"\n\n\"They say something happened to me when I got shot, I became 'nice.' ... If you don't mind, I'm not going to be nice,\" he said as the crowd roared. And then Trump mispronounced Harris' name as Ka-MAL-a instead of the way it is actually said, which is \"Comma-luh,\" over and over again.\n\nSometimes a mistake is just a mistake, but sometimes you're Trump. After four years as vice president, and four more as a U.S. senator during the Trump administration, we all know how to say her name by now. Trump is choosing not to. By any measure, it's a sign of disrespect. And if Trump has proved anything over the years, it's that showing respect to someone else, especially a woman in power, isn't something he's willing to do.\n\nPlenty of other Republicans have followed him down that road. Former U.S. Sen. David Perdue of Georgia did it when he attended a rally for Trump in 2020. \"Is it Kamala? Kama-la-la?\" he asked from the stage. \"Har-har!\" the audience laughed. It was one of Perdue's last public appearances before he lost his Senate seat to newcomer Jon Ossoff. Demeaning a Black woman, especially one who was his longtime colleague in the Senate, didn't help him with the independent women he needed to win that year.\n\nIt also won't help Republicans expand their reach now. In the moments after Biden endorsed Harris for president this week, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia posted a note to social media calling the vice president Biden's \"DEI hire\" (referring to diversity, equity and inclusion policies). Rep. Mike Collins, also of Georgia, reposted it. The insult took off in conservative circles.\n\nExasperated Republican strategists know that belittling and insulting a woman, a Black leader or both at the same time may be the best way for Trump to guarantee he loses again in November. If he would stick to the issues where he's strongest, he would win. But being unable to avoid lashing out at Harris is \"a key reason this thing is now anyone's ballgame\" one strategist told me.\n\nWhere Trump could have taken his devoted followers forward, he is choosing to go back. Where he could have gotten to the work of healing our broken country this month, he added to the brokenness. We've all been here before with Trump, but I have to admit that I didn't think we'd be back in the gutter quite so fast after the former president survived an assassination attempt and said God had spared his life.\n\nDemocrats weren't expecting anything less.\n\n\"With 'DEI,' that's a way to substitute the n-word in 2024,\" said Georgia state Sen. Derek Mallow, a Democrat. \"And even to say DEI stands for 'didn't earn it?' Absolutely not. African Americans have cemented their role in America by working for 100 years for free. ... Don't just talk down to us or think we are some monolith, give us substance.\"\n\nSo where does the ugliness leave the country and the presidential race now?\n\nHarris has a tremendous amount of work to do to deliver an economic message that persuades Americans to trust her, not Trump, to bring down the cost of living. And dubbed \"the border czar\" by Republicans years ago, she'll need to embrace a plan to return order to the border and the country's broken immigration system.\n\nBut her job of winning got a lot easier with Trump finding a way to offend so many different groups of Americans at once with his relentless attacks on her, her role and her name.\n\nIf Republicans keep going down this road, they may never have to learn how to pronounce Harris' name properly. They can just call her \"Madame President\" in 2025.\n\nPatricia Murphy is a columnist for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Americans", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Americans"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_tent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big tent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Perdue", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Perdue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Ossoff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Ossoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Mallow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derek Mallow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Her support with voters 18-34 is 46-44 over Trump. But here is the number that bodes best for Harris' standing only one week after Biden stepped aside. \"Just 4% of voters say they'd vote for someone besides Trump and Harris if the election were held today, which is the smallest share we've tracked all cycle,\" Morning Consult reported. Which means that after only seven days as a candidate, many people who previously told Morning Consult they were considering voting for RFK Jr. or -- shudder, Vlad's friend Jill Stein -- have changed their minds and committed to voting for either Harris or Trump. The poll does not separate out how many of those third party voters changed over to Harris, but it seems clear from her sudden jump in the polls from where Biden stood before he dropped out that many have changed their minds and decided to vote for Harris.\n\nIt's great, of course, that Vice President Harris' numbers are way, way up over where Biden stood before last week, but I don't think there could be better news than the declining numbers of those who were considering voting for a third party candidate.\n\nKamala Harris has the \"Big Mo,\" as momentum used to be called.

Before then, Biden had been recalcitrant that he would not withdraw from the race. He insisted that he was strong and healthy and was the only person who could defeat the Republican candidate, Donald Trump.\n\nEven though Biden had given the American public many signs that indicated that he was mentally and physically unfit for the job, it was during the first presidential debate that his shortcomings became indisputable. Biden spoke in a raspy voice without any force. He looked feeble. But that was not all. He regularly lost his train of thought and mixed up the names of people and incidents. Even his opponent at that debate, Trump, had occasions when he was surprised at the lack of coherence in what Biden was saying. At a point in the debate, Trump said, while responding to an answer Biden gave to the moderators: \"I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence, and I don't think he did, either.\"\n\nBiden's performance was embarrassing. Opinion polls showed that Trump was widening the gap between them. Many Democrats, including legislators, began to openly ask him to withdraw from the race and save the party from not just losing the presidency but also losing some of their strongholds in Congress to Republicans and becoming weakened. To show their seriousness, many sponsors of the party withdrew their support.\n\nBut the more Democrats asked Biden to withdraw, the more he said no and insisted that he was the person who could defeat Trump just as he did in 2020. The Democratic Party was divided and confused. The morale of members was low. Their case was worsened by the fact that Biden was (and still is) an incumbent president. As a result, he did not face any strong challenge for the ticket of the party earlier this year.\n\nAnother factor - not usually publicly discussed - was the fact that Biden's deputy, Vice President Kamala Harris, is a woman as well as a person of non-White race. Despite the high level of human rights in the United States, it has never elected a woman. It took America 232 years to elect a non-White person in 2008 in the person of Barack Obama. And it was because Obama had an amazing personality and showed exceptional promise with no bad story associated with him. It would be disastrous to sideline Harris because of her gender and race to pick a White male as Biden's replacement at the polls. But with less than four months to the presidential election, even if Harris became the candidate of the Democratic Party, it was not obvious whether she could make any impact.\n\nConversely, the Republican Party was upbeat. The morale of members was high. The missed assassination attempt on Trump some weeks ago drew him sympathy and helped to shoot up his rating. At the Republican Party's convention, where Trump was officially confirmed as the presidential candidate and where he named his running mate, the party was as united and confident as it had not been in many years. All polls showed that Trump was ahead. It was obvious that Trump would rout Biden in the presidential race in November.\n\nThen on Sunday, July 21, Biden announced his withdrawal from the presidential race and support for Harris. Within 48 hours, the presidential bid of Kamala Harris received over $100 million in donations: a record. (Within one week, it raised $200 million). The Democratic Party was rejuvenated. Attention shifted from the Republicans to the Democrats.\n\nThe campaign dynamics also completely changed. Before that Sunday, Trump was the younger and healthier candidate, while Biden was the old and feeble candidate. That was meant to be the focal point of the campaign. Immediately after Biden's announcement, Trump became the old candidate: the oldest candidate in American history to run for president. The Republicans would be forced to change their campaign message and focus. Opinion polls showed that Harris had gone narrowly ahead of Trump, even though it is still within the margin of error, which makes it an open game.\n\nThe Republicans believe that Trump will rescue the United States from the dangerous grip of Biden and the Democrats. The Democrats believe that Kamala Harris and the Democrats will save America from falling into the dangerous hands of Trump a second time.\n\nAnother thing that happened after Biden's announcement was the resignation of the Director of the American Secret Service, Kimberly Cheatle. Since the attempt on Trump, Cheatle had vowed not to resign. Last week, she was grilled by Congress and both Democrats and Republicans tore her to shreds and told her to write her resignation letter immediately. She refused. But the next day, she resigned.\n\nThis is why warts and all, the United States is an exemplary and exciting democracy. The system is above everyone. One person does not decide what happens in the country. People take responsibility for any lapses under their watch. There is no room for excuses. If they refuse to do that, they are put under pressure until they do the right thing.\n\nBiden is the president of the strongest country in the world. Therefore, he is the strongest president and individual in the world. But he had to succumb to the pressure from his party members to withdraw from the presidential race. The difference between the US and the Nigerian situation is that in cases like this, the Nigerian president would not resign. It happened when Umaru Musa Yar'Adua was ill. It happened when Muhammadu Buhari was also ill. It happened when Bola Tinubu was contesting for the presidency. Besides, there were many allies of theirs who came out and spoke strongly in their support, giving all kinds of reasons why their health situation was not an issue.\n\nAnother point is the importance Americans place on presidential debates. Any candidate who refuses to attend a presidential debate is seen as showing disrespect to the American populace. The presidential debate is the avenue through which the American people, as well as citizens of all developed countries, gauge the physical and mental acuity of those who wish to lead them. They use it to find out who seems prepared for leadership. But in Nigeria, politicians snub debates and all attempts to answer unscripted questions. Tinubu did not participate in any presidential debate before the 2023 election. Before him, Buhari did the same thing. Likewise, Goodluck Jonathan, Yar'Adua and Olusegun Obasanjo either avoided presidential debates or participated in the one they created. There were always people who defended them and argued that talking is not the same thing as leadership.\n\nNigeria copies most things from the US. The current presidential system of government which Nigeria practises was copied from the US after the First Republic failed and it was blamed on the British parliamentary system. The presidential system has not succeeded in delivering a reliable system that creates progress and stability. That proves that Nigeria's governance failure has no connection with the system of government in place. The problem of Nigeria is that of a bad workman who continuously quarrels with his tools.\n\nNigeria does not copy the transparency that the American system is known for. It does not copy the proclivity of Americans to put the interest of the country before their personal and parochial interests. Resigning from positions is almost unthinkable. Individuals are most times above the law. This makes it difficult for democracy to produce the desired dividends that are associated with it. The only dividend of democracy that has accrued to Nigeria is the fact that no president has stayed in power for more than two terms like what obtains in countries like Russia, Rwanda, Cameroon, etc, which purport to practise democracy. Nigerians look forward to the time their politicians will start copying the good examples from the United States.", "source": {"uri": "punchng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Punch Newspapers"},

The Republican snagged 48 percent, compared to Harris's 45 percent, with another 7 percent still undecided.\n\nHarris also saw a 9-point jump in favorability after she took over Biden's bid. She and Trump are now effectively tied at 47 and 48 percent, respectively, in terms of favorability.\n\nThe new numbers come in the wake of an unprecedented few weeks in politics, including an assassination attempt against Trump at one of his recent campaign rallies and Biden's withdrawal after a dismal debate performance.\n\nRoughly 4 in 5 voters said they approve of Biden's decision to leave the race, and 55 percent approve of his endorsement of Harris.\n\nCompared to the June poll, more Democrats said they'd back the Democratic candidate, and fewer independents said they're unsure of who to vote for -- but, at the same time, a quarter of voters overall said they still haven't made up their mind on who they'll back in November.\n\n\"Harris has picked up the easy points as the Democratic Party is now one again and with enthusiasm,\" said Mark Penn, co-director of the Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll. \"However, getting to the next level will mean bringing in more independent voters in key swing states and that's a tougher job.\"\n\nThe poll, a collaboration between the Center for American Political Studies at Harvard (CAPS) and the Harris Poll and HarrisX, was conducted July 26-28 among 2,196 registered voters.

I mean, I don't understand the point that you are making,\" Harris shot back.\n\nThe NBC interview took place the same month as Harris' famous \"do not come speech,\" in which she cautioned would-be migrants from Central America not to try to cross into the US.\n\nThe vice president's warning, however, was followed by more than 6.3 million crossings - including over 1 million who snuck by police to sneak into the US, federal data said.\n\nHarris visited the southern border for the first time as vice president a few weeks after the Lester Holt spot -- and worked to address some of the root drivers of immigration, including securing $5 billion in investments to bolster the El Salvadoran, Honduran, and Guatemalan economies.\n\nThe attack ad ended with by branding Harris \"failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign has forked out $12 million to run the ad over the next two weeks during broadcast, cable, and digital airtime in key battleground states of Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin, according to AdImpact.\n\nThe ad recalled a similar spot put forward by the Republican National Convention in mid-July, which reminded viewers that Biden had \"help\" flubbing the border crisis while Harris' trademark laugh played in the background.\n\nTrump's television advertising is supported by the super PAC MAGA, Inc., the Washington Post noted - though the group has been significantly outspent by the independent groups that supported President Biden.\n\nFrom March through July 29, the Biden-Harris camp had spent $138 million on ads alone, the outlet said, citing Ad Impact.\n\nAs conservatives continue to target Harris' record at the border in the run-up to the Democratic National Convention in August, several Democrats have jumped the VP's defense.\n\nUnder Harris' leadership, according to Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Hondurans encountered at the border dropped by 50%, while El Salvadorean new arrivals plunged by 60%

On Tuesday morning, another survey was released showing that she had narrowed the gap compared to Joe Biden before he dropped out of the race.\n\nThe headline was clear: Harris has \"reset\" the race to the numbers we were seeing before the disastrous debate that ended the current president's bid for re-election.\n\nAccording to the poll, Trump leads Harris by three points, clocking in at 48 to 45 percent. When leaners are included, the former president's lead grows to four points, with the spread being 52 to 48 percent.\n\nAre you starting to see the problem? Yes, that is a better showing for Harris than Biden was posting before his dropping out, but she's still losing. That's a theme we see across the vast majority of the polls released over the last week of her being the presumptive nominee. Of the eight non-partisan polls released post-Biden, Trump leads six of them. In the two that Harris led, she's only up one and two points respectively, which would suggest the former president would win the electoral college. The battleground polling isn't much better.\n\nSEE: Two New Swing State Polls Show the Trouble Kamala Harris Is In\n\nThat brings up the obvious question. What's so great about \"resetting the race\" if the result is the same? There's no prize for losing by a smaller margin. Do I fully expect Harris to continue to make this a closer contest, including possibly consolidating enough support in California and New York to win the popular vote? Sure, that seems probable based on what has transpired so far, but at this moment, she's still losing.\n\nHer hypothetical path to victory rests on one assumption, which is that the current bump she's seeing is not her high-water mark. \"She's still going to get a bump when she picks a vice president,\" they claim. I'm skeptical that's true. The Trump campaign just placed a huge ad buy to begin to Harris. It's very likely she just had the best week of her campaign given the media onslaught in her favor and the fact that Republicans were caught somewhat flat-footed (who wouldn't be when an opposition party swaps their nominee in late July via the machinations of nothing but insiders).\n\nThe next month is going to tell us a lot, but for now, Democrat adulation is countered by the situation on the ground.

After a triumphant and unified Republican National Convention last week, it seemed like they were on a glide path to defeat the Democrats, who found themselves forced to swap in Vice President Kamala Harris for the aging President Joe Biden barely three months out from Election Day.\n\nWith voters still uneasy about the direction of the economy and the ongoing dysfunction at the southern border, it seemed like all former President Donald Trump had to do was keep hammering away at the issues where voters trust him more than Democrats and call it a day. Add in a promise to be a president for all Americans, as he did last week when he warned of the dangers of \"discord and division,\" and Trump could even win by a landslide.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nPatricia Murphy is a political reporter and columnist for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nBut the former president and the deputies most loyal to him haven't been able to help themselves with Harris as their new target.\n\nAfter months of promising a \"big tent\" Republican Party and showcasing their outreach to women and minority voters, it took them less than 24 hours to unleash a series of personal attacks on the country's first Black female vice president, who is also Indian American, that hearken back to the country's worst days.\n\nFirst Trump called Harris \"Dumb as a Rock Kamala Harris\" on his Truth Social media feed and \"Lyin' Kamala\" at a rally a day later. On Wednesday, he called her \"a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country.\"\n\n\"They say something happened to me when I got shot, I became 'nice.' ... If you don't mind, I'm not going to be nice,\" he said, as the crowd roared. And then Trump mispronounced Harris' name as Ka-MAL-a instead of the way it is actually said, which is \"Comma-luh,\" over and over again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSometimes a mistake is just a mistake, but sometimes you're Trump. After four years as vice president, and four more as a U.S. senator during the Trump administration, we all know how to say her name by now. Trump is choosing not to. By any measure, it's a sign of disrespect. And if Trump has proved anything over the years, it's that showing respect to someone else, especially a woman in power, isn't something he's willing to do.\n\nPlenty of Georgia Republicans have followed him down that road. Former U.S. Sen. David Perdue did it when he attended a rally for Trump in 2020. \"Is it Kamala? Kama-la-la?\" he asked from the stage. \"Har-har!\" the audience laughed. It was one of Perdue's last public appearances before he lost his Senate seat to newcomer Jon Ossoff. Demeaning a Black woman, especially one who was his longtime colleague in the U.S. Senate, didn't help him with the independent women he needed to win that year.\n\nIt also won't help Republicans expand their reach now. In the moments after Biden endorsed Harris for president this week, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene posted a note to social media calling the vice president Biden's \"DEI hire\" (referring to diversity, equity and inclusion policies). U.S. Rep. Mike Collins reposted it. The insult took off in conservative circles.\n\nExasperated Republican strategists know that belittling and insulting a woman, a Black leader or both at the same time may be the best way for Trump to guarantee he loses Georgia again in November. If he would stick to the issues where he's strongest, he would win. But being unable to avoid lashing out at Harris is \"a key reason this thing is now anyone's ballgame\" one strategist told me.\n\nWhere Trump could have taken his devoted followers forward, he is choosing to go back. Where he could have gotten to the work of healing our broken country last week, he added to the brokenness. We've all been here before with Trump, but I have to admit that I didn't think we'd be back in the gutter quite so fast after the former president survived an assassination attempt and said God had spared his life.\n\nDemocrats weren't expecting anything less.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"With 'DEI,' that's a way to substitute the n-word in 2024,\" said state Sen. Derek Mallow, a Savannah Democrat. \"And even to say DEI stands for 'didn't earn it?' Absolutely not. African Americans have cemented their role in America by working for 100 years for free. ... Don't just talk down to us or think we are some monolith, give us substance.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Buddy Carter, a St. Simons Island Republican, said it's not the way he would have said it, either. But he'll support Trump at the end of the day.\n\nSo where does the ugliness leave the country and the presidential race now?\n\nHarris has a tremendous amount of work to do to deliver an economic message that persuades Americans to trust her, not Trump, to bring down the cost of living. And dubbed \"the border czar\" by Republicans years ago, she'll need to embrace a plan to return order to the border and the country's broken immigration system.\n\nBut her job of winning got a lot easier this week with Trump finding a way to offend so many different groups of Americans at once with his relentless attacks on her, her role and her name.\n\nIf Republicans keep going down this road, they may never have to learn how to pronounce Harris' name properly. They can just call her \"Madame President\" in 2025.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nfiled under: columns Related Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri": "pressherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Portland Press Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Americans", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Americans"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlanta_Journal-Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_tent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big tent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Perdue", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Perdue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Ossoff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Ossoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Mallow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derek Mallow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buddy Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Simons,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Simons, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Simons, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

This significant fundraising effort helps counter a recent Republican push that saw Donald Trump gaining ground in the financial race. Additionally, Harris has recruited 170,000 new volunteers over the past week.\n\nHarris' campaign announced the fundraising total on Sunday, with communications director Michael Tyler describing it as a \"record-shattering haul.\" The campaign reported that 66% of the funds came from first-time donors.\n\nThese latest figures build on the $81 million she raised on the first day after President Joe Biden's exit, an amount the campaign has labeled as the largest 24-hour fundraising total for any candidate in history.\n\nThis fundraising achievement underscores the growing support among Democrats for Harris, who only announced her candidacy a week ago following Biden's decision to withdraw from the race and endorse her. Harris has already secured enough delegate support to secure the nomination and is now in the process of selecting a running mate. Additionally, she received the backing of former President Barack Obama on Friday.\n\nREAD MORE: Prince William 'Forced To Sign' Waiver After Fiery Clash With King Charles Over Sensitive Issue\n\nBiden's debate fiasco and the subsequent internal party conflict over his future strained his campaign's finances, causing donors to become hesitant to contribute to a president, 81, who was facing scrutiny over his mental sharpness and his ability to challenge Trump in the November election.\n\nBy July, the Biden campaign had $96 million cash on hand, following a spending spree that used up nearly 93% of the funds raised in June. This high expenditure rate significantly outpaced that of rival Trump, whose campaign spent only 46% of its June fundraising and maintained $128 million in reserve. Despite some polls showing Trump with an advantage after the debate and increasing calls for Biden to withdraw, the incumbent's campaign continued its spending spree.\n\nThis development represents a dramatic reversal from earlier in the race when Biden had built a significant financial lead, partly due to the absence of a serious Democratic challenger and Trump's struggles with a contentious GOP primary and numerous court cases that depleted his funds.\n\nRecently, Trump's fundraising has surged, fueled by appeals to high-dollar Republican donors and backing from Wall Street and corporate executives attracted by his economic policies. Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, the world's richest person according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has indicated that he is \"making some donations\" to a super political action committee supporting the former president, though at a \"much lower level\" than previously reported. Sources have suggested that Musk is committed to contributing $45 million a month to the pro-Trump group.\n\nIn the second quarter, Trump and the Republican National Committee raised $331 million, surpassing the $264 million collected by Biden and the Democratic National Committee. In response, Democratic Wall Street donors are rallying to leverage their networks and assist Harris in narrowing the fundraising gap with Trump.\n\nTrump's campaign has filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, alleging that Biden's transfer of his $96 million in funds may be illegal. While this raises a novel legal issue, many campaign finance experts believe that the transfer is likely permissible.", "source": {"uri": "newsx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsX"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Communications_Director", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House Communications Director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidential nominee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Election_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Election Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political action committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Kamala-Harris.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773409", "eventUri": "eng-9773409", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

Republican candidate and former president, Donald Trump, survived an assassination attempt and emerged bolder and more energised in rallying his base. President Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential race, endorsing his vice president, Kamala Harris, who within a week managed to win enough delegate support to secure the nomination at the upcoming Democratic National Convention set for August 19-22.\n\nHarris has re-invigorated the Democratic campaign, raising more than $200m in donations, getting 100,000 new voters to register, and securing 170,000 new volunteers within just seven days.\n\nShe is also doing better at the polls. Her \"favourability\" score with the American public rose 8 percentage points to 43 percent in one week. Among likely voters, she is currently polling at 47 percent, just one percentage point behind Trump.\n\nSome of Harris's early success may be attributed to the significant relief many Democrats certainly felt over Biden's decision to step aside. A whopping 87 percent of registered Democrats supported his withdrawal.\n\nBut this early momentum is unlikely to hold all the way to the election in early November. And while Harris brought much-needed change to the Democratic campaign, she also represents continuity with the Biden administration, which on certain issues could put her at a disadvantage.\n\nOne of these issues is the Israeli genocide in Gaza. Let us remember that one reason Biden was initially seen to be vulnerable was the Arab and Muslim American-led \"uncommitted vote\" campaign during the Democratic primaries earlier this year. A significant percentage of Democrats voted uncommitted to signal their rejection of Biden's unconditional support for Israel's Gaza genocide.\n\nThe results in key swing states particularly worried the Biden campaign. In Michigan and Wisconsin, for example, 101,000 and 47,800, respectively, voted uncommitted. Biden had won both states by margins as small as 154,000 and 20,600 in 2020.\n\nIn the latest polls, Harris is trailing Trump by 2 to 10 percent in swing states like Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania; in Michigan, she is one percentage point behind and in Wisconsin they both poll at 47 percent. In other words, the Arab and Muslim American communities, supported by their many progressive allies, could play a defining role in determining small-margin wins in these states. They may prove key for her victory, if she lags behind Trump in other swing states like Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina or Georgia.\n\nMembers of the \"Abandon Biden\" and \"uncommitted\" movements have threatened to abandon Harris if she continues Biden's pro-war policy. The \"uncommitted\" movement has expanded into a growing coalition that includes other traditional Democratic Party voters, like labour activists, progressive Jews, Black people and Hispanics, and others who support social justice issues. On July 23, for example, seven labour unions representing millions of American workers asked Biden in a joint letter to halt military aid to Israel.\n\nIt is important to point out that opposition to the Biden administration's policies on Palestine and Israel goes beyond these interest groups. Americans' backing for Israel's war is currently at 42 percent; among Democrats it stands at 23 percent. In other words, the vast majority of Harris's Democratic base does not support Israel's actions, which the Biden administration has wholeheartedly endorsed.\n\nI asked Huwaida Arraf, a Palestinian-American Michigan-based lawyer, human rights activist, and an \"uncommitted\" alternate delegate to the Democratic National Convention, whether and how her colleagues expect Harris to respond to their demands. She replied: \"To get our votes, the Democratic Party must fundamentally change course on Gaza specifically, and on Palestine in general. It cannot keep mistreating us, enabling and funding a genocide of our people, then expecting our votes by warning us that the alternative will be worse. Harris is part of an administration that is complicit in genocide and has done nothing to stop it. While she is seen as slightly better than Biden, this is a very low bar, and will not be enough to get our votes. To have a chance, Harris must distance herself from Biden's policies in a clear and tangible way that goes beyond words. We will no longer accept crumbs.\"\n\nThis sentiment is widespread among uncommitted members, who have closely followed Harris's statements on Gaza. The vice president did not attend Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's congressional address on July 24, but she did meet him the following day.\n\nHer comments after their meeting offered possible hints about her position on Gaza. She called for a ceasefire, a two-state solution, and a stop to the mass suffering of Palestinian civilians, referring to Palestinian women and children in a humanised way that is rarely heard in Washington.\n\nSeasoned Middle East analyst and justice advocate Adam Shapiro, a Brooklyn native currently based in Michigan, told me, \"Harris has to be aware the Israeli genocide in Gaza caused the drop in support for Biden, and we have to see if she does anything about that. Her contrast with Biden is often striking in her style and words, but she has spoken well of reducing Palestinian suffering while also supporting the Biden war policy. Skipping the Netanyahu speech is more impressive than her words of concern. Now she must show if she can change her position by the time of the November election in a meaningful way.\"\n\nThe Democratic National Convention may give Harris the platform to make clear her position on Israel and its war on Gaza. As the Democratic presidential candidate, she would have more influence than she does now as vice president. To what extent she is willing to distance herself from Biden's staunch support for Israel's war may determine how much backing she gains from pro-Palestinian progressive Democrats.\n\n\"The bare minimum [Harris must do] is to declare support for an arms embargo on Israel before the November vote,\" Arraf said. A Harris commitment to respecting international law is another area activists are watching, including a commitment to applying relevant US laws on arms transfers that are used in genocide or other human rights abuses. Others say that there can be changes in the party platform overall, announced at the convention in August.\n\nThe 2024 presidential election was always expected to be one of the most consequential presidential votes in modern American history, given the expanding powers of the far right and the fears of Democrats who fret for their democracy. This is now shaping up as an even more historic event not only because it could put a woman of colour in charge of the White House for the first time in US history, but also because it could produce a significant shift in the Democratic Party's position on Israel-Palestine.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But the majority of people have barely begun to tune in. With Kamala Harris suddenly the Democrat candidate, the Trump campaign has had to rework their strategy completely.\n\nThe results are here and not particularly surprising. Trump is going after Kamala as dangerously liberal, especially on the border. And they are making their pitch in a significant ad buy on TV in the big swing states.\n\nI am not a campaign ad specialist, and I am so jaded about such things that I am completely incapable of analyzing the effectiveness of these sorts of appeals. It's clear to me that they are going after Harris' weak spots, which is good, but beyond that I can't judge how people will respond.\n\nThe focus groups must have been good, though.\n\nWhat I can tell you is that Trump's campaign has identified the big states he wants to play in: Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Minnesota is not on the list, and that is smart since it hasn't voted for a Republican since 1972. It is the great purple mirage, and while it might be nice to win the state (Trump did well here, relatively speaking), its electoral votes don't really matter. No Trump path to victory requires a win in this state.\n\nIf Trump wins Minnesota it will be in a blowout election. If he loses it, he can still easily win without it.\n\nHarris is also running ads, trying to define herself in a race where she is a relative unknown, and there is a race to define her.\n\nThe race to define Vice President Kamala Harris began in earnest on Tuesday, with both her campaign and former President Donald J. Trump's team unveiling television advertisements that aim to explain her biography to voters in battleground states.\n\nMs. Harris's new ad, her first since becoming the party's de facto nominee, labels her as \"fearless\" while leaning into her time as a local and state prosecutor. \"She put murderers and abusers behind bars,\" a narrator states. \"Kamala Harris has always known who she represents.\"\n\nMr. Trump's new ad, meanwhile, attacks her as being weak on the border. It suggests that she is responsible for millions of border crossings and a quarter-million deaths from fentanyl, which the ad says occurred \"on Harris's watch.\" It closes with a new Trump tagline for Ms. Harris: \"Failed. Weak. Dangerously Liberal.\"\n\nThe effort to define Kamala on TV is just one part of a much larger campaign being pushed by Harris' team, which includes the mainstream media. They are trying to turn her into a cultural phenomenon, and have been engaged in a brainwashing campaign to define the Trump/Vance team as weird.\n\nIt has gotten so strange that the left is arguing that both are drag queens.\n\nReally. It is all over Twitter, and now a gay magazine has argued that Trump and Vance are \"weird\" and drag queens.\n\nIn an article titled \"Are Donald Trump and JD Vance drag queens?,\" The Philadelphia Gay News pushes both ideas:\n\nA friend alerted me to another odd aspect of these two candidates. The Republican party, known for its strong stance against drag queens, is being represented by a candidate who wears more orange makeup than any drag queen and a vice-presidential candidate known for his heavy use of eyeliner. This raises an interesting question: If someone paints their face for a performance and dances, does that qualify as drag? Trump is known for his heavily made-up appearance and his dancing at rallies, sometimes to the Village People's \"Y.M.C.A.\" So, could Trump be considered a drag queen? And if so, shouldn't Republicans follow their own advice and protect children from drag performances? Why, then, do people bring their children to see Trump in drag? Do they think they're bringing their child to see Ronald McDonald? So goes another week.\n\n\"Weird\" is the word of the week, and they are pushing it hard. Since the Associated Press \"fact check\" about J.D. Vance's sexual dalliance with a couch (they rated it \"false,\" but injected it into the conversation, the left has been pushing the idea that Vance is \"weird\" very hard.\n\nTotal brainwashing. You can find all sorts of news stories now about the subject because the mainstream media loves the theme, and they repeat the Democrat talking points religiously.\n\nThe brainwashing efforts of the left are creepy, and it's unclear if they are effective with anybody but the left. But then again, the Democrats had a problem with voter enthusiasm and Kamala's unpopularity, and they are determined to fix those problems.\n\nTrump's team has a different goal: define Harris as weak, especially on the border. Unlike the \"weird\" meme, voters care deeply about this issue. \"Weird\" is the meme directed specifically at women to make them feel disgusted when they think of Vance.\n\nThis is by far the most gendered race in history, with Trump leaning into testosterone and Harris leaning into estrogen. Both are clearly self-conscious strategies, and I'm not sure which campaign has the edge on this.\n\nThe ads and online messaging over the next few weeks will tell us a lot about that. If the Harris campaign keeps up with the \"weird\" theme we will get a strong signal.\n\nTrump's testosterone-themed campaign is smart, though, because the image of him as a badass is indelible by now.

She had a growing profile as a no-nonsense interrogator in the Senate, heavyweight support from Hollywood to Wall Street and the raw talent of a once-in-a-generation leader.\n\nThen she crumbled.\n\nHarris' admirers -- not to mention aides and members of her inner circle -- detest the mere thought of that painful time. She's been vice president for four years, they say, standing in for President Joe Biden around the world and becoming the party's preeminent voice on abortion rights. She's confident, they contend, and battle-tested. The Kamala Harris of 2024 is light-years better than the Harris of 2019.\n\nBut the searing experience remains an indelible stain on her image, even after the 59-year-old Democrat spent the last half-decade steadily improving on the biggest stage imaginable.\n\nHer near-perfect introduction as the Democrats' standard-bearer is a testament to the hard work she's put in. But Harris has never dealt with an opponent as ferocious as former President Donald Trump. He'll seize on any perceived weakness and attack every vulnerability.\n\nThat means she needs to figure out how to neutralize her exposure on the border and immigration. Harris will need a crisp answer when talking about stubbornly high inflation. She must stem the slow-rolling erosion of the Democratic coalition that occurred on Biden's watch and energize young voters, Latinos and other voters of color while holding Biden's white working-class support across the industrial Midwestern battleground states. As a woman of color, she has to worry about calibrating her approach in ways that may seem unfair, and, at times, limiting. She has a momentous decision to make -- her own vice presidential pick -- and very little time to make it. In short, there is no margin for the kind of errors that plagued her first presidential bid.\n\nTo do all these things, and win the 100-day sprint to Election Day, she'll need to bury the ghosts of that first bid. Here's how she can do it:\n\nThe multi-headed structure Harris installed atop her 2020 campaign was a disaster. It was chaotic, creating choke points that nearly ground the operation to a halt. Decisions took forever to make, advisers struggled to put a check on her family's influence and it radiated uncertainty and dysfunction across her organization.\n\nIt wasn't a new dynamic for her. The first year in each of her elected offices had been marked by a failure to settle on a solid organizational structure and an inability to find her own footing within it.\n\nLike many high-achieving elected officials, she's a demanding boss who puts top aides through the paces and expects the same level of preparation and focus down the chain of command. And when she's made mistakes, it has rippled downstream to everyone's detriment, including in the vice president's office, where her first year was rocky.\n\nSince then, Harris has become more grounded. She found a solid core of advisers. She's tapped into her network of former aides and advisers for outside advice, even before taking over as the de facto nominee.\n\nBut she'll need to rely on -- and trust -- the plug-and-play aspect of Biden's campaign apparatus. In a compressed, three-month timeline, maintaining continuity, carefully integrating Willmington and Harris world and ensuring an effective transition is essential to exorcising the organizational demons of 2020. So is having a campaign organization marked by clear lines of authority and responsibility.\n\nHarris tripped herself up in 2019 by straying too far from what was then her political North Star: crafting an image as a tough-minded and empathetic prosecutor.\n\nIn the run-up to the Democratic primaries, Harris allowed \"Kamala is a cop\" critiques from activists and members of her own party to get inside her head. While Harris was progressive by the standards of her era in law enforcement, she was nowhere near as permissive as today's crop of liberal district attorneys. Still, she readily submitted to the left's endless purity tests, and backtracked on key pieces of her record as a prosecutor and attorney general. In doing so, she undermined what Harris and her closest advisers viewed as one of her greatest strengths: her career-long commitment to pursuing justice through the legal system.\n\nThe act of creating a policy platform on the fly while simultaneously trying to prove her ideological bona fides yanked her further left and outside her comfort zone. At different moments in the primary, you could almost see her calculating answers in real time during TV interviews, which had the effect of making her appear wishy-washy.\n\nHarris won't need to worry about liberal carping about her prosecutorial background anymore. It may have been a liability in a Democratic presidential primary, but in a general election, it's more likely to be an asset. And whereas she once struggled to articulate her views on broader issues like health care, she now can largely rely on the policy framework created under the Biden-Harris administration.\n\nAt the moment, Trump is throwing everything he has at Harris to see what sticks. It's no coincidence he's toggled between using two nicknames for Harris: Lyin' Kamala (with her first name pronounced incorrectly), and Laffin' Kamala. The latter, a nod to the wave of videos that capture Harris' big, full-bodied laugh, is designed to paint her as unserious and phony.\n\nHer ability to fend off those attacks may hinge on her ability to confidently return to her tough, pragmatic prosecutor motif, the space where she is most at ease. She's already moving in that direction. \"As attorney general of California, I took on the big Wall Street banks and held them accountable for fraud,\" she said in Wisconsin last week. \"Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud on 34 counts.\"\n\nOne of the most serious flaws of Harris' 2020 bid was the inability of the messenger to settle on a consistent, coherent and compelling message.\n\nIn large part, that was a function of her attempts to break out of a crowded primary field. Biden occupied the moderate path, promoting narrow, incremental change. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who proposed more sweeping initiatives, crashed in a pile-up on the left. Others sought to establish themselves as candidates of generational change, laying out competing versions of the Democratic future -- the mensa vibes of Pete Buttigieg, the Gen-X mystique of Beto O'Rourke, the spirituality of Cory Booker. Harris wasn't any of that.\n\nBy the time she pivoted to her \"3 a.m. Agenda,\" a late-stage phase of her run that purported to address issues that kept voters up at night, much of the party had already moved on.\n\nNow that she's about to be handed the Democratic nomination, Harris doesn't need to compete for eyeballs against a massive field of serious competitors. She's free to focus on a straightforward mission.\n\nIt won't be enough for Harris to just be the anti-Trump candidate. Her task will be laying waste to Trump while also articulating a forward-looking vision of a brighter future.\n\nBalancing those ideas and integrating them into a cohesive message won't be easy. But Harris has already gotten started, showing a zeal for attack in her characterization of Trump as a fraudster and an abuser of women while wrapping her campaign around the theme of fighting for the middle class.\n\nIt's worth remembering that Harris also had a wildly successful presidential campaign rollout in 2019. Things went downhill after that. This time around, she's far better prepared. There isn't a lot of time to get it right, but she has the advantage of a clear enemy, an inherited campaign structure and a well-defined objective.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType":

He tried cutting Social Security and Medicare every single year he was in office,\" Harris for President spokesperson Ammar Moussa said.\n\n\"There is only one candidate in this race who will protect and expand earned benefits programmes that millions of Americans rely on - Vice President Harris,\" Mossa said.\n\nAccording to the Harris campaign, Trump and his extreme Project 2025 allies will do everything in their power to gut these programmes - because they've come out and said it.\n\n\"Trump proposed cuts to Social Security and Medicare every year he was in office. He already tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act - and almost got his way. He doubled down on his openness to slashing Social Security and Medicare and repealing the ACA in a second term,\" the statement alleged.\n\n\"His Project 2025 agenda calls for gutting the Affordable Care Act, which would rip away protections from 100 million Americans with preexisting conditions. Trump will undo Vice President Harris' progress in lowering the cost of prescription drugs. And leave over 45 million Americans' healthcare in jeopardy,\" the Harris campaign said.\n\nThe Democratic Party will hold its national convention in Chicago from August 19 to 22 and is set to nominate US Vice President Harris as its candidate for the November 5 presidential election to compete against former president Donald Trump, a Republican.\n\nOn July 21, US President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the American presidential elections. He endorsed Harris, his running mate, as the nominee of the Democratic Party for the November general elections.

REUTERS\n\nUS President Joe Biden's decision to step aside as the Democratic Party's presidential candidate this fall has transformed American politics. It caps a historic July in the United States, one defined by far-reaching Supreme Court decisions and the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump on the eve of the Republican Convention.\n\nBiden's decision, urged by many Democratic Party officials and donors and favoured by many voters, was the right choice. In the wake of a debate widely viewed as a debacle for Biden, his age had made it all but impossible for him to make the case to the American people that he deserved another four years -- and was making it impossible for him to make the case that Trump did not.\n\nIt is too soon to write about Biden's legacy, if for no other reason than that his presidency still has some six months left. But by stepping aside he has gone a long way toward eliminating the potential critique that by staying in the race he paved the way for a successor who shared little of his commitment to American democracy and the country's role in the world. Indeed, had Trump defeated Biden in November, as polls were forecasting, this would have largely overshadowed Biden's accomplishments as president.\n\nThe odds are strong that Vice-President Kamala Harris will be the Democratic nominee. Biden's endorsement will help her. But it does not settle matters, because Biden only has the authority to release party delegates committed to him, not to require them to support someone else.\n\nSo, the Democratic Convention in Chicago this August will be an open one, and the four weeks between now and then could go a long way toward determining what happens there. Harris could essentially run for the nomination unopposed, or one or more challengers might emerge. Assuming she prevails, the latter scenario might actually be to her advantage, as the process would further hone her political skills, help her be seen as a winner, and allow her to get out from under the shadow of an unpopular president.\n\nThe process would also shine a spotlight on the Democratic Party at a time when it needs to reintroduce itself to the electorate. This is essential, as Trump and Senator J D Vance, his pick for vice-president, promise to be formidable campaigners. And even if Harris were to run and lose to them, polls suggest that she would outperform Biden, improving Democrats' chances of winning the House of Representatives (keeping control of the Senate appears out of reach) and thus preventing Republicans from controlling the entire federal government.\n\nTrump is slightly ahead of Harris in polls, but she could well get a boost in the next month as she steps into the spotlight. Harris's prosecutorial skills, which she honed as a prosecutor and later as California's attorney general, would serve her well in a campaign. She is well-positioned to take on the extreme anti-abortion stance of this Supreme Court as well as Vance. And she would benefit from the absence of a woman or a minority on the Republican ticket.\n\nOne unavoidable challenge, however, is what might be described as the Hubert Humphrey dilemma. In 1968, Humphrey, who was vice president at the time, won the Democratic nomination after the incumbent president, Lyndon Johnson, chose not to run for re-election. The words in Biden's withdrawal letter echoed many used by Johnson 56 years ago, the principal difference being that Biden put out his statement on X and Johnson appeared on national television.\n\nThe dilemma is this: how to appear loyal and take credit for what was popular about a presidency without being weighed down by policies that were unpopular. In 1968, it was the Vietnam War that complicated Humphrey's run, as he found it hard to distance himself from a policy that he had been associated with and from a boss who had little tolerance for disloyalty.\n\nNo single issue dominates public debate today, but there is still a need to differentiate the Democratic nominee from Biden, as incumbency has become a burden at a time when many seek change. Anyone doubting this only needs to look at recent election results in South Africa, India, the United Kingdom, and France.\n\nThis means that the Democratic nominee, whether Harris or someone else, would do well to embrace the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act, efforts to combat climate change and defend democracy, access to abortion and birth control, and military assistance to Ukraine. But it also suggests that the candidate might want to distance themselves from a Middle East policy seen by many Americans as too pro-Israel, and from policies on the border and crime viewed by many as too lax.\n\nIf Harris is the Democratic choice, her selection of a running mate will matter. Several Midwestern states are likely to be decisive in November's election, and there is a large pool of independent voters to be won over. Governors Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Andy Beshear of Kentucky, and Roy Cooper of North Carolina would presumably be considered, as would several members of Biden's cabinet.\n\nPerhaps the only thing that is certain is that less is certain after Biden's stunning announcement. One thing is clear, though: the outcome of the presidential election will matter enormously for the US and the rest of the world. This is not normally the case, as the candidates' similarities tend to outweigh their differences. Not so this time. The differences are profound, making it difficult to exaggerate just how much is at stake when Americans vote this November.\n\nRichard Haass, President Emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations and a senior counsellor at Centerview Partners, previously served as Director of Policy Planning for the US State Department (2001-03).\n\nViews expressed in this article are the author's own.", "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

You can read the previous edition here. Sign up for free here to get it on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Email us at electioncountdown@ft.com\n\nGood morning and welcome to US Election Countdown. Today we're looking at:\n\nKamala Harris is laying out her economic vision for the US -- and hoping voters will be keener for her economic leadership than Joe Biden's.\n\nHarris will try to avoid association with negative perceptions of the Biden economy and the impact of inflation on voters' personal finances. She has an opening here, and it could prove easier for her to defend the Biden administration's policies than the president himself [free to read].\n\nWith inflation continuing to fall from the 40-year high it hit in 2022 and the Federal Reserve preparing to lower borrowing costs, Harris has entered the race with an improved set of economic circumstances. If she's able to harness this momentum, she could also fuel optimism about her plans for future growth.\n\nBiden struggled to convince voters that the economy performed well under his watch, even though he oversaw the country's exit from the worst economic contraction since the Great Depression and presided over record jobs growth.\n\nWhile Harris has embraced the most popular parts of Biden's plans -- current and former administration officials say she's expected to push ahead with investing in the manufacturing sector, bolstering infrastructure and incentivising green energy policies -- she's carving out her own focus area too.\n\nThe vice-president will emphasise the so-called care economy, which includes broadening access to childcare and paid family leave, and increasing education funding, all of which Biden couldn't push through Congress.\n\nBut there's still a huge challenge for Harris: Donald Trump has cast himself as the president for working people. She'll need to undermine that idea to win over battleground states.\n\nJD Vance has had a rough start to his vice-presidential candidacy. There's growing unease among Republicans over his addition to their ticket after his hardline positions and resurfaced comments gave Democrats fresh attack lines.\n\nDemocrats are calling him \"weird\" and \"out of touch\", while Republican strategists warn that the Trump-Vance campaign has to move fast to redefine the Ohio senator.\n\nA clip from 2021, in which Vance warned that the US was being run by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives\" and named vice-president Kamala Harris as an example, provoked a national backlash. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has two stepchildren.\n\nIn other clips, Vance has proposed childless Americans pay higher taxes and that parents should be able to vote on behalf of their children.\n\nOne Republican strategist told me that the Trump campaign \"got caught flat-footed\" by the attacks on Vance:\n\nThe longer you wait, the harder it is to get back on offence\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. What was their plan to defend their VP and then promote a much more disciplined message that placed the Democrats in a negative frame?\n\nRepublican strategist Doug Heye cited \"buyer's concern\" within the party after \"the myriad of weird issues in the past week\".\n\nThe \"abnormal issues\" Vance talked about highlighted \"an eagerness to go into weird places that will be very easy to allow Democrats to define him\", said Heye. Democrats had been given \"an opening\" with the \"radical, anti-abortion weird stuff that he's been spewing\".\n\nHowever, Bryan Lanza, a strategist aligned with the Republican nominee, said that he had not heard from anyone in Trump's circle that the ex-president regretted his choice.\n\nDemocrats have seemingly freed themselves from the impending doom that had engulfed the party for months -- and it's showing up in the data.\n\nPolls published last week show that Harris's approval rating has surpassed that of Trump, something Biden wasn't able to do all year.\n\nShe's gotten a bump from previously undecided and independent voters -- especially young, Black and Latino voters -- that Biden was struggling to reach.\n\nA Wall Street Journal poll released on Friday showed Harris leading Trump by 1 percentage point when third-party candidates were included in the match-up. An ABC/Ipsos survey from Sunday showed that more voters view her favourably than unfavourably, reversing the previous week's result.\n\nHarris also raised $200mn during the first week of her White House run. Her campaign reported that two-thirds of the haul came from first-time donors.\n\nHowever, the vice-president conceded over the weekend that Trump was still the favourite to win in November. \"We are the underdogs in this race,\" she told donors.\n\nThough her approval rating has gone up, her lead over Trump is significantly smaller than Biden's was in 2020.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com",

If elected, Harris would continue to shatter the glass ceiling and would become the first Black and South Asian woman to become President of The United States.\n\nSince announcing her bid for president, Congressional Representatives Harriet Hageman (R-WY) and Tim Burchett (R-TN), referred to Harris as a \"DEI hire.\" These public comments have fueled this narrative, causing one guest on Fox Business to reference \"a vulgar TikTok meme, appearing to imply without evidence that Harris had somehow used sexual relationships with powerful men to advance her career,\" NPR reports.\n\nAnge-Marie Hancock is director of the Ohio State University's Kirwan Institute and the Kamala Harris Project's curator. \"There is very much this idea that they want to make sure she's seen as not qualified.\" Former President Trump's Vice-Presidential running mate JD Vance even called Harris a \"childless cat lady[y]\" in addition to implying that she is \"miserable.\"\n\n\"Those kinds of things are really designed to appeal to those suburban women voters who are more traditional in their values about what kind of life women lead,\" said Hancock.\n\nJesse Watters, a Fox News host, \"said Harris secured Hillary Clinton's endorsement, 'obviously, because she's a woman.'\"\n\nIn addition, Trump has publicly called Harris \"crazy,\" \"nuts\" and \"dumb as a rock.\" According to Reuters, however, these \"[o]nline attacks against Harris were ramping up even before Biden dropped out\" of the race after reviewing posts on X.\n\nThese attacks are occurring despite pleas from GOP leadership to keep their criticisms of Harris focused on policy.

Truscott IV\n\nColumnist\n\nPublished July 30, 2024 9:01AM (EDT)\n\n(Salon) It's hard to believe that it's been only a week. I've been looking for the word to describe the feeling of the change that happened since Joe Biden suspended his campaign in favor of Kamala Harris. I found it today: amazement. You can't look at the transformation of the Democratic Party and the presidential campaign in any other way than amazement.\n\n....(snip)....\n\nThat's fast. So is what happened afterwards: Harris made 100 calls to party leaders on Sunday; the campaign had to flip 30 social media accounts from saying \"Biden\" to \"Harris.\" The Post names all the campaign and White House officials who sprang into action. Harris' communications director was adamant that the veep appear on television on Monday, so preparations had to be made for that. The Post reported that \"for years,\" the site KamalaHarris.com had simply redirected to Biden's website. That had to be changed, but it could only be done by someone with power over that domain, so there was a scramble at the Democratic National Committee to find that person and get the change done.\n\n....(snip)....\n\nThere was something special at work in the transfer that took place from Biden to Harris as the party's nominee. Harris had spent four years in Biden's shadow, as every vice president must, especially while the president in question is in his first term with a re-election campaign on the horizon. In fact, Harris came under withering criticism for appearing to play such a quiet second fiddle to Biden. She was called \"low energy,\" her speaking style was criticized and in Republican corners ridiculed.\n\n....(snip)....\n\nWhat she was, was ready, and that truth came across in the speed and efficiency with which, in the words of the Washington Post, she \"took control of the Democratic Party.\" Sure, the party was ready for someone to take control after the Dark Days of Biden's apparent decline after the Trump debate.

Over the weekend, the campaign mobilised thousands of grassroots supporters who have signed up to volunteer since the campaign launch - through thousands of events, phone banks, and canvass launches across the battleground states.\n\nTaking to X, 'Harris for President' Battleground States Director Dan Kanninen said, \"100 days out! Our teams in battleground states have been building and were ready for it. 1,300+ staff (and growing), 250+ offices, (and) tens of thousands of volunteers. Talking to millions of voters. 2,300 events in battlegrounds. Just this weekend.\" \"One hundred days before Election Day, Team Harris is leveraging the historic grassroots enthusiasm we've seen for our campaign and putting it to work. For over a year, our team has been building the battleground infrastructure needed to reach and persuade the voters who will decide this election - and now, we're kicking it into overdrive,\" he said.\n\n\"We have an enormous battleground advantage over Donald Trump, and this weekend, that is going to be painfully clear to the Trump-Vance campaign. Our campaign is off to a running start and doing the work to defeat Donald Trump and send Vice President Harris to the Oval Office,\" he added.\n\nThe battleground States are Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nAccording to the campaign, this weekend, Team Harris held Kamala coffee hours, soul food potlucks, Pride trivia nights, office openings and other events to reach voters wherever they are and talk to them about all that's at stake in the November 5 election.\n\nLeaders like Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff and many volunteers hit the doors to talk directly to voters.\n\nIn addition, 'Harris for President' organised phone banks for bilingual Spanish speakers, labour organisers, and senior citizens. The campaign also held youth, women, labour, and LGBTQ+ national organising calls with thousands of supporters.\n\nIt also hosted watch parties so volunteers and supporters could watch Harris on RuPaul's Drag Race and learn more about how they can volunteer with and support her White House bid.

Biden, at the time, explicitly said he would choose a nonwhite female running mate and had originally flirted with the idea of failed Georgia candidate Stacey Abrams. To Republicans today, Harris is the epitome of a DEI candidate, and Democrats are furious about that comparison. It is a problem for the Republicans.\n\nDemocrat focus groups and media focus groups have regularly shown Kamala Harris is not well liked in parts of the black community. Black women and younger black men have often voiced criticisms of Harris. In the opinion of black focus group participants, Harris has not lived what they see as the \"black experience.\" The daughter of a Jamaican immigrant father and Indian immigrant mother, Harris is the epitome of the American dream and melting pot. But her father's family descends from a line of slave owners in Jamaica. She herself grew up in progressive politics in Oakland, California. Her father was a Marxist economics professor, and her mother was a biologist and cancer researcher.\n\nBlack voters may lean toward Harris as a Democrat, but not necessarily as someone with a shared cultural background. When white Republicans call Kamala Harris a \"DEI hire,\" black voters get defensive. Too many of them have had their hirings questioned as perhaps the product of affirmative action and not their merit. Attacking Harris as a DEI pick, true or not, draws black voters drifting away from the Democrats back in to take up defensive positions around Harris.\n\nMany Trump supporters operate as \"edgelords\" online, i.e., they seek to provoke others through an extreme online persona embodied in Donald Trump himself, who often sounds like an internet comments section come to life. They want to \"own the Left\" more than they want to beat the Left. The same Trump supporters who even now relish the opportunity to attack Ron DeSantis and his supporters, months after the end of the Republican primary process, will not be controllable. Their trolling will only help the Left.\n\nRepublicans used to understand they were held to a double standard by the press and worked harder with more discipline. In fact, in the past month as the media that had protected Biden turned on him, we all got to see Democrats held to the same standards the press holds Republicans to, and Democrats did not like it. Now, the press is back in defense mode, retracting prior news articles that had referred to Harris as a \"border czar\" and deleting nonpartisan rankings that showed Harris as the most progressive senator while she was in the Senate.\n\nDemocratic operatives and activists tend to be more collectivist and easier to corral. Republican activists pride themselves on their independence. With Trump, too, many Republican activists pride themselves on pushing every button, racial and otherwise, to get a rise out of the Left. A media that would never tie a Democrat activist to Harris will work overtime to tie a Republican troll to Trump and, more often than not, there will be a picture of that troll at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nLike with Project 2025, which embraces more than any candidate for office would ever embrace on the campaign trail, all the Trump trolls online will be tied to Trump. The news broadcasts relied on by low-information voters will cover the ties and tweets. Republicans must be careful.\n\nKamala Harris has a progressive record. She favors \"a conversation\" about letting prisoners, including terrorists, vote in elections. She favors using tax dollars to fund the health care of illegal aliens. She favors decriminalization of illegal alien entry into the country. She favors using government force to make Americans give up red meat. She favors the eradication of the fossil fuel industry. She favors disastrous economic policies. Republicans need to focus there.\n\nTrump needs to focus on her record and a competing vision for the future. The DEI digs, etc. will hurt the GOP more than Harris. She's a deeply beatable candidate, but uncontrollable Republican trolling will blow up in the GOP's face.", "source": {"uri": "heraldextra.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Herald"},

The anti-Harris rhetoric is part of what a report by the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan think tank, described as a broad pattern of gendered and sexualized attacks on prominent women in public discourse.\n\nMore recently, those comments were joined by conservative attacks branding Harris as the \"border czar,\" part of an effort to tie her to immigration, a hot-button topic for conservatives.\n\nThe intense attacks so far are only a fraction of what will come. Trump is skilled at both character assassination and political self-defense. Together, they translate into an exceptional ability to defeat his political rivals once they enter the presidential campaign arena.\n\nBut Harris also has sharp rhetorical skills that could make this a fierce election fight.\n\nTrump's alternative facts\n\nAs I discuss in my book \"Presidential Communication and Character,\" Trump is highly skilled at both channeling white working-class anger into political support for himself and at convincing his supporters to disregard the former president's own well-chronicled professional and personal failings.\n\nTrump's character generates enduring contempt among liberals, but those voters will back the Democratic nominee.\n\nIn 2016, Trump defeated Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. He also defeated several well-known Republican presidential hopefuls in the primary race, including Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas and former Governors Jeb Bush of Florida, John Kasich of Ohio and Scott Walker of Wisconsin.\n\nEarlier in 2024, Trump easily dispatched another round of highly experienced Republicans, most notably Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.\n\nLike those other opponents, President Biden has long endured Trump's personal attacks. But in 2020, Trump's original nickname of \"Sleepy Joe\" failed to become as effective as his insults aimed at other politicians, and Biden's election marked Trump's only electoral defeat.\n\nAs the 2024 election approached, Trump and conservative voices once again demonstrated their immense influence in shaping political narratives. They have convinced many voters this year to absolve Trump for his mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic, ignore that he designed a Supreme Court majority to overturn Roe v. Wade and agree with him that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\nIn an even more powerful demonstration of Trump's skills at political marketing, polls show that many voters follow Trump's lead and condemn Biden for U.S. economic conditions that in fact are quite good.\n\nUnemployment is low. Job growth is booming. Infrastructure projects are underway. Inflation is much lower now than it was earlier in Biden's term, and individual retirement accounts are flush thanks to large stock market gains.\n\nGiven Trump's public relations mastery - and the great susceptibility of many voters to his false narratives - one can marvel about how the Biden campaign had been able to endure the never-ending rhetorical assault and keep the contest as close as surveys show it had remained until recently.\n\nDuring a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on July 20, 2024, Trump attacked both Biden and Harris, repeatedly calling Biden \"stupid\" and insulting his IQ. But Harris, Trump said, was \"crazy.\"\n\n\"I call her laughing Kamala,\" Trump told the crowd. \"You can tell a lot by a laugh. She's crazy. She's nuts.\"\n\nA former prosecutor against a convicted felon\n\nWith Biden dropping out of the campaign, political developments suggest Trump may be in for a taste of his own medicine.\n\nHarris' previous career as a U.S. senator who challenged Trump administration officials and the former president's judicial nominees demonstrates that she is among the most effective Democratic officeholders when it comes to holding Republicans accountable.\n\nHer career as an attorney general and a prosecutor also allows her to use law-and-order themes to fight back against America's first convicted felon former president.\n\nBiden's departure may provide another major opportunity for Harris to reset the character assassination narrative, as the focus on age can now boomerang against Republicans. Trump now holds the record as the oldest major-party nominee for president, and a key issue that he used against Biden is likely to be turned back toward the former president.\n\nFor voters, it promises to be a scorched-earth campaign season.\n\nStephen J.

Here's what we learned", "body": "A view of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on July 29, 2024. Nate Smallwood for NPR hide caption\n\nVoters in a handful of battleground swing states will decide whether former President Donald Trump will return to the White House or if Democrats' gamble of replacing President Biden with Vice President Harris as their nominee will keep him out.\n\nA Morning Edition team visited Pittsburgh and some of its suburbs to hear from voters in Pennsylvania about how they're feeling about the revamped race. We knocked on doors, visited local parks and attractions and even attended a family dinner.\n\nVoter turnout here in Allegheny County was critical to Biden winning the state four years ago. More people voted than in 2016 and, even in towns that Biden lost, he still picked up support that got him across the finish line.\n\nPennsylvania narrowly went for Trump in 2016, breaking its run of voting for the Democratic presidential nominee since 1992. His message resonated with working-class voters here, where the coal, steel and manufacturing industries have been in decline for decades.\n\nOn our visit, we learned that plenty of enthusiasm and support for Trump remains.\n\nWhat do his neighbors here in Moon Township think of his political sign, we ask.\n\n\"I really don't care,\" he said with a chuckle. \"I mean, as a cop, I couldn't do too much. But as I'm retired, I can do whatever I want.\"\n\nHe told us he's a registered Democrat, but that he can't stand the party anymore.\n\nHe listed off his concerns, including inflation, trans kids in sports and border security, which he linked to Harris.\n\n\"She's been [to the border] once for a drive thru. That was it,\" DeRusso said. \"What's come to our border? Nobody knows.\"\n\nSome conservatives have incorrectly claimed that Harris was assigned to be Biden's \"Border Czar.\" The vice president was tasked with examining causes of migration in 2021, primarily from Mexico and Central America.\n\nWhen it comes to Trump's felony convictions - for falsifying business records to hide a $130,000 hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels - the former police chief has concluded that Trump did nothing wrong.\n\n\"I think there should be a full investigation as to why those charges were even pursued,\" DeRusso said.\n\nTrump's conviction in New York earlier this year didn't change his view of the former president and he felt the case was unfair because of when it was tried in court.\n\n\"He was guilty, not now, he was guilty whenever he committed the crime, but nobody came after him [then],\" Shukla said.\n\nShukla spoke to us as a construction crew worked on renovations to his home, which he has lived in since 2016.\n\nHe voted for Trump that year and again in 2020, but his politics are not clear cut, he said. He's a registered Republican. But in 2008, when he became a U.S. citizen and first eligible to vote, he did so for President Barack Obama.\n\nThis election, he said he will definitely not be voting for Harris. Shukla said he was concerned that gender and race played a role in Harris' selection as vice president in 2020. That year, Biden did say he would select a woman to be his running mate but did not explicitly say that it would be a person of color.\n\nSo, we asked Shukla, does that mean he'd vote for Trump a third time? \"Ideally, I would not like to vote for Donald Trump,\" he said, adding, however, that he sees a benefit to Trump.\n\n\"Most politicians are two people. One is on the camera and the other is on the back side,\" Shukla said. \"Democrats and many Republicans, they don't show their real person. I want to see the real person. [With] Donald Trump, the advantage is that I get what I see.\"\n\nWe met her as she was helping to lay out booths for a harvest festival near Beaver Street, an area lined with trendy restaurants and shops in this affluent suburb.\n\n\"I liked [Harris] all along,\" Marco said. \"Of course, I would love to see a woman president because I was all in for Hillary Clinton.\"\n\nShe's concerned about Trump's fitness for office, the GOP's 2024 platform, the state of democracy and his seeming admiration of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nHer husband, Bob Marco, whom she described as being a little more conservative than she is, was nearby.\n\n\"Bob!\" she called and he made his way over. We asked if he would be canceling out Sylvia's vote with a vote for Trump.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he responded, chuckling, before quickly backpedaling with \"No, I'm not. No, I'm not.\"\n\n\"If he votes for Trump, he's being kicked out of the house,\" Sylvia quipped.\n\n\"I'm voting for Harris,\" he said, adding that he doesn't want a president who is a convicted felon.\n\nThere we met their grandson Jimmy Madonna, a 25-year-old working in environmental inspection and compliance in the oil and gas industry. He's the kind of newly energized voter Democrats are likely to be relieved to hear about.\n\nHe sat with us, eating a plate of halupki, a stuffed cabbage dish. He told us he's always leaned left on politics, but this year, it's been harder to get excited about the election. Though he disagrees with Trump and is concerned about Project 2025, a roadmap created by a conservative group to expand presidential authority, Biden just wasn't the candidate for him.\n\n\"If Democrats can't put up a candidate that can beat Trump and Trump becomes the president, then democracy needs to learn from that,\" Jimmy Madonna said. \"You have to beat him in an election one way or another, and whatever is produced by him the same way.\"\n\nBut Madonna said Harris stepping in as the likely new Democratic candidate made him reconsider.\n\n\"The day that Joe Biden stepped down, I went from thinking 'I might not vote in this election' to 'I'm definitely going to vote in this election, and be more involved in it,'\" Jimmy Madonna said.\n\nDilworth was out and about in the neighborhood, near Salem's, a grocery store that opened earlier this year to alleviate the area's need for fresh groceries.\n\nShe feels that Biden stepping down was the right move, but she wishes Democrats had considered other candidates. She's also worried about Harris' past as a prosecutor and her approaches to criminal justice that have drawn criticism from advocates.\n\nDilworth, who returned to live in this neighborhood to be near family after many years away, said it needs jobs, more housing and better funding for its schools and roads.\n\nDilworth said she would like to hear Harris' plans specifically for the country and Pittsburgh and see them come true. We asked if it mattered at all that Harris could become the first Black woman president. \"It doesn't matter as far as the qualifications. I want somebody who's qualified to do the job and who's going to be a candidate for the people,\" Dilworth said. \"There's good, bad and indifferent in every color and every race. So I want to see a person that really has the best hearts and minds for the people.\"\n\nBack in Moon Township, we met Runco, who had just taken her granddaughter to the playground at Moon Park, where kids played on a splash pad, volunteers walked around picking up trash and as joggers circled the park.\n\nWe spoke to Runco as she and her granddaughter watched a plane come in low for a landing at nearby Pittsburgh International Airport.\n\n\"I am a registered Republican, but I don't like the extreme right of the party,\" Runco said. \"I'm a little frightened by Project 2025 and how that will influence or is influencing the party.\"\n\nRunco spent 20 years in a Christian ministry and generally opposes abortion, but feels it is sometimes medically necessary.\n\nShe wants a moderate position on that issue and also thinks Democrats veer too far to the left. She's not a fan of what she called Trump's \"bullying\" and him calling people names, but she feels the alleged assassination attempt on him may have humbled him. She thinks he could still move back to the center, which she prefers.\n\n\"I'm right in the middle right now,\" she said of how she will vote.\n\nAnd now there's one more factor in her indecision.\n\n\"I'm concerned with Kamala, a woman, when you go up against somebody in the world like Putin and what's happening in China in some of those countries, I am concerned about that,\" Runco said. \"I don't know that it's the right time. Running the country is one thing, but international affairs is a whole 'nother issue.\"\n\nShe's not persuaded by the examples of women who have run other nations.\n\n\"Because we are such a large, powerful country. It's not like if you had a woman in a smaller country. Now, I do consider, depending on who the VP is, if it's a strong man, that there might be enough.\"", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But both parties remain largely in denial regarding the unpopular leaders they've picked. According to the RealClearPolitics average of favorability polls, Harris is just over nine points underwater with 51 percent of Americans viewing her unfavorably, and Trump is just under nine points underwater, with 53 percent of Americans viewing him unfavorably. In nominating Harris and Trump, the devoted bases of both parties have essentially extended middle fingers at each other and to a swathe of independents who view both of them unfavorably.\n\nIf you tried to engineer candidates in a lab designed to highlight rather than overcome the weaknesses of their parties, it would be hard to do better than Harris and Trump. Let's start with our ever-cackling, word-salad producing, Venn-diagram-loving vice president. A New York Times poll conducted after Biden's calamitous debate performance revealed a massive gender divide even before Harris entered the race. Biden was losing to Trump by twenty-two points with men but was still leading among women by six points. Trump also held a thirty-six-point lead with white voters who do not have a college degree. A new NYT poll, released Thursday, shows Harris with a commanding fourteen-point lead with women, and a seventeen-point deficit with men. And Trump's thirty-six-point lead over Biden with white voters without a degree has expanded to thirty-eight points with Harris now at the top of the ticket.\n\nIn a recently released CNN poll, Harris is a whopping forty-two points underwater with white voters without a college degree, with 68 percent viewing her unfavorably. Fifty-seven percent of men and 57 percent of those without a college degree also viewed her unfavorably. If the Democratic Party was serious about trying to repair its standing with white working-class voters, why clear the decks for a polarizing, San Francisco liberal like Kamala Harris? Recall that Harris likened ICE agents to the KKK during a 2018 confirmation hearing in the Senate. And she, along with other Democrats, signaled at debates in 2020 that she supported decriminalizing illegal border crossings and providing free healthcare for illegal aliens. And her tenure as Biden's \"border czar\" was a disaster. The highlight of her 2020 presidential run was calling Joe Biden a racist, but she was outed as a calculating charlatan minutes later when her campaign started flogging $29.99 \"That Little Girl Was Me\" T-shirts.\n\nThe last time she was in a competitive election, in 2010 for California attorney general, she beat her Republican opponent by less than one point. As Nate Moore at the Liberal Patriot points out, every other Democrat running for statewide office in California that year won their race by double digits. Biden effectively saddled her with DEI baggage in saying he'd pick a black woman as his running mate. And Harris already faced an undercurrent of suspicion that her career path was paved at age twenty-nine, when she had a romantic relationship with the then-sixty-year-old speaker of the California Assembly, Willie Brown, who subsequently gifted her two sinecures, netting her nearly $100,000 while raising her profile in state party politics.\n\nGiven that baggage, combined with her disastrous 2020 run for president, and persistent complaints, even from friendly news outlets, that she's a poor leader who is difficult to work for, you would think that Democrats would make her earn the party nomination based on merit. Instead, they handed it to her on a silver platter because it was \"her turn.\" Hillary Clinton was nominated on the same basis in 2016, but at least she earned the votes. Still, Harris often seems like a less substantive but equally annoying version of Hillary -- hectoring, inauthentic, and condescending.\n\nMost on the left seem not to grasp how deeply unpopular she is. Seventy-seven percent of Democrats in the CNN poll said that Harris will unite the country. Ha! That's about as likely as Trump doing so. Remember all the talk on the right of Trump 2.0 and Donald emerging from the assassination attempt as a changed man, one who could unify the country? In his first rally since Biden dropped out, Trump called Harris a \"radical-left lunatic who will destroy our country if she ever gets the chance to get into office.\" So much for Trump 2.0.\n\nAt least Trump, hyped as an existential threat to democracy, was chosen by voters in a democratic process, rather than the palace coup that resulted in Harris's ascension.\n\nI suspect that even if Trump voters knew he'd be facing Harris, rather than geriatric Biden, they'd still pick him as the party nominee. But having just gotten rid of the oldest president in American history, I'm not sure voters want to replace him with a man who will break Biden's age record if he remains in office until 2028, when he'd be eighty-two.\n\nAside from his age and his legal baggage, there's the fact that everyone in America already has a strong opinion about him and many simply do not like him. In the recent CNN poll, Trump is twenty points underwater with women and a whopping thirty-six points underwater with college graduates. The NYT poll has him twenty-two points underwater with women and shows that 54 percent have a strongly unfavorable view of him. In that poll, two-thirds of those with a degree have an unfavorable view of him, including 57 percent who have a strongly unfavorable view of him.\n\nTo his credit, Trump has turned the GOP into a working-class party, but he has no opportunity to reinvent himself and is probably the least likely Republican to succeed in winning back suburban women and college graduates. Harris now has an infusion of cash -- she raised $126 million in less than three days since Biden stood down -- and the media is already working overtime to help her reinvent herself as something other than the vacuous, incompetent liberal many perceive her as. Meanwhile, as they sell Comma La harder than time-share salespeople on commission-only pay, she reminds audiences about Roe v. Wade roughly every fifteen seconds. She'll do everything perhaps short of inviting doctors to perform abortions on stage during her rallies to drive home her primary selling point.\n\nThe candidates' best attributes may be their opponents. Trump threaded several battleground needles to pull of an electoral college win in 2016, sparing us from Hillary, but the GOP has been on a hell of a losing streak since then, with him as the party's standard bearer. And Cackling Kamala is an improvement over immemorial Joe Biden, but all the coconut tree memes in the world can't change the fact that she's a very weak candidate. The winner of this unpopularity contest is likely to be the one who turns their bases out and performs least poorly with their Achilles heels -- college-educated women for Trump and working-class men for Harris. Those who were hoping for a unity candidate from either party will have to wait till 2028 or beyond.", "source": {"uri": "thespectator.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Spectator World"},

His record of accomplishments as president is robust. \"I've given my heart and soul to my nation\" he said in a prime-time speech, but he may have given it too late.\n\nThe accolades being tossed at Biden following his decision to withdraw from the presidential campaign are misguided, as were several of his earlier actions that placed Democrats in the position they're in now -- racing against time and odds to prevent another four years of Donald Trump.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama said Biden's decision to withdraw proved that he's \"a patriot of the highest order.\" The renowned historian Jon Meacham called it, \"one of the most remarkable acts of leadership in our history.\" And so it went, in a flood of praise for Biden that seemed more designed to honor his decades of service -- and to reflect a great national sigh of relief -- than to objectively take stock of what could have been an avoidable crisis.\n\nThere is little honor in finally acknowledging an untenable situation months, perhaps years, after those around you saw it. There is nothing heroic about clinging to a presidential re-election campaign that never should have been embarked upon in the first place. And there's hardly cause for celebration when a campaign of such high consequence is stubbornly taken to the brink before the course is corrected.\n\nWhen he ran in 2020 Biden explained, \"I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else.\" He said younger politicians were \"the future of this country.\" Had he kept to what seemed like a pledge to serve a single term it would have, indeed, qualified as an act of patriotism.\n\nInstead, Biden decided to run again, declaring that he had to \"finish the job.\" To be clear: No president has ever left office with the job completely done and few would be so audacious to suggest that only they were capable of handling whatever tasks remained.\n\nJoe Biden's missteps actually began before he selected Kamala Harris as his running mate. By declaring that he would only select a woman to run as vice president, he laid the foundation for unfair criticism that Harris faces now: that she is a \"DEI\" (diversity, equity and inclusion) selection. In other words, the label Republicans are using for Harris isn't so much about her as it is about how Biden went about picking her in the first place. (Biden made the same mistake with his U.S. Supreme Court pick, Ketanji Brown Jackson, first declaring that the choice would only be a Black woman.)\n\nIt's probably worth remembering that in 2020 neither Biden nor Harris were the Democrats' best options. Harris had stumbled so badly in her early effort to get the presidential nomination that she dropped out when it became clear she wouldn't even prevail in her home state of California. Biden looked shaky on the ground in Iowa, especially when seen alongside younger, energetic campaigners that included Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and even the senior citizen Bernie Sanders. Biden lost in Iowa and New Hampshire and was going nowhere until Rep. Jim Clyburn endorsed him in South Carolina -- giving Biden that state's primary and ultimately the party's nomination.\n\nIt may well be that Biden was the best person to defeat Trump in 2020. The nation wasn't focused on youth or vigor, it was seeking wisdom and stability. But after a few grueling years in the White House Biden's age and cognitive challenges began to show. Though many Democrats claim to have been surprised by Biden's June 28 debate debacle, evidence of his struggles had been on display for months in video compilations that ran almost daily across the internet. The President and those closest to him must certainly have been among the first to recognize this, not the last.\n\nBiden and many in his party's leadership point to the 14 million votes he received in this year's primaries. That's about as meaningless as the \"voting\" that keeps returning Vladimir Putin to power. Incumbent presidents aren't meaningfully challenged within their own party unless they withdraw early enough for a legitimate primary process. That's what Lyndon Johnson did in late March of 1968; Joe Biden waited until July 21.\n\nVice President Harris insisted she wanted to \"earn\" the nomination. But due to Biden's delay, what she got was the very \"coronation\" that Democrats hoped to avoid.\n\nIf Harris wins in November, Biden's place in history will be secure and the stubbornness he displayed in the campaign will be forgotten. If she loses, her political career will be over and, sadly, the blame will rest largely with her boss.", "source": {"uri": "themoderatevoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Moderate Voice"}, "authors": [{"uri": "guest_voice@themoderatevoice.com", "name": "Guest Voice", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Meacham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jon Meacham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketanji_Brown_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ketanji Brown Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Klobuchar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amy Klobuchar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Clyburn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Clyburn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

US Vice-President Kamala Harris has emerged as the favorite candidate to receive the presidential nomination from the Democratic party. She has garnered the support from her party members. As far as her competition is concerned, Donald Trump is a formidable opponent. According to this Democratic Strategist, Harris may be losing supporters to Trump from the rust belt which fall within some of the swing states.\n\nJulian Epstein who is also the former Chief Counsel for the House Judiciary Committee made these remarks in a TV show. He said that many of the working-class members may be extending their support to Donald Trump. Separately, another survey indicated that the voters believe Trump is best suited to fix issues pertaining to the economy and employment.\n\nAccording to three major aggregate surveys conducted by the New York Times, The Hill and Real Clear Politics, Trump is leading in all these surveys. Though these leads are marginal. The Real Clear Politics survey indicated a lead over just 1.7%, The New York Times gave a lead over just 2% and The Hill indicated a lead over just 2.1%.\n\nAlso Read : Is Kim Jong Un set to transfer North Korea's leadership to his 12-yr-old daughter, Kim Ju Ae?\n\nThese leads are narrow and do not represent much. However, one would need to get into the details of the survey. Harris is supported by many of the voters who belong to the non-white communities as well as women. She is also supported by the younger population below 35. Voters in the age group of 35-54 equally support Trump and Harris. Voters above the age of 55 support Trump.\n\nAnother key section of the voters who support Trump are the working-class population and the rustbelt workers. This is negative news for Harris as a majority of these workers stay in the states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin which are known as the rustbelt states.

Here's what we learned | WITF", "body": "Voters in a handful of battleground swing states will decide whether former President Donald Trump will return to the White House or if Democrats' gamble of replacing President Biden with Vice President Harris as their nominee will keep him out.\n\nA Morning Edition team visited Pittsburgh and some of its suburbs to hear from voters in Pennsylvania about how they're feeling about the revamped race. We knocked on doors, visited local parks and attractions and even attended a family dinner.\n\nVoter turnout here in Allegheny County was critical to Biden winning the state four years ago. More people voted than in 2016 and, even in towns that Biden lost, he still picked up support that got him across the finish line.\n\nPennsylvania narrowly went for Trump in 2016, breaking its run of voting for the Democratic presidential nominee since 1992. His message resonated with working-class voters here, where the coal, steel and manufacturing industries have been in decline for decades.\n\nOn our visit, we learned that plenty of enthusiasm and support for Trump remains.\n\nWhat do his neighbors here in Moon Township think of his political sign, we ask.\n\n\"I really don't care,\" he said with a chuckle. \"I mean, as a cop, I couldn't do too much. But as I'm retired, I can do whatever I want.\"\n\nHe told us he's a registered Democrat, but that he can't stand the party anymore.\n\nHe listed off his concerns, including inflation, trans kids in sports and border security, which he linked to Harris.\n\n\"She's been [to the border] once for a drive thru. That was it,\" DeRusso said. \"What's come to our border? Nobody knows.\"\n\nSome conservatives have incorrectly claimed that Harris was assigned to be Biden's \"Border Czar.\" The vice president was tasked with examining causes of migration in 2021, primarily from Mexico and Central America.\n\nWhen it comes to Trump's felony convictions - for falsifying business records to hide a $130,000 hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels - the former police chief has concluded that Trump did nothing wrong.\n\n\"I think there should be a full investigation as to why those charges were even pursued,\" DeRusso said.\n\nTrump's conviction in New York earlier this year didn't change his view of the former president and he felt the case was unfair because of when it was tried in court.\n\n\"He was guilty, not now, he was guilty whenever he committed the crime, but nobody came after him [then],\" Shukla said.\n\nShukla spoke to us as a construction crew worked on renovations to his home, which he has lived in since 2016.\n\nHe voted for Trump that year and again in 2020, but his politics are not clear cut, he said. He's a registered Republican. But in 2008, when he became a U.S. citizen and first eligible to vote, he did so for President Barack Obama.\n\nThis election, he said he will definitely not be voting for Harris. Shukla said he was concerned that gender and race played a role in Harris' selection as vice president in 2020. That year, Biden did say he would select a woman to be his running mate but did not explicitly say that it would be a person of color.\n\nSo, we asked Shukla, does that mean he'd vote for Trump a third time? \"Ideally, I would not like to vote for Donald Trump,\" he said, adding, however, that he sees a benefit to Trump.\n\n\"Most politicians are two people. One is on the camera and the other is on the back side,\" Shukla said. \"Democrats and many Republicans, they don't show their real person. I want to see the real person. [With] Donald Trump, the advantage is that I get what I see.\"\n\nWe met her as she was helping to lay out booths for a harvest festival near Beaver Street, an area lined with trendy restaurants and shops in this affluent suburb.\n\n\"I liked [Harris] all along,\" Marco said. \"Of course, I would love to see a woman president because I was all in for Hillary Clinton.\"\n\nShe's concerned about Trump's fitness for office, the GOP's 2024 platform, the state of democracy and his seeming admiration of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nHer husband, Bob Marco, whom she described as being a little more conservative than she is, was nearby.\n\n\"Bob!\" she called and he made his way over. We asked if he would be canceling out Sylvia's vote with a vote for Trump.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he responded, chuckling, before quickly backpedaling with \"No, I'm not. No, I'm not.\"\n\n\"If he votes for Trump, he's being kicked out of the house,\" Sylvia quipped.\n\n\"I'm voting for Harris,\" he said, adding that he doesn't want a president who is a convicted felon.\n\nThere we met their grandson Jimmy Madonna, a 25-year-old working in environmental inspection and compliance in the oil and gas industry. He's the kind of newly energized voter Democrats are likely to be relieved to hear about.\n\nHe sat with us, eating a plate of halupki, a stuffed cabbage dish. He told us he's always leaned left on politics, but this year, it's been harder to get excited about the election. Though he disagrees with Trump and is concerned about Project 2025, a roadmap created by a conservative group to expand presidential authority, Biden just wasn't the candidate for him.\n\n\"If Democrats can't put up a candidate that can beat Trump and Trump becomes the president, then democracy needs to learn from that,\" Jimmy Madonna said. \"You have to beat him in an election one way or another, and whatever is produced by him the same way.\"", "source": {"uri": "witf.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WITF"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

So much for the myth of Obama as the silent arbiter -- the final voice, so to speak -- of the Democrat Party. So much for the myth of Barack and Michelle Obama as the demigods -- more like demagogues -- of Democrat politics, because their phone call to Harris sounded as sincere and spontaneous as a coerced confession.\n\nThe call was a concession. The drama between Obama and Biden, of the former pushing the latter aside, ended with the anointment of Harris. By the time Obama called Harris, his time -- the time necessary to back another candidate -- had passed. By the time Obama \"endorsed\" Harris, all other Democrats and donors had spoken.\n\nWith Biden still in the White House, Obama is out of time and out of luck. The ex-president lost to a man who was his second-in-command, who is in command of nothing. The country lost, the country is at a loss, as we do not have a commander in chief.\n\nBetween an attempt on the life of our next president, Donald Trump, and the attempt to install Kamala Harris as president, between the incompetence of the director of the Secret Service and the incompetents occupying the White House, we do not need more drama.\n\nWe recognize the stories about Obama's purported genius, about his shrewdness as a politician and his sharpness as a leader, for what they are: lies.\n\nWe reject the lies about Joe Biden's purported wisdom, about his selflessness as a man and his sacrifice as an American. We reject the propaganda of the Democrat Party, because we know Biden is unfit to be president and Kamala Harris is unqualified to be the acting president. We know the whole thing is an act.\n\nWe believe Harris stands for nothing, that she has no principles or beliefs of her own, because she is an accidental nominee and an average (at best) politician. We do not, however, underestimate the resources at her disposal.\n\nBecause she has a wealth of campaign money and an endless supply of free media, because the two complement each other, because the two are one and the same, because she is the face of the most powerful propaganda force in the world, we know the resources Harris will use against us.\n\nBecause of what we have seen in the last four weeks, never mind the last four years, we know how far Democrats will go to eliminate President Trump. Because of their addiction to power, because they will do anything to feed their addiction, we know Democrats have the self-control of Hunter Biden and the self-awareness of Joe Biden.\n\nAnd while \"Doctor\" Jill Biden sees things differently, we stand by our diagnosis. We diagnose the Biden White House as dysfunctional and the Democrat Party as delusional. The two are responsible for the rise of Kamala Harris.\n\nAnd now, in spite of calls for unity and the Obamas' phone call for the same, Democrats are desperate.\n\nBecause they are desperate to stay in power, because Joe Biden refuses to leave the White House and Kamala Harris refuses to let Democrats pick someone else to run for the White House, the party is out of control. The Democrat Party is dangerous.\n\nDo not underestimate how ruthless the party is, because the Obamas and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will say anything to possess power; they will do anything, they have done too much already, to retain power; they will do anything not to relinquish or transfer power.\n\nSo, do not mistake words of unity for evidence of unity, because the only thing that unites Democrats -- the only feeling that inspires Democrats -- is their hatred of President Trump. The only thing we know Democrats will do between now and Election Day is attack President Trump.\n\nOnly by calling attention to the truth about a phone call between Democrats, only by reminding voters that the Obamas and the Bidens are not allies but frenemies, can we show how desperate Democrats are. Only by showing how desperate Democrats are to deny President Trump the White House can we show how fast they are to deny that anything is wrong at the White House.", "source": {"uri": "amgreatness.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Greatness"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_gruber@amgreatness.com", "name": "Steve Gruber", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democrat_Party_(Thailand)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democrat Party (Thailand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arbitration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagogue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Demagogue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acting president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commander-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.amgreatness.com/app/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1239765945.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773409", "eventUri": "eng-9773409", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

We are facing a machine that has been grinding away for decades. \"We're not running against a candidate,\" said Vivek Ramaswamy. \"We're running against a system.\"\n\nThe machine seeks to replace our republic with a dictatorship under the control of the Deep State and the Democrats (one and the same). The initial stooge for this cabal was Barack Obama, who presided over the first attempt by a sitting president to take America down. The socialist Left, said Steve Baldwin in Western Journalism, believed that the Obama era was the best opportunity to transform America to a socialist-based economy. We enjoyed a four-year respite when Donald Trump was elected, but then the Left found their second stooge in Joe Biden.\n\nJoe immediately reversed the benefits of the Trump administration and, as Obama 2.0, set the U.S. back on a course of economic and social ruin. When Joe's mind went on permanent vacation after three and a half years, the Democrats had to get rid of him, but that was okay because they had already planted the biggest stooge yet in the form of Vice President Kamala Harris. \"The real powers that be,\" said Elon Musk, \"are discarding the old puppet in favor of one that has a better chance of fooling the public.\"\n\nHarris is a DEI plant. She was selected as Biden's VP based solely on gender and race, not for talent and competence. She is living proof that meritocracy has given way to diversity.\n\nFor most of Joe Biden's presidency, Kamala lurked quietly in the background. No one took her seriously, especially when listening to her speak. Harris has been described as someone giving a book report on a book she hasn't read. When Joe announced he will not run for re-election, we were awakened from our slumber with the very real possibility that this cackling public fool could become the 47th president of the United States. \"This woman would be in charge of the most powerful nuclear arsenal on earth,\" said Douglas Murray. \"The image of her cackling manically while saying nonsense, with her finger on the nuclear button, is just too much.\"\n\nHarris began her career in local San Francisco politics by leveraging her affair with the married mayor, Willie Brown. After racking up a questionable record as a prosecutor, she wormed her way into the U.S. Senate. Her only claim to fame as a senator was her despicable treatment of Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court. Based on notoriety from that fiasco, she campaigned for the presidency. Democrat Party voters, recognizing that she is nothing more than a mendacious, unprincipled opportunist, relegated Harris to the bottom of the pile and ended her presidential aspirations -- but not for long. In a sort of magician's hat trick, Harris managed to land on the ballot as Biden's pick for VP.\n\nWhy was she picked? She appealed to the Left as someone they could control in case Biden fell out a window. Ideologically, said Mark Levin, Kamala \"is farther left than 97 percent of the Democrats, the most extreme radical politician ever to run for high office in the United States of America.\" Harris has endorsed the Green New Deal, eliminating automobiles and fossil fuels, higher taxes, income redistribution, defunding and disbanding the police, repealing the First and Second Amendments, and socialism. During the 2020 riots, Harris did nothing to uphold the rule of law. On the contrary -- she raised money to defend the rioters. \"There's a bevy of quotes that she has given,\" said Ari Fleisher, \"that show just how out of touch she is with mainstream America.\"\n\nKamala has accomplished nothing of value during her tenure as vice president. \"I'll put my record up against Trump's any day of the week,\" she bragged. What record? She shares responsibility for the atrocious Biden/Harris administration, especially allowing millions of illegals to threaten local communities around the country. \"Many people believe that the border invasion has been planned and organized by the Biden/Harris administration,\" said Becky Noble at RedState. When Biden appointed Kamala as the \"border czar,\" she accomplished nothing except keeping the border wide open. Harris admits she is against immigration control. \"If you believe in border security,\" said Tom Homan, former Acting ICE Director, \"Kamala Harris being president is our worst nightmare.\"\n\nTo deflect against the avalanche of negatives, the media are attempting to whitewash Kamala's image. \"Some of the media's largest players are proving their newfound devotion to Harris by attempting to rewrite her past -- and some of their own coverage,\" Ingrid Jacques reported in USA Today. \"The current presidency is a failed presidency,\" said Mollie Hemingway, \"and Kamala Harris is the current vice president and so they are working so hard to say that she had nothing to do with the failed economy, with the failed border, with the failed foreign policy. What they're saying therefore is that she did nothing while the country burned.\"\n\nThe media want the public to believe that Harris never served as \"border czar,\" despite abundant proof to the contrary. \"Yes, it's as Orwellian as it sounds,\" said Jacques. \"And it's a little too close to the tactics used by the Soviets to simply 'erase' opponents from photographs. Don't like someone or something that happened? Hit delete.\"\n\n\"The obvious question for the media,\" said Becky Noble, \"would be: If her record is so stellar, why the need to sanitize it? The answer is, of course, because it isn't, and they know it. The thought of her being in charge is terrifying.\"\n\nCan Kamala win? \"The big problem for Democrats,\" said Josh Hammer at Newsweek, \"is that Harris is not an unknown commodity. On the contrary, she is a very well-known commodity -- one who just happens to be about as popular with the American public as venereal disease. An NBC News poll last June found her to be the single least popular vice president in American history -- only 32% of Americans had a positive view of her. And as recently as a month or two ago, Democratic elites were openly discussing whether she could still be dropped as Biden's 2024 running mate. It's funny how quickly one can go from the weakest link to the great savior of 'Our Democracy.'\"\n\nIs Kamala smart enough to perceive her own shortcomings and how much of a liar she is? My answer: She is too dumb to realize that she is a stooge of the Left, and if she did realize it, she probably wouldn't care. It's all about power, baby.", "source": {"uri": "americanthinker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Thinker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They are deep into reinventing the presumptive Democrat nominee, lying about her background, removing damaging evidence of her hard-core leftism and presenting to the world, like a proud mom showing off her newborn, a fresh and unsullied face.\n\nIntroducing Immaculate Kamala, an entirely fabricated creation of the left-wing media.\n\nConfused voters must be wondering: why has Kamala Harris been judged one of the most unpopular vice presidents in history? How is it that Democrat kingmakers reportedly conspired for months to eject her from the ticket?\n\nThe liberal media is good at this, and have turned the political conversation on its head in just a few weeks. It seems like yesterday that Donald Trump was cruising to victory in November - some were talking\"landslide.\" The disastrous debate which revealed Joe Biden's incapacity, the attempt on the former president's life, his brave response and a stunningly effective convention showed the GOP united, for once, and poised to clobber the incumbent.\n\nHARRIS CLAIMS BIDEN FIT TO CONTINUE IN OFFICE, DESPITE MORE THAN 80 DOCUMENTED ENCOUNTERS IN PAST YEAR\n\nBut now we read the polls are tightening, Harris is hauling in big campaign bucks, rebuilding the Obama coalition, and strengthening her grip on young, female and minority voters. We also read that Republicans are distorting her record. Voters disgusted by the failures of the Biden-Harris administration over the past three and a half years are being told their judgment (and recollections) about Harris are wrong, that she had little influence over decision-making in the White House.\n\nDon't believe it. The New York Times, et al. may be doing their darndest to polish up Kamala Harris, but voters are not fooled. The vice president still earns deeply negative favorability ratings, worse than Donald Trump's. The Real Clear Politics average of polls show 42% of respondents view Harris positively, while 50% give her an unfavorable rating. True, those numbers have improved in recent weeks, thanks to the massive outpouring of flattering press, but they are still (slightly) worse than those earned by Donald Trump, invariably dubbed \"wildly unpopular\" by the left-wing media.\n\nSome of the air-brushing is downright funny. The New York Times just published a piece about Kamala's laugh, the notorious cackle that rivals nails on a chalkboard. The author, Jason Zinoman, dismisses the carping about Kamala's laugh, writing, \"This rests on a common misunderstanding that laughter is primarily a response to something funny.\" Hmmm.\n\nThe Times' \"comedy critic\" concludes that \"far from a liability\" the laugh is \"one of her most effective weapons.\"\n\nBRACE YOURSELF, AMERICA. WITH KAMALA HARRIS, DEMOCRATS ARE ABOUT TO PUT ON AN INCREDIBLE SHOW\n\nTell that to NBC's Lester Holt, who asked Harris whether she had visited the border and elicited hilarity instead of explanations from the clueless vice president. The clip of that damning interview is one of the most watched episodes in Harris' career; the laugh is what tells us she is not a serious person.\n\nk\n\nOf course, Zinoman ultimately falls back on the charge that criticizing Harris' cringe-making guffaws is sexist. Expect that to be the rallying cry in coming months: critical comments about Harris are sexist or racist, or likely both.\n\nAnother Times piece, titled \"Here's What Global Leaders Say About Kamala Harris\" reveals the cleverness of the liberal media's reinvention efforts. The lead-in reads, \"Heads of state and diplomats who have interacted with the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee say she uses humor, and talk of food, to help leaven hard discussions.\" This is so utterly perfect: Harris is portrayed as likable, approachable (she talks about food---just like any woman!) but steely underneath - ready to take a tough line with foreign leaders. The reality - buried deep in the piece, is that \"Ms. Harris did not emerge as a key point person for global leaders.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg delivered a podcast recently saying it was a \"bad look\" for Republicans who criticize Kamala Harris as a DEI hire, and also \"unimaginative.\" He's right. Harris can be attacked on many fronts, and not just that she is a lightweight who was added to Joe Biden's ticket because she was female and Black.\n\nHarris should be attacked for being a San Francisco progressive who supports full-term abortion on demand and advocates decriminalizing illegal immigration, a deceitful politician who lied to the American people about Joe Biden's health and mental acuity and panders to Hamas terrorists in a sickening effort to win Muslim votes in Michigan. She should be called on her support for the George Floyd rioters, her determination to ban fracking and offshore drilling and her enthusiasm for Joe Biden's ever-expanding welfare state.\n\nMost importantly, she has been a hands-on member of the Biden-Harris administration, which has earned the lowest marks of any White House in modern times.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nKamala Harris was right beside Joe when he signed off on trillions of dollars in excess government spending, which ignited inflation and drove down our standard of living. She was, by her own telling, the last person in the room and 100% on board when Joe decided to pull the plug on our engagement in Afghanistan, leading to one of the most humiliating chapters in this country's history. And she was - absolutely -- the \"border czar\" who allowed more than 10 million people to flood across our border illegally.\n\nThese issues will decide the November election in Donald Trump's favor. The left-leaning media will do everything possible to shield the real Kamala Harris, but Americans will decide: do they really want four more years of Biden-Harris?", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com",

Voters are equally divided about Trump, with 50 percent viewing him as unfavorable and 49 percent viewing him as favorable, but more voters think Trump is \"strongly\" favorable, 33 percent, than the 23 percent who said had the same view about Vance.\n\n\"Vance's launch has been uneven,\" Wagner told Newsweek. \"But it is probably a bit early to judge the impact by November. But, certainly the polling, including our own, suggest there are areas of concern.\"\n\nNew reports suggest that a number of Republicans are second-guessing Trump's decision to tap Vance as his running mate, wondering if the former president ignored his political advisers to pick a candidate that was favored by his son, Don Jr., and former Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson.\n\nTrump announced earlier this month at the Republican National Convention that he had selected Vance as his VP. The Ohio Republican, who turns 40 on Friday, had been expected to help attract more young voters to the top of a GOP ticket that features a 78-year-old presidential candidate.\n\nIf Trump wins a second White House term, Vance would be the third youngest vice presidential candidate in history, behind John C. Breckinridge, who was 36 when he was inaugurated, and Richard Nixon, who had just turned 40 before his inauguration. A Trump-Vance victory would also mean the inauguration of the oldest president in history. At 78, Trump would surpass President Joe Biden's record. Biden was also 78 at the time of his inauguration, but Trump would be 159 days older than Biden at the time of a 2025 inauguration.\n\n\"Generally, the VP pick is used to shore up a geographic area or part of the party base. Sometimes, the VP is used to appeal to a competitive demographic. It's usually helpful when the VP can appeal to voters that are not otherwise being reached effectively by the top of the ticket,\" Wagner said.\n\nBut the optimism about a Trump-Vance ticket has become muddied by President Joe Biden's decision to drop out of the presidential race and endorse Harris as the Democratic nominee instead. The emergence of 59-year-old presidential candidate has shifted the focus of the election and a string of controversial remarks has put Vance on the defensive.\n\nHis first week as the Republican VP nominee was dominated by bipartisan criticisms over resurfaced comments where he referred to Harris, among other Democrats, as \"childless cat ladies,\" a quip that many warned would not play well with female voters.\n\nHarris is already polling better than Trump among women. The new FAU survey shows the Democrat with a seven-point advantage over the former president among that demographic. The poll found Trump and Harris Harris in a dead heat overall, tied at 46 percent. Harris also has a strong lead among Black and Hispanic voters, polling ahead of Trump by 45 points 17 points, respectively.\n\nHarris also appeared to be more popular than both Republicans, with 53 percent of voters describing her as favorable and 44 percent viewing her as unfavorable.\n\nHarris emergence as the next Democratic nominee has also changed the emotions of many voters.\n\nWhile once frustrated and angry about November's election, 80 percent of Democratic voters now report being happy, compared with 61 percent of Republican voters who feel the same way. Only 20 percent of GOP voters said they felt positively about the shakeup on the top of the Democratic ticket, while more than half, 53 percent, reported negative feelings and 32 percent describing \"fear\" as the most prevalent emotion.\n\n\"As the data show, emotions play a pivotal role in shaping voter behavior and engagement,\" Carol Bishop Mills, co-director of the PolCom Lab, said. \"The significant positive sentiment among Democrats and minority voters toward Harris' candidacy reverses some feelings of frustration and disconnectedness with Biden's candidacy, while the heightened negative emotions among Republicans highlight the polarized nature of the current political climate.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katherine_fung@newsweek.com", "name": "Katherine Fung", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inauguration of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Atlantic_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Atlantic University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inauguration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Breckinridge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John C.

JD Vance, 39, as his own running mate -- with the pair focusing largely on Biden's economic record and on Harris' performance as Biden's designated point person to reduce illegal immigration, which instead surged to new record highs.\n\nTrump has pledged to eliminate federal taxes on tips and to lower inflation and interest rates if he wins on Nov. 5, though Democrats argue his plans for new

Shortly thereafter, another post appeared that said he endorsed his DEI hire Kamala Harris as his successor. It is more than a little strange that Biden made no appearance on television to announce these momentous news items. It would not be surprising to find out that he is as yet unaware of them.\n\nBut assuming the posts are indeed authentic, the question arises, would Kamala Harris make a good president? It is clear that she would not.\n\nAs the great Murray Rothbard has taught us, war and peace is the key issue of our time. Harris has revealed an abysmal ignorance on this subject. \"During an appearance on the syndicated \"Morning Hustle\" radio program, Harris was asked by co-host Headkrack to explain the conflict 'in layman's terms for people who don't understand what's going on and how can this directly affect the people of the United States?'\n\nSpeaking slowly, Harris began, 'So, Ukraine is a country in Europe.'\n\n'It exists next to another country called Russia,' she continued. 'Russia is a bigger country. Russia is a powerful country. Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine. So, basically, that's wrong, and it goes against everything that we stand for.'\"\n\nThis was no one-time slip. Harris is appallingly ignorant of the geography of Eastern Europe. On a trip to Poland in March 2022, she said: \"I am here, standing here on the northern flank -- on the eastern flank talking about what we have in terms of the eastern flank and our NATO Allies and what is at stake at this very moment. What is at stake this very moment are some of the guiding principles around the NATO Alliance and, in particular, the issue and the importance of defending sovereignty and territorial integrity, in this case, of Ukraine.\"\n\nDo we want such a complete ignoramus to be our president? The question answers itself.\n\nIf you want to know what someone is really like, one good way to find out is to ask those who work with him. Is the person mean and overbearing? That is likely to be the person's real personality. Harris's staffers report her to be exactly that, and she is incompetent to boot. According to a story that was published in Politico in June 2021, \"While much of the ire is aimed at Harris' chief, two administration officials said the VP herself also bears responsibility for the way her office is run. 'It all starts at the top,' said one of the administration officials, who like others requested anonymity to be able to speak candidly about a sensitive matter. 'People are thrown under the bus from the very top, there are short fuses and it's an abusive environment,' said another person with direct knowledge of how Harris' office is run. 'It's not a healthy environment and people often feel mistreated. It's not a place where people feel supported but a place where people feel treated like s -- .'\" See this.\n\nFor now, at any rate, the leading Democrats are boosting Harris as a great candidate, although I predict this will soon come to an end. But shortly before the Biden debate \"crisis,\" they were telling a different story. They were saying that she was a grave liability to the ticket. Because of Biden's advanced age, she might become the next president, and people didn't want her. Keeping her on the ticket might drag Biden down to defeat. A story in the New York Times in March 2023 reported: \"But the painful reality for Ms. Harris is that in private conversations over the last few months, dozens of Democrats in the White House, on Capitol Hill and around the nation -- including some who helped put her on the party's 2020 ticket -- said she had not risen to the challenge of proving herself as a future leader of the party, much less the country. Even some Democrats whom her own advisers referred reporters to for supportive quotes confided privately that they had lost hope in her. Through much of the fall, a quiet panic set in among key Democrats about what would happen if President Biden opted not to run for a second term. Most Democrats interviewed, who insisted on anonymity to avoid alienating the White House, said flatly that they did not think Ms. Harris could win the presidency in 2024. Some said the party's biggest challenge would be finding a way to sideline her without inflaming key Democratic constituencies that would take offense. Now with Mr. Biden appearing all but certain to run again, the concern over Ms. Harris has shifted to whether she will be a political liability for the ticket. Given that Mr. Biden at 80 is already the oldest president in American history, Republicans would most likely make Ms. Harris, who is 58, a prime attack line, arguing that a vote for Mr. Biden may in fact be a vote to put her in the Oval Office. 'That will be in my opinion one of the most hard-hitting arguments against Biden,' said John Morgan, a prominent fund-raiser for Democrats, including Mr. Biden, and a former Florida finance chairman for President Bill Clinton. 'It doesn't take a genius to say, 'Look, with his age, we have to really think about this.'\" See this.\n\nOpinions differ on whether abortion should be legal -- in my opinion, this should be left up to the states. But there can be no doubt that abortion is morally wrong. Even brain-dead \"President\" Biden is on record as saying that he doesn't like abortion. But Harris is different. She likes abortion: \"Beginning in late 2023, Harris has embarked on a national tour to highlight the threats to reproductive rights posed by a second Trump administration - an issue that Biden has been criticized for shying away from. Biden has defended Roe v Wade, but has said he is 'not big on abortion'. 'As a woman on the ticket and the first woman VP and a woman of color, and then secondly, as an AG, she is strongest when her profile is fighting and prosecuting the case. People really like her in that mode,' Celinda Lake, a Democratic party strategist and a lead pollster on the 2020 Biden campaign, told the Guardian in March. 'She's so comfortable saying the word 'abortion'. She's so comfortable leaning in and speaking to the repercussions.'\" See this.\n\nHarris likes to complain that she has been discriminated against because she's black, but in reality she has again and again benefited from \"affirmative action\" polices. Mises Institute President Tom DiLorenzo aptly sums up: \"Poor Comrade Commie-la. Her career has suffered so, so much because of her dark skin. Just like Obama. Her slave-owning Jamaican ancestors would be so disappointed. Her (retired) Marxist professor father would understand, however. Like father, like daughter. UPDATE: Robert R. writes that the best nickname he's heard for Commie-la is 'Pol Pot in a pantsuit.' Others have suggested \"Polly Pot in a pantsuit\" and 'Paula Pot in a pantsuit.' See here.\n\nKamala Harris would make a very poor president indeed.

Brian Kemp (R-GA), will join Harris at 7 p.m. Eastern time along with Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens, Sens. Raphael Warnock (D-GA) and Jon Ossoff (D-GA) and rapper Megan Thee Stallion, among others. It will be Harris's 15th visit to the Peach State since taking office.\n\nAfter serving for years in the state legislature, Abrams became a star in Democratic circles when she filed lawsuits over the 2018 Georgia governor's race results and even drew buzz as a vice presidential candidate, a job that ultimately went to Harris, but has been relatively quiet since a 2022 rematch with Kemp, which she lost by nearly 300,000 votes.\n\n\"I'm not sure why she is not saying as much as she used to,\" Spelman College professor Marilyn Davis recently told the Washington Examiner. \"It could be that it would galvanize more Trump voters in the state of Georgia. But this is, of course, a national effort that she has, but recently, say within maybe three weeks ago, she is going all out to bring together organizations that have the same goal as when John Lewis had the voter project back in the 1960s and '70s.\"\n\nAbrams is now the endowed chairwoman for race and black politics at Washington, D.C.'s, Howard University and and is working for a group looking to crack down on gas stoves, so she may be spending less time in Georgia these days. Even so, she's respected as a political organizer who can help drive turnout in her home state, argues Charles Bullock, a University of Georgia political science professor.\n\n\"If she can crank up the get-out-the-vote effort she operated in 2020, that could be very important for Harris's prospects in the state,\" Bullock said. \"That gets her people back up and mobilized.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump leads Harris in Georgia by 4.5 points in the RealClearPolitics polling average, but the two polls taken since she replaced President Joe Biden on the Democratic ticket have Trump up by only one or two points, suggesting a much closer race than before.\n\nThere's little doubt that Abrams' star power has fallen since 2020, when she drew mentions as a vice presidential candidate. Her claims of a stolen election have caused awkward questions for Democrats since Trump began claiming his own 2020 race was rigged, and her Fair Fight Action group has been laying off staff in the midst of significant debt.\n\nAs such, some politicos argue the rally spot could be an even bigger opportunity for Abrams than it is for Harris.\n\n\"I'm sure that the Harris ticket is a way to try and resurrect herself from the politically dead,\" said former Georgia Republican Rep. Bob Barr. \"She had basically faded into irrelevance after her losses and all of the money that she wasted. So this gives her an opportunity.\"\n\nStill, Barr added that he thinks Georgia Democrats have done a better job of getting their voters to the polls in recent election cycles than Georgia Republicans have.\n\n\"Hopefully, the Republicans have learned from the last couple of cycles that they need to do a better job of identifying voters, registering voters, and getting them to the polls,\" he said.\n\nBiden won Georgia in 2020 by a margin of just 11,779 votes, or 0.23%.\n\nWhile Harris is expected to help connect with and drive turnout among Georgia's nonwhite voters, Bullock, who has been at UGA since 1968, said it's actually a different demographic group who may decide the state's election.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"White, college-educated voters,\" he said. \"Looking again at those recent contests, those last couple of cycles, if Democrats can get 40% of the white, college-educated vote, they can win. They don't need a majority, but they need about 40%.\"\n\nTrump and his running mate, the embattled Sen. J.D.

Before joining Raw Story, he wrote for Shareblue and AlterNet, specializing in election and policy coverage.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris long suffered from poor approval ratings and a general lack of interest from the public. But in just a couple of weeks, with her as the presumptive presidential nominee for the Democratic Party she has totally turned that around, and it's reflected in the data, Aaron Blake wrote for The Washington Post on Monday.\n\n\"A long-unpopular vice president has gotten a second look from voters now that the spotlight is trained on her. And at least for now, the polls suggest that Americans are both warming to her and liking her significantly more than they like Biden,\" wrote Blake. \"Multiple polls in recent days tell that tale.\"\n\nA new ABC News/Ipsos poll, for example, puts Harris at 43 percent favorable -- an eight-point jump from the previous month, but also, just as importantly, 11 points higher than President Joe Biden was in the last poll. A new Wall Street Journal poll shows her at 46 points. And perhaps most dramatic, Morning Consult shows her jumping 12 points to an outright majority favorable rating.\n\nRead also: Trump spews late night attack on Harris as polls show her gaining in swing states\n\nA new NYT/Siena poll has even further data that shows good news for Harris, wrote Blake.\n\n\"While just 74 percent of Biden 2020 voters liked him, 88 percent of Biden 2020 voters liked Harris. And the poll showed her being viewed favorably by about twice as many people who didn't vote in 2020 (46 percent vs. 24 percent) and who currently support a candidate besides her, Donald Trump or Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (33 percent vs. 17 percent).\"\n\nThis would be essential to consolidating the coalition that beat Trump last time.\n\nThe election is by no means assured for Democrats, Blake cautioned, as Trump's favorable numbers aren't much different and head-to-head polls show a close race. But this puts Democrats in a much better position than they were when Biden dropped his re-election bid.\n\n\"Democrats looked like they were going to have to win lots of voters who didn't like Biden and who didn't seem to have much reason to vote blue, beyond dislike of Trump,\" he concluded. \"Many of those voters today see a more viable option in Harris.\"", "source": {"uri": "rawstory.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Raw Story"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlterNet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AlterNet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rensselaer_Polytechnic_Institute", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Marcos,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Marcos, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Marcos, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsos", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ipsos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Consult", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morning Consult"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

This survey has all the answers", "body": "A survey which was conducted found that a former president may have had a role in convincing Joe Biden to end his election campaign. Vice-President Kamala Harris is now all set to receive the presidential nomination from the Democratic party. Joe Biden has taken a decision to end his election campaign. This was not before considerable pressure was applied on him. His decline had begun after the first presidential debate. Since this debate, many of the law makers from within his party had voiced their concerns against Biden's nomination.\n\nWhile these law makers had expressed their dissent, many people are questioning as to who had finally convinced Biden to end his election campaign. A recent survey conducted by The Democracy Institute and the Daily Express US have revealed what the electorate thinks on the issue. Biden has ended his election campaign and endorsed Kamala Harris. Former US President Barack Obama has endorsed Harris but took his time before this endorsement.\n\nThe survey which recorded the responses provided by 1200 voters said that 36% believed that former Barack Obama may have influenced Biden's decision.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hilary Clinton too may have had a role, according to 17% of the respondents. Her husband Bill Clinton who is also the former US President and donors to the party may have also had a role with 15% of the respondents believe the same. 5% believe that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had role whereas 4% also believe that Dr Jill Biden had role in ending her husband's campaign team.\n\n8% of the respondent believe that the vice-president who is also the presumptive presidential nominee of the Democratic party may have had a role in convincing Biden to end his election campaign.\n\nMany respondents believe that the former president played a critical role in convincing Biden to end his campaign. Biden had served as his deputy and he had various national surveys to convince Biden.\n\nThe former president had also taken his time to endorse Kamala Harris.

Brian Kemp (R-GA), will join Harris at 7 p.m. Eastern time along with Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens, Sens. Raphael Warnock (D-GA) and Jon Ossoff (D-GA) and rapper Megan Thee Stallion, among others. It will be Harris's 15th visit to the Peach State since taking office.\n\nAfter serving for years in the state legislature, Abrams became a star in Democratic circles when she filed lawsuits over the 2018 Georgia governor's race results and even drew buzz as a vice presidential candidate -- a job that ultimately went to Harris -- but has been relatively quiet since a 2022 rematch with Kemp, which she lost by nearly 300,000 votes.\n\n\"I'm not sure why she is not saying as much as she used to,\" Spelman College professor Marilyn Davis recently told the Washington Examiner. \"It could be that it would galvanize more Trump voters in the state of Georgia. But this is, of course, a national effort that she has, but recently, say within maybe three weeks ago, she is going all out to bring together organizations that have the same goal as when John Lewis had the voter project back in the 1960s and '70s.\"\n\nAbrams is now the endowed chairwoman for race and black politics at Washington D.C.'s Howard University and working for a group looking to crack down on gas stoves, so she may be spending less time in Georgia these days. Even so, she's respected as a political organizer who can help drive turnout in her home state, argues longtime University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock.\n\n\"If she can crank up the get-out-the-vote effort she operated in 2020, that could be very important for Harris's prospects in the state,\" Bullock said. \"That gets her people back up and mobilized.\"\n\nTrump leads Harris in Georgia by 4.5 points in the RealClearPolitics polling average, but the two polls taken since she replaced Biden on the Democratic ticket have Trump up by only one or two points, suggesting a much closer race than before.\n\nThere's little doubt that Abrams' star power has fallen since 2020, when she drew mentions as a vice presidential candidate. Her claims of a stolen election have caused awkward questions for Democrats since Trump began claiming his own 2020 race was rigged, and her Fair Fight Action group has been laying off staff in the midst of significant debt.\n\nAs such, some politicos argue the rally spot could be an even bigger opportunity for Abrams than it is for Harris.\n\n\"I'm sure that the Harris ticket is a way to try and resurrect herself from the politically dead,\" said former Georgia Republican congressman Bob Barr. \"She had basically faded into irrelevance after her losses and all of the money that she wasted. So this gives her an opportunity.\"\n\nStill, Barr added that he thinks Georgia Democrats have done a better job in recent election cycles of getting their voters to the polls than Georgia Republicans have.\n\n\"Hopefully the Republicans have learned from the last couple of cycles that they need to do a better job of identifying voters, registering voters, and getting them to the polls,\" he said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden won Georgia in 2020 by a margin of just 11,779 votes, or 0.23%.\n\nWhile Harris is expected to help connect with and drive turnout among Georgia's nonwhite voters, Bullock, who has been at UGA since 1968, said it's actually a different demographic group who may decide the state's election.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"White, college-educated voters,\" he said. \"Looking again at those recent contests, those last couple of cycles, if Democrats can get 40% of the white, college-educated vote, they can win.

Here's what we learned", "body": "For more politics coverage and analysis, sign up for Here's the Deal, our weekly politics newsletter, here.\n\nLast month, roughly a century ago in political time, we began talking with readers and voters who were discontented, or unhappy with the choices on the presidential ballot.\n\nWe received a written waterfall of insight. Thousands of voters who were undecided or unsure about their decision for 2024 sent us their thoughts.\n\nThen, everything changed. Gunshots at a Pennsylvania campaign rally shocked the country and raised a new image of former President Donald Trump. Eight days later, a statement from President Joe Biden stunned, as he dropped out of the 2024 race.\n\nIt's only been a week since the 2024 race for the White House was upended, but it's already entering the final countdown with fewer than 100 days until Election Day. Lisa Desjardins reports.\n\nHow did those events affect voters? Especially those core voters who were the least happy and who might have the most influence on the election?\n\nWe have some answers, with a snapshot of the same voters before -- and after -- this wild ride of history.\n\nThese folks, who we're calling the \"deciders,\" were deeply unhappy a month ago. Where are they now? Read on.\n\n'Increasingly hopeful'\n\nBen Bryant, 74\n\nRetired lighting designer. Seattle\n\nDemocrat\n\nNow: All in on Kamala Harris\n\nBack in June, Bryant described himself as \"frustrated and scared\" thinking about a Biden-Trump rematch. He was begrudgingly ready to vote for Biden. But, he told us, \"I would really like to be able to vote for someone who's younger. The president is often seen as a figurehead. And Joe Biden, the optics are just not very good.\"\n\nNow, Bryant told us yesterday he is \"increasingly hopeful\" that Democrats can win and that he is,\"all in for Harris.\" He would have preferred a ticket with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg but he is firmly backing Harris. He remains unhappy about the lack of conversation over climate change and deeper issues in American life. But overall, Ben's tone and optimism have clearly changed for the positive.\n\nPlans to unhappily vote\n\nJessica Dalton, 44\n\nWorks in marketing. Salt Lake City\n\nRegistered Republican but does not vote by party\n\nNow: Voting Harris, though she's still dissatisfied\n\nIn June, Dalton said she was \"frustrated and dissatisfied.\" She wanted a leader who speaks to moderates, like Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah. She had hoped Biden could do that but ultimately concluded that she was \"ready for more change than Joe Biden is ready, willing or able to offer.\" Despite that, she was planning to unhappily vote for Biden. To her, Trump is a \"self-appointed dictator\" who she could not consider as a candidate.\n\nNow, Dalton plans to be a Harris voter but she is not happy about the circumstance. \"I'm dissatisfied with how our Democrat nominee came to be,\" she wrote us. \"It hasn't escaped my attention that the primary process has been circumvented completely. I'm irritated that the conversation about Biden's candidacy took place NOW instead of two years ago.\" She is also worried that party politics are likely to give rise to sexism, racism and classism.\n\nA notable shift\n\nAna Fernandez, 20\n\nAbout to start law school. Miami\n\nDemocrat\n\nNow: From dejected to excited. Voting for Harris\n\nIn June, she felt \"a little dejected\" about the upcoming election. Fernandez, who fled Cuba with her parents and crossed the southern border as a child, said, \"I have not a lot of confidence that things are going the way that they should in this country.\" She was planning on voting for Biden, though she harbored deep concerns about his fitness. \"It is a little scary to think what happens if he decreases or his health declines,\" she told us a few days before the June 27 debate.\n\nPainted shells that read \"Kamala is brat\" lie lined up outside a rally in support of Vice President Kamala Harris' Democratic presidential election campaign in Ambler, Pennsylvania. Photo by Rachel Wisniewski/Reuters\n\nNow, \"I feel joyful, excited, so hopeful. So excited,\" Fernandez told us this week. The Harris and Biden switch has added to some Democratic voters' stress. But not for Fernandez. She is openly and happily on board for Harris. The lime-green memes borrowed from a pop star's branding are helping. \"She's definitely energizing me,\" she said. \"I also love when Charli XCX posted that 'kamala IS brat.' That made me very happy.\"\n\nMore uncertainty has followed\n\nDavid Herring, 75\n\nRetired Army officer. Okemos, Mich.\n\nRepublican\n\nNow: Still a no on Trump. Less sure about Democrats.\n\nIn June, Herring wrote of Biden and Trump: \"Is this the best we can do?\" \"My generation has made this mess. It will not get better until the next generation takes charge,\" he added. In an interview, Herring said he could not stomach Trump. \"If you're not an honorable person ... I couldn't follow that.\" He was considering, but was still uncomfortable with the thought of voting for Biden as the lesser of two evils.\n\nNow, Herring seems even less sure. His deep doubts about Trump were upheld by the GOP convention. \"In his acceptance speech at the GOP convention,\" he wrote, \"Trump started out encouraging but fell back into his usual rally speech.\" Herring said he is still looking for dignity and decency in him. At the same time, he seems potentially farther away from voting for the Democratic ticket as well. \"I do not know who I will vote for, the radical left or the Trump regime,\" Herring wrote us this week. \"I cannot at this point justify the lesser of two evils.\"\n\nLikely to vote for a third-party candidate\n\nStephen Stone, 39\n\nHuman resources manager. Brooklyn, New York\n\nIndependent\n\nNow: Not as hopeless, but still demoralized. Likely to vote for Jill Stein\n\nIn June, Stone began by saying the election is hard to put into just a few words. But \"I feel despondent,\" he told us. \"I feel there is no good choice.\" He voted for Biden in 2020 to block Trump, but now feels that Biden has alienated too many voters, including Black voters and those following the war in Gaza. He was considering a write-in candidate, or Green Party candidate Jill Stein.\n\nNow, his feelings about the election have become less dark. \"I still feel demoralized,\" he wrote, but \"not as hopeless, because I think the country may elect Kamala Harris, which would give us some more time to organize; delay some of the most overt elements of fascism.\" He is sticking with Stein as his candidate, though he longs for a \"viable left wing party.\"\n\nThe effects of the shakeup on the Democratic presidential ticket are being felt in the battle for the House and Senate and the fight over big issues on the ballot in many states. Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter joins John Yang to discuss.\n\nThis is just a sample of the changes happening for voters.\n\nOverall, as above, we have heard of far more shift among voters who were left-leaning or profoundly anti-Trump. That group is quickly feeling less disillusioned and, to use Stephen Stone's word, despondent, about the election. And some, like Ana Fernandez, are now truly excited.\n\nFor those with more conservative leanings, we've also seen a slight lightening of the mood. For the most part, they are not yet moving to Harris. But they are also giving her a chance.\n\nMost telling to us is that we only found one person -- a teacher in Pennsylvania -- who became more inclined to support Trump in the last month. The assassination attempt humanized Trump for that person, and they hoped he would give a unifying convention speech.\n\nBut when Trump's address rambled into 90 minutes, full of more barbed words, this voter again shifted back to undecided. And they, too, are waiting to see if Harris gives them a reason to vote for her.", "source": {"uri": "pbs.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "PBS.org"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lisa_desjardins@pbs.org",

(The headline was later updated.) Another lamented the \"border confusion\" that \"haunts\" Harris since she effectively took over as the top of the 2024 Democratic ticket.\n\nSome in the liberal intelligentsia go further, arguing that an inherent advantage of bypassing a competitive, small-d democratic primary process this time around means that a new platform can be fashioned for the general election only.\n\n\"But I think the merit of skipping a primary is that you don't need to make huge public promises to your base groups,\" the liberal pundit Matthew Yglesias writes. \"You need to write down a brief, realistic agenda of items the public wants to hear about.\"\n\nYglesias put it another way on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter: \"By skipping a primary you can skip the part of the election where you make lots of explicit cringey promises to various elements of your base and just write down a few popular issues to run on and tell everyone else to be chill.\"\n\n\"Chill\" in what way? Harris \"should send a quiet emissary to the immigration advocacy community to tell them not to be idiots, that if a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill passes Congress, she's obviously not going to veto it.... Was she the 'border czar?' Who cares!\"\n\nIt is fine for liberal commentators to advise Harris to adopt this type of messaging. It is significantly more problematic for straight news outlets to allow Harris to flip-flop and memory-hole unpopular or too-radical positions while not allowing former President Donald Trump or Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) similar latitude with theirs.\n\nTrump can repeatedly disavow Project 2025 or federal abortion bans less easily than Harris can distance herself from past advocacy for the Green New Deal, Medicare for All, decriminalizing border crossings, or banning fracking.\n\nOn abortion in particular, Trump clearly did try to avoid \"explicit cringey promises to various elements of\" his \"base and just write down a few popular issues to run on and tell everyone else to be chill.\" The 2024 Republican platform was rewritten accordingly, largely urging states to use the powers they regained when Roe v. Wade was reversed to ban late-term abortions.\n\nNone of this will prevent Harris from making abortion access one of the top issues in her campaign to defeat Trump this November.\n\nCampaigns are indeed about the future. Past records are nevertheless an important indicator of what is to come.\n\nHarris is trying to run less as a continuation of Biden or the liberal alternative to him she presented herself as in her failed first presidential campaign than as a California prosecutor throwing the book at felon Trump. The references to her being unburdened by what has been or having just fallen out of a coconut tree are already cliches a little over a week into her campaign, yet both catchphrases are apt metaphors for her campaign strategy.\n\nIn some ways, this is a type of continuity with Biden. Biden spent a half-century trying to find the center of gravity inside the Democratic Party and position himself accordingly. Harris's campaign so far is following in that tradition.\n\nRepublicans for decades ran to the right in primaries and then tacked to the center for the general election. It is part of why the party became so disenchanted with its leaders and governing class.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nBut the last Republican presidential nominee before Trump, Mitt Romney, did end up paying a political price for adopting a slightly different persona in each race he ran for a quarter century. \"Look, I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush.

Harris now claims she doesn't want to ban fracking, abolish immigration enforcement, confiscate guns, or end private health insurance -- all positions she espoused while attempting to please left-wing activists.\n\nHarris campaign spokesman Brian Fallon, who supports defunding the police, told the New York Times that noticing the candidate's flip-flops on key issues was part of Donald Trump's sinister plot to \"define her through lies.\" In fact, Harris's alarming ignorance and lack of ideological conviction was something that concerned Joe Biden's campaign team during the VP selection process in 2020.\n\nAccording to Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns, authors of This Will Not Pass (2022), Democratic pollsters determined that voters were more likely to view Harris negatively when exposed to attacks highlighting her reputation as a \"flip-flopper with no core.\" It was a reputation she acquired over the course of her failed primary campaign, when she reversed herself multiple times on Medicare for All and other policies she did not fully understand.\n\nPolls financed by liberal billionaire Reid Hoffman, the cofounder of LinkedIn, revealed that one of the \"most damaging\" lines of attack against Harris was portraying her as a \"political chameleon who had changed her positions on a range of issues and had guffawed on the radio about smoking pot after spending years prosecuting drug crimes.\"\n\nHarris's inability to articulate a clear policy vision stood out during the Biden campaign's search for a running mate. Martin and Burns wrote that Biden himself \"privately and repeatedly shared versions of a common observation about Harris: She doesn't seem to know who she wants to be.\" In other words, Harris \"often seemed to be guessing at the answers her party's activist class wanted to hear.\"\n\nNevertheless, Biden ultimately chose Harris because she was the only non-white woman who ran in the primary. \"Harris was neither the candidate who most greatly impressed Biden's vice-presidential search committee, nor the person his advisers saw as most immediately prepared for the presidency,\" Martin and Burns wrote. Biden's team even came to see her ideological vacuousness as an asset, believing she would \"just as readily move back to the center if called upon to do so.\"", "source": {"uri": "freebeacon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Free Beacon"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_stiles@freebeacon.com", "name": "Andrew Stiles", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fracking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defund_the_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defund the police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Fallon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Fallon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flip-flop (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-payer_healthcare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-payer healthcare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reid Hoffman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/kamala2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773409", "eventUri": "eng-9773409", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 106, "relevance": 1}

Abrams, Jeff Shell - now the president of Paramount Global - and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.\n\nBut like most campaigns, other early supporters were less well known or moneyed but just as vital: grassroots activists who energized neighbors and posted on social media to drive donations for the woman they wanted to see one day shatter the highest and hardest glass ceiling in America.\n\n\"She was not focused on how much money did somebody raise. She was focused on 'we're building a community, a network, and a family that believes in my message and wants to help get it to the rest of the country,' Harris' 2019 National Finance Chair Jon Henes told ABC News, noting that they raised over 40 million dollars during her primary campaign.\n\nHe added, \"If you just leave it up to people who can write a big check, you're not going to be able to build a real movement.\"\n\nABC News spoke to over 25 people from Harris' 2019 national finance committee, a group in charge of raising money and galvanizing communities to support their candidate. Some of them were known to Harris as a part of her \"Ride or Die\" crew.\n\n\"The finance committee was so diverse - racially, geographically, professionally. It laid the groundwork for this moment,\" Henes said. \"So what we're seeing now with these Zoom calls to raise money and the rallies shows the excitement and diversity coming to play.\"\n\nThe presidential campaign they invested in then fizzled out two months before the 2020 Iowa caucus. Now, however, it has come roaring back - no surprise to many supporters who had watched Harris' ascent long before the world knew her name.\n\nNeil Makhija, commissioner of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, first met Harris in 2010 when she was running for California attorney general. \"I walked up to her and said I had not been that inspired since I heard Barack Obama,\" he told ABC News, adding that he further told Harris she would be president one day.\n\nMultiple \"bundlers,\" as they're called - people who collect donations from multiple contributors for a candidate and deliver them as a single, large donation - said they saw the same quality in Harris.\n\nKimberly Marteau Emerson, the regional co-chair of the Southern California Harris Victory Fund PAC, said she also first met Harris in 2010 when she was running for California attorney general. Nearly a decade later, shortly before Harris launched her presidential campaign in 2019, Emerson watched her at an event publicizing her book.\n\n\"She communicates like Barack Obama. She is that good. She is a great storyteller,\" Emerson says she told her husband, John B. Emerson, also a Harris PAC regional co-chair as well as a Democratic National Convention (DNC) delegate. \"She spoke in a way that helped us relate to her and each other. There was a common humanity.\"\n\nEmerson said she and her husband knew many candidates who were running in 2020. But the day Harris announced, Emerson texted her: \"I'm in.\"\n\nMany of Harris' supporters point to her ability to connect with people. \"I thought she had a great people's touch. And an interest in people in all walks of life,\" Wells Fargo Vice Chairman of Investment Banking Frederick Terrell told ABC News. \"She was intellectually curious, our conversations were engaging ... She will make a fabulous president.\"\n\nYet some people stressed that winning wasn't the only factor in their decision to invest in Harris.\n\n\"I'm a values-based supporter. I'm not a frontrunner supporter,\" said Jill Louis, who was one of Harris' 38 line sisters at the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, Alpha Chapter at Howard University. \"We came up in a time when we believed this country stood for freedom and equality ... that's what we're so steeped in.\"\n\nMany donors with whom ABC News spoke for this story said they have been playing the long game in supporting her. And now, with fewer than 100 days remaining before Election Day, many said they've never before experienced this level of excitement in politics.\n\nJust an hour after Biden announced on July 21 that he was no longer seeking reelection, top donor and bundler Alex Heckler was in the audience of the Broadway musical \"Suffs,\" based on the women's suffrage movement a century ago and co-produced by Hillary Clinton. As the curtain opened and before the lead actress delivered her first line, Heckler recalls, something unexpected happened.\n\n\"Before she can say a word, there was an outrageous applause. People started chanting 'Kamala' for a minute,\" Heckler told ABC News. \"I had chills. People in the crowd were crying.\"\n\nWanda James, a DNC delegate from Colorado, said realizing that Harris would likely be the Democratic presidential nominee took her back to former President Obama's first campaign.\n\n\"I feel all 2008 ... You could hear the Beatles singing 'Here Comes the Sun,' James said. \"My phone was ringing and buzzing so much, my phone was hot.\"\n\nOthers told ABC News that while they were initially relieved and excited by the news that Biden had stepped down and endorsed Harris for the Oval Office, they are also facing a blunt reality.\n\n\"Donors recognize it's more difficult electing a Black woman - [a] double whammy in this world of misogyny and sexism,\" said Susie Tompkins Buell, a longtime Democratic donor and activist who's also a close friend of Hillary Clinton's, for whom she also was a campaign bundler. Yet Buell also feels Harris is the clear pick to support.\n\n\"It's so obvious. She has the aura. She's tenacious. She has it all,\" Buell declared, but added that supporters \"need to understand the reality of this process ... This is uncharted territory for all of us.\"\n\nShould Harris secure the Democratic presidential nomination, one of her first tasks will be to select a vice presidential running mate, a process that has already begun.\n\nAreva Martin, a California at-large Democratic delegate who has known Harris since they were both college freshmen, says she's comforted by the fact that that Harris is supported by strong Democratic leaders.\n\n\"I like that she picked Eric Holder to do the vetting,\" Martin said, referring to Barack Obama's former attorney general. \"I think he's brilliant. Bringing Holder in is bringing the Obama coalition.\"\n\nABC News has confirmed the two frontrunners for Harris' VP pick remain Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Pennsylvania Governor Mark Shapiro. Nearly every donor with whom ABC News spoke said they supported both.\n\nYet a few donors had different ideas. Takeila Hannah, who held the first large fundraiser for Harris in North Carolina during her 2019 campaign, said prior to state Gov. Roy Cooper announcing on July 29 that he was withdrawing from consideration for the position that she would also strongly support him for the job.\n\n\"What they have in common is they've both been [attorneys general] of states. That's a language they can speak ... they both come from the law,\" said Hannah.\n\nDr. Manan Trivedi, a Democratic donor and former candidate for Pennsylvania's 6th congressional district, echoed several others with whom ABC News spoke in saying he hoped Harris would make a more unconventional pick to continue shaking up the race. His choice is Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\n\"I know it's not going to happen. But as a dad of two daughters and a successful wife, I think we're overdue,\" Trivedi said. \"And I think Gretchen Whitmer is a dominant force and we need Michigan; it's not just because she's female. She has a great record and it brings the race into stark contrast.\"\n\nSince President Biden withdrew from the presidential race just over one week ago, the Harris campaign said it has so far raised over $200 million, including the record-shattering $81 million in donations it received in the 24 hours immediately following Biden's announcement. That enthusiasm, some donors believe, demonstrates high-level support for the candidate.\n\nAsif Mahmood was deputy national finance chair for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, as well as the financial point person for Asian outreach for Harris' 2019 campaign. He notes that there are \"stark differences\" between 2016 and now that work in Harris' favor, one of which is the major boost Harris has received due to the presidential race focusing on Biden's age and other perceived weaknesses for as long as it did.\n\n\"In 25 years, I haven't seen the energy Kamala is enjoying right now,\" Asif told ABC News. \"This is more than Obama energy.\"\n\nEven so, Asif said, the campaign cannot afford to be complacent, particularly regarding the swing states that Clinton lost to Trump in 2016. He expects campaign workers to visit those states to bolster efforts there.\n\nFundraiser Tina Duryea, who's also a Connecticut delegate to the Democratic National Convention, said it's not just the big checks that are significant in this moment. Duryea says she raised a respectable amount of money for Harris from grassroots supporters in the 24 hours after Biden's withdrawal.\n\n\"I did TikToks, Facebook posts, Threads, Instagram, and raised 30 thousand from small-donor donations,\" Duryea told ABC News.\n\nMichael Kempner, founder and CEO of the global PR film MikeWorldWide, who's accustomed to collecting high-dollar donations for Democratic candidates, said the Harris candidacy is generating renewed interest from potential supporters.\n\n\"I've received close to a 100 texts, emails and calls from people who want to be more involved who previously were not enthusiastic,\" Kempner said. \"The level of excitement feels Obama-esque. There's a level of enthusiasm [that] in my 40 years I have never experienced.\"", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Political action committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Global", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Shell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Shell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Lourd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Lourd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_caucuses", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa caucuses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Abrams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

This gives her an opportunity to craft her image as a centrist with a spine, the sort of Democrat who can win national elections.\n\nThe Democratic nominee has two automatic advantages. One is that President Joe Biden is leaving behind a U.S. economy that's the strongest in decades and the envy of the world. The other is that the opponent is Donald Trump.\n\nTrump's attempted coup against the elected government of the United States should alone disqualify him from holding office -- or even walking around as a free man. The shocking spasm of violence that Trump set off at the U.S. Capitol is on video, as is the spectacle of his enjoying the show on a White House TV.\n\nAs he pushes 80, Trump is now the old man who has lost some dots on his dice. His confusion has accelerated to the point that he thought he ran against Barack Obama in 2020. (No, it was Biden.) He called Vladimir Putin a \"genius\" for invading Ukraine.\n\nAnd he chose as his running mate the weirdly malleable JD Vance. When Russia launched a full-scale ground invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Vance said, \"I don't really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.\" Not surprisingly, when Trump chose Vance as his VP, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov applauded warmly.\n\nIf Democrats choose Harris, she would be wise to showcase her law-and-order past. The right-wing opposition will smear her as a Californian and all that implies. But as district attorney for San Francisco and then California's attorney general, she was tough on criminal defendants to the point that progressives targeted her.\n\nOne accuser, law professor Lara Bazelon, complained of her support for a state law \"under which parents whose children were found to be habitually truant in elementary school could be prosecuted, despite concerns that it would disproportionately affect low-income people of color.\"\n\nThat would have been a great law. And if it worked as the professor warned, it would have disproportionately advanced the education of low-income children of color.\n\nHarris should not let the media, especially the friendly media, turn her into an identity candidate, that is, significant for being Black and a woman. A president can be one, the other or both, but neither is a qualification.\n\nOn immigration, Harris has to set aside the idea that the fix lies in addressing the \"root causes.\" There is simply no lid on the number of people who will try to enter the United States illegally if they can. Biden was late into taking executive action to secure the border, but he did it. Harris should continue to support that strenuous enforcement and if elected, back a comprehensive reform that ensures America gets the workers it needs but that every immigrant enters legally.\n\nHarris has the street smarts to return the low blows Trump world is already sending her way. A big advantage is she's a prosecutor and Trump is a criminal. She should easily put Trump away in a debate. Trump has already asked that Fox News host the next debate, and if he finds an excuse to chicken out, it will be no surprise.\n\nHer vice presidential pick will be super important. How about Sen. Mark Kelly? He's a war hero, an astronaut, an Arizonan.\n\nAgain, Harris is not yet the official Democratic nominee. Whether it's her or someone else, the voters must defeat Trump to save the democracy. And given Trump's fawning over Putin, they would save the West as well.", "source": {"uri": "heraldextra.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

One bullet nicked the former president's ear, miraculously missing his head in what would have been a fatal strike.\n\nAs Secret Service agents jumped on Trump to protect him, he managed to raise his fist in the air, shouting, \"Fight\". Streaks of blood covered his ear and face as he was rushed to safety. The image of a bloodied Trump pumping his fist and shouting \"fight\" mesmerised America and the world. Trump had indeed secured the elections.\n\nRead more by Osama Al Sharif European youth's shift to Far Right sends a message Is Israel annexing the West Bank? How Gaza became an issue for voters in France, the UK and US Back with a vengeance\n\nHe emerged with a bandaged ear at the RNC, smiling and pensive. Pundits said the ordeal humbled him. As he delivered his 90-minute speech on the third and final day of the convention, he appeared solemn, calling for unity. But then he turned his eyes away from the teleprompters and launched a tirade against President Joe Biden, the Democrats, and all those who opposed his agenda. The old Trump was back -- with a vengeance.\n\nFor months, the focus was on his rival, an ailing, senile, and visibly confused Biden. Pressure has been mounting on the incumbent from his party to drop out of the race ever since his pathetic performance in his debate with Trump.\n\nBiden was defiant and insisted that he was the only candidate capable of defeating a dangerous Trump, even as the poll showed him trailing, especially in the battleground states. The race appeared lost, and Trump was sailing smoothly towards winning the November poll.\n\nBut then, last week, a Covid stricken Biden announced that he was stepping aside and endorsing his Vice President, Kamala Harris, as a Democratic candidate. This was a political earthquake. Pundits scrambled to find precedents and pondered how the race would look now that Biden had decided to drop out.\n\nAt 82, it was not only old age that finally brought Biden down. The party was already divided on the eve of the Democratic primaries. Biden's Gaza policy had dented his popularity among youth -- who rallied to his support in the 2020 elections -- as well as Muslim and Arab Americans. The majority of those voted uncommitted in the Muslim majority states in protest of the White House's indifference to the Israeli atrocities in Gaza.\n\nLatest on Trump FBI confirms Donald Trump hit by bullet in assassination attempt Two years in 100 days: Extraordinary US election enters the homestretch Trump risks losing voters he needs with loaded attacks on Harris Make America great again\n\nDespite his positive record in reining in inflation, creating jobs, and boosting the economy, Biden was attacked by the Conservatives over his failing policy to control the southern borders where thousands of illegal immigrants were crossing into the country. The Republicans, under Trump, warned of the so-called progressive agenda by the Democratic Party's left flank and the dangers of the so-called woke culture.\n\nThere is no doubt today that endorsing Harris, a seasoned prosecutor, a woman of black roots, and one who can now unite the party and bring back the uncommitted, is a game changer. Despite Trump's disdain for Harris and claim that he will easily defeat her, the reality is that she will present a serious challenge to the Trump campaign.\n\nWith Biden out of the race, the Democrats will now shift the focus to Trump's agenda for America. They will be able to remind Americans, especially those uncommitted or those who believed the race was already over, of the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nFor corporate America, the Democrats will warn against Trump's isolationist tendencies and his plan to wage a trade war against China and Europe in a bid to make America great again.\n\nProject 2025\n\nThose voting in November will not be casting the ballot for Harris as much as voting against Trump and the risk of him winning a second term, in which an ultraconservative agenda would likely shake the republic's pillars, as outlined in the 900-page document produced by the Heritage Foundation entitled Project 2025.\n\nWhile Trump has tried to distance himself from that agenda, pundits believe that even if a small part of it is implemented, it will endanger the country and breach its Constitution.\n\nNothing is for sure. Four months separate us from November, and much will happen between now and then. For the Middle East, a Trump victory would usher cataclysmic events, especially about the Israel/Palestine conflict and Israel's confrontation with Iran.\n\nThat is not to say that a Harris presidency will bring peace to the region. But she will have learnt from Biden's mistakes. She will surely be tougher on Netanyahu and his pursuit of an endless war that has hurt America's standing in the world and made it an accessory to what is now being described as genocide in Gaza.\n\nSince Trump launched his political career in 2015, he has managed to bring together and led various fragmented groups, revisionists and white supremacists, and turn them into a real power at the centre of US politics.\n\nThis election is about the soul of the United States, and its outcome will determine not only America's future but also its place in a changing world.\n\nOsama Al Sharif

Trump smashed his campaign records, raising $52.8 million online in the 24 hours right after that guilty verdict for the 34 felony counts in a New York hush money case in May, according to a press release.\n\nHarris surpassed that record, raising $81 million in the first 24 hours of her presidential campaign.\n\nThe Federal Election Commission does not have updated fundraising numbers following the July 13 assassination attempt. However, the campaign used the tragedy for its fundraising efforts.\n\nThe Trump campaign said they raised $331 million in the second quarter, beating Biden's contributions by nearly $70 million.\n\nAnalyses from OpenSecrets, a political money-tracking nonprofit, show fundraising matters but it is not always the determinative factor.\n\nDuring the 2020 presidential election, the Bidan campaign became the first to raise over $1 billion from donors. Trump's campaign raised $774 million. Notably, over half of his money was from small donors giving $200 or less, which no other presidential candidate had done. Biden's cash advantage helped him put out more campaign ads in the critical swing states which helped him win the presidency.\n\nHowever, money is not everything. In 2016, the Democratic presidential nominee at the time, Hillary Clinton's campaign raised more than double the amount that Trump did, pulling in almost $500 million to Trump's $248 million. Trump won despite having less money.\n\nMoney usually equals victory when it comes to the Congressional races. OpenSecrets shows 93.65% of House races were won by the top spending candidate, and 82.35% of Senate races were won by the top spending candidate in 2022.

Data from the Federal Election Commission (FEC) collected and analyzed by the nonpartisan research group OpenSecrets shows that for this election cycle, President Joe Biden, potential Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have collected roughly $781 million from a variety of partisan interest groups up until June 30, 2024. Not included: the reported $100 million in funds the Harris campaign raised in just over a day after Biden dropped out of the race.\n\nWhile there are bipartisan groups that support more than just one candidate, the Statista chart shows only contributions made by organizations or individuals directly supporting either Harris's or Trump's election bid. At first glance, it is already apparent that the Trump campaign relies on the funds funneled towards it by so-called super PACs. The prefix super stems from the fact that donations to these committees are not as tightly regulated and can exceed the donor limit of $5,000 per year.\n\nWhile, in theory, super PACs are independent and their expenditures \"not made in cooperation, consultation or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of, any candidate, or his or her authorized committees or agents, or a political party committee or its agents\", the reality is often different. For example, Make America Great Again Inc spent almost $100 million of its roughly $200 million raised in support of Donald Trump and opposition of his competitors in the Republican primary and incumbent President Joe Biden. The largest donor with $75 million is Thomas Mellon, heir to one of the richest families in the U.S.\n\nThe Biden-Harris campaign, on the other hand, saw the most money raised outside of the official campaign committee come from so-called carey committees. These committees are a mixture of a super PAC and a regular PAC. They hold two accounts, one for unlimited donations and spending and another that adheres to the strict aforementioned caps. Around $148 million out of the $152 million coming from carey committees was raised by Future Forward USA and The Lincoln Project. The former received donations by, for example, a variety of unions and Silicon Valley venture capitalist company Greylock Partners. It has also been accused of receiving large amounts of secret donations towards the end of the 2020 presidential election. The considerably smaller Lincoln Project's donors include donors like the University of California, Bank of America, Google parent company Alphabet and AT&T. The largest donors, however, are the designer outlet mall company McArthurGlen and Silicon Valley's Sequoia Capital, the latter of which has also given money to the Trump campaign.\n\nEver since President Biden announced he would stop campaigning for reelection and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the new Democratic candidate, Republicans have questioned whether Harris could utilize the hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars from the war chest of the Biden reelection campaign. According to many experts, among them the director of the progressive nonprofit Brennan Center for Justice's Elections & Government Program Daniel I. Weiner and Nicholas Stephanopoulos, Kirkland & Ellis Professor of Law at Harvard, Harris is cleared to use the funds since she ran on a combined ticket with Joe Biden.\n\nHowever, a current President stepping down from his reelection bid and passing the torch to his Vice President has no precedent in U.S. history, so it's more a question of established practice than a clear legal ruling. According to Stephanopoulos, the FEC is still dealing with official complaints connected to the 2016 election, so there is virtually no chance that any decision barring Harris from utilizing the Biden campaign funds will be made before the election in November.", "source": {"uri": "statista.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Statista"}, "authors": [{"uri": "florian_zandt@statista.com", "name":

He is from a swing state and can easily take on Donald Trump, on matters being raised him. US Vice-President Kamala Harris is all set to receive the presidential nomination from the Democratic party after President Joe Biden ended his election campaign. The most important question in the mind of the voters is related to Harris' choice of her running mate. She is expected to announce the name of the candidate soon within a week.\n\nThere will be many considerations for her. The ABC News/Ipsos poll indicates growing support for Kamala Harris' presidential nomination. The same survey also indicates the popularity levels of her potential running mates. The survey indicates that the electorate seeks someone who is capable of defeating Trump, to be Harris' running mate.\n\nIn this survey, Senator Mark Kelly has emerged as the favorite among all contenders. The former Astronaut who represents the state of Arizona in the US Senate is also a critic of the gun laws in the US. Further, Harris who may lose out on the votes of white American males may count on Senator Kelly to attract the votes of this community.\n\nUS President Joe Biden has been replaced by Kamala Harris and this may alienate a section of the voters who are white Americans. The Senator from Arizona will need to step in here. Further, Arizona is a swing state and this may enable the Democrats to focus on gaining precious votes from this state.\n\nAlso Read: How will August's astrological shifts transform your life? Here is how planetary movements can bring fortune into your life\n\nMark Kelly also may be the best candidate to take on Trump's views on immigration. He is a Senator from a border state. 22% of the respondents view him favorably. He is also viewed negatively by 12%. He is still the best performing candidate.\n\nTransport Secretary Pete Buttigieg is viewed favorably by 29% of the respondents but he is viewed negatively by 25% and this is being viewed as matter of concern by his supporters. Similarly, Josh Shapiro (17% favorable and 13% unfavorable), Andy Beshear (13% favorable and 9% unfavorable) are the other candidates. Harris' fellow Californian Gavin Newsom is worst performing with 21% viewing him favorably and 33% viewing him unfavorably.\n\nAlso Read : US Presidential Election 2024: Will China and Russia succeed in scanning election infrastructure, manipulating voters?\n\nThe same survey indicates that the vice-president's popularity levels stand at 43% which is 8% surge as compared to the previous week.

Poor Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA). He saw the writing on the wall about Biden's second term a year in advance and played the loyal soldier while campaigning with a nod and wink to replace him, but Harris managed to shunt him unceremoniously aside.\n\nPoliticos observe that no candidate has had the Hollywood base that Harris has, but Democrats who applaud her ability to tap that gravy train fail to understand that such close association with Hollywood is no longer a positive with average people. The culture and values of Hollywood are simply too foreign.\n\nThe legacy media has also fallen in lockstep to whitewash Harris's record, from her failures as Biden's point person on the border to her legendary unlikability that causes staff to flee and makes former Secretary of State John Kerry appear humble and personable by comparison. She went from \"word salad Kamala\" to master orator in the space of three days.\n\nEvery politician gets a honeymoon, and Harris can have hers. But ultimately she will have to begin answering questions. She will eventually have to face the elephant in the room: When did she become aware of Biden's dementia? Did she prize political convenience over the well-being of the nation?\n\nCertainly, on foreign policy, Harris is a black box. She has probably been the most ineffective vice president since Dan Quayle. Biden threw her some crumbs but seldom let her near foreign policy. He considered diplomacy and statecraft his bailiwick alone, and his record notwithstanding, Biden famously considers himself the smartest person in Washington on issues of foreign relations.\n\nHarris's views on Israel appear shaped more by political efficacy than moral clarity. When she is before Jewish audiences, she sings Israel's praises. When she is in Michigan or Minnesota, she laments the situation in which Gazans find themselves without considering why. Meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, she said the war must end, but she does not explain the costs of doing so if that means Hamas rises from the ashes or Iran triumphs.\n\nOn Russia and Ukraine, her instincts are also unclear. Biden's willingness to support Ukraine against Russia stands in contrast to former President Donald Trump and vice presidential candidate Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), but with Ukraine mired in stalemate, Harris has not said how she would change policy to help Ukraine win or if, like with Israel, she would simply demand ceasefire even if it meant far greater war down the road.\n\nHarris likewise gives little insight into how she would approach China. Beijing has undertaken an unprecedented military buildup and threatens the United States in the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic oceans. Beijing will cut Harris no slack; as she parties with Hollywood, China is actively encroaching on the Philippines.\n\nHarris will likewise need to address Cuba. Forget the usual sanctions pandering; that is a nonstarter since Cuba sanctions are written into law. As even former President Barack Obama came to realize, it will take congressional action to end them, not presidential fiat.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nRather, the problem Harris will face is Cuba's collapse. A triumvirate of nonagenarians dominates Havana, with no clear succession plan. The country has lost more than 5% of its population over the last year alone, with migrants flying visa-free to Nicaragua and then hopping on chartered buses to the U.S. southern border. When the communist regime ends, will Harris stand by while China takes over or Cuba descends into Haiti-style gang violence?\n\nHarris is the teleprompter queen, but someone must write her script. The longer she goes without one, the more America's enemies salivate. Make no mistake: Harris may believe the enemy is domestic and politics is war, but that is a conceit applicable only when America is safe and its enemies deterred. Neither is true anymore. It is time for Harris to provide real answers about where she stands and what strategies she will embrace.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_rubin@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Michael Rubin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Kerry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Quayle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dan Quayle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Republic_of_Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Socialist Republic of Romania"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumvirate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Triumvirate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

We see this now in Kamalamania - the dizzying speed with which the vice-president and presumptive Democratic nominee has been turned, through mass acclamation, from national embarrassment to Democratic saviour.\n\nThe fact that Harris's transfiguration doesn't make much sense is sort of the point - the more improbable it seems the better. We are memetic creatures, especially in the digital age, and the meme of the moment is that Harris has magically invigorated the Democratic base and turned the 2024 US presidential election around in their party's favour. It's quasi-religious in that you don't have to believe you just have to repeat the message until you accept.\n\nNobody who has seen Harris speak believes that she is the next coming of Barack Obama, but many millions of people will now express faith in the sudden excitement around her campaign because they want to believe in the idea of Harris, a mixed-race woman, delivering them from what they see as the horror of Donald Trump. For many, Harris's past failings, her incoherent record as a politician, can all be forgotten in an instant. A select few, meanwhile, can claim to have had faith in her all along.\n\nCornell Belcher, the Democratic pollster, put his finger on the key point for Harris earlier this year. In describing her appeal to young black women, he said: 'Younger girls kind of see her in a way that younger African Americans saw Barack Obama: This too can happen, there too can I be.\n\n'It's beyond politics, it's beyond cultural, it's a spiritual thing...from a political standpoint, that s*** is gold.' In other words, logic is irrelevant. How Harris looks, her skin colour and her sex, trumps all. It's the identity, stupid.\n\nWill Kamalamania last until the election is over? It might. The identity tribes of modern America are now coalescing around her in impressive numbers: on the Sunday Joe Biden dropped out, 40,000 black women joined an organising call for her campaign. The next night, 20,000 black men did the same. On Thursday, not to be out done, 40,000 'White women for Kamala' joined at such speed that the Zoom livestream crashed. The New York Times called it 'a paroxysm of solidarity and angst'. And yesterday, more than 60,000 'White dudes for Harris' joined in. It's one nation anti-Trump, if you don't count the many millions of other Americans who believe in the Donald.\n\nLast night, we also saw what Joe Biden's purpose in this election is to be, as he delivered another humiliatingly bad speech to mark the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act. The crowd laughed generously as he went through his tiresome stories about campaigning for the Senate in the 1970s. At one point, he seemed to refer to himself as 'a former president' - a telling slip.\n\nRepublicans and others now complain that, if Biden is unfit to run, he is unfit to serve as leader of the free world. But in the Democratic worldview that's beside the point. Biden is the Distracter-in-Chief now. His clear and present dysfunction will serve as a reminder to Americans of why they are better off with Harris, who can at least use a Teleprompter without reading off the 'end quote' instructions.\n\nIn this way, Biden and Harris have switched roles. For the last four years, Harris, with her 'word salads' and her disastrous interviews, has fulfilled the primary duty of a vice-president - to make the big guy look better. All that time, one of the main arguments for keeping Biden was that Harris's performances showed she would be worse than he is. That's all changed now. Biden is now the decrepit yang to the Harris campaign's energetic yin.

Her remarks were met with near-constant applause, and they hinted at her strategy for the next three months: tough on former President Trump and forward-looking on a Harris administration's policy goals.\n\nIt was a stark contrast from when Biden took the stage in Madison July 5 to double down on staying in the race after a rocky debate performance.\n\nThe crowd at the Biden event skewed older, and the energy level was lower. The president's remarks were greeted by a few shouts, but not the raucous applause Harris received. And while his supporters still felt assured he could win Wisconsin -- expressing consistent concerns about the future of abortion rights, foreign affairs and the economy -- it didn't feel like their enthusiasm would boil out of the room.\n\nHarris' rally laid bare the issue that had plagued Democrats in recent months: They had a messenger -- not a message -- problem.\n\n\"Kamala Harris is going to win Wisconsin,\" Ben Wikler, chair of the Democratic Party in Wisconsin, told Wisconsin Watch in the moments after the rally. \"You could see on the stage just now, her ability to lay out a message grounded in her record and her values that make crystal clear that she wants what most Wisconsinites want, which is freedom and opportunity.\"\n\nBut some prominent Democrats want to proceed with caution.\n\n\"I think people should avoid, if you are rooting for Democrats, irrational exuberance at this moment,\" said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama. \"(Harris) comes in in a deep hole.\"\n\nYet voter excitement was almost tangible in West Allis, with rally-goers echoing Wikler, many of whom said they feel more thrilled and involved with the Democratic Party than they previously were.\n\nTracy Potrzebowksi, who worked polls and the recount during the 2020 election, said she's more motivated than when Biden was in the race.\n\n\"I feel a similar energy from when Obama was running,\" she told Wisconsin Watch. \"I obviously always was going to vote for any Democrat because of what is happening in our country, but this is what galvanized me to get into a community and find spaces to really advocate.\"\n\nContrast that with Jeannie Peterson's take after the July 5 Biden event, reminiscent of a certain cartoon dog sitting nervously in a flaming kitchen.\n\n\"We're not concerned, his mind is still fine,\" Peterson told Wisconsin Watch. \"He's a good, honest man. He's Irish. We can relate to his values because that's how we are, we're ordinary people.\"\n\nRally-goer Tim Lau told Wisconsin Watch that Biden could easily make it through the final stretch.\n\n\"The crowd seemed ready and receptive for President Biden, and I was happy to just be in the vicinity,\" Lau said. \"I got to within five feet of him, and it was a special moment for me. But it's not about that. It's about hearing that he stayed in the race, that he is going toward November for the final election and that he's not going to drop out of the race.\"\n\nSupporters had no trouble pivoting away from Biden in West Allis.\n\nAfter Harris' speech, former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who lost a close race for U.S. Senate in 2022 to U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, told Wisconsin Watch his opinion solidified that Harris can organize voters in a way that Democrats were lacking.\n\nHe said many people were \"convincing themselves\" there was Democratic energy, but after Biden dropped out he said the involvement \"now is real.\"\n\n\"It is very apparent how much energy was in this room today,\" Barnes said, \"and it is hard to imagine that would've been the case a week ago.\"", "source": {"uri": "minnpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MinnPost"}, "authors": [{"uri": "wisconsin_watch@minnpost.com", "name": "Wisconsin Watch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Allis,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Allis, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Allis, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madison, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Axelrod_(political_consultant)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Axelrod (political consultant)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Wikler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben Wikler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandela_Barnes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mandela Barnes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.minnpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/KamalaHarrisWestAllis940.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773409", "eventUri": "eng-9773409", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-05", "textStart": 961, "textEnd": 967, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 104, "relevance": 1}

Biden has experience on both ends of that equation, having been selected for the number-two job by Barack Obama in 2008, and having selected Harris to be his own running-mate during his victorious run against Trump twelve years later.\n\nBiden and his possible successor are understood to speak regularly. They also meet for lunch at semi-regular intervals, and Harris has joined Biden in-person for his President's Daily Brief on occasion. She also has an office in the West Wing, just steps away from the Oval Office where Biden spends his working hours.\n\nAsked about Biden's early-morning comments about consulting with Harris later on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre demurred. In doing so, she cited an inability to comment on election-related matters because of the Hatch Act, a nearly century-old ethics law which prohibits federal workers from engaging in partisan political activity on the job.\n\nBut she did tell reporters that Harris and Biden \"talk regularly\" and last spoke \"about a day or two ago.\"\n\n\"They stay in touch and and that's going to continue ... not just because, obviously, the vice president is running, but that's going to continue because, as I said, she's a critical partner in what they do,\" she said.\n\nJean-Pierre added that Biden \"has been in public service for more than 54 years,\" and said that in his dual roles as president and leader of the Democratic Party, he \"always offers up advice, any type of little bit of wisdom that he has\" based on his \"experience on these multiple fronts\" as a senator, vice president and as president.\n\nShe added that Biden has regularly \"offered his advice, his opinion\" and has been \"a mentor\" to Harris.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President's_Daily_Brief", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President's Daily Brief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Wing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Wing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatch_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hatch Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karine_Jean-Pierre", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karine Jean-Pierre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/29/19/BIDEN-CORTE_SUPREMA_73317.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773409", "eventUri": "eng-9773409", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 104, "relevance": 1}

The protests condemned so-called \"systemic racism\" as well as police brutality. (Related: Democrats revive Black Lives Matter one day after Biden endorses Kamala Harris for president.)\n\nFallon, whose bio on X now says, \"Harris for President,\" has not been clear if he has since changed his position on that issue, which became wildly unpopular with Democrat and Republican voters, Breitbart reported.\n\nHe has also been known for publicly criticizing President Joe Biden in the past, slamming the president back in 2019 during a debate in the Democratic presidential primaries. He posted on X, that \"Biden trying to complete an answer is a tender moment.\" He also condemned Biden for his past collaboration with segregationists.\n\nHe lashed out one of his strongest criticisms of Biden as the future running mates duked it out for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. \"White politicians and White commentators don't [sic] get to tell the two black candidates in the 2020 race they are wrong to take offense at Joe Biden's comments. Just stop,\" Fallon tweeted in June 2019. At a Democratic debate the day before, Harris and Sen. Cory Booker (D - NJ) condemned Biden's praise for segregationists with whom he worked with in the 1970s.\n\n\"A lot of people seem to be giving Biden a pass for that answer on slavery,\" Fallon tweeted during a September 2019 Democratic primary debate.\n\nFor Washington Free Beacon's Chuck Ross, Fallon may have a harder time defending Harris now that he's on her payroll as former employees described her office as toxic. In fact, according to a recent NBC News poll, a meager 29 percent of Americans have a favorable view of Harris.\n\nMeanwhile, when Biden endorsed her candidacy following his decision to withdraw from the race, Harris has made a pivot publicly from more extremist positions. On Thursday, July 25, she publicly condemned far-left anti-Israel protesters for their antisemitic rhetoric. She posted a statement on X, saying: \"I condemn any individuals associating with the brutal terrorist organization Hamas, which has vowed to annihilate the State of Israel and kill Jews. Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent and we must not tolerate it in our nation.\"\n\nAs Harris suddenly ascended to becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee who will go face to face with former President Donald Trump in the upcoming elections, the world has also started watching out for the new cast of aides, confidants and supporters who will shape the campaign or even her stint as the POTUS, if she gets a chance to win.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, the inner circle surrounding Harris is her family, including her husband, sister, niece and brother-in-law. Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, a Los Angeles-based lawyer, has been active both in the campaign, including on fundraising and at official White House events. Her sister Maya Harris, a lawyer who ran her failed 2020 campaign for the Democratic nomination, and her niece theater producer Meena Harris, remain close to her. Maya's husband Tony West has also been seen several times recently on Air Force Two, the vice president's plane.\n\nHarris' campaign finance supporters include Wall Street icons such as top corporate bankruptcy adviser Jon Henes, who has been coordinating fundraising events. Other figures rushing to help include Ray McGuire, the Lazard banker and former Citigroup executive and Brad Karp, chair of corporate law firm Paul Weiss. Also on board are Blair Effron, the veteran dealmaker at Centerview Partners and a fixture of Democratic fundraising, Blackstone president Jonathan Gray, Evercore co-founder Roger Altman and Marc Lasry, the hedge fund investor and former co-owner of NBA team the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\n\"Many in Wall Street have been extremely supportive of Kamala for years,\" said a Democratic fundraiser. \"Blair and Brad backed her hugely in the 2020 presidential primaries?.?.?.?they aren't last minute supporters.\"\n\nHarris's husband, being a well-regarded entertainment lawyer, has also enabled her to have strong Hollywood connections. The couple lives in the posh Brentwood neighborhood, where Arnold Schwarzenegger and Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger also reside.\n\nShe is also good friends with Chrisette Hudlin, who is the wife of Reginald Hudlin, a Democratic donor and former president of Black Entertainment Television and producer of films including House Party and Django Unchained. She is also close to Dana Walden, co-chair of Disney Entertainment, who along with her husband Matt have been friends and financial backers since 2003. Producer Ryan Murphy and Nicole Avant, wife of Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, are also her supporters, as well as Laura Shell, wife of Jeff Shell, the former NBCUniversal executive and incoming Paramount CEO.\n\nMake way for PRESIDENT KAMALA as Biden exits stage.\n\nTennessee Rep.

It can be a kind of superpower. And I have a strong feeling that Donald Trump and the Republican Party have only begun to experience the potentially fatal consequences of underestimating Kamala Harris.\n\nMany in the GOP leadership believed that they were on the verge of crushing what little political life remained in Joe Biden. Then, as the president dropped out of the race, Trump's campaign strategists appeared to jump to the conclusion that Harris was the second-best thing. In their fever dreams, Harris was seen as a weak candidate who'd had everything in life handed to her on a DEI plate. Who reflected the most liberal dreams of San Francisco \"radicals.\" Who was kind of \"out there.\" (Note to Republicans: Check out Exhibit A, one J.D. Vance.)\n\nBut in politics, preconceptions can bite you pretty quickly. Harris has come out of the box roaring like a lion and is already blowing away expectations in terms of her personality, her performance, her discipline, her poll numbers, and her fundraising. And while observers have raised doubts about her management skills -- and contend that she can be thin-skinned and overly defensive at times -- I can assure you of one thing: Weak, she is not. And that's key.\n\nThe perception and/or reality of strength is by far the most important attribute a presidential candidate can possess. Which is why the Trump campaign had been on a sugar high as it faced off against Biden, who seemed progressively more frail and -- as Trump once famously tagged Florida governor Jeb Bush -- \"low energy.\" Largely due to the ravages of age, Biden was always going to be seen as the weaker candidate.\n\nBut Harris -- in contrast to the meandering, 78-year-old, culturally-ossified-in-the-1980s ex-president -- appears youthful, energetic, and feisty. And anyone who's watched her at all knows she does not back down from a fight. Sure, she deserves much of the criticism she got for her 2020 campaign; it was often lackluster. But she can be devastating when it matters. Recall how she hit Biden with an almost fatal roundhouse during one of the debates, lashing out at him for his efforts to oppose school busing.\n\nWith that in mind, there's going to be a hell of a run on popcorn for the Harris-Trump debate -- or debates. Trump was all in when his sparring partner was Biden. Now, apparently, Trump is already grousing about a September commitment, whining rather predictably that the next debate host should be Fox News, not ABC. And Harris, gunning for a fight, has already adopted Trump's mantra against Old Joe: anytime, anywhere, as often as possible.\n\nSo, why the underestimation of Harris? Her 2020 campaign is one reason. Five and a half years ago, she stumbled out of the blocks. And yet, in politics, there's nothing like getting your clock cleaned to learn some important lessons. It's already clear from her new staffing moves that she's not going to turn the ship over to friends and sycophants. Instead, she's enlisting hardened pros like Jen O'Malley Dillon and, some say, the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the 2008 Obama campaign, David Plouffe.\n\nAnd then -- to go along with her political savvy -- the vice president has her experience, her career arc, and those psychological, social, and personal attributes, which I've observed up close.\n\nHoned as a prosecutor, time-tested by her countless public appearances, and charming in private, she's now proving to be a formidable adversary on the stump -- and the perfect spokesperson to make the case against Trump. Her speeches this past week have been masterfully cogent, and sometimes blistering, indictments of the GOP ticket, highlighting the hypocrisy of her rivals, who, despite being in the pockets of the privileged, are running as champions of the working class.\n\nThose who have lowered expectations of Harris will be in for a jolt. Such prejudices (by which I mean both prejudgment and inexcusable bias) may well work in her favor. They'll allow her to outperform her opponents and the presuppositions of the pundits -- which, in politics, often translates into connection with voters.", "source": {"uri": "vanityfair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanity Fair"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@vanityfair.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

So it's not surprising to encounter it at the start of the first major ad that the Trump campaign has released since Harris became the de facto Democratic nominee.\n\n\"This is America's border czar,\" says an unseen narrator, in an ominous voice, as the words \"Border Czar Kamala Harris\" appear onscreen, just to hammer home the designation. They're superimposed over video of Harris, in a kaleidoscopic blouse, dancing at an unspecified celebration. Message: She's not just out to lunch. She's out having a blast while the country implodes.\n\nOn a scale of 1 to someone screaming that Harris is an agent of the apocalypse, the ad rates about a 9. It's as subtle as Trump. And, like him, it doesn't play fair -- in tying illegal border crossings to terrorism and in assigning her ultimate responsibility for those crossings. She was charged not with fortifying the border but with the vaguer task of working with Central American countries to deter migration by identifying and alleviating its causes.\n\nBut the ad is smart, and it's a clear signal of what will be a main theme, possibly the main theme, in Republicans' attacks against Harris in particular and Democrats in general. Americans are much more concerned about illegal immigration than they have been in the past, and polls show that they trust Trump more than they do his Democratic adversaries to hold back the tide.\n\nThat's a big reason that Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona is on Harris's short list of potential running mates: He represents a border state and has spoken forcefully for greater border security. Harris must persuade voters that she's concerned about and focused on that issue.\n\nBut Trump must take care, too. The ad -- which is slated to appear in the six top battleground states -- underscores that. The colors in Harris's blouse, the lightheartedness of her dance moves, a carefully selected snippet of remarks she made to Lester Holt of NBC News: Those details and others combine to suggest that Harris is frivolous, different, even exotic, especially because there's an image of Trump in the ad, too, and he's striding purposefully in a suit and red tie outside what appears to be the White House.\n\nSerious man. Silly (and dangerous) woman.

Over that weekend, the campaign fielded more than 29,000 volunteers who knocked on some 126,000 doors, hosted 2,300 events, and made nearly 770,000 phone calls, Mr. Kanninen said.\n\n\"This election is going to be incredibly close,\" said Michael Tyler, the campaign's communications director. Ms. Harris herself has acknowledged that she is an underdog in the contest. However, the volunteer structure of the Harris campaign is designed for a close race, according to Mr. Kanninen.\n\nThat structure includes on-the-ground volunteers in battleground states to engage in voter outreach, as well as remote volunteers who will make phone calls and engage in electronic outreach to voters.\n\n\"We were only able to pull off -- this massive mobilization -- because of the battleground infrastructure we already had in place,\" Mr. Kanninen told reporters in a telephone briefing.\n\nPresident Biden won in Georgia by fewer than 12,000 out of nearly 5 million votes cast. In Wisconsin, the president won by fewer than 20,000 votes.\n\nThis year both campaigns have focused significant attention on these six states, which account for 75 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win.\n\nVoter turnout in the 2020 election rose to the highest level in decades with more than 158.4 million people voting, according to Pew Research Center. However, that still accounted for less than 64 percent of the voting-age population.\n\nThe number of Hispanic voters is projected to increase significantly in 2024 according to Arturo Vargas, the CEO of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO) Educational Fund.\n\nThe Trump campaign announced a grassroots organizing effort in May, dubbed Trump Force 47. The program aims to use manpower provided by state and local Republican parties and allied organizations to recruit and deploy volunteers to turn out targeted voters in battleground states.\n\nVolunteers are asked to do voter outreach activities such as phone banking, hosting house parties, precinct organizing, or delivering yard signs.\n\nThe number of volunteers to be mobilized was not specified. By mid-June the Trump campaign had opened two campaign offices in Pennsylvania. However, the Democrats already had 24 campaign sites operating with more than 100 staff members in place by that time and had spent months conducting voter outreach activities.\n\nSix weeks later, the Trump campaign had opened one additional office while the Democrats had an additional 12 sites operating in the Keystone State, according to the Harris Campaign.\n\nThe Trump Campaign has made a concerted effort to reach minority voters in this election, launching Blacks for Trump and Latinos for Trump initiatives. Former President Trump has also campaigned in traditional Democratic strongholds including Minnesota, New York, New Jersey, and Virgina in an apparent attempt to bring those states into play.\n\nHowever, the Trump campaign, in partnership with the Republican National Committee (RNC), appears more intent on mobilizing volunteers to staff its election integrity initiative.\n\n\"Having the right people to count the ballots is just as important as turning out voters on Election Day,\" former President Trump said in an April 19 statement announcing the effort.\n\nRepublicans aim to mobilize and train more than 100,000 poll watchers and volunteer attorneys to deploy in battleground states to ensure election integrity and transparency.\n\n\"Every ballot. Every precinct. Every processing center. Every county. Every battleground state. We will be there,\" said Lara Trump, co-chair of the RNC, in a statement. She added that the RNC plans to hire hundreds of election integrity workers and will have attorneys onsite at all ballot processing centers.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType":

By endorsing Kamala Harris, he seemed to have settled a score with top Democrats who forced him out of the contest read more\n\nStumbling, snoring, jumbling, jabbering, bumbling and bungling, US President Joe Biden had become the perfect example of brain fog. Mixing up names, tripping over, napping and blabbering at domestic and international summits, pressers or events, disorientation had become his middle name.\n\nThe blooper-in-chief's desperate bit for a second shot at the White House ended in the catastrophic debate with his challenger and predecessor Donald Trump on June 27.\n\nYouGov poll after Biden's disastrous debate performance and before the Trump assassination bid found him trailing his rival in all seven battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- six of which he won in 2020. The poll, conducted between July 4 and July 12, showed Biden's significant decline from his position in the states since March.\n\nFrustrated and angry, wealthy Democratic donors realised they had bet on an old horse. The donors told Future Forward, the largest pro-Biden super political action committee, that pledges worth around $90 million were on hold unless he exited. The donors coined the slogan \"No more dough until no more Joe, signalling their desperation.\n\nA few hours before Biden quit the race, the number of Congress Democrats who wanted him to step down had grown to 37, including senators Joe Manchin, Sherrod Brown, Peter Welch and Martin Heinrich and representatives Mark Takano, Marc Veasey, Jared Huffman, Chuy Garcia and Mark Pocan. Even his former boss and president, Barack Obama, wanted him to pull out.\n\nHowever, despite polls showing him behind Trump, more Democrats asking him to withdraw, and donors refusing to pump more money, Biden's delusion of self-grandeur continued for 23 days. He wasn't honest enough to admit the bitter reality staring at his face -- frailty and mental aberrations bordering on schizophrenia that could have derailed the Democratic Party.\n\nIn interviews with two radio stations, WURD Radio in Philadelphia and Civic Media in Milwaukee, he admitted his poor performance but dug his heels.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with ABC News, he said that only \"if the Lord Almighty comes down and tells me that [to stand down], I might do that\" though he acknowledged that the debate was a \"bad episode\".\n\nThe last straw was Biden testing positive for Covid on July 18. As he self-isolated at his Rehoboth Beach home in Delaware, his two confidantes, Steve Ricchetti and Mike Donilon, landed there with the bad news on July 20.\n\nBiden campaign polls, according to them, showed that Biden's re-election chances had evaporated.\n\nParty stalwart and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi played a major role in Biden's exit by giving almost an ultimatum as more Democratic lawmakers were planning to ask him to withdraw. Pelosi had the support of Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nAn enraged and frustrated Biden realised that game was over. On July 21, he dropped the bomb by posting a letter on X.\n\nDemocrats praised Biden for the 'selfless' decision to withdraw and his service to the nation, but it was a pathetic face-saving attempt. The commentariat and the average Joe knew why Biden hung up his boots -- he was mentally and physically unfit and the pressure exerted by dissident Democrats to withdraw was unbearable.\n\nBiden misled the public with big words\n\nIn his July 24 address to the nation explaining his withdrawal, the 46th POTUS told Americans that he quit the race in the \"defence of democracy\" and passed \"the torch to a new generation\".\n\nInvoking patriotism, he said, \"I revere this office, but I love my country more. It's been the honour of my life to serve as your president. But in the defence of democracy, which is at stake, I think it's more important than any title. We have to decide: Do we still believe in honesty, decency and respect; freedom, justice and democracy?\"\n\nIn his fantastical leap of self-importance and ambition, he refused to admit his worst judgement. \"I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future, all merited a second term.\"\n\nBiden's 'coup for a coup'\n\nBiden was literally forced to hang up his boots around 100 days before the election -- his anger, resentment, frustration and revenge were natural.\n\nHis wife, Jill, and son, Hunter, seethed with rage at top Democrats who orchestrated his ouster. The First Lady felt his cataclysmic debate performance was \" a great job\" and was \" all in for his decision to fight Trump despite the opposition in the party.\n\nA source close to the Biden family told the New York Post that top Democrats threatened to invoke the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution and urge vice-president (V-P) Kamala Harris and the Cabinet to remove Biden from office.\n\nBiden's rage was at a different level. Still hallucinating about a second term, he couldn't fathom the reality. He had enough. He devised a strategy to assert some control over the party by planning his own 'coup'.\n\nInitially, Biden hadn't endorsed Harris as the party's nominee in the letter posted on X at 11.16 pm. But at 11.43 pm, he endorsed her in another post.\n\nWhat transpired in those 27 minutes to make Biden endorse Harris isn't known.\n\nOn July 26, the Post reported that Biden's endorsement of Harris was his revenge on top Dems, including Obama, who had told allies that his chances of a second victory had drastically diminished.\n\n\"It was Joe's big fu*k you. Joe said, 'If I'm out, then I am endorsing her,'\" the source close to the Biden family told the Post claiming that Obama had asked the president to allow delegates at August's Democratic National Convention in Chicago to decide a new nominee.\n\nBiden's endorsement of Harris was one step ahead of the late President Lyndon B Johnson's behind-the-scenes game before the 1968 presidential election.\n\nJohnson's primary challengers were senators Eugene McCarthy and Robert F Kennedy. On March 21, 1968, Johnson announced that he wouldn't contest after only barely winning the New Hampshire primary.\n\nShockingly, the game changed after V-P Hubert Humphrey entered into the race without competing in any of the 13 primaries, inherited the delegates pledged to Johnson and collected delegates in caucus states, especially in those controlled by local Democratic leaders like Chicago mayor Ruchard Daley. He bagged the nomination due to the tight control of Johnson and other major leaders over the Democratic National Convention (DNC).\n\nSeveral Democrats saw the process of nominee selection at the party convention, not through primaries and caucuses, undemocratic. Therefore, both Democrats and Republicans have been selecting their nominees through primaries and caucuses since 1972.\n\nThough the convention system in both parties have nominated great leaders like Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S Grant, Woodrow Wilson, FDR, Dwight D Eisenhower and JFK, who were elected president.\n\nThis year, there are an estimated 4,696 delegates: 3,949 pledged and 747 automatic (superdelegates). Pledged delegates are committed to support the candidate chosen by state voters. Automatic delegates are the party's major leaders, like former presidents, V-Ps, governors, Congress members and party officials. They are not pledged to any candidate and can't vote on the first ballot at the convention.\n\nSince Biden was himself a presumptive nominee with the party convention slated for August 19-22, it was not illegal for the party to switch from him to Harris as his name was not on the first ballot.\n\nHarris already has the support of 3,359 delegates so far, much more than 1,976 needed to win on a first ballot, according to an Associated Press survey, which is an unofficial tally as Democratic delegates are free to vote for the candidate of their choice when the party picks its new nominee.\n\nHowever, Harris's case is similar to that of Humphrey and against rules and conventions. It lacks legitimacy as she was handed Biden's delegates on a platter without contesting a primary or caucus -- the will of voters, who chose him, not her.\n\nThough Biden's delegates were not legally bound to him as he was the presumptive, not official, nominee, surveys show that most Democrats are happy with Harris as the nominee.\n\nOn the other hand, Biden's delegates are also free to choose another candidate. For example, in 1952, Tennessee's Democratic senator Estes Kefauver was the clear favourite to win the nomination after winning the most primaries and delegates. However, party leaders backed Illinois governor Adlai Stevenson, who wasn't even a candidate before the convention.\n\nBiden knew that it takes months, if not a year, to prepare for primaries and caucuses. However, the party was divided over how to select a nominee if Biden dropped out, meaning Harris wasn't their first choice.\n\nPelosi favoured the competitive process in an open primary to select a nominee before Biden pulled out, though she later endorsed Harris. Even Obama and Schumer favoured a \"mini primary\". Obama wanted Arizona senator and former astronaut Mark Kelly \"at the top of the ticket\" at the convention.\n\nIn a video, New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, \"If you think that there is consensus among the people who want Joe Biden to leave, that they will support vice-president Harris, you would be mistaken.\" Though she also endorsed Harris later.\n\nSeveral other Democrats also favoured an open nominating process at the DNC. California representative Zoe Lofgren favoured a \"mini-primary\", including Harris. \"I don't think we can do a coronation [of Harris],\" she said.\n\nMontana senator Jon Tester and Vermont senator Peter Welch also favoured an open nominating process.\n\nBiden knew that scenario was unlikely in the DNC as Democrats want to present a united face to voters and the Republican Party, which has coalesced around Trump. Dems don't want the DNC to turn into chaos and bitterness.\n\nStill fearing an open contest, Biden knew Harris was his best bet. If she wins, she would be the first woman, African-American and person of South Asian descent to become president and Biden would get some credit. Besides, Harris, his V-P pick in 2020, supported him despite the banner of revolt unfurled by top Democrats and never portrayed herself as his replacement publicly,\n\nBiden couldn't allow an open-for-all contest with hard numbers staring at his face. A July draft memo prepared by Washington, D.C.-based BlueLabs Analytics, a leading provider of analytics services and technology, showed that four prominent Democrats outperformed Biden by five points against Trump in the battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.\n\nMoreover, these four Democrats -- Kelly, Maryland governor Wes Moore, Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro and Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer -- also outperformed Harris.\n\nBlueLabs interviewed 15,000 voters across Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania between July 5 and 12, around a week after the debate.\n\n\"Alternative Democratic candidates run ahead of President Biden by an average of three points across the battleground states. Nearly, every tested Democrat performs better than the President. This includes vice-president Harris, who runs better than the President (but behind the average alternative),\" the memo read. Harris was \"behind the average [Democratic] alternative\".\n\nYoung voters, Independents and those who haven't voted since, at least, 2020 are most likely to increase support for an alternative Democratic candidate.\n\nAccording to the memo, voters are \"looking for a fresh face\" and \"those more closely tied to the current administration [including Harris] perform relatively worse than other tested candidates\". Almost twice as many voters say delegates should nominate the best candidate over picking the next in line [Harris].\n\nBiden's strategy has worked so far.\n\nExcept for Moore, all the three top Democrats who were leading Biden and Harris in the BlueLabs survey have endorsed Harris.\n\n\"I couldn't be more confident that Vice President @KamalaHarris is the right person to defeat Donald Trump and lead our country into the future. She has my support for the nomination,\" he tweeted.\n\nWhitmer tweeted: \"Today, not only am I fired up to endorse @KamalaHarris for President of the United States, I'm proud to serve as a co-chair of her campaign. ... Vice President Harris, you have my full support. Let's win this.\"\n\nShapiro tweeted: \"I will do everything I can to help elect @KamalaHarris as the 47th President of the United States.\"\n\nFinally, Obama also endorsed Harris after not mentioning her in tribute to Biden after he quit the race. The former president hinted that the party \"will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead\" and called for \"a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges\", clearly hinting that he didn't support Harris.\n\nHowever, the Obamas endorsed Harris on July 26. \"We agree with President Biden that choosing Kamala was one of the best decisions he's made. She has the resume to prove it. There is no doubt in our mind that Kamala Harris has exactly what it takes to win this election and deliver for the American people,\" they said in a statement.\n\nA video showing Harris taking a phone call from the Obamas pledging their support accompanied the statement.\n\nIrrespective of whether Harris beats Trump, Biden had his revenge with the party having no option but to select Harris as the nominee.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Family of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Donilon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Donilon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ricchetti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Ricchetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Huffman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jared Huffman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pocan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Pocan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Veasey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marc Veasey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heinrich", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martin Heinrich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherrod_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sherrod Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Manchin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Manchin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

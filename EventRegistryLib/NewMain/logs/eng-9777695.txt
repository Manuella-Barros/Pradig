In 1984, she wrote and presented the acclaimed BBC/NTA documentary Nigeria: A Squandering of Riches, a pivotal film exploring the challenges of corruption and environmental degradation in the Niger Delta.\n\nTransitioning from secular music to gospel in the 1990s, Onwenu's career in music was marked by her ability to address critical social issues through her art. She released her debut album, For the Love of You, in 1981, followed by several others under EMI and Polygram, including the popular One Love. Her later works, such as Inspiration for Change, focused on social transformation in Nigeria.", "source": {"uri": "nairametrics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nairametrics"}, "authors": [{"uri": "deborah_dan_awoh@nairametrics.com", "name": "Deborah Dan-Awoh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onyeka_Onwenu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Onyeka Onwenu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stella_Chinyelu_Okoli", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stella Chinyelu Okoli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddington_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reddington Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Centre_for_Women_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Centre for Women Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_Television_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian Television Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imo_State", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imo State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Imo State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PolyGram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PolyGram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMI", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EMI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_Agency_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "News Agency of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_degradation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environmental degradation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "News presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gospel music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger_Delta", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Niger Delta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://nairametrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-6.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777695", "eventUri": "eng-9777695", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

The musical legend used her music and its timeless messages to promote Nigeria's culture.\n\nHer music duet with King Sunny Ade entitled \"Wait for Me\" has remained evergreen. It is remembered always as a song with deep lyrical message which was put together to help the government of that era fight seriously against the outburst of population explosion while also regulating it with the different family planning programmes put together by the government.\n\nHer song, \"African Woman'', helped greatly in projecting the innate exquisiteness of the African woman giving them a sense of pride and belonging amid poverty, widowhood, rape, lack of care, hatred, humiliation and abandonment, among others.\n\nHer evergreen classic, \"Sodom and Gomorrah'', is a biblical narrative of the popular story of the city of Sodom and Gomorrah, a city destroyed by God due to their heedlessness and high level of immorality.\n\nOnwenu has also acted in several Nollywood films and won numerous awards for her contributions to music and film.\n\nIn addition to her entertainment career, Onwenu has also been involved in politics.\n\nShe was appointed as the Chairperson of the Imo State Council for Arts and Culture in 2013 and later became the Director-General of the National Centre for Women Development in 2016.\n\nShe was awarded the National Honours of Member of the Order of the Federal Republic (MFR) in 2011.", "source": {"uri": "thenewsguru.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheNewsGuru"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ediri_oyibo@thenewsguru.com", "name": "Ediri Oyibo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onyeka_Onwenu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Onyeka Onwenu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddington_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reddington Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Sunny_Ad\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "King Sunny Ad\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anambra_State", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anambra State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Anambra State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obosi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obosi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Obosi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Centre_for_Women_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Centre for Women Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Federal_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Order of the Federal Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodom_and_Gomorrah", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sodom and Gomorrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Family planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imo_State", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imo State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Imo State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://thenewsguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot_20220130-151620_Facebook-e1722404334297.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777695", "eventUri": "eng-9777695", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Born on January 31,1952, she was aged 72 years, The Niche has reported.\n\nShe was said to have died at the Reddington Hospital in Lagos after slumping at the birthday party of Mrs. Stella Okoli.\n\nMs. Onwenu performed at the 80th birthday party of Mrs. Okoli, a pharmacist, and founder of Emzor pharmaceutical manufacturing company in Lagos.\n\nA guest at the party who spoke to TheNiche said they thought it was all a joke.\n\n\"I have never seen anything like this before. She had just come down from the stage after performing energetically and admirably as always. And went to her seat where she slumped. It is still like a dream.\"\n\nAnother eyewitness who was also at the party who confirmed the sad news to TheNiche said: \"It is very sad. Onyeka Onwenu just performed at the birthday of Mrs. Stella Okoli today, and after performing, she slumped. She was taken to Reddington Hospital and she couldn't make it.\"\n\nAs at the time of going to press, TheNiche reliably gathered that even the doctors were in disbelief and are yet to take her body to the morgue.\n\nAnother source who was among the people that rushed her to the hospital said, \"Apparently, she had a heart attack. The doctor has advised that the body should be kept until later this morning. It is unbelievable.\"\n\nOnyeka was a singer, songwriter, actress, human rights and social activist, journalist, politician, and former X Factor series judge.\n\nDubbed the \"Elegant Stallion\" by the Nigerian press, she is a former chairperson of the Imo State Council for Arts and Culture.\n\nIn 2013 she was appointed the Executive Director/Chief Executive Officer of the National Centre for Women Development.\n\nOnwenu hailed from Arondizuogu, a town in Ideato North, Imo State, but was raised in Port Harcourt, the capital city of Rivers State.\n\nShe was the youngest daughter of Nigerian educationist and politician D. K. Onwenu, who died when she was four years old in an autocrash a week before his appointment as Minister for Education, leaving his widow, Hope, to raise five children alone.\n\nOnwenu possessed a BA in International Relations and Communication from Wellesley College, Massachusetts, and an MA in Media Studies from The New School for Social Research, New York.\n\nShe worked for the United Nations as a tour guide before returning to Nigeria in 1980 to complete her mandatory one-year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) with the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nAs an NTA employee, Onwenu made an impact as a newsreader and reporter. In 1984, she wrote and presented the internationally acclaimed BBC/NTA documentary \"Nigeria: A Squandering of Riches,\" which became the definitive film about corruption in Nigeria, as well as the intractable Niger Delta agitation for resource control and campaign against environmental degradation in the oil rich region of Nigeria.\n\nA former member of the NTA board, she has also worked as a TV presenter, hosting the shows Contact (1988) and Who's On? (1993) both on NTA Network.\n\nMusic\n\nOriginally a secular artist, Onwenu made the transition to gospel music in the 90s, and most of her songs are self-penned. She continued to write and sing about issues such as health (HIV/AIDS), peace and mutual coexistence, respect for women's rights, and the plight of children.\n\nShe began her recording career in 1981 while still with the NTA, releasing the album For the Love of You, a pop album which featured an orchestral cover of Johnny Nash's \"Hold Me Tight\", produced by Berkley Jones. Her second album was Endless Life, produced by Sonny Okosun, and included another cover - the Everley Brothers' \"Walk Right Back\". Both records were released under the EMI label.\n\nOnwenu's first album with Polygram, In The Morning Light, was released in 1984. Recorded in London, it featured the track \"Masterplan\" written by close friend Tyna Onwudiwe who had previously contributed to Onwenu's BBC documentary and subsequently sang back-up vocals on the album.\n\nIn 1986, she released One Love which contained an updated version of the song \"(In the) Morning Light from the previous album. Another song, \"You and I\", was re-recorded for the 2001 film Conspiracy starring Nkem Owoh and Onwenu herself.\n\nFor the 1988 album Dancing In The Sun, Onwenu adopted a more Afrocentric sound and collaborated with veteran j\u00f9j\u00fa artist Sunny Ade on the track \"Madawolohun (Let Them Say)\". This was the first of three songs the pair worked on together; the other two - \"Choices\" and \"Wait For Me\" - centred on family planning, and were endorsed by the Planned Parenthood Federation of Nigeria who used \"Choices\" in their PSA.\n\nDancing In The Sun, Onwenu's final release on Polygram, was dedicated to Winnie Mandela, the subject of a song of the same name which Onwenu performed live when Nelson Mandela and his wife visited Nigeria in 1990 following his release from prison.\n\nOnwenu diverted to Benson and Hedges Music in 1992 and released the self-titled Onyeka!, her only album with the label, after which she made the transition to Christian/gospel music. Her latest collection, \"Inspiration for Change,\" focused on the need for an attitudinal change in Nigeria.\n\nActing\n\nOnwenu's first movie role was as Joke, a childless woman who adopts an abandoned baby in Zik Zulu Okafor's Nightmare.\n\nShe has since featured in numerous Nollywood movies, and in 2006 she won the Africa Movie Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her performance in the movie \"Widow's Cot\". She was also nominated that same year for Africa Movie Academy Award for \"Best Actress in a Leading Role\" in the movie \"Rising Moon\".\n\nIn 2014 she was in the movie Half of a Yellow Sun with Chiwetel Ejiofor and Thandiwe Newton, and Lion Heart (2018).\n\nPolitics\n\nOnwenu was a member of the Peoples Democratic Party. She contested twice to become the Local Council Chairman of her Local Government, Ideato North Local Government Area of Imo State, and lost at both attempts but was appointed Chairperson of Imo State Council for Arts and Culture by former governor Ikedi Ohakim. On September 16, 2013, President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan appointed her the Executive Director/Chief Executive Officer of the National Centre for Women Development.\n\nActivism\n\nIn 2000, Onwenu protested against her former employer NTA over their refusal to pay royalties on her songs (NTA 2 Channel 5 had used \"Iyogogo\", a track from the Onyeka! album, in station idents without asking her permission). After then-director general Ben Murray-Bruce blacklisted her from transmission, she embarked on a hunger strike outside the station's premises.\n\nOnwenu's activism attracted widespread support from various artists, including Charly Boy, who lambasted Nigeria's reluctance to pay royalties when songs are broadcast on television and radio. NTA resolved to settle the issue amicably but denied barring Onwenu from appearing on their channels.\n\nThe protest was called off after six days when Onwenu and NTA came to an arrangement regarding royalties.\n\nThe Niche", "source": {"uri": "nationalaccordnewspaper.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Accord Newspaper"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

K. Onwenu, who tragically passed away in an auto crash when she was just four years old, a week before he was appointed Minister for Education.\n\nOnwenu's impressive career spans several fields, including music, acting, human rights activism, journalism, and politics.\n\nKnown for her powerful voice and charismatic stage presence, she earned the nickname \"Elegant Stallion\" from the Nigerian press.\n\nShe served as the chairperson of the Imo State Council for Arts and Culture and was also a judge on the X Factor series.\n\nHer music resonates across generations, with iconic songs like \"One Love\" and \"You and I,\" the latter popularised further by Africa Magic. Another notable song, \"Ekwe,\" holds a significant place in cultural history and is often remembered for its bold and somewhat combative tone, reminiscent of the struggles faced by earlier generations.\n\nOnwenu's legacy as a singer/songwriter, actress, and social activist continues to inspire and influence Nigerian culture and beyond.\n\nHer songs create awareness about diverse salient issues and a recent one in 2022 was to support widows - understanding their plights in Nigeria, Africa and the world at large\n\nOnwenu announced that her latest song titled, 'Rise Up', was written and produced in partnership with the Rose of Sharon Foundation, to draw attention to the plight of widows in society.\n\nThe foundation is owned by Folorunsho Alakija, one of the richest black women in the world.\n\nEarly Life and Education: Born on May 17, 1952, in Oguta, Imo State, Nigeria. She attended Wellesley College in Massachusetts, USA, where she earned a Bachelor's degree in International Relations and Communication.\n\nMusic Career: Onwenu began her music career in the 1980s, becoming known as the \"Elegant Stallion.\" She has released several albums, blending genres like highlife, pop, and gospel.

She has contested twice to become the Local Council Chairman of her local government and lost at both attempts, but was appointed Chairperson of Imo State Council for Arts and Culture by former Governor Ikedi Ohakim.\n\nOn September 16, 2013, President Goodluck Jonathan appointed her the Executive Director/Chief Executive Officer of the National Centre for Women Development.\n\nShe was awarded the Member of the Order of the Niger (MON) for her contributions to the Nigerian entertainment industry.\n\nAlso, she received the award of the Member of the Order of the Federal Republic (MFR) in 2011.\n\nIn 2000, Onwenu protested against her former employer NTA over their refusal to pay royalties on her songs and after then-director general Ben Murray-Bruce blacklisted her from the transmission, she embarked on a hunger strike outside the stations.\n\nOnwenu's activism attracted widespread support from various artists, including Charly Boy, who lambasted Nigeria's reluctance to pay royalties when songs are broadcast on television and radio. NTA resolved to settle the issue amicably but denied barring Onwenu from appearing on their channels.\n\nShe made a very touching viral BBC short documentary about Nigeria 40 years ago, where she stated that nothing seems to have changed in how we manage our economy, politics, leadership, etc. It's like Nigeria has been in a cycle since Independence. It was titled, \"A Squandering of Riches.\"\n\nOnwenu notably keeps her personal life private and often refuses to disclose private information regarding her ex-husband, a Yoruba Muslim, with whom she bore two children - Tijani Charles and Abraham.\n\nOnwenu and Fela Kuti, two iconic figures in Nigerian music, were often the subject of rumours regarding a romantic relationship.\n\nDespite the widespread speculation, Onyeka Onwenu has consistently denied any romantic involvement with Fela Kuti.\n\nShe also said this in a viral podcast\n\nAlso, in her autobiography \"My Father's Daughter,\" she addressed these rumours directly, clarifying that while she had great respect for Fela and admired his musical talent and activism, their relationship was purely professional and based on mutual respect.\n\nShe acknowledged that they collaborated and shared common goals in their advocacy for social and political change in Nigeria, but any suggestions of a romantic relationship were unfounded.\n\nThis clarification helped to put the longstanding rumours to rest, focusing attention instead on their significant contributions to Nigerian music and culture.\n\nOnyeka Onwenu had a notable collaboration with King Sunny Ade, one of Nigeria's most celebrated musicians. Their professional relationship was marked by the release of the hit song \"Wait for Me\" in 1984, which became a significant success in Nigeria.\n\n\"Wait for Me\" was more than just a song; it was

The doctor has advised that the body should be kept until later this morning. It is unbelievable.\"\n\nOnyeka was a singer, songwriter, actress, human rights and social activist, journalist, politician, and former X Factor series judge.\n\nDubbed the \"Elegant Stallion\" by the Nigerian press, she is a former chairperson of the Imo State Council for Arts and Culture.\n\nIn 2013 she was appointed the Executive Director/Chief Executive Officer of the National Centre for Women Development.\n\nOnwenu hailed from Arondizuogu, a town in Ideato North, Imo State, but was raised in Port Harcourt, the capital city of Rivers State.\n\nShe was the youngest daughter of Nigerian educationist and politician D. K. Onwenu, who died when she was four years old in an auto crash a week before his appointment as Minister for Education, leaving his widow, Hope, to raise five children alone.\n\nOnwenu possessed a BA in International Relations and Communication from Wellesley College, Massachusetts, and an MA in Media Studies from The New School for Social Research, New York.\n\nShe worked for the United Nations as a tour guide before returning to Nigeria in 1980 to complete her mandatory one-year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) with the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nAs an NTA employee, Onwenu made an impact as a newsreader and reporter. In 1984, she wrote and presented the internationally acclaimed BBC/NTA documentary \"Nigeria: A Squandering of Riches,\" which became the definitive film about corruption in Nigeria, as well as the intractable Niger Delta agitation for resource control and campaign against environmental degradation in the oil rich region of Nigeria.\n\nA former member of the NTA board, she has also worked as a TV presenter, hosting the shows Contact (1988) and Who's On? (1993) both on NTA Network.\n\nMusic\n\nOriginally a secular artist, Onwenu made the transition to gospel music in the 90s, and most of her songs are self-penned. She continued to write and sing about issues such as health (HIV/AIDS), peace and mutual coexistence, respect for women's rights, and the plight of children.\n\nShe began her recording career in 1981 while still with the NTA, releasing the album For the Love of You, a pop album which featured an orchestral cover of Johnny Nash's \"Hold Me Tight\", produced by Berkley Jones. Her second album was Endless Life, produced by Sonny Okosun, and included another cover - the Everley Brothers' \"Walk Right Back\". Both records were released under the EMI label.\n\nOnwenu's first album with Polygram, In The Morning Light, was released in 1984. Recorded in London, it featured the track \"Masterplan\" written by close friend Tyna Onwudiwe who had previously contributed to Onwenu's BBC documentary and subsequently sang back-up vocals on the album.\n\nIn 1986, she released One Love which contained an updated version of the song \"(In the) Morning Light from the previous album. Another song, \"You and I\", was re-recorded for the 2001 film Conspiracy starring Nkem Owoh and Onwenu herself.\n\nFor the 1988 album Dancing In The Sun, Onwenu adopted a more Afrocentric sound and collaborated with veteran j\u00f9j\u00fa artist Sunny Ade on the track \"Madawolohun (Let Them Say)\". This was the first of three songs the pair worked on together; the other two - \"Choices\" and \"Wait For Me\" - centred on family planning, and were endorsed by the Planned Parenthood Federation of Nigeria who used \"Choices\" in their PSA.\n\nDancing In The Sun, Onwenu's final release on Polygram, was dedicated to Winnie Mandela, the subject of a song of the same name which Onwenu performed live when Nelson Mandela and his wife visited Nigeria in 1990 following his release from prison.\n\nOnwenu diverted to Benson and Hedges Music in 1992 and released the self-titled Onyeka!, her only album with the label, after which she made the transition to Christian/gospel music. Her latest collection, \"Inspiration for Change,\" focused on the need for an attitudinal change in Nigeria.\n\nActing\n\nOnwenu's first movie role was as Joke, a childless woman who adopts an abandoned baby in Zik Zulu Okafor's Nightmare.\n\nShe has since featured in numerous Nollywood movies, and in 2006 she won the Africa Movie Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her performance in the movie \"Widow's Cot\". She was also nominated that same year for Africa Movie Academy Award for \"Best Actress in a Leading Role\" in the movie \"Rising Moon\".\n\nIn 2014 she was in the movie Half of a Yellow Sun with Chiwetel Ejiofor and Thandiwe Newton, and Lion Heart (2018).\n\nPolitics\n\nOnwenu was a member of the Peoples Democratic Party. She contested twice to become the Local Council Chairman of her Local Government, Ideato North Local Government Area of Imo State, and lost at both attempts but was appointed Chairperson of Imo State Council for Arts and Culture by former governor Ikedi Ohakim. On September 16, 2013, President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan appointed her the Executive Director/Chief Executive Officer of the National Centre for Women Development.\n\nActivism\n\nIn 2000, Onwenu protested against her former employer NTA over their refusal to pay royalties on her songs (NTA 2 Channel 5 had used \"Iyogogo\", a track from the Onyeka! album, in station idents without asking her permission). After then-director general Ben Murray-Bruce blacklisted her from transmission, she embarked on a hunger strike outside the station's premises.\n\nOnwenu's activism attracted widespread support from various artists, including Charly Boy, who lambasted Nigeria's reluctance to pay royalties when songs are broadcast on television and radio. NTA resolved to settle the issue amicably but denied barring Onwenu from appearing on their channels.\n\nThe protest was called off after six days when Onwenu and NTA came to an arrangement regarding royalties.", "source": {"uri": "pointblanknews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pointblank News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onyeka_Onwenu", "type":

The song was interpolated by P-Square in their single 'Bank Alert'.", "source": {"uri": "pulse.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pulse Nigeria"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adeayo_adebiyi@pulse.ng", "name": "Adeayo Adebiyi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onyeka_Onwenu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Onyeka Onwenu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigerians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Music of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbo_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Igbo culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burna_Boy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Burna Boy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundtrack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soundtrack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oguchi_Onyewu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oguchi Onyewu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gospel music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00f9j\u00fa_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J\u00f9j\u00fa music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Sunny_Ad\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "King Sunny Ad\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-Square", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "P-Square"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pidgin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Funk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Folk music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbo_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Igbo people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spirituality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound_Files", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound Files", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/History", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/X2wktkpTURBXy9mM2VlMDY3YTFkYWY3NWVjYzM3ZDVkZDZmYjg0ZTU0YS5qcGeSlQMAPM0DQ80B1pMFzQSwzQJ2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777695", "eventUri": "eng-9777695", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

However, her family is yet to confirm the news.\n\nShe died aged 72.\n\nHere are six key facts about the renowned Nigerian figure:\n\nEARLY LIFE\n\nOnwenu, born January 31, 1952, hailed from Arondizuogu, a big town in Ideato North, Imo State, southeastern Nigeria, but was raised in Port Harcourt, the capital city of Rivers State, Nigeria.\n\nShe was the youngest daughter of Nigerian educationist and politician D. K. Onwenu, who died when she was four years old in an autocrash a week before his appointment as Minister for Education, leaving his widow, Hope, to raise five children alone after her husband's family denied her access to his property.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nOnwenu possessed a BA in International Relations and Communication from Wellesley College, Massachusetts, and an MA in Media Studies from The New School for Social Research, New York. She worked for the United Nations as a tour guide before returning to Nigeria in 1980 to complete her mandatory one-year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) with the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nCAREEER\n\nAs an NTA employee, Onwenu made an impact as a newsreader and reporter. In 1984, she wrote and presented the internationally acclaimed BBC/NTA documentary Nigeria: A Squandering of Riches which became the definitive film about corruption in Nigeria, as well as the intractable Niger Delta agitation for resource control and campaign against environmental degradation in the oil rich region of Nigeria. A former member of the NTA board, she has also worked as a TV presenter, hosting the shows Contact (1988) and Who's On? (1993) both on NTA Network.\n\nOnwenu began her music career in the 1980s, becoming known as the \"Elegant Stallion.\" She has released several albums, blending genres like highlife, pop, and gospel. Some of her popular songs include \"One Love\" and \"You and I.\"\n\nShe has also made a significant mark in Nollywood, starring in numerous films and television series. Half of a Yellow Sun, Lion Heart, Muna, and many others.\n\nPOLITICS\n\nOnwenu was a member of the People's Democratic Party (PDP). She contested twice to become the Local Council Chairman of her Local Government, Ideato North Local Government Area of Imo State and lost at both attempts, but was appointed Chairperson of Imo State Council for Arts and Culture by former governor Ikedi Ohakim.\n\nOn 16 September 2013, President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan appointed her the Executive Director/Chief Executive Officer of the National Centre for Women Development (NCWD).\n\nACTIVISM\n\nIn 2000, Onwenu protested against her former employer NTA over their refusal to pay royalties on her songs (NTA 2 Channel 5 had used \"Iyogogo\", a track from the Onyeka! album, in station idents without asking her permission). After then-director general Ben Murray-Bruce blacklisted her from transmission, she embarked on a hunger strike outside the station's premises.\n\nOnwenu's activism attracted widespread support from various artists, including Charly Boy, who lambasted Nigeria's reluctance to pay royalties when songs are broadcast on television and radio. NTA resolved to settle the issue amicably but denied barring Onwenu from appearing on their channels. The protest was called off after six days when Onwenu and NTA came to an arrangement regarding royalties.\n\nPERSONAL LIFE\n\nOnwenu notably kept her personal life private and often refused to disclose private information regarding her ex-husband, a Yoruba Muslim. She was the mother of two children - Tijani Charles and Abraham.", "source": {"uri": "dailytrust.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Trust"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The ace songwriter passed away on Tuesday night at the Reddington Hospital in Lagos.\n\nOnwenu had attended the 80th birthday party of Stella Okoli, the founder of Emzor Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Company, in Lagos. Referred to as the 'Elegant Stallion,' the singer slumped at the birthday party after performing.\n\nAs of the time of this report, the singer's family has not yet made an official announcement regarding her death.\n\nOnyeka was born on January 31, 1952, in Arondizuogu, a small town in Ideato North, Imo state. She was raised in Port Harcourt, the capital city of Rivers state.\n\nIn the 70s, she attended Wellesley College, Massachusetts, where she obtained a BA in International Relations and Communication. She also earned an MA in Media Studies from The New School for Social Research, New York.\n\nOnwenu worked for the United Nations as a tour guide before returning to Nigeria in 1980 to complete her mandatory one-year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) with the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) in Lagos. She then worked as a reporter at NTA. In 1984, she wrote and presented the internationally acclaimed BBC/NTA documentary 'Nigeria: A Squandering of Riches,' which was turned into a film about corruption in Nigeria and the Niger Delta agitation for resource control and campaign against environmental degradation.\n\nOnwenu also worked as a TV presenter, hosting the shows 'Contact' (1988) and 'Who's On?' (1993) both on the NTA Network. She then ventured into the music industry, beginning her recording career in 1981 while still with the NTA, releasing an album titled 'For the Love of You'. Her sophomore album, 'Endless Life,' was produced by the late Sonny Okosun.\n\nIn 1986, she delivered her award-winning hit song 'One Love'. Another hit song, 'You and I,' was re-recorded for the 2001 film 'Conspiracy' starring actor Nkem Owoh and herself. She also released numerous other projects, including 'Iyogogo,' 'Falling in Love,' 'Odenigbo,' 'Ekwe,' 'Alleluya,' and 'Dancing in the Sun.'\n\nHer first role in a movie was in Zik Zulu Okafor's 'Nightmare,' where she played the character of a childless woman who adopted an abandoned baby. She featured in numerous Nollywood movies, winning the Africa Movie Academy Award for 'Best Actress in a Supporting Role' in 2006 for her performance in 'Widow's Cot.' Her acclaimed albums, including 'In The Morning Light' and 'Dancing In The Sun,' showcased her extraordinary talent and contributed significantly to the rich tapestry of Nigerian music.\n\nIn addition to her musical success, she was celebrated for her roles in prominent films such as 'Half of a Yellow Sun' and 'Lionheart.'\n\nBeyond her artistic achievements, Onwenu was also a prominent figure in Nigerian politics and women's rights. She served as the Chairperson of the Imo State Council for Arts and Culture and later as the Director-General of the National Centre for Women Development.", "source": {"uri": "tv360nigeria.com",

The elegant stallion. A name given to her by the Nigerian Media.\n\nOnyeka Onwenu. She died doing what she loved to do most. Entertaining. Singing. Dancing. Bringing joy to the soul.\n\nWhen the news of her passing broke Tuesday night, it sounded unbelievable. Not a few people thought, and felt it was a joke. But she was gone. With her sonorous voice. Her elegance. Her energetic performance.\n\nOnyeka, the firebrand musician, song writer, journalist, actor, dancer, civil rights activist, Ada Mazi, proudly Igbo, disappeared from mother-earth when it was least expected. Just like that.\n\nShe was contracted to perform at the 80th birthday party of another proudly Igbo Lady- Stella Okoli, Pharmacist and the owner of Emzor Pharmaceuticals.\n\nOnyeka herself was 72 years old. But age never interfered with her performance on stage. She usually gave it her all.\n\nHer performance on this 30th July at Mrs Okoli's birthday was no different.\n\nShe gave it her all. And sang a number of her hit songs to the admiration and applause of the adoring audience. They clapped and swayed to her melodious voice. Iconic songs. She danced along with them.\n\nBut that turned out to be her last performance on this side of God's creation.\n\nAfter the performance, she walked back to her seat, eye witnesses said. And, just like a joke, she slumped.\n\nRushed by a number of people to the high profile Redington Hospital for help, she simply gave up. Just like that, before the equally shocked medical crew.\n\nExhaustion? Perhaps? Stress? Perhaps? But those who should know attribute this unbelievable passing to cardiac arrest. How?, many ask in confusion. Did she have a heart disease she was not aware of? Probably. Or, did she push herself too hard? Who knows?\n\nWhatever, Onyeka Onwenu is gone. She's gone to sing no more. To dance no more. To act no more.\n\nA native of Arondizogu, Imo State, Onyeka sprang to national consciousness with her world acclaimed documentary - \"Nigeria, A Squandering of Riches\".\n\nShe delved in and out of politics, but was never successful.\n\nShe fared better in political appointments. She was once the Chairperson of Imo State Council of Arts and Culture.

The singer slumped and died shortly after performing at a birthday party in Lagos.\n\nAs we reflect on Onyeka Onwenu's remarkable career, we are reminded of the undeniable impact she left on the Nigerian entertainment industry.\n\nOnwenu's musical career began in the early 1980s with the release of her debut album, Endless Life, produced by the legendary Sunny Okosun. This album was an instant hit, setting the stage for what would be a remarkable career as a singer-songwriter.\n\nOver the years, Onwenu released a series of successful albums, showcasing her versatility and musical genius. Her 1984 album, Golden Songs Volume 1, featured 10 tracks with Onwenu as the sole vocalist. Also, she showcased her talent as a skilled songwriter in all of her albums. Her music was a blend of Afropop, Juju, and highlife.\n\nAdditionally, she incorporated both English and local languages in her music. She made it a point to deliver socially conscious songs that were relevant to societal issues Nigeria was facing at the time.\n\nOne of Onwenu's most iconic collaborations was her duet with the \"King of Juju Music,\" King Sunny Ad\u00e9, on the track Madawolohun (Let Them Say) from her Dancing in the Sun album.\n\nThe song was widely accepted by listeners and was celebrated for its unique sound. Subsequently, Onwenu collaborated with King Sunny Ad\u00e9 on two more tracks, Wait for Me and Choices.\n\nThese tracks discussed several important social issues such as family planning and birth control. These topics were generally seen as taboo in Nigeria to discuss publicly.\n\nThroughout her musical career, Onwenu used her platform to address topics like HIV/AIDS, peace, and human rights. These made her widely known as an artiste-activist.\n\nIn addition to her remarkable musical career, Onyeka Onwenu made a significant impact on the Nigerian film industry, Nollywood. She made her acting debut in 1999 with the film Nightmare and went on to star in numerous iconic roles, working alongside some of Nollywood's most renowned actors.\n\nOnwenu's most acclaimed film is Women's Cot, released in 2006. The film earned four nominations at the 2nd Africa Movie Academy Awards, and Onwenu's co-star, Joke Silva, won the award for Best Actress for her performance in the film. Women's Cot is an exploration of the challenges faced by widows in Nigerian society. The film tells the story of a widow whose in-laws treat her poorly after the passing of her husband, leading her to join the widow's cot.\n\nOnyeka Onwenu's passing is a profound loss for the Nigerian entertainment industry and the country as a whole. Through her music and her acting, she entertained thousands of Nigerians. Surprisingly, her last public appearance was a musical performance at a birthday party.\n\nAs we mourn the loss of this exceptional talent, we also celebrate the legacy she has left behind.", "source": {"uri": "guardian.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onyeka_Onwenu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Onyeka Onwenu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Music of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Okosun", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sonny Okosun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Sunny_Ad\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "King Sunny Ad\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juju", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juju"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Highlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_popular_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African popular music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joke_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joke Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Award for Best Actress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Family planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigerians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AIDS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Reviews", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_7465-640x360.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777695", "eventUri": "eng-9777695", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 460122112, "relevance": 2}

The departed artist was originally a secular artist before transitioning to gospel music in the 1990s.\n\nOnyeka Onwenu released this vibrant highlife track in 1984 from her album Golden Songs Vol.2. The song portrays the act of unrequited love. Iyogogo would later be sampled by popular Afrobetas duo PSquare in their 2016 hit song \"Bank Alert\".\n\nIn 2000, Onwenu protested against her previous employer, NTA, for failing to pay royalties on her songs (NTA 2 Channel 5 had used \"Iyogogo\" in station idents without her consent). After then-director general Ben Murray-Bruce banned her from transmission, she went on a hunger strike outside the station's grounds.\n\nThis evergreen song, from her studio album Golden Songs Vol.3, ruled the airwaves in the early 90s.\n\nThe song illuminates the importance of inner peace and general peace in the world, as Onyeka calls on God's greatest emotion, love, to unite humans' hearts.\n\nThis is another of Owenu's songs that has remained prominent to date.\n\nSung in her Indigenous dialect, Igbo, The Elegant Stallion, as she was fondly referred to, sang about the ills and troubles of critics, employing brilliant storytelling skills to pass her message.\n\nOchie Dike speaks about love for a mother, as Onyeka prayed to God almighty to safeguard her mother and fill her with his blessing.\n\nThe song was also sampled by PSqaure in 2016, with the same song title, \"Ochie Dike,\" featuring rapper Phyno.\n\nWait for Me, originally owned by King Sunny, was another song that put Onyeka Owenu at the forefront during her heydays.\n\nThe Grammy-nominated Fuji star featured her in it. Wait For Me was released in 1989 and has remained one of her fans' favourites.\n\nThis classic remains one of Onyeka's most remarkable songs which has torched the hearts of her fans intensely.\n\nYou and I was adapted by Stanley Okorie for the 2001 Nollywood blockbuster 'Conspiracy', in which the departed songstress also played the role of a mad woman named Grace.\n\nThe movie also starred Nollywood legend Nkem Owoh and is still remembered to this day for its soundtrack.\n\nThis sensational classic would be Onwenu's final release on Polygram and was dedicated to Winnie Mandela, the subject of a song of the same name, which Onwenu performed live when Nelson Mandela and his wife visited Nigeria in 1990 following his release from prison.\n\n'Alleluya', 'Madawonlohun' with Sunny Ade, 'Choices' with King Sunny Ade, 'Falling In Love', 'Odenigbo', 'Wait For Me', 'Greatest Love', 'Bia Nulu' and many more.\n\nIn another entertainment report, Nollywood veteran Charles Inojie was overly filled with immeasurable gratitude as he narrowly escaped death in his residential home.\n\nCharles Inojie took to Instagram to share his testimony, recounting how he nearly missed death. He disclosed that God came through for him, much to the chagrin of the devil.\n\nAccording to the seasoned actor, his tank had fallen on his favourite sitting position, his customary spot, a few

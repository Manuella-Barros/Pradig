He's come close several times throughout his seven years in Boston - making it to the conference finals four times and the NBA Finals once - but ultimately has struggled to secure banner 18.\n\nNow, following a dominant 64-18 regular season, each passing game of the postseason breeds higher expectations for this Tatum-led Celtics team.\n\n\"I feel like his time is now, and he understands the process. He understands the moment, he understands what he has to give the moment,\" former Celtic and Naismith Hall of Famer Paul Pierce said following Tuesday night's matchup.\n\n\"The moment\" demands more than soaring offensive contributions, however. It requires selflessness and composure, two qualities which Pierce thinks Tatum has strengthened since his last Finals appearance in 2022.\n\n\"I've seen true growth in Tatum. Last year he went from a guy who averaged 30 to a guy who understands that he doesn't have to have 30 to win. I see his maturity and he's more vocal. He's more of a leader, I feel like,\" Pierce said.\n\nOn a night when Tatum scored just 18 points on 19 attempts, he proved he could be a key distributor, adding 5 assists and 11 rebounds (two offensive). His ability to read the game and understand his role through each matchup is the secret weapon, Pierce argues.\n\nPierce's former teammate, longtime Celtic and sharpshooter Eddie House, agrees.\n\n\"That's the maturation that we've seen in Jayson Tatum, that's why I think this team is so good,\" House said. \"When you have a selfless superstar, somebody who can go out there and get 30 shots up whenever they want.

The Cavs played the C's tight early on, but Jayson Tatum and company managed to build a double-digit lead that they held for most of the game.\n\nAs has been the case throughout the playoffs, though, the Celtics weren't actually led by Tatum in terms of production on the court. Once again, it was Jaylen Brown (32 PTS, 6 REB, 2 AST, 12/18 FGM) and Derrick White (25 PTS, 5 AST, 1 REB, 9/16 FGM) leading the way, while Tatum struggled to find his shot (18 PTS, 11 REB, 5 AST, 7/19 FGM).\n\nThere's not much to complain about for Boston so far this postseason, as they are playing at a high level as a team and blowing their opponents out of the water currently. But if there is one thing to worry about right now, it may just be Tatum and his lingering woes to start the postseason.\n\nCeltics getting by despite Jayson Tatum's struggles...for now\n\nThe 2023-24 campaign was a year of maturation for Tatum with the Celtics. His numbers took a step back from last season (26.9 PPG, 8.1 RPG, 4.9 APG, 47.1 FG%), but that was largely because of the increase in options Boston had at his disposal. Tatum's scoring decreased a bit because he did not have to take as many shots as he had been taking over the past three seasons.\n\nTo an extent, that's why the C's have been able to get by without Tatum doing much so far this postseason. After his latest poor shooting night, Tatum's numbers through the team's first six playoff games (21.2 PPG, 10.5 RPG, 5.3 APG, 40.6 FG%) are fairly underwhelming. It's been great to see Tatum work hard as a rebounder and playmaker, but his scoring has left a lot to be desired.\n\nThankfully, Brown (24.3 PPG, 6.8 RPG, 2.2 APG, 54.5 FG%) and White (22.8 PPG, 3.5 APG, 3.2 RPG, 57.5 FG%) have picked up the slack to this point. Brown has been dominating on offense by relentlessly attacking the paint and getting to his spots in the midrange game, while White is shooting a blistering 50 percent from behind the arc through these first six games.\n\nThat's the luxury of having three 20-point per game scorers at your disposal, and another one lurking on the sidelines in Kristaps Porzingis as he works his way back from a soleus strain. But at some point, Tatum is going to have to step up for Boston and find a way to hit some shots on offense if this team wants to make good on their championship aspirations.\n\nWe have seen Tatum struggle at times in the playoffs, with the most glaring example of that coming in the 2022 NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors. That was the final series, though, in what had been a grueling postseason slate for the Celtics. Tatum ran out of gas against a high-powered Golden State defense, which was somewhat understandable considering the circumstances.\n\nThis time, he doesn't have the same excuses. Boston easily took down an overmatched Miami Heat squad in the first-round, and they quickly showed that when they are at their best, there is a sizable skill gap between themselves and the Cavaliers in the first game of this series. With all the favorable matchups he is getting with the ball in his hands, it's almost inconceivable that he is playing as poorly as he has been early on in the playoffs.\n\nThere are a couple of issues that are hurting Jayson Tatum currently. He's settling way too often for jumpers, either from behind the arc or at the midrange level, that are not falling. He's shooting just 25 percent from three so far, including an o-for-5 performance to open the series against Cleveland.\n\nPerhaps more confusingly, though, is that Tatum has shown an aversion to attacking the paint against overmatched defenders. Against the Heat, Tatum was hunting mismatches against the likes of Tyler Herro, Delon Wright, and Duncan Robinson, yet he rarely found his way to the paint against them. On the other hand, Brown has been making a living so far by barreling through these mismatches on his way to the rim for easy buckets.\n\nAgainst Cleveland, Tatum is going to have these mismatches at his disposal every single time he touches the ball. Neither Donovan Mitchell or Darius Garland are going to be able to do much against him defensively, and while Evan Mobley is one of the better all-around defenders in the game, the Cavs interior defense is going to be lacking for as long as Jarrett Allen is forced to sit on the sidelines as he nurses a rib injury.\n\nOnce he gets his game going in the paint, that's when Tatum can create more space for his jumpers. Isaac Okoro will likely be doing his best to shadow Tatum throughout this series, and truth be told, Cleveland did a good job of making his life difficult on offense for much of the night. But he's also playing into their hands by settling for tough jumpers when he has the ability to get to the rim at will against the Cavaliers undersized perimeter defenders.\n\nIt's a tough balance to find, and whereas Brown and White have figured out what they need to do on offense pretty quickly, Tatum is still trying to find a way to get going. It's encouraging to see them play as well as they have with his offensive numbers lagging behind, and he's stepped up his efforts as a rebounder and playmaker in order to compensate for these woes.\n\nBut at some point, Jayson Tatum is going to have to step up and become the best player on the Celtics. They haven't faced much adversity to this point in the postseason, but that's going to change the further they go in the playoffs. And when the lights are shining brightest, they are often going to shine on Tatum. So far, he hasn't been at his best for Boston, and while it's great that it hasn't impacted them yet, there will be a bit of lingering concern among the team and their fans for as long as these struggles continue.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "owen_crisafulli@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Owen Crisafulli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Field goal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ice hockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Mobley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evan Mobley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Okoro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isaac Okoro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Herro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Herro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darius Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delon_Wright", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delon Wright"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrett_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarrett Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Robinson_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duncan Robinson (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/7377329678.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551037", "eventUri": "eng-9551037", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

He's dead-last among Celtics rotation players in 3-point percentage (25 percent) and third in points per game (21.2), down more than five points from his regular-season scoring average (26.9)?\n\nThose stats are all accurate, and after Tatum mustered just 18 points on 7 of 19 shooting (0 of 5 from 3) in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals against the Cleveland Cavaliers, there's been increased chatter about Tatum's lack of offensive production being a potential issue for the title-favorite Celtics.\n\nHead coach Joe Mazzulla responded to that chatter Wednesday with some Tatum stats of his own.\n\n\"I don't think he's being forced to do anything,\" Mazzulla told reporters when asked about teams trying to limit Tatum's scoring output. \"I mean, he was 1.6 (points per possession) as a screener in our offense (in Game 1), which would be the best offense in the history of the world. He had 11 potential assists and he had 18 points and three blocks.\n\n\"So, I think he's doing a great job of taking what the defense gives him and finding any way to impact the game on both ends of the floor. That's what we need him to be, and I think he's doing a really good job of it.\"\n\nWhile Tatum's scoring is down, his playmaking is up significantly. He's averaging 5.3 assists per game this postseason -- fourth among all non-guards in the playoffs behind only Nikola Jokic, LeBron James and Joel Embiid -- and leads the Celtics with 9.7 potential assists per game.\n\n\"I think he's becoming a playmaker, or he's being a playmaker,\" guard Jrue Holiday said of Tatum. \"Not that he's being the sacrificial lamb, but he's making a lot of the right plays. He takes his chances where people are gonna double-team him, and he's gonna take some of those shots, but I think he's getting everybody open looks.\"\n\nThe Celtics boast a ridiculous 126.4 offensive rating this postseason with Tatum on the floor, and that number plummets to 101.7 when he's off the floor. But the stat that matters most to Boston is winning, and he's made considerable strides in impacting it in these playoffs, even when his shot isn't falling.\n\nConsider this: The Celtics are 4-0 with a double-digit average point differential this postseason when Tatum shoots worse than 40 percent from the floor, and 2-0 when he scores fewer than 20 points. Boston's record in those scenarios in the previous two postseasons: 7-8 and 4-6, respectively.\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();\n\n\"People can have bad shooting nights, but what is he doing? He has great defensive plays, he made the easy passes which led to assists and big rebounds,\" Celtics guard Payton Pritchard added of Tatum.\n\n\"It's just the casuals who think it's all about the shots. There's so many different areas he can affect the game, and if he only ends up with 18 points, but like we win by 25 points, he was very impactful.\"\n\nTo Pritchard's point, Tatum the facilitator helped Boston to a 25-point rout of the Cavs on Tuesday night. The Celtics star was content to let Jaylen Brown (32 points) and Derrick White (25 points) carry the load on offense while setting up his teammates (five assists) and impacting the game in other ways (11 rebounds, five assists).\n\nThe further the C's advance in the postseason, the slimmer the margin for error, and there might come a point where they need more from their best player in the scoring department. But this is the same player who owns the NBA record for most points in a Game 7 and dropped 46 points on the road to stave off elimination in a Game 6.\n\nIf Tatum fails to deliver in higher-stakes playoff scenarios, he'll open himself up to deserved criticism. In the meantime, however, his playmaking shouldn't go unnoticed as Boston steamrolls through Rounds 1 and 2.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payton_Pritchard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Payton Pritchard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnne.com/0aa2c327acb46448c841efb4cb6f1082", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551037", "eventUri": "eng-9551037", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "-07-08", "dateEnd": "2024-04-06", "textStart": 2597, "textEnd": 2608}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Luka Doncic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Jalen Brunson finished ahead of Tatum, which speaks to the overall motto of Boston's 2023-24 season: sacrifice.\n\nBefore the season began, Tatum led a team meeting, covering that very topic. The Celtics had just acquired Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday, adding two All-Star veterans to an already-talented starting five. Knowing adjustments were necessary for the new-and-improved Boston core to reach its potential, Tatum needed to set the record straight.\n\n\"We all are human and have feelings, and I opened the floor and basically said, 'There's six of us. Only five can play at one time One of us is not going to finish the game all the time,'\" Tatum explained to ESPN in November.\n\nTeammates Jaylen Brown, Derrick White, Al Horford, Porzingis, and Holiday each attended the preseason meeting. Ultimately, the Celtics elected to make Horford the team's unofficial sixth starter, playing off the bench, primarily along Boston's second unit. Considering Horford's age (37) and athletic limitations, the decision made all the sense in the world, especially with a 7-foot-2, 28-year-old Porzingis added to the mix.\n\nHowever, it wasn't just Horford who was impacted.\n\nWelcoming Porzingis and Holiday to the starting lineup meant that Tatum's scoring numbers would, too, take a slight backseat. This mindset resonated with Boston's entire locker room from Opening Night. Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla didn't need to worry about personal interests interfering with the team's primary motive -- a championship -- throughout the regular season.\n\nBoston finished with a league-best 64-18 record, losing no more than twice consecutively through the campaign. Consistently, the Celtics blew teams out, and that trend even snuck its way into the postseason. Tuesday night's 120-95 Game 1 win over the Cavaliers marked Boston's 19th win by 25-plus points -- the most in NBA history -- surpassing the 1971-72 Bucks and 2015-16 Spurs.\n\nTatum's performance to open up the Eastern Conference semifinals against Cleveland was one of the 26-year-old's less-than-stellar nights. He scored 18 points, shot 7-of-19 from the field, and missed all five 3-point attempts. Granted, in grabbing 11 rebounds, Tatum recorded his fifth double-double this postseason and the 40th of his career under the bright lights.\n\nEncapsulating what's allowed the Celtics to be the most dominant team in the NBA, Tatum applied the locker room's mentality. The Cavaliers smothered Tatum with multiple defenders focused primarily on him, and taking notice of that early, Tatum played a facilitator's role.\n\n\"It's really what I've been saying all year: we got a really, really talented team,\" Tatum said after Game 1. \"It shows the depth of our team and how we can win games in a lot of different ways. It just presents another challenge of what else can you do to impact the game in a positive way.\"\n\nBoston's true identity gave the Cavaliers a rude awakening, as it did to the Heat in the first round. Cleveland held a measly two-point lead in the first quarter, which lasted 18 seconds, and it was the team's only lead of the night.\n\nTatum and the Celtics are three wins away from taking their next step toward the postseason mountaintop and reaching the conference finals.", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gio_rivera@nesn.com", "name": "Gio Rivera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://nesn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/05/Jayson-Tatum-3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551037", "eventUri": "eng-9551037", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

How many Eastern Conference finals has he gone to?\" There's a softness I see with him,\" Murray prefaced before saying, \"He's not my favorite player on the team. There's something missing with him. Edwards is a badass. I want I would take Anthony Edwards.\"\n\n\"Tatum is with 6'9'' and plays like 6'11\",\" Felger prefaced before saying, \"Or he's 6'8'', but I feel like he plays like Durant.

Tatum is bigger and shoots a little better.\"\n\nThe Timberwolves are 6-0 through their first six games of the postseason while the Celtics are 5-1 through theirs. Both teams' stars should be celebrated, even if Tatum has taken a backseat to Jaylen Brown at times.\n\nBut Edwards is being portrayed as a top-five player in an almost artificial algorithmic way -- giving \"industry plant\" vibes even though Edwards is deserving of a serious amount of hype in his own right -- while Tatum is being bashed every time some other team's star player goes off.\n\nTatum is a victim of his own expectations, having come within a quarter of a Finals appearance and dunking on LeBron James in his first Finals appearance. Edwards, on the other hand, has had a slower build to stardom that started off with a 23-49 record his rookie year and two first-round eliminations in years two and three. Tatum, for the record, has never missed the postseason and has been bounced in the first round twice.\n\nOne can point to the supporting casts for why Tatum has gone further in his career, and to that, the Houdini asks: are we really punishing Tatum for being on a well-run franchise?\n\nThe answer is yes.

He's dead-last among Celtics rotation players in 3-point percentage (25 percent) and third in points per game (21.2), down more than five points from his regular-season scoring average (26.9)?\n\nThose stats are all accurate, and after Tatum mustered just 18 points on 7 of 19 shooting (0 of 5 from 3) in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals against the Cleveland Cavaliers, there's been increased chatter about Tatum's lack of offensive production being a potential issue for the title-favorite Celtics.\n\nHead coach Joe Mazzulla responded to that chatter Wednesday with some Tatum stats of his own.\n\n\"I don't think he's being forced to do anything,\" Mazzulla told reporters when asked about teams trying to limit Tatum's scoring output. \"I mean, he was 1.6 (points per possession) as a screener in our offense (in Game 1), which would be the best offense in the history of the world. He had 11 potential assists and he had 18 points and three blocks.\n\n\"So, I think he's doing a great job of taking what the defense gives him and finding any way to impact the game on both ends of the floor. That's what we need him to be, and I think he's doing a really good job of it.\"\n\nWhile Tatum's scoring is down, his playmaking is up significantly. He's averaging 5.3 assists per game this postseason -- fourth among all non-guards in the playoffs behind only Nikola Jokic, LeBron James and Joel Embiid -- and leads the Celtics with 9.7 potential assists per game.\n\n\"I think he's becoming a playmaker, or he's being a playmaker,\" guard Jrue Holiday said of Tatum. \"Not that he's being the sacrificial lamb, but he's making a lot of the right plays. He takes his chances where people are gonna double-team him, and he's gonna take some of those shots, but I think he's getting everybody open looks.\"\n\nThe Celtics boast a ridiculous 126.4 offensive rating this postseason with Tatum on the floor, and that number plummets to 101.7 when he's off the floor. But the stat that matters most to Boston is winning, and he's made considerable strides in impacting it in these playoffs, even when his shot isn't falling.\n\nConsider this: The Celtics are 4-0 with a double-digit average point differential this postseason when Tatum shoots worse than 40 percent from the floor, and 2-0 when he scores fewer than 20 points. Boston's record in those scenarios in the previous two postseasons: 7-8 and 4-6, respectively.\n\n\"People can have bad shooting nights, but what is he doing? He has great defensive plays, he made the easy passes which led to assists and big rebounds,\" Celtics guard Payton Pritchard added of Tatum.\n\n\"It's just the casuals who think it's all about the shots. There's so many different areas he can affect the game, and if he only ends up with 18 points, but like we win by 25 points, he was very impactful.\"\n\nTo Pritchard's point, Tatum the facilitator helped Boston to a 25-point rout of the Cavs on Tuesday night. The Celtics star was content to let Jaylen Brown (32 points) and Derrick White (25 points) carry the load on offense while setting up his teammates (five assists) and impacting the game in other ways (11 rebounds, five assists).\n\nThe further the C's advance in the postseason, the slimmer the margin for error, and there might come a point where they need more from their best player in the scoring department. But this is the same player who owns the NBA record for most points in a Game 7 and dropped 46 points on the road to stave off elimination in a Game 6.\n\nIf Tatum fails to deliver in higher-stakes playoff scenarios, he'll open himself up to deserved criticism. In the meantime, however, his playmaking shouldn't go unnoticed as Boston steamrolls through Rounds 1 and 2.\n\nGame 2 of Celtics-Cavs is set for Thursday at 7 p.m. ET, with NBC Sports Boston's coverage beginning at 6 p.m. with Celtics Pregame Live from TD Garden.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsportsboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Boston", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payton_Pritchard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Payton Pritchard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.nbcsportsboston.com/2024/05/Jayson-Tatum-USATSI_23214121.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551037", "eventUri": "eng-9551037", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "-07-08", "dateEnd": "2024-04-06", "textStart": 2597, "textEnd": 2608}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

The 26-year-old joined elite company alongside LeBron James and C's legend Larry Bird as the only players to record over 2,300 points, 750 rebounds, and 450 assists in their first 100 playoff games.\n\nWhile discussing the high-level accolade on NBC Sports Boston's Celtics Pregame Live, former Celtic Paul Pierce chimed in to give Tatum his flowers, noting that he has seen the five-time All-Star come a long way in both his physical skills and on-court mentality.\n\n\"I've seen true growth in Tatum,\" Pierce said of Tatum's 2024 campaign. \"Last year, he went from a guy that averaged 30 [points per game compared to this year, as a guy] that understands that he doesn't need 30 to get a win.\"\n\nLast year, Tatum ended the regular season averaging a career-high 30.1 points per game. This year, that total dropped to 26.1, instead buying into head coach Joe Mazzulla's team-first mentality -- putting individual accolades aside for team success. Tatum's field goal percentage benefitted as well, increasing from 46.6 percent from the field to 47.1, and 35 percent from deep to 37.6.\n\n\"I see his maturity -- he's more vocal, more of a leader, I feel like,\" Pierce added. \"I feel like his time is now and he understands the process, he understands the moment, he understands what he has to give in the moment.\"\n\nPierce adds that Tatum now has the mental maturity to know when to continue playing Mazzulla's team-first basketball or when it's time to play superstar and take over the game, compared to previous seasons where Tatum would look to prove he's the best on the court.\n\n\"He understands when he really needs to take that step up for the team to win, and he can do that for them,\" Pierce clarified.\n\nWith Tatum and co-star Jaylen Brown putting personal glory aside, teammates Derrick White, Sam Hauser, and Payton Pritchard have seen significant statistical leaps, contributing more to team wins -- something that has made Boston's offense nearly unguardable.\n\nThroughout the first five games of Boston's 2024 playoffs, Tatum has averaged 21.8 points, 10.4 rebounds, and 5.4 assists per game.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Pierce", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Boston", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Bird", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Larry Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Field goal percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payton_Pritchard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Payton Pritchard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/n6z7dH7Oe2d98UN6sQEHQQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnne.com/b4f9cb335b9f843f3b3224ef79eebcf3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551037", "eventUri": "eng-9551037", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Understanding the truth behind the box score", "body": "BOSTON -- If you turned on your TV Wednesday morning, you couldn't miss the praise for the Boston Celtics' blowout win to take a 1-0 series lead over the Cleveland Cavaliers. But there was a caveat.\n\nDerrick White was a star, Jaylen Brown was unstoppable, but Jayson Tatum had a bad shooting night. Shooting 0-for-5 from deep, and scoring 18 points, it was easy to write up a chyron wondering if the Celtics should be concerned about Tatum's shooting.\n\n\"It's just the casuals who think it's all about the shots,\" Payton Pritchard said at Wednesday's practice. \"But there's so many different areas he can affect the game. If he only gets 18 points, but we get a win by 25 points, he was very impactful.\"\n\nBut the questions pop up because it wasn't just the Cavaliers who had him missing. Tatum is connecting at 25 percent from 3-point range this postseason. Considering he is shooting 31 percent beyond the arc over the 26 games since the start of last year's playoffs, it is a fair question to ask.\n\n\"I think he's taking really good shots. I just think they're not falling,\" coach Joe Mazzulla said. \"I urge him to continue to take those, and they'll fall.\"\n\nThe perception has generally been that Tatum had an underwhelming shooting season. But after spending Christmas week in Los Angeles recalibrating his shot mechanics, something that regularly happens at some point every year, he shot 40.7 percent in the 39 games between January and March before he went on cruise control in April.\n\nHis touch has eluded him so far in the playoffs, but the Celtics haven't really been tested so far. So what happens when a team is good enough to have the Celtics on the ropes, start to finish?\n\n\"We're winning and he's playmaking. So it seems like he's handling it well,\" Jrue Holiday said. \"But again, Jayson is more than just a scorer. He's a complete basketball player who does everything. So I think for him to be able to damn near average a triple-double almost every game is something he can do.\"\n\nOn the four plays where another Celtic took a shot after Tatum grabbed the defensive rebound, Boston scored or got fouled. When he took the shot after his defensive rebound, he missed almost every time.\n\nParsing Tatum's misses, he repeatedly targeted Cavs guards in the high post and missed five shots that are generally in his wheelhouse. He bricked several clean looks at pull-up 3s. Often, he'll find himself something like 0-for-5 halfway through the third quarter, then go on a barrage to finish 3-for-8 and it's considered a normal night for him. But with the way White and Brown were cooking, there was no need for Tatum to find his shooting rhythm late in Game 1.\n\nAs we examined in Tuesday's story, Tatum's screening was instrumental in getting White's pull-up game going. With Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is out, Tatum's screening became a central tenet of the game plan, especially with Al Horford pulling Evan Mobley out of the paint. So while he took the bait on some of the Cavs' defensive choices and didn't convert most of the time, the Celtics got to use him how they wanted.\n\n\"I don't think he's being forced to do anything. I mean, he was 1.6 (points per possession) as a screener in our offense yesterday, which would be the best offense in the history of the world,\" Mazzulla said. \"And he had 11 potential assists and he had 18 points and three blocks. I think he's doing a great job of taking what the defense gives him and finding any way to impact the game on both ends of the floor. That's what we need him to be and he's doing a really good job of it.\"\n\nUnlike most situations for high-scoring stars, the Celtics roster has enough scoring around him so that Tatum doesn't have to force the issue most nights. Game 1 had him looking like more of a decoy to free up Boston's guards, which works since Tatum is more than willing to get involved as a screener.\n\n\"I think he's becoming a playmaker. He's been a playmaker,\" Holiday said. \"Not that he's being a sacrificial lamb, but he making a lot of the right plays, he takes his chances where people are going to double-team him and he's gonna take some of those shots, but I think he's getting everybody open looks.\"\n\nThere's no doubt that if the Celtics are gunning for a title, Tatum's going to have to convert on his open looks. According to NBA Stats, he shot 2-for-10 on uncontested shots in Game 1. He has made a living at looking out of rhythm on the easiest shots, then burying looks that only he and a small group of stars can pull off.\n\nAs with everything in the Celtics offense, Tatum will need to achieve balance. Over time, he's proven he'll find a way.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jared_weiss@theathletic.com", "name": "Jared Weiss", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payton_Pritchard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Payton Pritchard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Mobley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evan Mobley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/05/08202759/USATSI_23215005-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551037", "eventUri": "eng-9551037", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Looking at Celtics star's status for Game 2 (May 9)", "body": "Boston Celtics superstar Jayson Tatum is listed as available for the upcoming Game 2 of the Eastern Conference semifinals against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday. The Celts took Game 1 120-95 on Tuesday.\n\nThe Boston Celtics took care of business in the opening game of the Eastern Conference semifinals against the Cavaliers. Shooting 48.9% from the field and 39.1% from beyond the arc propelling the Celtics to victory.\n\nJaylen Brown spearheaded the offense with 32 points, while Derrick White added 25 points, including seven from the 3-point range.\n\nJayson Tatum had a quieter evening despite a double-double, posting 18 points and 11 rebounds, but Boston comfortably pulled away in the second half. The win marked their fifth in six playoff games, giving them a 1-0 series lead.\n\nThey rank fifth in playoff scoring, averaging 109.8 points per game. Their shooting accuracy is impressive, hitting 47.7% from the field and almost 38.6% from the 3-point range, leading the league with an average of 15.5 3-pointers made per game.\n\nDefensively, the Celtics are also second in points allowed per game, holding opponents to 43.0% shooting from the field and 32% from beyond the arc. Additionally, they rank second in the playoffs in fewest turnovers and rebounds per game.\n\nThe Cavaliers face a critical challenge in finding success on the road if they aim to compete in this series. After suffering another blowout loss, they are 0-4 away from home in the playoffs.\n\nAdditionally, the Cavs offense requires greater contributions from players beyond just Donovan Mitchell to generate a more dynamic and effective scoring attack.\n\nWhat happened to Jayson Tatum?\n\nJayson Tatum was sidelined for eight games this season, with two due to an impingement in his right ankle. Additionally, against the Warriors on Dec. 19, Tatum encountered a setback when he sustained a sprain to his left ankle.\n\nIt occurred just shy of the eight-minute mark in the first quarter after he had accidentally stepped on the foot of Brandin Podziemski. Following the mishap, JT limped off to the locker room to be assessed.\n\nHe made a return at the start of the second quarter, but his agility was clearly diminished, impacting his overall game performance and ability to close out the game.\n\nJayson Tatum stats vs Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nThe Celtics standout has appeared in 22 games against the Cleveland Cavaliers, averaging 23.1 points, 7.5 rebounds and 3.2 assists with 1.0 steals and 1.2 blocks on 44.4% shooting from the field, including 35.2% from the distance and 87.7% from the free-throw line.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tanay_sahai@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Tanay Sahai", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/23215181-1715241938.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551037", "eventUri": "eng-9551037", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-19", "textStart": 1809, "textEnd": 1816}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

He is averaging 21.2 points while shooting 40.6 percent from the field and 25 percent from the 3-point line, both career postseason lows. On Tuesday, he was 7 for 19 from the field and 0 for 5 from beyond the arc.\n\nBut the Celtics insist they are not at all concerned. They say the attention Tatum draws from defenses is opening avenues elsewhere, and Tatum continues to be a willing passer. He is averaging 5.3 assists and just 1.7 turnovers per contest. When he finds himself covered by one defender -- a rarity -- he looks to attack. But when he is swarmed by two or more, he makes the right play without hesitation.\n\n\"I think he's becoming a playmaker,\" point guard Jrue Holiday said. \"He's been a playmaker. Not that he's being a sacrificial lamb, but he's making a lot of the right plays, he takes his chances where people are going to double-team him, and he's going to take some of those shots. But I think he's getting everybody open looks.\"\n\nWhen coach Joe Mazzulla was asked Wednesday about Tatum's shooting struggles, he quickly pointed out that the Celtics are generating 1.6 points per possession when Tatum serves as the screener, \"which would be the best offense in the history of the world.\"\n\n\"I think he's doing a great job of taking what the defense gives him and finding any way to impact the game on both ends of the floor,\" Mazzulla added. \"That's what we need him to be, and he's doing a really good job of it.\"\n\nMazzulla said he has been pleased with Tatum's shot selection and will continue to urge him to fire away. Also, the sample size is so small that one or two big offensive sprees could flip his lukewarm statistics in an instant.\n\nBut it is clear that the lack of scoring punch is not affecting Tatum's effort. He has tallied 10 or more rebounds in five of the six playoff games, and he registered three blocked shots in Game 1 against the Cavaliers.\n\n\"It's just the casual [fans] who think it's all about the shots,\" guard Payton Pritchard said. \"But there's so many different areas he can affect the game. If he only gets 18 points but we get a win by 25 points, he was very impactful.\"\n\nCeltics center Kristaps Porzingis, who remains out with the calf strain he suffered during the Game 4 win over the Heat last week, was doing some very light shooting without much movement when the end of practice was opened to the media Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Block (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payton_Pritchard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Payton Pritchard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/MnS8zeBt86Z2pDfAZy_859WBQds=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/DRO25ZDLFF7EQISZ5J4GSKWABY.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551037", "eventUri": "eng-9551037", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Tatum shot just 7-of-19, went 0-for-5 from 3-point range, and finished with 18 points in Boston's 120-95 Game 1 win on Tuesday night. Looking ahead, NESN's Travis Thomas addressed Tatum's uncharacteristic playoff performances on the \"Hold My Banner\" podcast.\n\n\"Yes, he's not shooting well. His scoring's down. It hasn't mattered,\" Thomas explained. \"His team's picking up the slack, whooping up on everyone that's in front of them. And Jayson Tatum is crashing boards, he's getting rebounds. His assist numbers are up. He's helping you. He's playing defense.\"\n\nTatum still managed to notch his fifth double-double of the 2023-24 playoffs (40 career), grabbing 11 rebounds with five rebounds and three blocks. Meanwhile, Boston's cast held the fort down.

Aside from their Game 2 loss in the opening round against the Heat that was an outlier due to Miami's unusually hot 3-point shooting, they have trailed for a total of just nine minutes over their five wins, with plenty of massive leads mixed in.\n\nThere was a big talent gap between the Celtics and the undermanned Heat, and there appears to be another one in this conference semifinal series against the Cavaliers, which the Celtics lead, 1-0, following their 120-95 demolition at TD Garden Tuesday night.\n\nSo the results are not surprising, but the fact that the Celtics have cruised despite Jayson Tatum's lack of scoring is unusual.\n\nTatum has not reached the 30-point mark in any of the six playoff games. He is averaging 21.2 points while shooting 40.6 percent from the field and 25 percent from the 3-point line, both career postseason lows. On Tuesday, he was 7 for 19 from the field and 0 for 5 from beyond the arc.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/5BC8bB98peyc0sBUaX_ImauY1TU=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/SB37WZBIIEGR3MRTULHJNU7R3I.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551037", "eventUri": "eng-9551037", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

We may receive compensation when you click on links to those products. The opinions and information provided on this site are original editorial content of Sneaker News.\n\nJayson Tatum is currently laced in Jordan Tatum 2 as he leads the Boston Celtics through the Playoffs. There hasn't been much news surrounding the NBA's top team (win-wise) given that they've yet to meet a formidable opponent in this postseason, but that'll change as the competition gets fiercer in the later rounds. However, there may be some headlines in the form of the Jordan Tatum 3, his newest signature shoe that just leaked on social media.\n\nA first look at the Jordan Tatum 3 can be seen below, revealing a radically new design that departs from the foam and textile pods from the Tatum 2 and channels some of the eclectic 1990s flavor via the variety of materials and graphic patterns. Classic sport mesh is seen on the tongue and throughout the upper, with a canvas-like material with printed patterns alternating via wavy panels. The middle streams down into the midsole, bringing that pattern beneath. The cut remains that 5/8th height that Jayson seems to prefer, while outer touch-points -- the simple lacing, the pull-tab at the heel -- also speak to earlier decades of hoop shoes.\n\nAlthough these are just a sample, this image is a good indication of what's coming with the third signature shoe model. Tatum's emblem is seen embroidered on the tongue, while the Jumpman logo sits at the forefoot. The Jordan Tatum 2 has only been on the market for a few short months, so it might be a while until we see these on the market. Stay tuned for updates as we learn more, and check out our Jordan Release Dates 2024 page for the latest news on the Tatum 2 and Tatum 3.", "source": {"uri": "sneakernews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sneaker News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumpman_(logo)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jumpman (logo)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embroidery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Embroidery"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://sneakernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jordan-tatum-3-first-look-release-date.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551037", "eventUri": "eng-9551037", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

The Celtics are heavy favorites in Game 2, and this game has one of the lower totals on the slate. Consequently, this leads me to Tatum's assists and rebounds prop. He's cleared this line in four of his last five games. Additionally, Tatum has averaged 8.4 potential assists and 14.4 rebound chances in 36.8 minutes over that time frame. Expect Tatum and the Celtics to take care of business on their home floor on Thursday night.\n\nDonovan Mitchell UNDER 29.5 points. It's clear that the Cavaliers are outmatched against the Celtics. Boston is favored by 13.5 points against Cleveland. The Celtics have gone 10-5 against the spread this season when favored by at least 13.5. Although Mitchell scored 33 points in Game 1, and considering how well the Celtics defended everyone else, I believe they'll make adjustments to contain him in Game 2.\n\nDaniel Gafford OVER 18.5 points and rebounds. The Thunder really hammered the Mavericks in Game 1, especially in the second half. Dallas' big men were supposed to have an advantage in this series against the Thunder. I believe they'll have a better showing in Game 2. Gafford has cleared this line in two consecutive games.\n\nLuka Doncic OVER 10.5 assists. Now, this number might seem high at first glance, but let me explain. If the Mavericks aim to keep this series competitive, Doncic must get everyone involved. Throughout the regular season and playoffs, Doncic has averaged 16.8 potential assists and 9.8 assists per game. Considering the narrow spread of the game, indicating it should be competitive, this bodes well for Doncic and his chances of having a big assist night.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gafford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Gafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0509%2Fr1330664_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551037", "eventUri": "eng-9551037", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

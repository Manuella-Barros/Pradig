The ITV talent competition is currently in its 17th series as the judges search for the nation's best act. Ant and Dec are back at the helm with judges Simon Cowell, Bruno Tonioli, Amanda Holden and Alesha Dixon. Despite the much loved show being on screens for years, some viewers have called for one major part of it to be axed. Fans have criticised one very familiar feature of the show - the Golden Buzzer. Some have suggested the Golden Buzzer is \u201closing its credibility\u201d as it has been given out to too many acts. \"I feel that since they keep giving out golden buzzers they are kinda losing their credibility because the whole reason they were special were the fact there was only five but now it feels as though there is one every other act,\" the viewer wrote on Reddit. \u201cAnd in my personal opinion, the ones that have received golden buzzers I would not have chosen. I\u2019m not saying they aren\u2019t talented because they really are but there have been many others who truly deserved golden buzzers but wasn\u2019t. Anyway just felt I need to speak about this.\u201d Another agreed as they said: \u201cI agree, don't see why they need 9 golden buzzers. I mean, if they like those acts so much, surely they'll put them through to the semis anyway?\u201d The Golden Buzzer was introduced in series eight and grants an automatic place in the live semi-final rounds. Normally, there was just five Golden Buzzers on offer - one from each judge as well as Ant and Dec. The number of Golden Buzzers increased last year and there have been nine on the latest series. Last weekend, viewers pointed out a huge problem as another Golden Buzzer was dished out despite there being none left. Group Haribow from Japan combined skipping with gymnastic and dance moves in the hope of winning the show. They confirmed they'd flown more than 20 hours for their audition, and were all friends from school who had performed for the last nine years. The audience quickly began chanting for the judges to press the buzzer, but Simon confirmed they were not allowed as they had already gone way over their one buzzer each this series. The judges stood their ground, yet Simon's son Eric was spotted jumping around in the audience alongside Amanda Holden's daughter Hollie. Simon told the group how Eric was so excited about them, clearly a fan. It's then that the chants got louder and Simon realised they weren't going to be able to get away with not giving them the buzzer. Audience members Eric and Hollie pressed the buzzer as the judges \"weren't allowed\". However, some viewers suggested it defeated the point of its value. One fan posted: \"What\u2019s the point in the golden buzzers when they\u2019re just giving them out to absolutely everyone? These guys are really good but when they\u2019re gone they\u2019re gone!!\" Another agreed: \"They don't need to golden buzzer everything. If they're that good they'll get picked to go through anyway.\" A third fan added: \"They know there's no buzzers left, but they still won't stfu about pushing it. It devalues every other golden buzzer act,\" as a fourth said: \"What\u2019s the point of the golden buzzer, they would get through to the finals anyway.\" Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTubeand Threads.", "summary": "Britain's Got Talent has sparked outrage with some fans during the latest series of the ITV talent competition as they call for a huge aspect of the show to be axed", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/britains-talent-fans-furious-over-32916091", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32917033.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Britains-Got-Talent-TV-Show-Series-17-Judges-London-UK-24-Jan-2024.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:15:08", "author": "Mia O'Hare", "authors": ["Mia O'Hare"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.279}

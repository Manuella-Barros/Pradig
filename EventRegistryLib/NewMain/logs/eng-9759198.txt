The franchise is considering several options, including Sanjay Bangar for the head coach role. Bangar previously served as the franchise's head coach and is currently the director of cricket development.\n\nThe Punjab Kings' board meeting was scheduled for July 22 regarding the head coach role.

However, they are not satisfied with the results in the last two seasons. The Punjab team finished poorly despite having a strong squad. Bayliss took over from legendary spinner Anil Kumble before the 2023 season.\n\nIndian coaches are in high demand in the IPL. Gautam Gambhir and Chandrakant Pandit guided the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in the recent season. Ashish Nehra guided the Gujarat Titans (GT) to the title in 2022. Dinesh Karthik joined Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) as batting coach for the upcoming season.\n\nTrevor Bayliss has coached Kolkata Knight Riders, Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH), and Punjab Kings. The 61-year-old also coached the England cricket team. His recent T20 record with various teams has been underwhelming. The PBKS management will review last season's performance before making any final decisions.\n\nRahul Dravid is attracting attention from several IPL franchises. Ashish Nehra and Vikram Solanki's futures are uncertain with the Gujarat Titans (GT).

Sourav Ganguly continues to play a key role in the Delhi Capitals' coaching staff, and Royal Challengers Bengaluru have included Dinesh Karthik in their coaching team for the upcoming season.\n\nAs for Bayliss (61), who has had three different tenures with three different franchises - Kolkata Knight Riders, Sunrisers Hyderabad, and Punjab Kings - and a hugely successful stint with the England team in between, PBKS decision-makers maintain that they will take a final call after a review meeting of last year's performance. Factually his T20 record across tournaments has been very poor during the last five years - be it with the Sunrisers, Sydney Thunder or with the Punjab Kings. The ownership group continues to maintain that no decision has been taken yet.\n\nCricbuzz understands that franchise insiders have no complaints about the Aussie's coaching style but acknowledge that, ultimately, results matter.

The former England coach is set to be released by Punjab Kings ahead of the IPL 2025 season. PBKS are reportedly not willing to renew the contract of Bayliss, whose 2-year deal with the franchise has expired.\n\nAccording to a report in Cricbuzz, Punjab Kings are searching for an Indian coach to turn the fortunes of the franchise. Only time will tell if their search for an Indian coach is complete but they are looking at several options with one of them being former coach Sanjay Bangar, who is currently the director of cricket development.\n\nA board meeting scheduled for July 22 to discuss the topic was cancelled.\n\nThe rising stocks of Indian coaches have tempted the Punjab franchise to turn their focus on domestic coaching talent.\n\nRahul Dravid's success with the Indian team, the title-winning duo of Gautam Gambhir-Chandrakant Pandit at KKR last season, and Ashish Nehra's successful stint with Gujarat Titans have resulted in the high demand for Indian coaches among franchises.\n\nBayliss, (61), has held associations with three different franchises - Kolkata Knight Riders, Sunrisers Hyderabad, and Punjab Kings. In the middle of the IPL stints, Bayliss led England to the ODI World Cup victory in 2019. It is reported that PBKS will take a final call on his future after a review meeting of last year's performance.\n\nWhile Bayliss boasts a good ODI record, his recent T20 record across tournaments has been dismal during the last five years with Sunrisers, Sydney Thunder and the Punjab Kings. He, however, has a Big Bash League title and a Champions League trophy under his belt. He led the Sixers to a BBL and CLT20 titles in the 2011-12 season.\n\nUnder the Australian coach, PBKS finished eighth and ninth in the last two IPL seasons.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sparsh_vyas@news9live.com", "name": "Sparsh Vyas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Bayliss", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Bayliss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricbuzz", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricbuzz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjay_Bangar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sanjay Bangar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashish_Nehra", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ashish Nehra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Dravid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champions_League_Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Champions League Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bash_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Bash League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sydney Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Trevor-Bayliss.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759198", "eventUri": "eng-9759198", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "textStart": 666, "textEnd": 673}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

Now, Punjab Kings (PBKS) are almost certain to take the same route, ending the relationship with their head coach Trevor Bayliss, whose two-year contract with the team has ended.\n\nPunjab Kings end this 2024 season of the 20-over format, at the penultimate position among the 10 teams, with just five wins in 14 games, at a net run rate of -0.353. They started quite poorly in that edition with just a couple of wins in their first eight games.\n\nIt was the same story for them in 2023, where they finished their campaign at the eighth position in the points table, with six wins, at a net run rate of -0.304. The middle phase of the competition didn't go in their favor as they continued to come up with poor results.\n\nThe sources have confirmed that Punjab Kings is looking for an Indian coach to guide the team, which has been the cheat code for many other franchises in this tournament, Whether they could get the option only remained to be seen.\n\nAlso Read: IPL 2024: The Focus Is To Help Punjab Kings Get The Trophy - Shikhar Dhawan On His Goals For The Forthcoming Indian Premier League\n\nIt has been known that the team is considering several options with one of them being Sanjay Bangar, who was previously with the franchise in the head coach role and is currently their director of cricket development. He could be a potential candidate for the team's head coach role.\n\nNo such confirmed decision has been made on the prospect. They had a scheduled meeting for July 22 which later didn't take place. The franchise is believed to make a broadened search for their players and coaching staffs before the mega-auction later this year.\n\nOne of the remarkable achievements of an Indian coach was what Rahul Dravid did with the national team. Under his guidance, India reached the final of last year's home Men's ODI World Cup 2023, where they became the runners-up after losing to Australia. But they went a step ahead during the recent T20 World Cup 2024, where they got the better of South Africa in Barbados, during the final of the event, to end their 11-year wait for an ICC trophy drought.\n\nThe duo of Gautam Gambhir and Chandrakant Pandit as the mentor and head coach of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) has done a terrific job for the success of the team in 2024, where they lifted their third title in the tournament.\n\nUnder the guidance of Ashish Nehra, Gujarat Titans (GT) too earned the same success, as they became the champions in their inaugural edition in 2022, and backed up being the runners-up in 2023. The Punjab Kings side is looking forward to the same success rate.\n\nEven the likes of Delhi Capitals (DC) have provided a key role to the former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly who is the director of the franchise, while Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) has included their former wicket-keeping batter Dinesh Karthik in their coaching set-up for the upcoming season.\n\nAlso Read: Eoin Morgan Breaks Silence On Becoming Next England White-ball Coach\n\nTrevor Bayliss has had three different periods with various franchises- KKR, Punjab Kings, and the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH), as the Shikhar Dhawan-led side will take the final call after their review meeting of last year's performances.\n\nThe former England coach took over from Anil Kumble ahead of the 2023 season. It will be interesting to see how the story unfolds, and if they go for Bangar in the head coach role before the mega auction of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025.", "source": {"uri":

The Australian was appointed in 2022 and under his two-year stint, the team has not been able to make it to the playoffs, finishing eighth and ninth respectively in 2023 and 2024 respectively. Rahul Dravid Likely to Return As Head Coach of Rajasthan Royals; VVS Laxman to Join Lucknow Super Giants Coaching Staff: Report.\n\nAccording to a report in Cricbuzz, Bayliss' contract, which finished this year, is unlikely to be renewed by Punjab Kings. The 61-year-old thus could be on his way out with the franchise looking for a revamp before the upcoming mega auction and the new season next year. Punjab Kings have been among the teams in the IPL to have never won the title, having made just one final in 2014. The franchise have had a number of quality players in their ranks but failed to live upto expectations. Punjab Kings, the report adds, might be on the lookout for an Indian coach for the next season.

As per reports, the franchise doesn't have a problem with Bayliss' coaching style but the Australian failed to bring results in the last couple of years.\n\nHis track record in T20 cricket in the last few years is also concerning. He has failed to deliver for Sunrisers Hyderabad, Sydney Thunder, and recently for Punjab Kings, which played a part in their wanting to part ways. The franchise was scheduled to have a board meeting on July 22 to discuss future plans but it didn't take place. However, they seem to have discussed Sanjay Bangar's name as the next head coach, who is currently their Director of Cricket Development.\n\nAlso Read - ECB proposes IPL franchise owners to invest The Hundred\n\nAs per Cricbuzz, Bayliss' two-year contract with Punjab ended with the completion of IPL 2024 and since then, the management has made no effort to renew it. Apart from Bangar, they are keeping other options open as well, especially with a mega auction in mind.\n\nAs things stand, Gujarat might also part ways with the successful coaching duo of Nehra and Solanki. Former cricketer Yuvraj Singh is believed to be in talks with the franchise but it needs to be seen if he returns back to cricket. Since his retirement, the southpaw has focused more on his brand and business and has groomed the likes of Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma and also featured in various leagues for retired cricketers but never indicated returning to professional cricket.\n\nAlso Read - Rahul Dravid likely to join Rajasthan Royals as head coach ahead of IPL 2025\n\nOn the other hand, Dravid remains one of the key players in the market, with many franchises wanting to sign the former India coach.

Whether they will ultimately choose an Indian coach remains to be seen, but they are believed to be considering several options with one of them being Sanjay Bangar,\" stated a report in Cricbuzz.\n\nUnder Bayliss, PBKS finished at the 8th and 9th spots in IPL 2023 and 2024, respectively, which seems to have played a significant role in his potential release.\n\nThe same report also added that PBKS owners did not have any complaint with the coaching style of the Australian, but it is the result of the team's performance that has forced them to come to the decision.", "source": {"uri": "cricketcountry.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cricket Country"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Punjab Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Bayliss", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Bayliss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anil_Kumble", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anil Kumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Australian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Ponting", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ricky Ponting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricbuzz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricbuzz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjay_Bangar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sanjay Bangar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://www.cricketcountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bayliss.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759198", "eventUri": "eng-9759198", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

The Punjab Kings have yet to make a final decision on Bayliss's future, pending a review of the team's recent performance, which saw them finish in the lower ranks in the last two seasons despite having a strong squad.\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

Figures like Gary Kirsten, Daniel Vettori, and Mike Hesson have shown their mentoring skills and led their respective teams to success. Looking ahead, IPL 2025 is anticipated to be big, especially with the mega auction approaching, which might bring about various changes.\n\nFor example, Rohit Sharma might move to another franchise, Rishabh Pant could join CSK, and Yuvraj Singh might also be involved in coaching. Reports indicate that some top-class coaches may not be part of IPL 2025. So, who are these coaches, and what were their records during their tenure? Let's take a look at three major names we might not see on the boundary ropes and give tips to players.\n\nPonting, who was with the DC team in 2018, has recently completed his 7-year contract with the franchise. Over these seven years, he has provided countless memories to the franchise's supporters. Although the team didn't fare well in his first season in 2018, there was a noticeable change in 2019, when DC won 10 games and reached the playoffs.\n\nThe team managed to enter the final in 2020 but faced heartbreak as MI defeated them by five wickets. As a coach, Ponting has coached 103 games with DC, winning 53 and losing 50, which gives him a 51.4% win record. Now, after all this, he will not be part of the DC management in IPL 2025.\n\nThe record of Trevor Bayliss includes 42 games, with 18 wins and 24 losses, giving him a percentage of 42.9% during his stint as coach for PBKS. Appointed as the head coach of the Punjab Kings in September 2022, succeeding Anil Kumble, Bayliss is now facing the possibility of not having his contract renewed. Despite his efforts to revamp the image of the Punjab Kings in the IPL, the results have been underwhelming, with only 18 wins in 42 games not meeting the expectations of PBKS stakeholders.\n\nBayliss, who previously coached Sri Lanka from 2007 to 2011 and led them to the finals of the 50-over World Cup twice, did not have a successful run with the PBKS franchise. It is noteworthy that under his coaching, the Knight Riders became IPL champions twice, in 2012 and 2014.\n\nAnother big name who is not going to be the head coach is Ashish Nehra. The former Indian pacer, known for his unique coaching style, may part ways with the Gujarat Titans after delivering significant success. Under his leadership, the team won the IPL 2022, which was GT's debut year in the tournament. In 2023, they almost clinched the final against CSK but fell short.\n\nHowever, the 2024 season did not go well, as the team finished 7th under their new captain, Shubman Gill. According to reports, the team is now looking for a new coach, and Yuvraj Singh may be considered for the role in IPL 2025.

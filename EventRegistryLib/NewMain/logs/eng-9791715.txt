She fled the country by helicopter, a source close to the ousted leader told AFP.\n\nMedia in neighbouring India reported Hasina had landed at a military airbase near New Delhi.\n\nA top-level source said she wanted to \"transit\" on to London, but calls by the British government for a UN-led investigation into \"unprecedented levels of violence\" put that into doubt.\n\nThe military declared an emergency in January 2007 after widespread political unrest and installed a military-backed caretaker government for two years.\n\nMichael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Washington-based Wilson Center, warned that Hasina's departure \"would leave a major vacuum\" and that the country was in \"uncharted territory\".\n\n\"The coming days are critical,\" he said.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stressed the importance of a \"peaceful, orderly and democratic transition\", his spokesman said. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell echoed that call.\n\nFormer colonial ruler Britain and the United States meanwhile urged \"calm\".", "source": {"uri": "cebudailynews.inquirer.net",

Hundreds of people died as security forces sought to quell the unrest, but the protests grew and Hasina finally fled Bangladesh aboard a helicopter on Monday as the military turned against her.\n\nArmy chief General Waqar-Uz-Zaman announced Monday afternoon on state television that Hasina had resigned and the military would form a caretaker government. \"The country has suffered a lot, the economy has been hit, many people have been killed -- it is time to stop the violence,\" said Waker, shortly after jubilant crowds stormed and looted Hasina's official residence.\n\nStudent protest leaders, ahead of the expected meeting with the army chief, said Tuesday they wanted Nobel laureate and microfinance pioneer Muhammad Yunus, 84, to lead the government. \"In Dr. Yunus, we trust,\" Asif Mahmud, a key leader of the Students Against Discrimination (SAD) group, wrote on Facebook.\n\nYunus has not commented on the call, but in an interview with India's The Print, he said Bangladesh had been \"an occupied country\" under Hasina. \"Today all the people of Bangladesh feel liberated,\" Yunus said, it reported.\n\nThe president and army chief also met President Mohammed Shahabuddin late Monday, alongside key opposition leaders, with the president's press team saying it had been \"decided to form an interim government immediately\". Millions of Bangladeshis flooded the streets of Dhaka to celebrate after Waker's announcement on Monday. \"I feel so happy,\" said Sazid Ahnaf, 21, comparing the events to the independence war that split the nation from Pakistan more than five decades ago. \"We have been freed from a dictatorship.\"\n\nBut there were also scenes of chaos and anger, with police reporting at least 109 people killed on Monday, including by mobs who launched revenge attacks on Hasina's allies. It was the deadliest day since protests began in early July, with at least 409 people killed overall, according to an AFP tally based on police, government officials and doctors at hospitals.\n\nProtesters stormed parliament and torched TV stations, while some smashed statues of Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's independence hero. Others set a museum dedicated to the former leader on fire, flames licking at portraits in destruction barely thinkable just hours before, when Hasina had the loyalty of the security forces under her autocratic grip.\n\n\"The time has come to make them accountable for torture,\" said protester Kaza Ahmed. \"Sheikh Hasina is responsible for murder.\" Offices of Hasina's Awami League across the country were torched and looted, eyewitnesses told AFP.\n\nThe unrest began last month in the form of protests against civil service job quotas and then escalated into wider calls for Hasina to stand down. Her government was accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including through the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.\n\nThe president on Monday, after meeting the army chief Waker, also ordered the release of prisoners from the protests, as well as former prime minister and key opposition leader Khaleda Zia, 78. Zia, who is in poor health, was jailed by her arch-rival Hasina for graft in 2018.\n\nMothers of some of the hundreds of political prisoners secretly jailed under Hasina's rule waited outside a military intelligence force building in Dhaka on Tuesday, hoping for news. \"We need answers,\" said Sanjida Islam Tulee, a coordinator of Mayer Daak, meaning \"The Call of the Mothers\", a group campaigning for the release of people detained by Hasina's security forces.\n\nHasina's fate is also uncertain. She fled the country by helicopter, a source close to the ousted leader told AFP. Media in neighbouring India reported Hasina had landed at a military airbase near New Delhi. A top-level source said she wanted to \"transit\" on to London, but calls by the British government for a UN-led investigation into \"unprecedented levels of violence\" put that into doubt.\n\nBangladesh has a long history of coups. The military declared an emergency in January 2007 after widespread political unrest and installed a military-backed caretaker government for two years. Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Washington-based Wilson Center, warned that Hasina's departure \"would leave a major vacuum\" and that the country was in \"uncharted territory\". \"The coming days are critical,\" he said.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stressed the importance of a \"peaceful, orderly and democratic transition\", his spokesman said. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell echoed that call. Former colonial ruler Britain and the United States meanwhile urged \"calm\".", "source": {"uri": "92newshd.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "92 News HD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Waker-Uz-Zaman announced Monday afternoon on state television that Hasina had resigned and the military would form an interim government.\n\n\"The country has suffered a lot, the economy has been hit, many people have been killed -- it is time to stop the violence,\" said Waker, shortly after jubilant crowds stormed and looted Hasina's official residence.\n\nWaker was expected to meet student leaders on Tuesday, to hear their demand for the 84-year-old microfinance pioneer Yunus to lead the government.\n\nThe students also want the dissolution of parliament, a call echoed by the key opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, who have demanded elections within three months.\n\n\"In Dr. Yunus, we trust,\" a key leader of the Students Against Discrimination group, Asif Mahmud, wrote on Facebook.\n\nYunus has not commented on the call, but in an interview with India's The Print, he said Bangladesh had been \"an occupied country\" under Hasina.\n\n\"Today all the people of Bangladesh feel liberated,\" it quoted Yunus as saying.\n\nStreets in Dhaka were largely peaceful on Tuesday -- with traffic resuming and shops opening, but government offices mainly closed -- after a day of chaotic violence saw at least 113 people killed.\n\nMillions of Bangladeshis flooded the streets of Dhaka to celebrate after Waker's announcement on Monday.\n\n\"I feel so happy,\" said Sazid Ahnaf, 21, comparing the events to the independence war that split the nation from Pakistan more than five decades ago.\n\n\"We have been freed from a dictatorship,\" he added.\n\nBut there were also scenes of chaos and anger, with police reporting mobs launching revenge attacks on Hasina's allies.\n\nIt was the deadliest day since protests began in early July, with at least 413 people killed overall, according to an AFP tally based on police, government officials and doctors at hospitals.\n\nProtesters stormed parliament and torched TV stations, while some smashed statues of Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's independence hero.\n\nOthers set a museum dedicated to the former leader on fire, flames licking at portraits in destruction barely thinkable just hours before when Hasina still had the loyalty of the security forces in her autocratic grip.\n\nOffices of Hasina's Awami League across the country were torched and looted, eyewitnesses told AFP.\n\nSome businesses and homes owned by Hindus -- a group seen by some in the Muslim-majority nation as having been close to Hasina -- were also attacked, witnesses said.\n\nThe unrest began last month in the form of protests against civil service job quotas and then escalated into wider calls for Hasina to stand down.\n\nRights groups accused her government of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including through the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.\n\nThe army chief met President Mohammed Shahabuddin late Monday, alongside key opposition leaders, with the president's press team saying it had been \"decided to form an interim government immediately\".\n\nShahabuddin also ordered the release of prisoners from the protests, as well as former prime minister and key opposition leader Khaleda Zia, 78.\n\nZia, who is in poor health, was jailed by her arch-rival Hasina for graft in 2018.\n\nMothers of some of the hundreds of political prisoners secretly jailed under Hasina's rule waited outside a military intelligence force building in Dhaka on Tuesday, hoping for news.\n\n\"We need answers,\" said Sanjida Islam Tulee, a coordinator of Mayer Daak, meaning \"The Call of the Mothers\", a group campaigning for the release of people detained by Hasina's security forces.\n\nHasina's fate is also uncertain. She fled the country by helicopter, a source close to the ousted leader told AFP.\n\nMedia in neighbouring India reported Hasina had landed at a military airbase near New Delhi.\n\nA top-level source said she wanted to \"transit\" on to London, but calls by the British government for a UN-led investigation into \"unprecedented levels of violence\" put that into doubt.\n\nBangladesh has a long history of coups.\n\nAfter widespread political unrest, the military declared an emergency in January 2007 and installed a military-backed caretaker government for two years.\n\nMichael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Washington-based Wilson Center, warned that Hasina's departure \"would leave a major vacuum\" and that the country was in \"uncharted territory\".",

the former leader was also set on fire in destruction barely thinkable just hours before when the autocratic Hasina still had the loyalty of the security forces.\n\nSome businesses and homes owned by Hindus - a group seen by some in the Muslim-majority nation as close to Hasina - were also attacked, witnesses said.\n\nEuropean Union diplomats in Bangladesh said Tuesday they were \"very concerned\" about reports of attacks on religious, ethnic and other minority groups.\n\nKey police unions said their members had declared a strike \"until the security of every member of the police is secured\", offering their \"apology\" for police actions against the protesters.\n\nA mob in northern Sherpur district also broke into a prison late Monday - with \"all 518 inmates escaping\", police chief Akramul Hossain told AFP.\n\nThe unrest began last month with protests against civil service job quotas and escalated into wider calls for Hasina to stand down.\n\nHer government was accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including through the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.\n\nMothers of some of the hundreds of

\"unprecedented\" violence put that in doubt.\n\nThomas Kean from the International Crisis Group said the new authorities faced a daunting challenge.\n\n\"The interim government that will now assume

It's a Bengal uprising, what we saw in 1971 and [are] now seeing in 2024.\"\n\nAt least 109 people were killed during violent unrest in Bangladesh on Monday as the prime minister was ousted, police and doctors said, updating an earlier toll.\n\nIt marked the deadliest day since protests began in early July, and brings the total number killed to 409, according to an AFP tally based on police, government officials and doctors at hospitals.\n\nProtesters stormed parliament and torched TV stations, while some smashed statues of Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's independence hero.\n\nOthers set a museum dedicated to the former leader on fire, flames licking at portraits in destruction barely thinkable just hours before, when Hasina had the loyalty of the security forces under her autocratic grip.\n\n\"The time has come to make them accountable for torture,\" said protester Kaza Ahmed. \"Sheikh Hasina is responsible for murder.\"\n\nOffices of Hasina's Awami League across the country were torched and looted, eyewitnesses told AFP.\n\nStudent protest leaders, ahead of an expected meeting with the army chief, said on Tuesday that they wanted Nobel laureate and microfinance pioneer Muhammad Yunus, 84, to lead the government.\n\n\"In Dr Yunus, we trust,\" Asif Mahmud, a key leader of the Students Against Discrimination (SAD) group, wrote on Facebook.\n\nWaker said a curfew would be lifted on Tuesday morning, with the military set to lead an interim government.\n\nBangladeshi President Mohammed Shahabuddin on late Monday ordered the release of prisoners from the protests, as well as former prime minister and key opposition leader Khaleda Zia, 78.\n\nZia, who is in poor health, was jailed by her arch-rival Hasina for graft in 2018.\n\nThe president and army chief also met on late Monday, alongside key opposition leaders, with the president's press team saying it had been \"decided to form an interim government immediately\".\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Waker would lead it.\n\nHasina's fate was also uncertain. She fled the country by helicopter, a source close to the ousted leader told AFP.\n\nA top-level source said she wanted to \"transit\" on to London, but calls by the British government for a UN-led investigation into \"unprecedented levels of violence\" put that into doubt.\n\nThere were widespread calls by protesters to ensure Hasina's close allies remained in the country.\n\nBangladesh's military said they had shut down Dhaka's international airport on Monday evening, without giving a reason.\n\nBangladesh has a long history of coups.\n\nThe military declared an emergency in January 2007 after widespread political unrest and installed a military-backed caretaker government for two years.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stressed the importance of a \"peaceful, orderly and democratic transition\", his spokesman said.\n\nEuropean Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell echoed that call. Former colonial ruler Britain and the United States meanwhile urged \"calm\".\n\nMichael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Washington-based Wilson Center, warned that Hasina's departure \"would leave a major vacuum\" and that the country was in \"uncharted territory\".\n\nMeanwhile, families of political prisoners secretly jailed in Bangladesh under the autocratic rule of Hasina waited desperately for news of their relatives, as some of those missing were released.\n\n\"We need answers,\" said Sanjida Islam Tulee, a coordinator of Mayer Daak, meaning \"The Call of the Mothers\" -- a group campaigning for the release of people detained by Hasina's security forces.\n\nRights groups accused Hasina's security forces of abducting and disappearing some 600 people -- including many from the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the banned Jamaat-e-Islami, the country's largest religio-political party.\n\nTulee told AFP that at least 20 families gathered outside a military intelligence force building in a northern Dhaka neighbourhood, waiting for news of their relatives.\n\nAmong the most high profile of those released on Tuesday was opposition activist and lawyer Ahmad Bin Quasem, son of Mir Quasem Ali, the executed leader of Jamaat-e-Islami.\n\n\"He was released from secret detention this morning,\" family friend and relative Masum Khalili told AFP. \"He had a medical check-up, his condition is stable.\"\n\nQuasem, a British-educated barrister, was abducted -- allegedly by security forces in plainclothes -- in August 2016.\n\nSecurity forces during Hasina's rule were accused of detaining tens of thousands of opposition activists, killing hundreds in extrajudicial encounters, and disappearing their leaders and supporters.\n\nHuman Rights Watch last year said security forces had committed \"over 600 enforced disappearances\" since Hasina came to power in 2009, and nearly 100 remain unaccounted for.\n\nHasina's government denied the allegations of disappearances and extrajudicial killings, saying some of those reported missing drowned in the Mediterranean while trying to reach Europe.\n\n\"We heard Ahmad Bin Quasem has been released,\" Tulee said, \"but what happened to others? \"", "source": {"uri": "dawn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dawn"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@dawn.com", "name": "Agence

Bangladesh's Channel 24 broadcast images of crowds running into the compound, waving to the camera as they celebrated. Others smashed a statues of Hasina's father Sheikh Mujibur Rahma, the country's independence hero.\n\nBangladesh's army chief Waker-Uz-Zaman would address the nation on Monday afternoon, a military spokesman told AFP without giving further details.\n\nBefore the protesters had stormed the compound, Hasina's son urged the country's security forces to block any takeover from her 15-year rule.\n\n\"Your duty is to keep our people safe and our country safe and to uphold the constitution,\" her son, US-based Sajeeb Wazed Joy, said in a post on Facebook.\n\n\"It means don't allow any unelected government to come in power for one minute, it is your duty.\" Security forces had supported Hasina's government throughout the unrest, which began last month against civil service job quotas then escalated into wider calls for her to stand down.\n\nBut the protesters defied curfews and deadly force.\n\nAt least 94 people were killed on Sunday, including 14 police officers, in the deadliest day of the unrest. Protesters and government supporters countrywide battled each other with sticks and knives, and security forces opened fire.\n\nThe day's violence took the total number of people killed since protests began in early July to at least 300, according to an AFP tally based on police, government officials and doctors at hospitals.\n\nWaker told officers on Saturday that the military \"always stood by the people\", according to an official statement.\n\nThe military declared an emergency in January 2007 after widespread political unrest and installed a military-backed caretaker government for two years.\n\nHasina has ruled Bangladesh since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.\n\nHer government is accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including through the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.\n\nDemonstrations began over the reintroduction of a quota scheme that reserved more than half of all government jobs for certain groups.\n\nThe protests escalated despite the scheme having been scaled back by Bangladesh's top court.\n\nSoldiers and police with armoured vehicles in Dhaka had barricaded routes to Hasina's office with barbed wire on Monday morning, but vast crowds flooded the streets, tearing down barriers.\n\nThe Business Standard newspaper estimated as many as 400,000 protesters were on the streets but it was impossible to verify the figure.\n\n\"The time has come for the final protest,\" said Asif Mahmud, one of the key leaders in the nationwide civil disobedience campaign.\n\nIn several cases, soldiers and police did not intervene to stem Sunday's protests, unlike during the past month of rallies that repeatedly ended in deadly crackdowns.\n\n\"Let's be clear: The walls are closing in on Hasina: She's rapidly losing support and legitimacy,\" Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Washington-based Wilson Center, told AFP.\n\n\"The protests have taken on immense momentum, fuelled by raw anger but also by the confidence that comes with knowing that so much of the nation is behind them,\" he said.\n\nIn a hugely symbolic rebuke of Hasina, a respected former army chief demanded the government \"immediately\" withdraw troops and allow protests.\n\n\"Those who are responsible for pushing people of this country to a state of such an extreme misery will have to be brought to justice,\" ex-army chief General Ikbal Karim Bhuiyan told reporters Sunday.\n\nThe anti-government movement had attracted people from across society in the South Asian nation of about 170 million people, including film stars, musicians and singers.\n\nBangladesh's army chief Waker-Uz-Zaman said Monday he would \"form an interim government\" after the prime minister resigned and fled the capital in the face of overwhelming protests.\n\n\"I am taking full responsibility,\" the general said, dressed in military fatigues and cap, although it was not immediatly clear if he would head a caretaker government.\n\n\"We will form an interim government,\" Waker said in a broadcast to the nation on state television, adding that Sheikh Hasina had resigned.\n\n\"The country has suffered a lot, the economy has been hit, many people have been killed -- it is time to stop the violence,\" he added.\n\n\"I hope after my speech, the situation will improve.\"\n\nHe said he would talk to the president to form the interim government and had held talks with the main opposition parties and civil society members -- but not Hasina's Awami League.\n\nWaker is a career infantry officer who has spent nearly four decades in the military, serving two tours as a UN peacekeeper as well as in the prime minister's office.\n\n\"If the situation gets better, there is no need for emergency\", he said, vowing the new authorities would \"prosecute all murders\" following weeks of deadly protests.\n\n\"Now the task of the students is to keep calm and help us,\" he said.\n\nBedecked with medal ribbons on his green uniform, the mild-looking and spectacle-wearing officer was appointed to the military's top job as chief of army staff earlier this year.", "source": {"uri": "nation.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It's a Bengal uprising, what we saw in 1971, and now seeing in 2024.\"\n\n- Violence -\n\nBut there were also scenes of chaos and anger, with police reporting at least 66 people killed on Monday as mobs launched revenge attacks on Hasina's allies.\n\nProtesters stormed parliament and torched TV stations, while some smashed statues of Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's independence hero.\n\nOthers set a museum dedicated to the former leader on fire, flames licking at portraits in destruction barely thinkable just hours before, when Hasina had the loyalty of the security forces under her autocratic grip.\n\n\"The time has come to make them accountable for torture,\" said protester Kaza Ahmed. \"Sheikh Hasina is responsible for murder.\"\n\nOffices of Hasina's Awami League across the country were torched and looted, eyewitnesses told AFP.\n\nThe unrest began last month in the form of protests against civil service job quotas and then escalated into wider calls for Hasina to stand down.\n\nHer government was accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including through the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.\n\nAt least 366 people died in the unrest that began in early July, according to an AFP tally based on police, government officials and doctors at hospitals.\n\nStudent protest leaders, ahead of an expected meeting with the army chief, said Tuesday that they wanted Nobel laureate and microfinance pioneer Muhammad Yunus, 84, to lead the government.\n\n\"In Dr. Yunus, we trust,\" Asif Mahmud, a key leader of the Students Against Discrimination (SAD) group, wrote on Facebook.\n\nWaker said a curfew would be lifted on Tuesday morning, with the military set to lead an interim government.\n\nBangladeshi President Mohammed Shahabuddin late Monday ordered the release of prisoners from the protests, as well as former prime minister and key opposition leader Khaleda Zia, 78.\n\nZia, who is in poor health, was jailed by her arch-rival Hasina for graft in 2018.\n\nThe president and army chief also met late Monday, alongside key opposition leaders, with the president's press team saying it had been \"decided to form an interim government immediately\".\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Waker would lead it.\n\n- Political vacuum -\n\nHasina's fate was also uncertain.\n\nShe fled the country by helicopter, a source close to the ousted leader told AFP.\n\nMedia in neighbouring India reported Hasina had landed at a military airbase near New Delhi.\n\nA top-level source said she wanted to \"transit\" on to London, but calls by the British government for a UN-led investigation into \"unprecedented levels of violence\" put that into doubt.\n\nThere were widespread calls by protesters to ensure Hasina's close allies remained in the country.\n\nBangladesh's military said they had shut Dhaka's international airport on Monday evening, without giving a reason.\n\nBangladesh has a long history of coups.\n\nThe military declared an emergency in January 2007 after widespread political unrest and installed a military-backed caretaker government for two years.\n\nMichael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Washington-based Wilson Center, warned that Hasina's departure \"would leave a major vacuum\" and that the country was in \"uncharted territory\".\n\n\"The coming days are critical,\" he said.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stressed the importance of a \"peaceful, orderly and democratic transition\", his spokesman said.

It's a Bengal uprising, what we saw in 1971, and now seeing in 2024.\"\n\nBut there were also scenes of chaos and anger, with police reporting at least 66 people killed on Monday as mobs launched revenge attacks on Hasina's allies.\n\nProtesters stormed parliament and torched TV stations, while some smashed statues of Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's independence hero.\n\nOthers set a museum dedicated to the former leader on fire, flames licking at portraits in destruction barely thinkable just hours before, when Hasina had the loyalty of the security forces under her autocratic grip.\n\n\"The time has come to make them accountable for torture,\" said protester Kaza Ahmed. \"Sheikh Hasina is responsible for murder.\"\n\nOffices of Hasina's Awami League across the country were torched and looted, eyewitnesses told AFP.\n\nThe unrest began last month in the form of protests against civil service job quotas and then escalated into wider calls for Hasina to stand down.\n\nHer government was accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including through the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.\n\nAt least 366 people died in the unrest that began in early July, according to an AFP tally based on police, government officials and doctors at hospitals.\n\nPolitical vacuum\n\nWaker said a curfew would be lifted on Tuesday morning, with the military set to lead an interim government.\n\nBangladeshi President Mohammed Shahabuddin late Monday ordered the release of prisoners from the protests, as well as former prime minister and key opposition leader Khaleda Zia, 78.\n\nZia, who is in poor health, was jailed by her arch-rival Hasina for graft in 2018.\n\nThe president and army chief also met late Monday, alongside key opposition leaders, with the president's press team saying it had been \"decided to form an interim government immediately\".\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Waker would lead it.\n\nHasina's fate was also uncertain.\n\nHasina, 76, fled the country by helicopter, a source close to the ousted leader told AFP.\n\nMedia in neighbouring India reported Hasina had landed at a military airbase near New Delhi.\n\nA top-level source said she wanted to \"transit\" on to London, but calls by the British government for a UN-led investigation into \"unprecedented levels of violence\" put that into doubt.\n\nThere were widespread calls by protesters to ensure Hasina's close allies remained in the country.\n\nBangladesh's military said they had shut Dhaka's international airport on Monday evening, without giving a reason.\n\nBangladesh has a long history of coups.\n\nThe military declared an emergency in January 2007 after widespread political unrest and installed a military-backed caretaker government for two years.\n\nMichael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Washington-based Wilson Center, warned that Hasina's departure \"would leave a major vacuum\" and that the country was in \"uncharted territory\".\n\n\"The coming days are critical,\" he said.\n\nFormer colonial ruler Britain and the United States meanwhile urged \"calm\".", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person",

Reuters\n\nBangladesh's protesting students leaders demanded on Tuesday that parliament be dissolved and warned of a \"strict programme\" if their deadline was not met, a day after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country.\n\nNahid Islam, one of the key organisers of the student movement against Hasina, said in a video on Facebook with three other leaders that parliament should be dissolved by 3 pm (0900 GMT) on Tuesday and asked \"revolutionary students to be ready\" if that did not happen.\n\nBangladesh's army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman was due to meet student leaders at 0600 GMT to discuss the formation of an interim government that is expected to hold elections soon after it takes over. Zaman had announced Hasina's resignation on Monday.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the meeting had taken place and if the students' deadline to dissolve parliament came after the meeting.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, some normalcy returned to the capital Dhaka, although traffic was lighter than usual and few schools reopened with thin attendance after closing down in mid-July as protests against quotas in government jobs morphed into a broad campaign against Hasina's rule.\n\nAt least 109 people were killed during violent unrest in Bangladesh on Monday as the prime minister was ousted, police and doctors said, updating an earlier toll.\n\nIt marks the deadliest day since protests began in early July, and brings the total number killed to 409, according to an AFP tally based on police, government officials and doctors at hospitals.\n\nStudent leaders, who spearheaded the movement for Hasina to resign, said they want Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus as the chief adviser to the interim government and a spokesperson for Yunus said he has agreed to their demand.\n\nHow things unfolded\n\nHasina's 15-year rule ended on Monday as she fled to India after more than a month of deadly protests. Following her departure from the restive country, the military announced it would form an interim government.\n\nHasina had sought to quell nationwide protests against her government since early July but she fled after a brutal day of unrest on Sunday in which nearly 100 people were killed.\n\nBangladesh's army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said in a broadcast to the nation on state television that Hasina had resigned and the military would form a caretaker government.\n\n\"The country has suffered a lot, the economy has been hit, many people have been killed - it is time to stop the violence,\" said Waker, dressed in military fatigues, shortly after jubilant crowds stormed and looted Hasina's residence.\n\nDemonstrations began over the reintroduction of a quota scheme that reserved more than half of all government jobs for certain groups.\n\nThe protests escalated despite the scheme being scaled back by Bangladesh's top court.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganabhaban", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ganabhaban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caretaker_government", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caretaker government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Peace Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/08/Bangladesprotests1200-2024-08-34e9c1dc2b98f9916ba62da44e32bc8c.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791715", "eventUri": "eng-9791715", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Her ultimate destination was not immediately clear.\n\nBangladesh's army chief General Waker-uz-Zaman, speaking on state television, told the predominantly Muslim South Asian nation of 170 million people that Hasina, 76, had resigned and that the military would form an interim government.\n\nGeneral Waker-uz-Zaman, dressed in military fatigues, said, \"The country has suffered a lot, the economy has been hit, many people have been killed -- it is time to stop the violence. I hope after my speech, the situation will improve.\"\n\nThe army chief said he had held talks with the main opposition parties and civil society members but not Hasina's Awami League. He said the military would investigate the crackdown on student-led protests that has fueled outrage against the government and left at least 300 dead since early July.\n\n\"Keep faith in the military, we will investigate all the killings and punish the responsible,\" he said. \"I have ordered that no army and police will indulge in any kind of firing.\"\n\nThe main target of the protests has been a quota system that set aside up to 30% of government jobs for family members of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence against Pakistan, while also favoring those with connections to the prime minister's Awami League.\n\nThe protests continued even after the Supreme Court last month ruled that the quota system must be drastically cut and evolved into a broader rebuke of Hasina, the world's longest-serving female head of government.\n\nAt least 11,000 people have been arrested in recent weeks. The unrest has also resulted in the closure of schools and universities across the country, and authorities at one point imposed a shoot-on-sight curfew.\n\nAuthorities shut off mobile internet connections on Sunday to try to quell the unrest, and broadband internet was cut briefly Monday morning. It was the second internet blackout in the country since July, but services were restored later Monday.\n\nOver the weekend, protesters called for a \"non-cooperation\" effort with the government, urging people not to pay taxes or utility bills and not to show up to their jobs on Sunday, a workday in Bangladesh. Offices, banks and factories opened, but commuters in Dhaka and other cities struggled to get to their jobs since much public transport was halted amid fears of violence.\n\nWith Hasina's departure, jubilant crowds waved flags, with some dancing atop a tank in the street on Monday morning before hundreds broke through the gates of her official residence.\n\nThe Business Standard newspaper estimated as many as 400,000 protesters were on the streets, but any exact number was impossible to verify.\n\n\"The time has come for the final protest,\" said Asif Mahmud, one of the key leaders in the nationwide civil disobedience campaign.\n\nBangladesh's Channel 24 showed crowds running into the compound, waving to the camera as they celebrated, looting furniture and books, with others relaxing on beds. Some of the demonstrators grabbed food from refrigerators.\n\nOthers smashed a statue of Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's independence hero.\n\nMichael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Washington-based Wilson Center, warned that Hasina's departure \"would leave a major vacuum.\"\n\n\"If it's a peaceful transition, with an interim set-up taking over until elections are held, then stability risks would be modest and the consequences would be limited,\" he said.\n\n\"But if there is a violent transition or a period of uncertainty, that could risk more destabilization and problems inside and outside.\"\n\nBefore the protesters stormed the palace compound, Hasina's son had urged security forces to block any takeover.\n\n\"It means don't allow any unelected government to come in power for one minute, it is your duty,\" her son, U.S.-based Sajeeb Wazed Joy, said in a post on Facebook.\n\nHasina had ruled Bangladesh since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition. The U.S. and Britain denounced the results as not credible, but her government defended the outcome.\n\nHasina's government was accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including through the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.\n\nHer political opponents accused her of growing increasingly autocratic and called her a threat to the country's democracy. Many said the unrest was a result of that authoritarian streak.\n\nOn Saturday, Hasina offered to meet with student leaders, but a coordinator refused and demanded her resignation. Earlier, Hasina had said protesters who engaged in \"sabotage\" and destruction were no longer students but criminals.", "source": {"uri": "globalsecurity.org", "dataType": "news", "title":

At a short notice she requested New Delhi for permission to come to India while Bangladesh authorities simultaneously sought flight clearance.\n\nAccording to the latest information, she is still in India.\n\nBangladesh President Dissolves Parliament\n\nPresident Mohammed Shahabuddin dissolved parliament on Tuesday, paving the way for the formation of an interim government following Hasina's resignation. The president also freed Bangladesh Nationalist Party chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia, a former prime minister and Hasina's arch rival, from house arrest.\n\nStudent leaders who spearheaded the movement that led to Hasina's overthrow said they want Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus to be chief adviser of the interim government.\n\nCalls For Sheikh Hasina To Step Down\n\nThe Students Against Discrimination group, which was at the forefront of last month's job quota protests, led the latest demonstrations.\n\nThe protests to reform the quota system paused after the Supreme Court scrapped most of them on July 21. Protesters, however, returned last week demanding a public apology from Hasina for the violence, restoration of internet connections, reopening of college and university campuses and release of those arrested.\n\nBy the weekend, the demonstrations spiralled into a campaign seeking Hasina's overthrow as demonstrators demanded justice for people killed last month.\n\nThe students' group called for a nationwide non-cooperation movement starting Sunday with a single-point agenda - Hasina must resign.\n\nWhy Did Protesters Want Sheikh Hasina's Resignation?\n\nThe protesters blame Hasina's government for the violence during the protests in July. Hasina's critics and rights groups have accused her government of using excessive force against protesters, a charge the government denied.\n\nWhat Did Sheikh Hasina Say About The Protests?\n\nHasina and her government initially said students were not involved in the violence during the quota protests and blamed the Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami and the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) for the clashes and arson.\n\nBut after violence erupted again on Sunday, Hasina said that \"those who are carrying out violence are not students but terrorists who are out to destabilise the nation\".\n\nThe students' group declined Hasina's offer for talks to resolve the crisis.\n\nWhat Triggered The Job-Quota Protests?\n\nDemonstrations started at university campuses in June after the High Court reinstated a quota system for government jobs which favoured relatives of veterans of Bangladesh's war of independence, overturning a 2018 decision by Hasina's government to scrap it.\n\nThe Supreme Court suspended the high court order after the government's appeal and then dismissed the lower court order last month, directing that 93% of jobs should be open to candidates on merit.\n\nFlagging Economy, Unemployment\n\nExperts also attribute the current unrest in Bangladesh to stagnant job growth in the private sector, making public sector jobs, with their accompanying regular wage hikes and privileges, very attractive.\n\nThe quotas sparked anger among students grappling with high youth unemployment, as nearly 32 million young people are out of work or education in a population of 170 million.\n\nThe flagging economy, once among the world's fastest growing on the back of the country's booming garments sector, has stagnated. Inflation hovers around 10% per annum and dollar reserves are shrinking.\n\nHasina Won January Election\n\nHasina retained power for a fourth straight term in an election in January boycotted by the BNP, which accused her Awami League of trying to legitimise sham elections.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nBNP said 10 million party workers were on the run ahead of the election with nearly 25,000 arrested following deadly anti-government protests on Oct. 28. Hasina blamed the BNP for instigating anti-government protests that rocked Dhaka ahead of the election and left at least 10 people dead.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by

The army plans to form an interim government. What are the next steps for the nation?\n\nBangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country on Monday, after weeks of massive student protests and escalating violence that has so far claimed hundreds of lives.\n\nIt marked an abrupt and dramatic end to her 15-year rule.\n\nAfter the news broke, the streets of the capital, Dhaka, and other major cities were filled with celebrations. Jubilant crowds waved flags, some dancing on top of a tank in the streets of Dhaka before hundreds broke through the gates of Hasina's official residence.\n\nBangladesh's army chief, General Waker-uz-Zaman, said in a televised speech that the military would form an interim government. It was not immediately clear if he would lead it or who would join the caretaker administration.\n\n\"The country has suffered a lot, the economy has been hit, many people have been killed -- it is time to stop the violence,\" Zaman said, dressed in military fatigues.\n\n\"I hope after my speech, the situation will improve,\" he said.\n\nZaman said he had held talks with the main opposition parties and civil society members but not Hasina's Awami League party.\n\nIt's been less than seven months since Hasina swept a national election in January, celebrating a fourth straight term in power and fifth overall. The vote was boycotted by the main opposition.\n\nBut relentless and violent protests over the past few weeks and the inability of the security forces to put an end to them drew the curtain on Hasina's rule.\n\nThe demonstrations began in June after student groups demanded the scrapping of a controversial quota system in government jobs. But it escalated into a major uprising against Hasina's government.\n\nThe unrest has so far claimed the lives of about 300 people since mid-July, according to local media reports.\n\nIt's unclear if the transition toward a military-led interim administration will be smooth.\n\nSome student protesters have already said they won't accept any government without their representation.\n\n\"Representatives of student protesters have to be part of the interim government. Otherwise, we will not accept it,\" Asif Mahmud, a student leader, told DW.\n\nHe also underlined that they want to have a say not only on the structure of government but also on policies.\n\nZ. I. Khan Panna, a senior lawyer and human rights activist, also expressed discontent with the army chief's statement.\n\n\"We have not received any concrete plans from the army chief. What he said was a temporary solution,\" Panna told DW. \"The people he spoke to over the formation of the interim government, what is their level of public support? I don't think people will accept that.\"\n\nHowever, a statement released by the military's public relations department said the army chief would soon hold direct talks with representatives of protesting students and teachers.\n\nThe concept of a \"caretaker government\" is not new to Bangladesh. From 1990 to 2008, during general elections, the elected government ceded power to an interim, technocratic administration, which was tasked with holding elections in a free and fair manner.

He also said businesses should re-open on Tuesday after authorities lift a curfew at 6 a.m. and that elections will be held \"as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe head of the army, Waker-Uz-Zaman, said earlier that a new government will be formed in consultation with Shahabuddin before a new vote.\n\n\"An interim government will be formed,\" the army chief said, adding it could happen as soon as overnight. \"Justice will be served for each death. Keep faith in the army.\"\n\nHasina, 76, left Bangladesh for India shortly before the army's announcement and was seeking to head to London, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private information. India will allow her safe passage on her way to the UK, the people said.\n\nHasina's location was unclear late Monday night. The UK Foreign Office and India's Ministry of External Affairs both declined to comment on her travel. Separately, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy called for a UN-led investigation into the unrest.\n\n\"The UK wants to see action taken to ensure Bangladesh a peaceful and democratic future,\" Lammy said.\n\nHasina had faced pressure to resign for weeks as the demonstrations turned deadly. Local TV channels showed protesters storming her official residence on Monday afternoon and ransacking the building, taking away furniture and food.\n\nAt a press conference late Monday, protest organizers said they will meet with political parties and demanded the release of all those arrested in relation to the protests. Nahid Islam, a protest organizer speaking at the briefing, didn't clarify if Hasina's Awami League party would be involved in the discussions.\n\nThe protest leaders have reportedly proposed Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist Muhammad Yunus, 84, to serve as the leader of the interim government. Yunus, who pioneered micro loans as a tool to fight poverty, has faced legal trouble under Hasina that he has called politically motivated.\n\nWhat started out in late June as peaceful protests seeking to abolish a government jobs quota turned into deadly unrest in recent weeks with demonstrators seeking to oust Hasina. Her resignation follows a weekend of student-led clashes with pro-government supporters that pushed the death toll from the violence since mid-July to about 350 people, according to news reports and data from local hospitals and police stations.\n\nUS State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Monday that Washington welcomes the forming of an interim government and that all decisions \"should be made with respect to democratic principles, rule of law and the will of the Bangladeshi people.\"\n\n\"We are focused now on supporting an end to the violence and\n\naccountability,\" Miller said.\n\nEarlier Monday, thousands of students defied a government-imposed curfew to march through Dhaka, chanting, \"We will not go back.\" TV channels showed troops trying to control huge crowds of people who had walked through the night to the capital to take part in the protests. A few jubilant demonstrators were seen hugging soldiers as they awaited the army chief's speech.\n\nHasina was the world's longest serving female head of a government, winning a fourth term as prime minister in an election in January that was boycotted by her opponents and voters. The US, the biggest buyer of Bangladesh's exports, had criticized the polls, and imposed visa curbs on members of Hasina's party and law enforcement officials in September.\n\nWhile her ruling Awami League party controls nearly 80% of seats in parliament, the army chief invited none of its members to talks on forming an interim government. The constitution, if it were followed, requires any prime minister to command majority support in parliament. Hasina didn't make any public comments Monday and officials in her party didn't answer calls when contacted for comment.\n\nHasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was killed in a coup in 1975 when he was prime minister. TV footage Monday showed protesters taking hammers to a statue of the independence leader in Dhaka.\n\nThe political turmoil is a setback for the economy, which is reliant on financial aid from the International Monetary Fund and other donors, and earns most of its foreign exchange from exports of garments. Major clothing brands like Hennes & Mauritz AB, Adidas AG, Wal-Mart Inc. and Gap Inc. have operations in the country.\n\nBangladesh has taken a $10 billion hit to the economy from the curfews and the Internet blackouts, according to an industry group. The unrest has made it difficult for garment manufacturers to operate, impacting the country's foreign exchange earnings. Reserves dropped to $21.8 billion in June.\n\nWhile Hasina had overseen rapid growth in the economy and helped lift millions out of poverty, those achievements were often overshadowed by what critics contend is her authoritarianism, and accusations she's used state institutions to stamp out dissent and stifle the media.\n\nUnemployment in the country has become more acute since the pandemic, especially among young people, with the private sector struggling to expand.

Jubilant crowds waved flags, some dancing on top of a tank in the streets of Dhaka before hundreds .\n\nBangladesh's army chief, General Waker-Uz-Zaman, said in a televised speech that the military would form an interim government. It was not immediately clear if he would lead it or who would join the caretaker administration.\n\n\"The country has suffered a lot, the economy has been hit, many people have been killed -- it is time to stop the violence,\" Zaman said, dressed in military fatigues.\n\n\"I hope after my speech, the situation will improve,\" he said.\n\nZaman said he had held talks with the main opposition parties and civil society members but not Hasina's Awami League party.\n\nIt's been less than seven months since Hasina swept a national election in January, celebrating a fourth straight term in power and fifth overall. The vote was boycotted by the main opposition.\n\nBut relentless and violent protests over the past few weeks and the inability of the security forces to put an end to them drew the curtain on Hasina's rule.\n\nThe demonstrations began in June after student groups demanded the scrapping of in government jobs.\n\nBut it escalated into a major uprising against Hasina's government.\n\nThe unrest has so far claimed the lives of about 300 people since mid-July, according to local media reports.\n\nIt's unclear if the transition toward a military-led interim administration would be smooth.\n\nSome have already said they won't accept any government without their representation.\n\n\"Representatives of student protesters have to be part of the interim government.

I don't think people will accept that.\"\n\nHowever, a statement released by the military's public relations department said that the army chief would soon hold direct talks with representatives of protesting students and teachers.\n\nThe concept of a \"caretaker government\" is not new to Bangladesh.

Bangladesh's powerful army chief Waker-Uz-Zaman is looking to set up an interim government in consultation with the president.\n\nWhat happens next after Hasina, who turned Bangladesh into an economic success and ruled with an iron fist, remains unclear. It is possible the interim government excludes her Awami League party, which won almost 80% of the parliamentary seats in a boycotted vote in January. While Shahabuddin has vowed to hold elections \"as soon as possible,\" it's unclear if Hasina's allies will be able to participate or return to power.\n\nThousands of jailed protesters were freed, as well as Hasina's rival and opposition leader Khaleda Zia -- a former prime minister herself. The student-led protesters are pushing for Nobel Peace Prize winning economist Muhammad Yunus to lead the interim government.\n\nInvestors are betting on a smooth transition with a key Bangladesh stock index surging by the most since March 2020. Still, the interim government will have to focus on the economy that has struggled to gain its footing since the pandemic and has come under pressure from the curfews and recent internet blackouts.\n\nThe new government may also have to negotiate with the International Monetary Fund and other creditors for more cash to bolster dwindling reserves. The multilateral lender, which approved a $4.7 billion loan program last year, said it would continue to \"support efforts to ensure economic stability and deliver inclusive growth,\" according to a Reuters report.\n\n\"These events in Bangladesh could not have come at a worse time given that it was regaining some amount of macro-stability after having taken the tough policy measures linked to the IMF program,\" said Ruchir Desai, fund manager at Asia Frontier Capital, which has been adding to its position in Bangladesh stocks in the past two months.\n\nHasina, who fled the country to India by helicopter shortly before protesters ransacked the presidential palace, hasn't spoken publicly. Indian television channel News18 reported she is stationed at Hindon airbase on the outskirts of New Delhi for the next few days.\n\nMinister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said Hasina had requested approval \"to come for the moment to India,\" confirming a Bloomberg news report. She was initially heading for the UK though it is increasingly unclear where she will go from India.\n\n\"The situation in Bangladesh is still evolving,\" Jaishankar told Indian parliament on Tuesday. \"In the last 24 hours, we have also been in regular touch with the authorities in Dhaka.\"\n\nIron Hands\n\nHasina was the world's longest serving female head of a government, winning a fourth term as prime minister in an election in January that was boycotted by her opponents and voters. The US, the biggest buyer of Bangladesh's exports, had criticized the polls, and imposed visa curbs on members of Hasina's party and law enforcement officials in September.\n\nWhile the Awami League party dominates parliament, the army chief invited none of its members to talks on forming an interim government. The constitution, if it were followed, requires any prime minister to command majority support in parliament. Officials in her party didn't answer calls seeking comment on Monday.\n\nUS State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Monday that Washington welcomes the forming of an interim government and that all decisions \"should be made with respect to democratic principles, rule of law and the will of the Bangladeshi people.\"\n\n\"We are focused now on supporting an end to the violence and accountability,\" Miller said.\n\nHasina had faced pressure to resign for weeks as the demonstrations turned deadly. Local TV channels showed protesters looting her official residence on Monday afternoon, taking away furniture and food.\n\nWhat started out in late June as peaceful protests seeking to abolish a government jobs quota turned into deadly unrest in recent weeks with demonstrators seeking to oust Hasina who showed little sign of backing down at the time. Her sudden resignation follows a weekend of student-led clashes with pro-government supporters that pushed the death toll from the violence since mid-July to about 350 people, according to news reports and data from local hospitals and police stations.\n\nOn Monday, thousands of students defied a government-imposed curfew to march through Dhaka, chanting \"We will not go back.\" TV channels showed troops trying to control huge crowds of people who had walked through the night to the capital to take part in the protests. A few jubilant demonstrators were seen hugging soldiers.\n\nHasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was killed in a coup in 1975 when he was prime minister. Protesters took hammers to a statue of the independence leader in Dhaka.\n\nHasina's son and former official adviser, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, said his mother had not done anything wrong and had provided the \"best government in the country.\"\n\n\"She is disappointed and disheartened,\" he told India Today. \"She fought militancy with iron hands, she is done.\"\n\n--With assistance from Anup Roy, Sudhi Ranjan Sen, Iain Marlow, Faseeh Mangi and Yasufumi Saito.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

At a short notice she requested New Delhi for permission to come to India while Bangladesh authorities simultaneously sought flight clearance.\n\nAccording to the latest information, she is still in India.\n\nBANGLADESH PRESIDENT DISSOLVES PARLIAMENT\n\nPresident Mohammed Shahabuddin dissolved parliament on Tuesday, paving the way for the formation of an interim government following Hasina's resignation. The president also freed Bangladesh Nationalist Party chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia, a former prime minister and Hasina's arch rival, from house arrest.\n\nStudent leaders who spearheaded the movement that led to Hasina's overthrow said they want Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus to be chief adviser of the interim government.\n\nCALLS FOR HASINA TO STEP DOWN\n\nThe Students Against Discrimination group, which was at the forefront of last month's job quota protests, led the latest demonstrations.\n\nThe protests to reform the quota system paused after the Supreme Court scrapped most of them on July 21. Protesters, however, returned last week demanding a public apology from Hasina for the violence, restoration of internet connections, reopening of college and university campuses and release of those arrested.\n\nBy the weekend, the demonstrations spiralled into a campaign seeking Hasina's overthrow as demonstrators demanded justice for people killed last month.\n\nThe students' group called for a nationwide non-cooperation movement starting Sunday with a single-point agenda - Hasina must resign.\n\nWHY DID PROTESTERS WANT HASINA'S RESIGNATION?\n\nThe protesters blame Hasina's government for the violence during the protests in July. Hasina's critics and rights groups have accused her government of using excessive force against protesters, a charge the government denied.\n\nWHAT DID HASINA SAY ABOUT THE PROTESTS?\n\nHasina and her government initially said students were not involved in the violence during the quota protests and blamed the Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami and the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) for the clashes and arson.\n\nBut after violence erupted again on Sunday, Hasina said that \"those who are carrying out violence are not students but terrorists who are out to destabilise the nation\".\n\nThe students' group declined Hasina's offer for talks to resolve the crisis.\n\nWHAT TRIGGERED THE JOB-QUOTA PROTESTS?\n\nDemonstrations started at university campuses in June after the High Court reinstated a quota system for government jobs which favoured relatives of veterans of Bangladesh's war of independence, overturning a 2018 decision by Hasina's government to scrap it.\n\nThe Supreme Court suspended the high court order after the government's appeal and then dismissed the lower court order last month, directing that 93% of jobs should be open to candidates on merit.\n\nFLAGGING ECONOMY, UNEMPLOYMENT\n\nExperts also attribute the current unrest in Bangladesh to stagnant job growth in the private sector, making public sector jobs, with their accompanying regular wage hikes and privileges, very attractive.\n\nThe quotas sparked anger among students grappling with high youth unemployment, as nearly 32 million young people are out of work or education in a population of 170 million.\n\nThe flagging economy, once among the world's fastest growing on the back of the country's booming garments sector, has stagnated. Inflation hovers around 10% per annum and dollar reserves are shrinking.\n\nHASINA WON JANUARY ELECTION\n\nHasina retained power for a fourth straight term in an election in January boycotted by the BNP, which accused her Awami League of trying to legitimise sham elections.\n\nBNP said 10 million party workers were on the run ahead of the election with nearly 25,000 arrested following deadly anti-government protests on Oct. 28. Hasina blamed the BNP for instigating anti-government protests that rocked Dhaka ahead of the election and left at least 10 people dead.\n\n(Reporting by Sudipto Ganguly; Editing by Angus MacSwan)",

Within hours the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, had resigned and fled the country in a helicopter, bringing her 15 years in power to an abrupt end.\n\nThe army chief, Waker-Uz-Zaman, announced that he would be assuming control and, after discussions with political parties (excluding Hasina's Awami League) and civil society groups, has promised to form an interim government. But whether a new government will address the protesters' demands for state reform remains to be seen.\n\nThere is also concern about whether public anger against members of Hasina's government can be contained. Protesters stormed and ransacked the prime minister's official residence, while mobs reportedly torched some TV stations, attacked political leaders' homes, and looted shops.\n\nThe situation does seem to have been brought back under control. And, as the dust settles, the question many are now asking is: how did this seemingly strong dictator fall from power so spectacularly and so quickly?\n\nHasina's tenure has been marked by creeping repression that has gradually eroded her legitimacy. She secured a fourth straight term in January, for example, in an election so rigged it was boycotted by the main opposition party (whose top leadership have either been imprisoned or exiled).\n\nIt is within this context that students began to protest. The protests started peacefully in July with demands to abolish a controversial quota system that reserved government jobs for family members of freedom fighters from the 1971 war for independence from Pakistan. But they quickly turned into a wider anti-government movement that sought to oust the prime minister.\n\nMany argue that this was fuelled by Hasina herself. She made casual remarks about the protesters being descendants of razakars, a word used to describe those who collaborated with the Pakistani army during the war.\n\nAnd a few of her ministers began to suggest that the student wing of Hasina's regime, the Chhatra League, was ready to counter the protesters. This was seen as a license for members of the Chhatra League to beat the peaceful student protesters, with police support. Soon the situation turned very violent.\n\nThe brutality of the crackdown was unprecedented, with gruesome videos of deaths and injuries shared on social media. There have been around 300 deaths in total (including 32 children), many more injuries, and thousands of arrests.\n\nThe use of live ammunition and helicopters against protesters shocked the nation, as did allegations that the police have destroyed hospital death registers to hide the true death toll.\n\nRead more: Bangladesh protests: brutal security crackdown sparks calls for international probe\n\nHasina's failure to show empathy or take action against the police only exacerbated public discontent. She was seen weeping over the damage caused to metro stations instead of the deaths of protesters.\n\nThe government has also refused to take any responsibility for the brutality of its security forces and has been willing to do and say anything to spin the narrative against the protesters. The police have even denied the killing of student activist Abu Sayed, despite video footage of him being shot at point blank range.\n\nBut what ultimately united the country was the deaths of protesters from all walks of life - from rickshaw pullers to the elite urban class. The whole narrative changed. Previously indifferent to political protests organised by opposition parties during Hasina's tenure, the Bangladeshi people came together.\n\nOn Saturday, August 3, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in every city and town in Bangladesh after student leaders called for a nationwide \"civil disobedience campaign\" until Hasina's government resigns.\n\nThe army had stepped in to help restore order following earlier protests. But this time around they were largely bystanders watching the protest rallies unfold.\n\nThe protests appear to have shattered the climate of fear that has long pervaded Bangladesh's political landscape. Social media has been awash with memes, slogans and songs demanding the prime minister's resignation.\n\nThis unprecedented outpouring of dissent, ranging from street protests to digital activism, signalled a significant erosion of the government's control over public discourse. Temporary internet closures backfired, making people even angrier.\n\nEven before the political unrest, the economic situation in Bangladesh was worsening. In May, the country's reserves of foreign currency fell below US$19 billion (\u00a315 billion) for the first time in 11 months.\n\nA growing economy such as Bangladesh's generally needs foreign currency reserves equivalent to six months worth of import bills. However, central bank officials said existing reserves would cover Bangladesh for just four months. This will leave the country struggling to import fuel and maintain its garment sector - the country's largest export industry.\n\nOn top of this, on August 3 the student leaders asked Bangladeshi citizens to stop paying taxes and utilities bills, and to shut down factories and ports. They also called on the diaspora not to send remittances to Bangladesh as part of their bid to force a change of leadership. The potential for an economic shutdown only added to the uncertainty facing the country.\n\nAugust 4 became the bloodiest day of all. At least 90 people were killed in Bangladesh as the police and members of the Chhatra League clashed with anti-government protesters once more.\n\nIn a statement released on Sunday, the UN's human rights chief, Volker T\u00fcrk, said: \"The continuing effort to suppress popular discontent, including through the excessive use of force, and the deliberate spread of misinformation and incitement to violence, must immediately cease\".\n\nThe culmination of these factors left Hasina with no option but to resign, as public sentiment and economic instability converged to demand a change in leadership.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Yunus as its chief\" was taken at a meeting of President Mohammed Shahabuddin, military leaders and the heads of the Students Against Discrimination (SAD) group, Shahabuddin's press office said.\n\n\"The president has asked the people to help ride out the crisis. Quick formation of an interim government is necessary to overcome the crisis,\" it said in a statement, adding that the national police chief had been sacked.\n\nYunus will have the title of chief advisor, according to SAD leader Nahid Islam.\n\nShahabuddin agreed that the interim government \"will be formed within the shortest time\" possible, Islam told reporters.\n\nHasina, 76, had been in power since 2009 but was accused of rigging elections in January and then watched millions of people take to the streets over the past month demanding her resignation.\n\nHundreds of people were killed as security forces sought to quell the unrest but the protests grew and Hasina finally fled Monday aboard a helicopter after the military turned against her.\n\nArmy chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said it was \"time to stop the violence\".\n\nThe president dissolved parliament yesterday, a key demand of the student leaders and the major opposition Bangladesh National Party (BNP), which has demanded elections within three months.\n\n\"If action is needed in Bangladesh, for my country and for the courage of my people, then I will take it,\" Yunus told AFP in a statement yesterday, also calling for free elections.\n\n'In Dr Yunus, we trust'\n\n\"In Dr Yunus, we trust,\" Asif Mahmud, a key leader of SAD, wrote on Facebook.\n\nThe military yesterday reshuffled several generals, demoting some seen as close to Hasina, and sacking Ziaul Ahsan, a commander of the feared Rapid Action Battalion paramilitary force.\n\nEx-prime minister and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, 78, was also released from years of house arrest, a presidential statement and her party said.\n\nStreets in the capital were largely peaceful yesterday -- with shops opening and international flights resuming at Dhaka airport -- but government offices remained mostly closed.\n\nMillions of Bangladeshis flooded the streets to celebrate after Hasina's departure -- and jubilant crowds also stormed and looted her official residence.\n\n\"We have been freed from a dictatorship\", said Sazid Ahnaf, 21, comparing the events to the independence war that split the nation from Pakistan more than five decades ago.\n\n100s dead\n\nPolice said mobs had launched revenge attacks on Hasina's allies and their own officers, and also freed more than 500 inmates from a prison.\n\nMonday was the deadliest day since protests began in early July, and 10 more people were killed yesterday, taking the death toll overall to at least 432, according to an AFP tally based on police, government officials and hospital doctors.\n\nProtesters broke into parliament and torched TV stations. Others smashed statues of Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's independence hero.\n\nSome businesses and homes owned by Hindus -- a group seen by some in the Muslim-majority nation as close to Hasina -- were also attacked.\n\nBangladeshi rights groups, as well as US and European Union diplomats, have expressed concerns about reports of attacks on religious, ethnic and other minority groups.\n\nNeighbouring India and China, both key regional allies of Bangladesh, have called for calm.\n\nPolitical prisoners\n\nHasina's government was accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including through extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.\n\nMothers of some of the hundreds of political prisoners secretly jailed under Hasina's rule waited outside a military intelligence building in Dhaka on yesterday.\n\n\"We need answers,\" said campaigner Sanjida Islam Tulee.\n\nThe fate of Hasina, now in India, is also uncertain.\n\nA source had said she wanted to go to London but calls by the British government for a UN-led investigation into the violence put that in doubt.\n\nThomas Kean from the International Crisis Group said the new authorities faced daunting challenges.\n\n\"The interim government... needs to embark on the long task of rebuilding democracy in Bangladesh, which has been so badly eroded in recent years,\" he said. -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "malaymail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Malay Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

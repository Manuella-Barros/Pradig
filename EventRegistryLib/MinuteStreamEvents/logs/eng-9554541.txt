Another incident involving inappropriate behavior towards wrestlers occurred earlier in the night, highlighting the need for respect towards performers. Despite the challenges, both Blue and Ellering managed to deliver a solid match, impressing AEW officials with their professionalism.\n\nAn unfortunate incident took place during a recent AEW and ROH television taping which saw Skye Blue verbally abused throughout her match.\n\nSkye Blue Was Verbally Abused By A Fan\n\nBlue was competing on the Ring Of Honor taping section of the night on May 8th, which took place after AEW Dynamite went off the air as she faced Rachael Ellering in singles action. Throughout the match a fan in the front row allegedly harrassed Blue, making countless inappropriate comments at her.\n\nPWInsider reported that the fan in question was told specifically by Blue, \"not to be such a pervert\" during the match, with the AEW star then shouting several expletives towards them. It was also noted by fans on social media that Blue appeared visibly upset about the situation.\n\nRelated Skye Blue's Rise To Be AEW's Next Big Star, Explained Skye Blue is enjoying a surge in popularity in AEW with her recent character change and overall improvement. Can she become AEW's next huge star?\n\nAfter the match, AEW official Aubrey Edwards instructed security to speak with the member of the audience, and they ended up being escorted out of the building. It was reported that the attendee had a small child with them throughout the situation.\n\nOf course, fans are encouraged to be vocal throughout any wrestling show, as that is a crucial part of the product. But a firm line has to be drawn, and the minimum that is expected is respect towards anybody performing inside the ring. AEW officials praised both Blue and Ellering for being able to keep the match together despite the difficult circumstances.\n\nSaraya Also Had Issues Earlier In The Night\n\nClose\n\nUnfortunately, Blue wasn't the only wrestler who had to deal with some inappropriate behavior at ringside on Wednesday. During AEW Dynamite, Mariah May competed against Harley Cameron which resulted in Saraya calling out some fans who were sitting front row.\n\nShe pointed to the camera and publicly labeled them as \"f***ing creeps,\" and went on to warn women watching the show to stay away from them, claiming they will attack you. The former AEW Women's World Champion could be seen visibly arguing with the fans afterward while the match was ongoing. Saraya then shared the clip on social media to further illustrate her point.\n\nAccording to sources that PWInsider spoke with, one of the fans whom Saraya had problems with was the one who abused Blue later on in the evening.\n\nAt this point, neither Blue nor AEW as a company has commented on this matter.", "source": {"uri": "thesportster.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheSportster"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_wilkinson@thesportster.com", "name": "Matthew Wilkinson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skye_Blue", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Skye Blue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Elite_Wrestling", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All Elite Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Honor", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ring of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FITE", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FITE"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tony Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_Edwards", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aubrey Edwards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEW_Dynamite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AEW Dynamite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachael_Ellering", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rachael Ellering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraya_Bevis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saraya Bevis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEW_Women's_World_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AEW Women's World Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling ring"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Psychological_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Psychological Abuse", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Abuse", "wgt": 11}], "image": "https://static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/skye-blue-cropped.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554541", "eventUri": "eng-9554541", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 852, "textEnd": 859}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-01-01", "textStart": 120, "textEnd": 130}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

The harassment became louder as the match went along, even as several other fans in the area told him to stop.\n\nUpon the match ending, Blue was said to have immediately made her way backstage, visibly upset, while AEW/ROH official Aubrey Edwards went to AEW security and demanded the fan be removed from the arena. Building security also got involved, and the fan was seen putting up a fight as they attempted to remove him, leading to more people getting involved before he was eventually thrown out.\n\nAt this time, neither AEW nor Blue have commented on the situation.

She emphasized the severity of the harassment, stating, \"I've NEVER in my career heard such vulgar things being said to talent during a match. Sexual harassment is not heckling.\"\n\n\"The speed in which @RefAubrey and I got out of the ring last night post match to get this creep kicked out was remarkable. Olympic medalist speeds. I've NEVER in my career heard such vulgar things being said to talent during a match. Sexual harassment is not heckling.\"\n\nIn her message, Ellering also expressed gratitude to the genuine fans who attend events to support and enjoy the show, contrasting them with the individual whose behavior crossed the line into predatory territory. She firmly asserted that such behavior has no place in wrestling or any public space, calling for a lifetime ban for the perpetrator.\n\n\"I do want to say this: Thank you very much to the rowdy, respectful fans that come out to enjoy the show and support. We really appreciate you! This guy wasn't a fan. He was a pervert who should be banned from shows for life.\"\n\nThis incident serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining a safe and respectful environment for performers and fans alike. Ellering's courage in speaking out against this behavior sets a powerful example, and her call for action underscores the need for continued vigilance against harassment in the wrestling community.\n\nWhat steps do you think wrestling promotions should take to ensure the safety and well-being of performers and fans in light of incidents like this?

The longest-serving companion in British history, the Duke of Edinburgh will not be completely disappearing from the public eye. However, due primarily to his advanced age -- he turned 96 in June -- it's time for him to step down.\n\n\"I think he is retiring now in order to have a few years of retirement and I think the timing is thought through. It's 70 years this autumn since he became the consort of Princess Elizabeth and then the Queen - so, after 70 years, I think he feels probably he has done his stuff,\" Gyles Brandreth, a friend of the Duke, told BBC News.\n\nHere is what you need to know:\n\nOn Wednesday, the Duke of Edinburgh will attend a \"parade to mark the finale of the Royal Marines 1664 Global Challenge,\" according to Sky News. The event will be held at Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe 1664 Global Challenge started 100 days ago and involved all Royal Marines. According to the organization's website, the challenge is made up of a series of events -- 100 over the course of 100 days -- in which participants run 16.64 miles each day for a total of 1,664 miles -- the significance being that 1664 is the year that the Corps was founded.\n\nThey do this as a way to raise awareness and to raise money for the Corps' family as a whole.\n\n\"The 1664 Global Challenge provides the opportunity and platform for the Corps' family, both serving and retired to get involved towards fundraising efforts for The Royal Marines Charity.\"\n\nPrince Philip will attend the parade alongside Queen Elizabeth II. He has long been associated with the Royal Marines -- for 64 years, to be exact. On June 2, 1953, Philip was appointed Captain General in succession to the late King George VI, according to Royal.uk.\n\nAt Wednesday's event, Philip will meet with veterans and other Marine Corp. members. He will also receive the 1664 Global Challenge baton.\n\n\u200cBack in May, Queen Elizabeth II called an emergency meeting at Buckingham Palace, gathering the powers that be at an odd time of day. Immediately, people on social media started speculating about what the meeting might have been about. It didn't take long for a couple of media outlets to report that Prince Philip had died, but that wasn't the case at all.\n\nHours later, an official announcement was made by the palace: Prince Philip was alive and well, but he would officially retire from his royal duties this fall.\n\nBelow is the official statement announcing Prince Philip's retirement, released to BBC News.\n\n\u200cAlthough Prince Philip will not be accepting invitations to any upcoming events officially, he will still be attending events with Queen Elizabeth II. He is expected to attend high profile events such as the annual Trooping the Colour, an annual celebration of the Queen's birthday.\n\nAlso, when U.S. President Donald Trump visits the U.K., Prince Philip is expected to be on-hand to support the Queen.\n\nAccording to BBC News, Philip will still be associated with several hundred organizations despite his retirement.\n\n\"The duke carried out 110 days of engagements in 2016, making him the fifth busiest member of the royal family, according to Court Circular listings. He is patron, president or a member of more than 780 organizations and will continue to be associated with them, but 'will no longer play an active role by attending engagements' Buckingham Palace said.\"\n\nPrince Philip has had quite the royal career. Since marrying Queen Elizabeth II in 1947 (the couple will celebrate their 70th wedding anniversary in November), Philip has carried out 22,181 solo engagements. He has also taken part in 637 overseas visits without his wife. He has given 5,493 speeches and has penned a total of 14 books, according to BBC News.\n\nPhilip is going to be greatly missed; his retirement represents the end of an era for the British people -- and for the rest of the world.\n\n\"I love his wit and I think people will miss seeing that on a day-to-day basis. But I don't think it's him disappearing, I think it's just him being very sensible, he's 95 years old. He's slowing down and I'm sure we will still hear and see of him from time to time,\" former royal butler Grant Harrold previously told BBC News, speaking about Philip's retirement.\n\n\u200cThe Duke is in very good health despite his advanced age. He has had a few relatively normal health issues over the years, but nothing very serious.\n\nDuring the last holiday season, he and Queen Elizabeth II ended up catching \"heavy colds,\" but they both rested for a few days and recovered just fine.\n\nThis past June, Prince Philip was hospitalized after coming down with an infection. The infection was been caused by a \"preexisting condition\" and Philip was up and walking around his room at King Edward VII Hospital in London soon after being admitted.\n\nIt has been made very clear that Philip isn't stepping down from his royal duties because of his health.\n\n\"He is not giving up on life, just stepping [down] from full-time public engagements,\" royal commentator Dickie Arbiter told BBC News.", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-02", "title": "Prince Philip's Retirement: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-02", "id": "14851769", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 107, "amb": false, "textEnd": 115, "date": "2017-08-02"}], "storyUri": "eng-3330847", "time": "03:34:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "type": "person", "id": "302942"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)", "label": {"eng": "Family (biology)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303765"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303766"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304262"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}, "type": "org", "id": "304957"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}, "type": "person", "id": "305814"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh", "label": {"eng": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh"}, "type": "person", "id": "306901"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}, "type": "org", "id": "307454"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_VI", "label": {"eng": "George VI"}, "type": "person", "id": "317125"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_people", "label": {"eng": "British people"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "326397"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage", "label": {"eng": "Patronage"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "330020"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_British_Isles", "label": {"eng": "History of the British Isles"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "345870"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_News", "label": {"eng": "BBC News"}, "type": "org", "id": "387324"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Marines", "label": {"eng": "Royal Marines"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "438155"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_general", "label": {"eng": "Captain general"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "555682"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_Circular", "label": {"eng": "Court Circular"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "577728"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trooping_the_Colour", "label": {"eng": "Trooping the Colour"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "637252"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Official_Birthday", "label": {"eng": "Queen's Official Birthday"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "725463"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Challenge", "label": {"eng": "Global Challenge"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "765406"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyles_Brandreth", "label": {"eng": "Gyles Brandreth"}, "type": "person", "id": "769617"}], "url": "https://heavy.com/news/2017/08/prince-philip-retires-why-reason-age-health-photos/", "timeCrawl": "11:01:00", "image": "https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-683835644_opt.jpg?quality=65&strip=all", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-02T03:34:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.7843137383460999}

him on royal duty.\n\nPrince Philip, who turned 96 in June, will attend a parade at Buckingham Palace to mark the finale of the Royal Marines 1664 Global Challenge.\n\nBuckingham Palace announced in May that the Duke would not be taking on any more solo engagements from Autumn this year.\n\nA palace spokeswoman said the parade would \"bring His Royal Highness's individual programme to a conclusion, although he may choose to attend certain events, alongside the Queen, from time-to-time\".\n\nIt was the Duke who decided now was the right time to step back from public life, and he does so with the \"full support\" of the Queen.\n\nThe palace has said it was not a decision made on the advice of doctors.\n\nPhil Dampier, who has written several books about the Duke of Edinburgh, said it was the right decision.\n\nHe told Sky News: \"At 96 I really do feel he deserves a rest.\n\n\"I don't think he's going to disappear completely, I'm sure he'll turn up for various jobs with the Queen here and there but the nice thing is now he can pick and choose them, and relax when he wants to, and that's good for the nation I think.\"\n\nBuckingham Palace has confirmed there are no plans for the Queen to reduce her official workload.\n\nIn a statement they said: \"Her Majesty will continue to carry out a full programme of official engagements with the support of members of the Royal Family.\"\n\nYounger members of Team Windsor, as the family have been described, will be expected to increase their royal workload to support the Queen.\n\nLast week Prince William gave up his job as an air ambulance pilot to become a full time royal.\n\nPhilip, however, may pop up at public events from time to time, such as Trooping the Colour in future years or even support the Queen during the proposed state visit for US president Donald Trump.\n\nMartin Palmer, a close friend and adviser to the Duke, believes Prince Philip's support for the Queen and his personal contribution to national life should not be underestimated, as behind the scenes he remained head of the family as his wife carried out the role of head of state.\n\nMr Palmer said: \"I think his greatest achievement has been to support the Queen through probably one of the most tempestuous periods the monarchy has ever been through and, in a sense, to wear the trousers in the family, so the Queen could wear the crown.\"\n\nLater at Buckingham Palace Prince Philip will attend a parade to mark the end of the Royal Marines 1664 challenge.\n\nHe became Captain General of the Royal Marines in 1953, following the death of the Queen's father George VI.\n\nThe 1664 challenge raises money for The Royal Marines Charity.\n\nThis year marines from around the country have run 16.64 miles each day for 100 days, totalling a distance of 1,664 miles, a symbolic number for the naval fighting force which traces its roots back to 1664.\n\nSince 1952, Prince Philip has carried out 22,219 solo public engagements, taken 637 solo overseas trips, made 5,493 speeches and authored 14 books.\n\nHe became the longest-serving consort in the British monarchy's history in 2009 and is the oldest ever male member of the

The Duke's has brightened these decades,\" the Telegraph said.\n\nPhilip is still in good health for a man of his age, although he was hospitalised for two nights in June for the treatment of an undisclosed infection.\n\nA spokeswoman said his individual programme of public engagements had come to an end, but \"he may choose to attend engagements alongside the queen from time to time\".\n\nWhen he announced his retirement, Prime Minister Theresa May offered him Britain's \"deepest gratitude and good wishes\".\n\nBoth the senior royals have taken a step back in recent years, leaving their eldest son and heir Prince Charles and grandson Prince William to take their places.\n\nWilliam, the Duke of Cambridge, ended his brief career as an air ambulance pilot last week and will now turn his full attention to royal duties, alongside his wife Kate.\n\nBut while the queen supports her husband's decision to retire, experts say her own sacred vow at her 1953 coronation to serve for life was unbreakable.\n\n\"Her Majesty will continue to carry out a full programme of official engagements with the support of members of the royal family,\" the palace said earlier this year. -- AFP", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-02", "title": "At 96, Prince Philip begins his retirement", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-02", "id": "14769508",

feats raising funds and awareness for the Royal Marines Charity.\n\nIt was announced in May that Philip would be retiring from royal engagements, following more than 65 years supporting the Queen in her role as head of state and attending events for his own charities and organisations.\n\nPhilip, 96, was praised at the time for his public service with Prime Minister Theresa May leading the tributes saying he had given the Queen 'steadfast support', while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Duke's 'clear sense of public duty' had inspired people for more than 60 years.\n\nDespite his age, Philip's decision - which was fully supported by the Queen and was not medically related - came as a surprise as he still appeared to relish meeting people and carrying out his public role.\n\nMother and twins killed in crash in front of husband named\n\nThe Duke is known for his quips and over the past few months has been joking about his impending retirement, even telling celebrity cook Prue Leith at a Palace event 'I'm discovering what it's like to be on your last legs'.\n\nBuckingham Palace has stressed although the Duke's diary of engagements will come to an end on Wednesday he may decide to attend certain events, alongside the Queen, from time to time.\n\nThe Queen's public schedule continues as normal but other members of the Royal Family will step up in support of the monarch in her role as head of state.\n\nOn Wednesday, in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace Philip, in his role as Captain General of the Royal Marines, will attend a parade to mark the finale of the 1664 Global Challenge.\n\nHis association with the Royal Marines dates back 64 years to June 2, 1953 when he was appointed Captain General in succession to the late King George VI.\n\nThe challenge, which recognises the year 1664 when the Corps was founded, has seen Royal Marines all over the world raising money for the military unit's charity with a number of ingenious feats.\n\nPrimary school teacher watched live stream of boy, 6, being raped\n\nThe 1,664 mile running challenge began in Plymouth on April 25 with Royal Marines running 16.64 miles a day for 100 days, with the gruelling trek due to end at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday.\n\nThe Duke will meet some of the runners including two Royal Marines who have completed the entire distance.\n\nRoyal Marines from around the globe have also been taking part in extreme events including a 34-mile swim underwater and a company of Royal Marines lifting more than 20,000 tonnes and running 10,000 kilometres.\n\nDuring the event Philip will also meet veterans and cadets before receiving the 1664 Global Challenge baton.\n\nThe parade will end with a march past, a royal salute and three cheers for the Captain General.\n\nOver the years Philip has attended many Royal Marines events and in 2014, to mark the Corps' 350th anniversary, the Duke wore his full ceremonial uniform as Captain General to the state opening of parliament.", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-02", "title": "Today is Prince Philip's last official day before retirement", "dateCrawl":

and last - official public engagement.\n\nThe Duke of Edinburgh met Royal Marines at Buckingham Palace who have completed a mammoth 1,664 mile trek on Wednesday - his final official royal event before he retires from public engagements.\n\nPhilip remains in good health but is getting increasingly frail and understandably can have his energy sapped by the 200-or-so public appearances he makes every year on his own or with his wife the Queen, who will never retire.\n\nUntil today's event he has carried out around 22,219 solo engagements since 1947 and given 5,493 speeches - but has now taken a well-earned retirement with 'Team Windsor' - the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry - set to take on some of his workload.\n\nToday in the grounds of Buckingham Palace, Philip is celebrating the achievements of servicemen who have taken part in the 1664 Global Challenge, a series of strength and endurance feats raising funds and awareness for the Royal Marines Charity.\n\nThe Duke of Edinburgh met Royal Marines at Buckingham Palace who have completed a mammoth 1,664 mile trek on Wednesday - his final official royal event before he retires from public engagements.\n\nPrince Philip's recent health scares\n\nPrince Philip has boasted excellent health for a 95-year-old and insists he has not had the flu for more than 40 years.\n\nNot to be cowed by his ill health in recent years, he still enjoys an active life and continues with his carriage driving, which he took up in 1971 after retiring from polo.\n\nIn 1961, the Duke broke a bone in his left ankle in a collision on the polo field.\n\nPolo also left him suffering from arthritis in his right wrist, a condition made worse by shaking many thousands of hands at official function\n\nBut in recent years he has struggled with illness.\n\nDecember 2011: The prince is airlifted to hospital from Sandringham two days before Christmas after suffering chest pains, and undergoes surgery for a blocked coronary artery.\n\nJune 2012: Philip is taken to hospital after developing a urinary infection during the river pageant to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee\n\nJune 2013: Philip has abdominal surgery for an undisclosed condition and spends 11 days in hospital, including his 92nd birthday.\n\nDecember 2016: Both the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh suddenly cancel plans to leave London for their festive break in Norfolk after they both come down with heavy colds.\n\nThe Queen's Consort announced in May he would be retiring from royal engagements after more than 65 years supporting the monarch in her role as head of state and attending events for his own charities and organisations.\n\nPhilip, 96, was praised at the time for his public service with Prime Minister Theresa May leading the tributes saying he had given the Queen 'steadfast support', while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Duke's 'clear sense of public duty' had inspired people for more than 60 years.\n\nDespite his age Philip's decision - which was fully supported by the Queen and was not medically related - came as a surprise as he still appeared to relish meeting people and carrying out his public role.\n\nThe Duke is known for his quips and over the past few months has been joking about his impending retirement, even telling celebrity cook Prue Leith at a Palace event 'I'm discovering what it's like to be on your last legs'.\n\nHis life-long friend and relative, Lady Myra Butter, 92, told the Mail previously: 'He always used to say, quite openly, I'm past my sell-by date'.\n\nAnd The Duke of Edinburgh made himself and a crowd of guests roar on May 4, when he announced his own retirement, after mathematician Sir Michael Atiyah stopped him at a St James's Palace event to say: 'I'm sorry to hear you're standing down', to which he replied: 'Well I can't stand up much longer'.\n\nBuckingham Palace has stressed although the Duke's diary of engagements will come to an end on Wednesday he may decide to attend certain events, alongside the Queen, from time to time.\n\nThe Queen's public schedule continues as normal but other members of the Royal Family will step up in support of the monarch in her role as head of state.\n\nOn Wednesday, in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace Philip, in his role as Captain General of the Royal Marines, attended a parade to mark the finale of the 1664 Global Challenge.\n\nHis association with the Royal Marines dates back 64 years to June 2, 1953 when he was appointed Captain General in succession to the late King George VI.\n\nThe challenge, which recognises the year 1664 when the Corps was founded, has seen Royal Marines all over the world raising money for the military unit's charity with a number of ingenious feats.\n\nThe 1,664 mile running challenge began in Plymouth on April 25 with Royal Marines running 16.64 miles a day for 100 days, with the gruelling trek due ending at Buckingham Palace today.\n\nThe Duke is meeting some of the runners including two Royal Marines who have completed the entire distance.\n\nRoyal Marines from around the globe have also been taking part in extreme events including a 34-mile swim underwater and a company of Royal Marines lifting more than 20,000 tonnes and running 10,000 kilometres.\n\nDuke of Edinburgh by numbers (1947-today) Total number of solo engagements - 22,219Total number of solo overseas visits - 637 (Commonwealth countries - 229 visits to 67 countries / other countries 408 visits to 76 countries)Total number of speeches given - 5,496Total number of patronages - 785 organisationsPresentation of colours - 54Number of service appointments - 32Number of books authored - 14\n\nDuring the event Philip will also meet veterans and cadets before receiving the 1664 Global Challenge baton.\n\nThe parade ended with a march past, a royal salute and three cheers for the Captain General.\n\nOver the years Philip has attended many Royal Marines events and in 2014, to mark the Corps' 350th anniversary, the Duke wore his full ceremonial uniform as Captain General to the state opening of parliament.\n\nThe Duke of Edinburgh has spent 52 days this year carrying out public engagements - more than the Queen and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.\n\nWere Philip not standing down from official duties, he would be likely to end this year having clocked up some 90 days of public events, his lowest total in recent years.\n\nAnalysis by the Press Association has found that the number of days spent by the Duke on duties such as meeting the public and attending ceremonial occasions has declined over the past 15 years.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2006, Philip spent an average of 139 days a year on engagements, compared with 121 days from 2012 to 2016.\n\nLast year, the total was 110 - which was still higher than the number for his grandchildren William (80) and Harry (86) and for William's wife Kate (63).\n\nEven in his final year of public service, the Duke has remained more active than the Queen and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who have spent 49, 45 and 39 days respectively on engagements.\n\nThe royals who have made the most public appearances so far this year have been the Princess Royal (111), Prince Charles (89) and the Duke of York (69).\n\nPhilip's quietest year in recent times came in 2013, when a two-week stint in hospital recovering from abdominal surgery allowed him to attend only 92 days of engagements.\n\nBy contrast, he clocked up 149 days in the Queen's Golden Jubilee year of 2002, and 165 in her Diamond Jubilee year of 2012.\n\nFor the 92 days spanning May to July 2002, he appeared in public on a total of 67 days, including 15 in succession in June.\n\nAlthough Philip was admitted to hospital in August 2012 with a recurrent bladder infection, he still managed 165 days of public engagements during the year.\n\nThis means he spent the equivalent of nearly every other day touring the country to mark the Diamond Jubilee.\n\nTimeline: The life and times of the Duke of Edinburgh\n\n1930: Prince Philippos of Greece and Denmark was born on June 10 1921\n\nJune 10 1921 -

In 1947, two years after the end of the war, the Princess married dashing, blond Philip in Westminster Abbey.\n\nHe renounced his Greek title and became a naturalised British subject, and was made Duke of Edinburgh by the King.\n\nThe Duke and the Princess had the first of their four children, Charles, now the Prince of Wales, in 1948 and Anne, now the Princess Royal, in 1950.\n\nThey initially enjoyed a simple married life during stays on the island of Malta, where the Duke was stationed with the Navy.\n\nBut their marital bliss changed forever when George VI died on February 6 1952 and Princess Elizabeth became Queen.\n\nPhilip - whose naval career had come to an end - had to a define a new role for himself as his wife diligently took to her duties as head of state.\n\nHe accompanied the Queen around the world on Commonwealth tours and state visits and across the UK.\n\nHe also undertook many solo royal engagements on his own, becoming involved with hundreds of organisations - often as a hands-on president, and continued to do so over the decades.\n\nHe set about modernising Buckingham Palace after being told to keep out of the Queen's official duties, and reorganised the Balmoral and Sandringham estates, as well as becoming ranger of Windsor Great Park.\n\n'I tried to find useful things to do,' he said about starting a footman training programme at the Palace.\n\nIn 1956, he set up the Duke of Edinburgh's Award - inspired by his time at Gordonstoun and his mentor and headmaster Dr Kurt Hahn.\n\nIt has become one of the country's best-known youth self-improvement schemes, with million across the globe gaining their bronze, silver and gold awards.\n\nThe Duke takes a great interest in scientific and technological research and development, as well as the conservation of nature.\n\nAfter a gap of 10 years, the Queen and Philip welcomed two more children - Andrew, now the Duke of York, in 1960, and Edward, now the Earl of Wessex, in 1964.\n\nThe Duke has been depicted as a tough but caring father.\n\nmore videos 1 2 3 Watch video\n\nCar seen in flames on M11 following collision with lorry\n\nWatch video\n\nGang of screaming chimpanzees launch attack to dethrone alpha male\n\nWatch video\n\nDaredevils climb the tallest rollercoaster in England - the Big One\n\nWatch video\n\nTourist coach squeezes past camper van on dangerous Scottish road\n\nWatch video\n\nA \u00a316 tool is used to break into any van in 30 seconds\n\nWatch video\n\nAdorable baby girl has best reaction to hearing Beyonce\n\nWatch video\n\nCrashed cars left abandoned at Britain's worst roundabout\n\nWatch video\n\nBrave young woman strides into gang fight to save teenager\n\nWatch video\n\nThis is one of the last videos shared by Risila Binte Wazer\n\nWatch video\n\n'It's a complete wind up' Agnew's hilarious prank on Boycott\n\nWatch video\n\nVideo shows holidaymakers in huge passport queue at Palma airport\n\nWatch video\n\n'British' jihadi threatens to kill Americans in their own homes\n\nBorn at the family home, Mon Repos in Corfu Greece - allegedly on the kitchen table - on June 10 1921, Philip came to Britain when he was just one year old (pictured in July 2012)\n\nPrince Philip of Greece (second left) with his schoolmates at the MacJannet American school in St Cloud, France in 1929\n\nA keen sportsman, the young prince is pictured here at school during an athletics championship\n\nPhilip waterskiis off Marmaris, Turkey, during the Mediterranean Fleet's summer cruise while serving on HMS Magpie in 1951\n\nmore videos 1 2 3 Watch video\n\nPassengers alarmed as 700 tonne ferry crashes into harbour\n\nWatch video\n\nClip shows Trump greeting children before speaking at podium\n\nWatch video\n\nMoment Linda Hoey is caught out walking without a disability\n\nWatch video\n\nFestival-goer lies motionless after brutal rugby tackle\n\nWatch video\n\nInpatient driver can't wait for ferry to dock and drives into sea\n\nWatch video\n\nShocking moment man BITES and tries to rip police dog's ear off\n\nWatch video\n\nCar seen in flames on M11 following collision with lorry\n\nWatch video\n\nVideo shows holidaymakers in huge passport queue at Palma airport\n\nWatch video\n\nCouple with child make lucky escape as car crashes around them\n\nWatch video\n\nGang of screaming chimpanzees launch attack to dethrone alpha male\n\nWatch video\n\nDaredevils climb the tallest rollercoaster in England - the Big One\n\nWatch video\n\nTourist coach squeezes past camper van on dangerous Scottish road\n\nAn accomplished sportsman, he played polo regularly until 1971 and then took up four-in-hand carriage driving, representing Britain at several European and world championships.\n\nA qualified pilot, he gained his RAF wings in 1953, helicopter wings in 1956 and private pilot's licence in 1959. His love of the sea never waned, and he competing regularly at Cowes Regatta.\n\nThe Duke witnessed first-hand the troubles faced by the Windsors in the 1990s - from the scandal surrounding Sarah, Duchess of York - who was caught having her toes sucked by her financial adviser - to the fall out of Charles and Diana's War of the Waleses.\n\nWhen the Princess of Wales died suddenly in a car crash in 1997, Philip joined Charles, Princes William and Harry, and Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, in the solemn procession behind her funeral cortege.\n\nThe Duke also helped the Queen through the deaths of both her mother and sister in the Golden Jubilee year of 2002.\n\nHe has enjoyed good health throughout much of his life - recovering from a blocked coronary artery in 2011 and a bladder infection in 2012 - the latter leading him to miss the majority of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations.\n\nHe continued to take part in fast-paced, dangerous carriage-driving events, competing at international level until the age of 85.\n\nmore videos 1 2 3 Watch video\n\nCar seen in flames on M11 following collision with lorry\n\nWatch video\n\nMoment Linda Hoey is caught out walking without a disability\n\nWatch video\n\nFestival-goer lies motionless after brutal rugby tackle\n\nWatch video\n\nInpatient driver can't wait for ferry to dock and drives into sea\n\nWatch video\n\nVideo shows holidaymakers in huge passport queue at Palma airport\n\nWatch video\n\nPassengers alarmed as 700 tonne ferry crashes into harbour\n\nWatch video\n\nClip shows Trump greeting children before speaking at podium\n\nWatch video\n\nShocking moment man BITES and tries to rip police dog's ear off\n\nWatch video\n\nAirport ground staff caught throwing suitcases onto luggage belt\n\nWatch video\n\nPalma airport chaos: Guard shortage leads to 'ridiculous' scene\n\nWatch video\n\nWhite House communications director Anthony Scaramucci is removed from post\n\nWatch video\n\nThis is one of the last videos shared by Risila Binte Wazer\n\nWhen Princess Diana died suddenly in a car crash in 1997, Philip joined Charles, William, Harry and the Princess's brother, Earl Spencer, in the solemn procession behind her funeral cortege\n\nIn August 2012, the Duke was treated for a bladder infection and spent five nights in hospital in Aberdeen and missed the opening of the Paralympic Games. He is pictured leaving the hospital\n\nWhen he turned 90 in June 2011 he insisted on no fuss, but the Queen bestowed on him a new title - Lord High Admiral, titular head of the Royal Navy.\n\nIt was a touching tribute to the man who given up his military career to support his wife, and devote himself to royal service.\n\nA symbol of continuity within the monarchy and public life, the Duke of Edinburgh is the person the Queen relies upon above all others.\n\nPhilip's first ever private secretary Michael Parker, a friend from the Navy, once revealed: 'He told me the first day he offered me my job that his job, first, second and last was never to let her down.'\n\nAs Prince Philip retires aged 96, his wife the Queen will still work full time aged 91 because hers is a 'job for life'\n\nPrince Philip and the Queen arrive at St James's Palace, London, for an Order of Merit service on May shortly after announcing his own retirement\n\nWhile the Duke of Edinburgh is retiring at the grand old age of 96, the Queen is in her job for life.\n\nThe monarch's public duties and behind-the-scenes work as head of state continue despite the Queen being 91.\n\nOn the throne for more than 65 years, Elizabeth II has always made clear it that abdication is not an option.\n\nOn her 21st birthday, she made her now famous radio broadcast from Cape Town in South Africa in 1947 on her first official overseas visit, declaring: 'My whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.'\n\nWith Philip stepping down from public duties, the Queen will increasingly turn to younger members of Team Windsor - namely the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge - to support her in her role.\n\nWilliam's job as an air ambulance pilot finished at the end of July - neatly timed for him to become a full-time royal just before his grandfather retires.\n\nThe Queen rarely carries out overseas duties and, although she still holds investitures, a number are also carried out by Charles, William and the Princess Royal.\n\nBuckingham Palace confirmed: 'Her Majesty will continue to carry out a full programme of official engagements with the support of members of the Royal Family.'\n\nPhilip, however, may pop up at public events from time to time.\n\nHe could choose to make appearances on the Palace balcony for Trooping the Colour in future years or even turn up to greet US president Donald Trump during his proposed state visit.\n\nIn 1992, the Queen dismissed any speculation that she would step down, insisting frankly: 'It is a job for life.'\n\nShe was speaking about the death of her father, King George VI, for a BBC TV documentary, Elizabeth R, marking the 40th anniversary of her accession.\n\n'In a way, I didn't have an apprenticeship. My father died much too young and so it was all very sudden ... taking on and making the best job you can,' the Queen said.\n\n'It's a question of maturing into something that one's got used to doing, and accepting the fact that it's your fate, because I think continuity is very important. It is a job for life.'\n\n'I declare this thing open, whatever it is': The gaffe-prone Duke who often says what he shouldn't (but the public love him for it)\n\nAt times witty, at other times, insensitive, Prince Philip has become known for being the most gaffe-prone member of the Royal Family, not shy of expressing his uncensored and often politically incorrect opinions on a variety of subjects.\n\nThe Queen's 95-year-old husband, who has announced he will retire from royal duties in the Autumn, is renowned for his risque, off-the-cuff remarks while carrying out official engagements.\n\nFrom addressing Aborigines on a state visit to Australia in March 2002 and asking them if they 'still throw spears at one another', to asking singer Tom Jones if he 'gargled with pebbles' following the 1969 Royal Variety performance, his comments have been toe curling and hilarious in equal measures.\n\nHere are some of them:\n\n'British women can't cook' (in Britain in 1966).\n\n'What do you gargle with, pebbles?' (speaking to singer Tom Jones after the 1969 Royal Variety Performance).\n\n'I declare this thing open, whatever it is.' (on a visit to Canada in 1969).\n\n'Everybody was saying we must have more leisure. Now they are complaining they are unemployed' (during the 1981 recession).\n\nIn a state visit to Australia in March 2002, the Prince asked Aborigines: 'Do you still throw spears at each other?' Cultural park manager William Brim replied: 'No, we don't do that any more'\n\n'If it has got four legs and it is not a chair, if it has got two wings and it flies but is not an aeroplane, and if it swims and it is not a submarine, the Cantonese will eat it.' (at a 1986 World Wildlife Fund meeting).\n\n'It looks like a tart's bedroom.' (on seeing plans for the Duke and Duchess of York's house at Sunninghill Park in 1988)\n\n'Yak, yak, yak; come on get a move on.' (shouted from the deck of Britannia in Belize in 1994 to the Queen who was chatting to her hosts on the quayside).\n\n'We didn't have counsellors rushing around every time somebody let off a gun, asking 'Are you all right? Are you sure you don't have a ghastly problem?' You just got on with it.' (about the Second World War commenting on modern stress counselling for servicemen in 1995).\n\n'How do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to get them through the test?' (to a driving instructor in Oban, Scotland, during a 1995 walkabout).\n\n'If a cricketer, for instance, suddenly decided to go into a school and batter a lot of people to death with a cricket bat, which he could do very easily, I mean, are you going to ban cricket bats?' (in 1996, amid calls to ban firearms after the Dunblane shooting).\n\nIn one of his most infamous outbursts, the Duke of Edinburgh said that British students would become 'slitty-eyed' if they stayed in China. The state visit in 1986 became renowned for the incident, after he advised the youngsters: 'If you stay here much longer you will all be slitty-eyed'. In a BBC documentary to mark his 90th birthday, he remarked: 'I'd forgotten about it. But for one particular reporter who overheard it, it wouldn't have come out'\n\n'Bloody silly fool!' (in 1997, referring to a Cambridge University car park attendant who did not recognise him).\n\n'It looks as if it was put in by an Indian.' (pointing at an old-fashioned fusebox in a factory near Edinburgh in 1999).\n\n'Deaf? If you are near there, no wonder you are deaf.' (to young deaf people in Cardiff, in 1999, referring to a school's steel band).\n\n'They must be out of their minds.' (in the Solomon Islands, in 1982, when he was told that the annual population growth was 5%).\n\n'You are a woman, aren't you?' (In Kenya, in 1984, after accepting a small gift from a local woman).\n\n'If you stay here much longer, you'll all be slitty-eyed.' (to British students in China, during the 1986 state visit).\n\nIn 2013, spotting pretty Hannah Jackson, 25, on a trip with his wife to Bromley in Kent, the elderly royal turned to the policeman standing next to her and gestured towards her eye-catching peplum-style red dress which had a zip running the length of its front. 'I would get arrested if I unzipped that dress!' he exclaimed\n\n'Your country is one of the most notorious centres of trading in endangered species in the world.' (in Thailand, in 1991, after accepting a conservation award).\n\n'Oh no, I might catch some ghastly disease.' (in Australia, in 1992, when asked to stroke a Koala bear).\n\n'You can't have been here that long - you haven't got a pot belly.' (to a Briton in Budapest, Hungary, in 1993).\n\n'Aren't most of you descended from pirates?' (to a wealthy islander in the Cayman Islands in 1994).\n\n'You managed not to get eaten, then?' (suggesting to a student in 1998 who had been trekking in Papua New Guinea that tribes there were still cannibals).\n\nIn Germany, in 1997, he welcomed German Chancellor Helmut Kohl at a trade fair as 'Reichskanzler' - the last German leader who used the title was Adolf Hitler.\n\nRoyal quip: The Duke of Edinburgh told this Filipino nurse at Luton and Dunstable University Hospital her country must be 'half empty', because so many of her compatriots have come to the UK to work for the NHS\n\n'You're too fat to be an astronaut.' (to 13-year-old Andrew Adams who told Philip he wanted to go into space. Salford, 2001).\n\n'I wish he'd turn the microphone off.' (muttered at the Royal Variety Performance as he watched Sir Elton John perform, 2001).\n\n'Do you still throw spears at each other?' (In Australia in 2002 talking to a successful aborigine entrepreneur).\n\n'You look like a suicide bomber.' (to a young female officer wearing a bullet-proof vest on Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, in 2002).\n\n'Do you know they're now producing eating dogs for anorexics?' (to a blind woman outside Exeter Cathedral, 2002)\n\nWhile visiting a London community centre group in July 2015, Philip asked a group of women 'who do you sponge off?' Ms Zamir, who founded the Chadwell Heath Asian Women's Network which meets at the centre, said: 'The Duke said to us 'who do you sponge off?' We're all married so it's our husbands. He was just teasing and it's similar to what I call my husband - the wallet'\n\n'Well, you didn't design your beard too well, did you?' (to designer Stephen Judge about his tiny goatee beard in July 2009).\n\n'There's a lot of your family in tonight.' (after looking at the name badge of businessman Atul Patel at a Palace reception for British Indians in October 2009).\n\n'Do you work it a strip club?' (to 24-year-old Barnstaple Sea Cadet Elizabeth Rendle when she told him she also worked in a nightclub in March 2010).\n\n'Do you have a pair of knickers made out of this?' pointing to some tartan (to Scottish Conservative leader Annabel Goldie a papal reception in Edinburgh in September 2010).\n\n'Bits are beginning to drop off.' (on approaching his 90th birthday, 2011)\n\n'How many people have you knocked over this morning on that thing?' (meeting disabled David Miller who drives a mobility scooter at the Valentine Mansion in Redbridge in March 2012)\n\nAt a 400-strong Buckingham Palace reception for British Indians in October 2009, Prince Philip told Indian businessman Atul Patel: 'There's a lot of your family in tonight'. The Prince is pictured during the night\n\n'I would get arrested if I unzipped that dress.' (to 25-year-old council worker Hannah Jackson, who was wearing a dress with a zip running the length of its front, on a Jubilee visit to Bromley, Kent, in May 2012)\n\n'The Philippines must be half empty as you're all here running the NHS.' (on meeting a Filipino nurse at a Luton hospital in February 2013)\n\n'Most stripping is done by hand.' (to 83-year-old Mars factory worker Audrey Cook when discussing how she used to strip or cut Mars Bars by hand in April 2013)\n\n'(Children) go to school because their parents don't want them in the house.' (prompting giggles from Malala Yousafzai, who survived an assassination attempt by the Taliban after campaigning for the right of girls to go to school without fear - October 2013)\n\n'Just take the f***ing picture.' (losing patience with an RAF photographer at events to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain - July 2015)\n\n'You look starved.' (to a pensioner on a visit to the Charterhouse almshouse for elderly men - February 2017)\n\nIn 2015 an impatient Prince Philip was caught on camera during a photocall for the Battle of Britain and appeared to say: 'Just take the f***ing picture'\n\nOther quotes:\n\n'I'm just a bloody amoeba.' (on the Queen's decision that their children should be called Windsor, not Mountbatten).'Gentlemen, I think it is time we pulled our fingers out.'(to the Industrial Co-Partnership Association on Britain's inefficient industries in 1961).'Are you asking me if the Queen is going to die?'

He's the Queen's 'consort' - and his role is to support Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nHe now holds the record for the longest-serving consort in British history!\n\nPrince Philip was born in 1921 on the Greek island of Corfu.\n\nHis family left Greece when Philip was just a one-year-old baby.\n\nHe spent his childhood in France, Germany and then here in Britain.\n\nHe celebrated his 96th birthday in June 2017.\n\nPhilip gave up his job in the Navy after Queen Elizabeth II's father died and she became Queen.\n\nHe has always thrown himself into his role of supporting her and has found a real passion in doing charity work.\n\nOne issue he cares about a lot is wildlife conservation - something he spoke to Newsround about back in 1986.\n\nYou may also have heard of one of his most important and famous charities: The Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme.\n\nIt offers challenges and adventure to thousands of young people in the UK.\n\nSince the Duke of Edinburgh's Award was launched in 1956, millions of young people have taken part in the scheme.\n\nPhilip also has a reputation for speaking his mind, and sometimes his comments have caused some people embarrassment.\n\nHowever, he is also praised by many for his dedication and his unique way of doing things.\n\nThe Queen is not only the head of state of the UK but she's also Head of the Commonwealth - an association of 52 countries, many of which used to be part of the British Empire.\n\nAs well as visiting parts of the UK, part of the Queen's job involves visiting these other countries, meeting people and doing lots of charity work, which Prince Philip often helps her with.\n\nSince 1952, Prince Philip has completed 22,219 royal engagements on his own.\n\nEvery year the Royal Family carry out over 2,000 official visits throughout the UK and worldwide.\n\nAs the Queen and the Duke have become older more of these royal duties have been passed to the younger members of the family.\n\nWhile Prince Philip's diary of events will come to an end in August, Buckingham Palace has said he may still decide to attend certain events alongside the Queen in the future.\n\nThe Queen's public schedule will continue as normal.", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-02", "title": "Prince Philip is retiring from royal duties", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-02", "id": "14821072", "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-06-", "textStart": 1235, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1244}], "storyUri": "eng-3330847", "time": "08:21:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "id": "56", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "id": "74", "location": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "id": "76", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "id": "88", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corfu"}, "id": "77874", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Corfu"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corfu", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(band)", "label": {"eng": "Queen (band)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303150"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303819"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state", "label": {"eng": "Head of state"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305553"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}, "type": "person", "id": "305814"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh", "label": {"eng": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh"}, "type": "person", "id": "306901"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Andrew,_Duke_of_York", "label": {"eng": "Prince Andrew, Duke of York"}, "type": "person", "id": "306908"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Princess_Royal", "label": {"eng": "Anne, Princess Royal"}, "type": "person", "id": "310218"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_conservation", "label": {"eng": "Wildlife conservation"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "322336"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Royal_Family", "label": {"eng": "British Royal Family"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "329310"}, {"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Empire"}, "id": "341235", "location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles,_Prince_of_Wales", "label": {"eng": "Charles, Prince of Wales"}, "type": "person", "id": "354698"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Edinburgh", "label": {"eng": "Duke of Edinburgh"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "436804"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Edinburgh's_Award", "label": {"eng": "Duke of Edinburgh's Award"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "436805"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_the_Commonwealth", "label": {"eng": "Head of the Commonwealth"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "491271"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsround", "label": {"eng": "Newsround"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "716781"}], "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/39802253", "timeCrawl": "08:21:00", "image": null, "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-02T08:21:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.6980392336845398}

In a massively erroneous report, the Daily Telegraph published an incomplete article online on Wednesday, announcing the Duke of Edinburgh's passing.\n\nThe Guardian reported, that the article, which has since been taken down, read: \"The Duke of Edinburgh, the longest-serving consort to a monarch in British history, has died at the age of XX, Buckingham Palace has announced.\"\n\nThe incomplete article further read: \"He will be given a royal ceremonial funeral in line with his wishes, which is expected to take place in seven days' time.\"\n\nA spokesman for the Telegraph apologized for the mistake and said that publishing processes will be reviewed as a matter of urgency. Meanwhile, this is not the first time that Prince Philip has been prematurely announced as dead. Back in May, the Sun made a similar error when the Duke had first announced his retirement from public engagements. The article, which was swiftly removed after publication online, was titled \"Prince Philip dead at 95, how did the Duke of Edinburgh die, etc etc.\"\n\nThe Telegraph's incomplete article was published online on Wednesday, as the still-alive Prince Philip prepared for his final day of public engagements. The 96-year-old monarch has accomplished 22,219 solo engagements since 1952. According to the Guardian, Buckingham Palace staff has calculated the Prince's solo overseas visits to be at 637. He has visited 143 countries, delivered 5,496 speeches, and has carried out the role of patron for 785 organizations during his royal career. On top of all that, he still managed to write 14 books.\n\nOn Wednesday, in the grounds of Buckingham Palace, Prince Philip met Royal Marines who have completed a mammoth 1,664-mile trek. This is his final official Royal event before he withdraws from public engagements. The Prince celebrated the achievements of servicemen who have taken part in the 1664 Global Challenge, which was a series of strength and endurance feats aimed to raise funds and awareness for the Royal Marines Charity.\n\nBut perhaps, the Duke of Edinburgh is best known for his seemingly never-ending list of gaffes during his reign as Queen Elizabeth II's husband. Throughout his career, his public appearances were not devoid of controversy. The Independent compiled some of his most popular gaffes.\n\nIn 1986, he told 21-year-old British student Simon Kerby during his visit to China: \"If you stay here much longer, you will go home with slitty eyes.\"\n\nIf his comments were uttered at a much later time, when every thing you say can be easily judged on the Internet, it would probably be a cause for outrage as most of his comments border on racism. For example, when he said to a woman in Kenya in 1984 after accepting a gift, \"You ARE a woman, aren't you?\"\n\n\"It looks as though it was put in by an Indian,\" the Prince once said of a fuse box during a tour of a Scottish factory in 1999. Later on, he clarified his comment and said, \"I meant to say cowboys. I just got my cowboys and Indians mixed up.\"\n\nWhile on a visit in 1998, Prince Philip also said to a British student who had trekked to Papua New Guinea, \"You managed not to get eaten then?\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Queen will continue with her duties and public schedule, and will be supported by other members of the royal family.", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-02", "title": "A Gaffe For The 'Prince of Gaffes': Publication Mistakenly Announce Prince Philip's Death On Day Of Retirement", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-02", "id": "14922421", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3330847", "time": "16:29:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "id": "47", "location": {"label": {"eng": "China"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "id": "76", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "id": "114", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "id": "84296", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "label": {"eng": "Internet"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302869"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302940"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}, "type": "org", "id": "303358"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303766"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}, "type": "person", "id": "305814"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "label": {"eng": "The Independent on Sunday"}, "type": "org", "id": "305878"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh", "label": {"eng": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh"}, "type": "person", "id": "306901"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "308814"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}, "type": "org", "id": "317114"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage", "label": {"eng": "Patronage"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "330020"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_British_Isles", "label": {"eng": "History of the British Isles"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "345870"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Edinburgh", "label": {"eng": "Duke of Edinburgh"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "436804"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Marines", "label": {"eng": "Royal Marines"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "438155"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_board", "label": {"eng": "Distribution board"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "454696"}], "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/4405287/a-gaffe-for-the-prince-of-gaffes-publication-mistakenly-announce-prince-philips-death-on-day-of-retirement/", "timeCrawl": "16:29:00", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Prince-Philip.jpg", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-02T16:29:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.6980392336845398}

and we wouldn't expect anything less.\n\nThe Duke of Edinburgh is known for his public gaffes, and has made a series of off-the-cuff comments over the years - ranging from hilarious to very politically incorrect.\n\nAs he bowed out of public life, at the grand old age of 96, the Duke couldn't resist one last joke.\n\nAnd let's face it, after carrying out 22,219 solo engagements since 1952, one is going to need a good sense of humour.\n\nSpeaking to the Royal Marines and referring to their fundraising efforts, he joked: \"You should all be locked up.\"\n\nThe Duke was attending a parade of Royal Marines, where he was meeting servicemen who have taken part in a 1,664 mile race to raise money for the Royal Marines Charity.\n\nDespite bad weather, many still flocked to outside the Palace to peek through the fence railings at the significant moment in royal history.\n\nWearing a black bowler hat and a long coat to stay dry, the Duke appeared in good spirits during the event when Royal Marines marched past him.\n\nThe Mirror's royal reporter Victoria Murphy tweeted from the event: \"Spontaneous cheers from the crowds and a final wave from Prince Philip as his last engagement comes to a close.\"\n\nIt's definitely not the first time Prince Philip has made jokes during public events.\n\nAfter being told that Madonna was singing the Die Another Day theme in 2002: \"Are we going to need ear plugs?\"\n\nSpeaking to a female sea cadet, he once asked: \"Do you work in a strip club?\"\n\nAnd referring to singer Tom Jones back in 1969, he quipped: \"It's difficult to see how it's possible to become immensely valuable by singing what are the most hideous songs.\"\n\nRead more of Prince Philip's best (and worst) public gaffes in the link below.\n\nThe engagement was hailed as \"historic\" by a Royal Marine whose feat of strength and endurance was celebrated by the retiring royal.\n\nAs a former Royal Navy officer Philip's last official event, after almost 70 years championing his own causes and charities, fittingly featured men from the Royal Marines - an integral part of the Navy.\n\nThe Duke was praised for his role as Captain General of the Royal Marines by a senior officer who described the 96-year-old as a \"wonderful figurehead for all Royal Marines to look up to\".\n\nThe event marked the end of the 1664 Global Challenge, a series of exploits that have pushed marines from the Corps to their physical limits in aid of the Royal Marines Charity.\n\nThe challenge, which recognises 1664, the year the Corps was founded, has seen Royal Marines all over the world fundraising, including Corporal Will Gingell, 33, and Corporal Jamie Thompson, 31, who have run 1,664 miles over 100 days.\n\nCpl Thompson, from Carlisle but based in Plymouth, whose epic marathon ended earlier, said: \"This is historic because this is the Duke's last royal engagement and we're a part of it, the Royal Marines are a part of it - so it's an absolute honour.\"\n\nThe Queen's Consort announced in May he would be retiring from royal engagements, a decision which was fully supported by the Queen and was not medically related.\n\nBuckingham Palace has stressed although the Duke's diary of engagements has come to an end he may decide to attend certain events, alongside the Queen, from time to time.\n\nThe Queen's public schedule continues as normal but other members of the Royal Family will step up in support of the monarch in her role as head of state.\n\nPrince Philip: A royal life in pictures from dashing young man in uniform to grandfather of the nation View gallery\n\nPrince Philip: A royal life in pictures from dashing young man in uniform to grandfather of the nation\n\nView gallery", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-03", "title": "Prince Philip makes one last joke as he retires from public duties", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-03", "id": "15084357", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3330847", "time": "10:56:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303766"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_(armed_forces)", "label": {"eng": "Officer (armed forces)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304952"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}, "type": "org", "id": "304957"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}, "type": "person", "id": "305814"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh", "label": {"eng": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh"}, "type": "person", "id": "306901"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporal", "label": {"eng": "Corporal"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "315060"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy", "label": {"eng": "Royal Navy"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "321994"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna_(entertainer)", "label": {"eng": "Madonna (entertainer)"}, "type": "person", "id": "328050"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Another_Day", "label": {"eng": "Die Another Day"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "350884"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Marines", "label": {"eng": "Royal Marines"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "438155"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowler_hat", "label": {"eng": "Bowler hat"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "564343"}], "url": "http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-philip-makes-one-last-10921999", "timeCrawl": "10:56:00", "image": "http://i2.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article10917933.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Duke-of-Edinburghs-final-public-engagement.jpg", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-03T10:56:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.6823529601097107}

after the Duke of Edinburgh began his service to the British public.\n\nThe Duke attended the The Captain General's Parade at Buckingham Palace before retiring from royal duties.\n\nHe was praised for his role as Captain General of the Royal Marines by a senior officer who described the 96-year-old as a \"wonderful figurehead for all Royal Marines to look up to\".\n\nThe event marked the end of the 1664 Global Challenge, a series of exploits that have pushed marines from the Corps to their physical limits in aid of the Royal Marines Charity.\n\nThe challenge, which recognises 1664, the year the Corps was founded, has seen Royal Marines all over the world fundraising, including Corporal Will Gingell, 33, and Corporal Jamie Thompson, 31, who have run 1,664 miles over 100 days.\n\nCpl Thompson, from Carlisle but based in Plymouth, whose epic marathon ended earlier, said: \"This is historic because this is the Duke's last royal engagement and we're a part of it, the Royal Marines are a part of it - so it's an absolute honour.\"\n\nThe special occasion, which marks the finale of the Royal Marines 1664 Global Challenge, is Prince Philip's final event as the Queen's official consort.\n\nIn May this year, a Palace spokeswoman said the parade would \"bring His Royal Highness's individual programme to a conclusion, although he may choose to attend certain events, alongside the Queen, from time to time\".\n\nPrince Philip's first royal engagement after the Queen's coronation was a dinner in the Officers' Mess at Eastney Barracks on July 15 1953.\n\nPhilip, who was 32, wore smart Royal Marines mess dress.\n\nThe Times recorded how he \"motored from Odiham to Eastney Barracks\" and watched the massed bands of the Portsmouth Command beat retreat on the cricket field.\n\nThe Duke had been appointed Captain General of the corps and the newspaper said: \"For the occasion, officers and men of the corps had come from all Royal Marine units in the United Kingdom and ships of the Home Fleet.\"\n\nAs consort to the Queen, the Duke has supported his wife in her new duties as sovereign, accompanying her to ceremonies such as the State Opening of Parliament in various countries, state dinners, and tours abroad.\n\nHe is also the patron of 785 organisations, particularly focused on the environment, industry, sport an education.\n\nKnown for his no-nonsense approach and acerbic wit, Prince Philip is the longest-serving consort in British history and also the oldest serving partner of a reigning monarch.\n\nThe Duke has attended an incredible 22,219 solo engagements between 1952 and this afternoon.\n\nHe set about modernising Buckingham Palace after being told to keep out of the Queen's official duties, and reorganised the Balmoral and Sandringham estates, as well as becoming ranger of Windsor Great Park.\n\n\"I tried to find useful things to do,\" he said about starting a footman training programme at the Palace.\n\nIn 1956, he set up the Duke of Edinburgh's Award - inspired by his time at Gordonstoun and his mentor and headmaster Dr Kurt Hahn.\n\nIt has become one of the country's best-known youth self-improvement schemes, with a million across the globe gaining their bronze, silver and gold awards.\n\nThe Duke takes a great interest in scientific and technological research and development, as well as the conservation of nature.\n\nHe has been depicted as a tough but caring father, as well as an accomplished sportsman - playing polo regularly until 1971 when he took up four-in-hand carriage driving and represented Britain at several European and world championships.\n\nA qualified pilot, the Duke gained his RAF wings in 1953, helicopter wings in 1956 and private pilot's licence in 1959.\n\nHis love of the sea never waned, and he competed regularly at Cowes Regatta.\n\nThe Duke witnessed first-hand the troubles faced by the Windsors in the 1990s - from the scandal surrounding Sarah, Duchess of York - who was caught having her toes sucked by her financial adviser - to the fallout of Charles and Diana's War of the Waleses.\n\nThe Duke also helped the Queen through the deaths of both her mother and sister in the Golden Jubilee year of 2002.\n\nHe has enjoyed good health throughout much of his life - recovering from a blocked coronary artery in 2011 and a bladder infection in 2012 - the latter leading him to miss the majority of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations.\n\nHe continued to take part in fast-paced, dangerous carriage-driving events, competing at international level until the age of 85.\n\nWhen he turned 90 in June 2011 he insisted on no fuss, but the Queen bestowed on him a new title - Lord High Admiral, titular head of the Royal Navy.\n\nA symbol of continuity within the monarchy and public life, the Duke of Edinburgh is the person the Queen relies upon above all others.\n\nPhilip's first ever private secretary Michael Parker, a friend from the Navy, once revealed: \"He told me the first day he offered me my job that his job, first, second and last was never to let her down.\"\n\nHe has made 637 official oversea trips, given 5,496 speeches and authored 14 books.\n\nPrinces Charles, William and Harry are now expected to increase their workload, but Philip will still attend occasional official duties with the Queen.\n\nPrince Philip: A royal life in pictures from dashing young man in uniform to

(AFP Photo)\n\nLONDON: Prince Philip, the 96-year-old husband of Britain's Queen Elizabeth, bowed out of public life on Wednesday with his final solo appearance at an official event, ending a royal career marked by occasional gaffes that landed him in hot water.\n\nThe prince, also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, attended a parade of Royal Marines at Buckingham Palace and met servicemen that had taken part in a 1,664 mile race to raise money for the Royal Marine's Charity.\n\nThough known for often off-colour comments that seized the headlines, Philip has been by the queen's side throughout her 65 years on the throne and she has described him as \"my strength and stay\".\n\nHe announced his retirement in May this year, after completing more than 22,000 solo appearances, spanning seven decades. At an engagement on the day of the announcement, a guest had told Philip he was sorry to hear he was standing down.\n\n\"I can't stand up much,\" quipped the prince.\n\nBoth the queen and Prince Philip have cut their workload in recent years, passing on many responsibilities to son and heir Prince Charles, and grandsons, Princes William and Harry.\n\nPhilip spent two days in hospital in June for treatment for an infection. The queen, the world's longest-reigning living monarch who celebrated her 91st birthday in April, will continue to carry out a full programme of official engagements.\n\nPhilip married Elizabeth at Westminster Abbey in 1947, and the couple are due to celebrate their 70th wedding anniversary in November.\n\nOutspoken, irascible and intensely private, Philip developed a reputation for occasional brusque and sometimes politically incorrect comments at ceremonial events he attended.\n\nA stray remark about \"slitty eyes\" during a visit to China in the 1980s became symbolic of his gruff and often unguarded manner.\n\nDuring a visit to Oban in Scotland in 1995 he asked a driving instructor: \"How do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to pass the (driving) test ?\"\n\nWell into his 90s, he made headlines when he exasperatedly swore at a photographer at a 2015 event.\n\nNonetheless, the queen has described him as a crucial figure during her long reign.\n\n\"He has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years,\" Elizabeth said in a rare personal tribute to Philip made in a speech marking their 50th wedding anniversary in 1997.\n\nIn his last public engagement on Wednesday, Philip, sporting a bowler hat and mac, met serving troops, veterans and cadets in the pouring rain, before watching as a unit of marines marched past him in formation in a ceremonial procedure known as taking the salute.\n\nAfterwards, the soldiers let out three cheers for the prince, with one more coming from a watching crowd behind. As well as raising his hat for the troops, Philip also waved to the crowd as he left.\n\nPhilip has been captain general of the marines since 1953, and has a personal connection with the Royal Navy after serving with the force in the Second World War.", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-02", "title": "IN PICTURES: Britain's outspoken Prince Philip bows out of public life", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-02", "id": "14921498", "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-02", "textStart": 212, "amb": false, "textEnd": 226}], "storyUri": "eng-3330847", "time": "16:24:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "id": "47", "location": {"label": {"eng": "China"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "id": "76", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "id": "84296", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oban"}, "id": "85419", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Oban"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oban", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "id": "86522", "location": {"label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_correctness", "label": {"eng": "Political correctness"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302941"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303766"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}, "type": "org", "id": "304957"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}, "type": "person", "id": "305814"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London", "label": {"eng": "Central London"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "306345"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Abbey", "label": {"eng": "Westminster Abbey"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "306893"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh", "label": {"eng": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh"}, "type": "person", "id": "306901"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "308814"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat", "label": {"eng": "Hat"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "328222"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Royal_Family", "label": {"eng": "British Royal Family"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "329310"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salute", "label": {"eng": "Salute"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "329974"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles,_Prince_of_Wales", "label": {"eng": "Charles, Prince of Wales"}, "type": "person", "id": "354698"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_anniversary", "label": {"eng": "Wedding anniversary"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "382180"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Marines", "label": {"eng": "Royal Marines"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "438155"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_general", "label": {"eng": "Captain general"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "555682"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowler_hat", "label": {"eng": "Bowler hat"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "564343"}], "url": "http://www.gdnonline.com/Details/247941/IN-PICTURES-Britains-outspoken-Prince-Philip-bows-out-of-public-life", "timeCrawl": "16:24:00", "image": "http://www.gdnonline.com/gdnimages/20170802\\20170802_183159_0.jpg", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-02T16:24:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.6627451181411743}

himself.\n\nNow aged 96, Prince Philip, otherwise known as the Duke of Edinburgh, is the husband of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nHis father was Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, while his mother was Princess Alice of Battenberg.\n\nPhilip worn on June 10, 1921, in Corfu, Greece, but his family was exiled when he was just a child.\n\nRaised in the UK, he was also educated in France and Germany, later joining the Navy and serving in World War II.\n\nA keen sports fan, he has been involved in a number of events including developing the equestrian event of carriage driving.\n\nHe has also been the patron of hundreds of organisations, often attending events with the Queen as part of their royal duties.\n\nBut it hasn't all been smooth sailing - with Prince Philip known for being one of the most gaffe-prone members of the royal family.\n\nIn May 2017, it was announced that he would be retiring from public engagements, having attended 110 days of engagements in 2016.\n\nAnd on June 21, he was admitted to hospital as a \"precautionary measure\" for treatment of an infection arising from a pre-existing condition - he left \"in good spirits\" after being kept for two nights.\n\nThe Duke of Edinburgh will formally retire on August 2, bowing out with a parade of Royal Marines commandos at Buckingham Palace.\n\nAfter that he will take a back seat role and may occasionally appear alongside other royals at public events.\n\nPrince Philip joined the Royal Navy in 1939 when he was just 18.\n\nHe graduated from the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth before going on to serve in World War II.\n\nAppointed a midshipman at the start of 1940, Philip served on the battleship HMS Ramillies, later being posted on HMS Kent and HMS Shropshire.\n\nHe was later commissioned as a sub-lieutenant before going on to be promoted as a lieutenant in July 1942.\n\nJust months later, he became the first lieutenant of HMS Wallace - making him one of the youngest in that position in the Royal Navy at just 21 years old.\n\nHe ultimately reached the rank of commander in 1952.\n\nPhilip also holds a number of honorary ranks including Captain General of the Royal Marines.\n\nHe was appointed Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom in 2011.\n\nPhilip Mountbatten married Elizabeth II in 1947.\n\nThe pair had previously been writing to each other for years previously, having first met in 1934.\n\nThe couple became engaged after seeking permission from Elizabeth's father King George VI.\n\nAfter a five month engagement, the pair were married on November 20 1947.\n\nThey have four children - Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward - eight grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.\n\nPrince Philip has been a patron for more than 800 organisations,

He was met with cheering before he gave the public a warm wave.\n\nThe 96-year-old looked fully prepared for the drizzly weather in London in a trench coat worn over his suit and a bowling hat as he embarked on his last official appearance. He announced his retirement in May.\n\nPhilip looked spritely and in high spirits despite the torrential downpour outside Buckingham Palace, looking proud after completing 22,219 solo engagements since 1952.\n\nThe royal was happy to meet with servicemen and celebrate their participation in a 1,664-mile trek in aid of charity. The duke has attended a parade to mark the finale of the 1664 Global Challenge - a series of strength and endurance challenged raising funds and awareness - as Captain General of the Royal Marines.\n\nWhile Philip retires from public life, the Queen's schedule will continue as normal. Lady Myra Butler discussed the duke's retirement on Radio 4's Today programme, saying that he was \"very spirited, a young normal boy full of fun... we loved when he came to stay\" as a young man.\n\nOn what he is expected to do next, she added: \"I'm sure that he won't disappear, he will be greatly missed by everybody.\n\n\"He's been such a stable character in all our lives - he's always there and he's always been there for the Queen and I think we're very, very lucky to have him.\"\n\nThe senior royal has been one of the most hard-working members of the British royal family since he wed the then Princess Elizabeth on 20 November 1947.

It is over five years since Buckingham Palace announced that the duke -- who married the then-Princess Elizabeth in 1947 -- would gradually \"wind down\" his workload, though he remained keen to perform many of his duties.\n\nIn 2016 alone, he attended 200 events as he continued to represent the royal family with his own distinctive style.\n\nMarried to Queen Elizabeth II for 69 years, the Prince is known for his wit, humor and controversial off the cuff remarks.\n\nIn April 2016 he caused amusement by taking the wheel to drive US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama to lunch during their state visit to Britain. That came a month before he withdrew from attending commemorations of the Battle of Jutland in Orkney upon the advice of his doctor.\n\nPhilip's health has long been monitored not just by the palace but by the British media and public. Despite a recent hospitalization for an undisclosed infection, Prince Philip is in good health for a man in his late '90s.\n\nDuring an interview with the BBC on the occasion of his 90th birthday in 2011, Philip said it was time to take a step back from his responsibilities.\n\n\"I reckon I've done my bit, I want to enjoy myself now ... have less responsibility, less frantic rushing about, less preparation, less trying to think of something to say,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Philip continued to appear by the Queen's side. In 2012, he was with Elizabeth as she undertook a busy schedule of public engagements across the UK to mark her 60 years on the throne.\n\n'Constant strength and guide'\n\nIn a diamond jubilee address to parliament in March 2012, the Queen said the support of her own family had been \"beyond measure\" throughout her reign. And she paid special tribute to the contribution of her husband, who accompanied her on so many of her official visits.\n\n\"Prince Philip is, I believe, well-known for declining compliments of any kind. But throughout he has been a constant strength and guide,\" she said.\n\nPhillip jokingly referred to himself as \"the world's most experienced plaque unveiler\" -- but as a child born in Greece into the turmoil of inter-war Europe, a naval officer decorated for heroism during World War II, the Duke of Edinburgh has been anything but.\n\nWhen peace came, Philip remained in the navy, but rekindled an earlier friendship with Elizabeth that quickly blossomed into a public romance.\n\nPhilip and Princess Elizabeth were married in Westminster Abbey in November 1947, after Philip became a naturalized British subject, and shortly afterward he returned to naval duty, rising to the rank of lieutenant commander.\n\nNewly-appointed as Duke of Edinburgh, Philip had to abandon his naval career for royal duties after the queen's father, George VI became ill. The king died on February 6, 1952 while Philip and Elizabeth were on an official trip to Kenya. It was Philip who broke the news to his wife.\n\n'Fantastic life partner'\n\nThe early years of the couple's marriage saw the prince enjoy the height of his popularity. On their first major tour together -- to Canada and the US in 1951 -- huge crowds turned out to see the couple.\n\nThe duke himself spoke of his own struggles to find a purpose within the royal family, saying he took on patronages -- including the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme, which he created to recognize community service -- out of duty rather than passion.\n\n\"I didn't want to be president of the World Wildlife Fund,\" he said in an interview in 1992. \"I was asked to do it. I'd much rather have stayed in the navy, frankly.\"\n\nPhilip has had no constitutional roles other than being a privy counselor, but the queen in 1952 declared that he had \"place, preeminence and precedence\" next to herself \"on all occasions and in all meetings, except where otherwise provided by act of Parliament.\"\n\nHe has been by the Queen's side as she has traveled for state visits around the world and helped her welcome a host of dignitaries.\n\nTheir relationship was discussed in a recent ITV documentary about Prince Philip and the jubilee of his much-vaunted Duke of Edinburgh award.\n\nSophie Wessex, wife of the couple's youngest son, Prince Edward, revealed how the pair enjoy each other's company after 69 years of marriage.\n\n\"He has been a fantastic life partner for her. I think it's maybe a fairly lonely job being queen,\" she told ITV.\n\n\"As a female in the top job I think to have somebody you can lean on, you can discuss things with, she can be honest with behind closed doors ... I don't think she could have chosen better. And they make each other laugh, which is half the battle, isn't it?\"\n\nEven now Philip will continue to be a patron or member of hundreds of charitable organizations. And he will remain the Queen's support and best companion in the private sphere.\n\nTM & \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Every year, he and (his daughter) Princess Anne vie to which of them does more,\" one of his biographers, Gyles Brandreth, told BBC radio.\n\nWhile Prince Philip's life had not turned out as expected, Brandreth said the duke once told him: \"I tried to make the best of it... I had to try to support the queen as best I could, without getting in the way.\"\n\nA palace spokeswoman said his individual programme of public events had come to an end, but \"he may choose to attend engagements alongside the queen from time to time\".\n\nThe queen once described her husband of almost 70 years as \"my strength and stay\".\n\nAnnouncing his plans to retire in May, Philip joked that he was the \"world's most experienced plaque-unveiler\".\n\nThe prince's sense of humour has got him into trouble in the past, making headlines for politically incorrect jokes.\n\nBut he uses it to break the ice, and many view it as a welcome contrast to the queen's more formal reserve.\n\n\"How do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to get them through the test?\" he once asked a driving instructor in Scotland.\n\nGruff in public -- he hates media interviews -- he is also widely credited for keeping his family together during the turmoil of his children's divorces and the death of Diana, princess of Wales.\n\nPrince Philip is still in good health for a man of his age, although he was hospitalised for two nights in June for an undisclosed infection.\n\nHe and the queen have scaled back public duties in recent years, handing responsibilities to the younger royals, including heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, and his eldest son Prince William.\n\nWilliam, the 35-year-old Duke of Cambridge, ended his two-year career as an air ambulance pilot last week to turn his full attention to royal duties, alongside his wife Kate.\n\nBut while the queen supports her husband's decision to retire, experts say she considers her own vow at her 1953 coronation to serve for life as unbreakable.\n\n\"Her Majesty will continue to carry out a full programme of official engagements with the support of members of the royal family,\" the palace said earlier this year.", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-02", "title": "At 96, Prince

Norman Saints - agreed, saying Prince Philip had been a good leader.\n\n\"Well he's a sailor, isn't he?\"\n\nThe two men watched in the rain as the Duke took his hat off to their marine friends and successors.\n\nAs the inspection finished the Duke made his way back inside the palace, while the crowd quickly moved on, likely thinking of finding somewhere dry to have a hot tea.\n\n\"Typical,\" remarked one onlooker. \"It stops raining just as the parade finishes.\"\n\nWednesday's parade in Buckingham Palace's forecourt was Prince Philip's 22,219th solo engagement since 1953.\n\nThe Duke has been Honorary President of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines Associated and Club since 1948.\n\nThe parade was the finale of the 1664 Global Challenge, which has seen 1500 Royal Marines and army commandos take part in a 2678km running challenge over the past four months.\n\nThe announcement in May that the Duke was stepping down came after a day of speculation that the steadfast companion of the Queen for 70 years may have died.\n\nBut the Duke, who is also the longest-serving consort in British history and also the oldest serving partner of a reigning monarch, is reported to be in good health.\n\nBuckingham Palace said the 91-year-old Queen's schedule will continue, and her husband may join her at official events, but \"Team Windsor\" - Prince William, his wife Catherine and Prince Harry - are increasingly stepping up their royal duties.\n\nShare Tweet Whatsapp Email\n\nShare\n\nOn a rainy day, Philip s duty finally done - Yahoo7 Pinterest Tumblr", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-02", "title": "On a rainy day, Philip's duty finally done", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-02", "id": "14952896", "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-03", "textStart": 24, "amb": false, "textEnd": 38}], "storyUri": "eng-3330847", "time": "13:39:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "id": "12", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "Australia (continent)"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "id": "76", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303766"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}, "type": "org", "id": "304957"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}, "type": "person", "id": "305814"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "306307"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry_of_Wales", "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry of Wales"}, "type": "person", "id": "306417"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblr", "label": {"eng": "Tumblr"}, "type": "org", "id": "306534"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinterest", "label": {"eng": "Pinterest"}, "type": "org", "id": "306535"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh", "label": {"eng": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh"}, "type": "person", "id": "306901"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_VI", "label": {"eng": "George VI"}, "type": "person", "id": "317125"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy", "label": {"eng": "Royal Navy"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "321994"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat", "label": {"eng": "Hat"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "328222"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!7", "label": {"eng": "Yahoo7"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "349232"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Marines", "label": {"eng": "Royal Marines"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "438155"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_He's_a_Jolly_Good_Fellow", "label": {"eng": "For He's a Jolly Good Fellow"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "589561"}], "url": "https://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/36587787/on-a-rainy-day-philips-duty-finally-done/", "timeCrawl": "19:12:00", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/iu/api/res/1.2/D7S2CiAN7r2BCmVgc7S5pA--~B/YXBwaWQ9eXZpZGVvO3c9NjMwO2g9MzU0O2R4PTE7ZHk9MTtjdz0xMTk5O2NoPTY3NDtxPTcwO249MTt1bGNyb3A7cm90YXRlPWF1dG8-/https://s.yimg.com/iu/api/res/1.2/4Fm66X7N8HYalUTfkt0INw--~B/cm90YXRlPWF1dG87dz0xMjAwO2FwcGlkPXl2aWRlbw--/https://s.yimg.com/ea/img/-/170803/5981e38d9d802_royals_philip_scene_16_9_12429509_1755308_5981e2faca6a9325fb2a4432_sd_1280x720.jpg", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-02T13:39:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.6235294342041016}

almost constant presence throughout royal duties.\n\nBut with Prince Philip formally retiring from public engagements, we look at what you need to know about the Duke of Edinburgh himself.\n\nPrince Philip, otherwise known as the Duke of Edinburgh, is the husband of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nBorn on June 10, 1921, his father was Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, while his mother was Princess Alice of Battenberg.\n\nWhile he was born in Corfu, Greece, Philip's family was exiled when he was just a child.\n\nRaised in the UK, he was also educated in France and Germany, later joining the Navy and serving in World War II.\n\nAt 96 years old, he now has four children, including Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward.\n\nA keen sports fan, he has been involved in a number of events including developing the equestrian event of carriage driving.\n\nHe has also been the patron of hundreds of organisations, often attending events with the Queen as part of their royal duties.\n\nBut it hasn't all been smooth sailing - with Prince Philip known for being one of the most gaffe-prone members of the royal family.\n\nIn May 2017, it was announced that he would be retiring from public engagements, having attended 110 days of engagements in 2016.\n\nAnd on June 21, he was admitted to hospital as a \"precautionary measure\" for treatment of an infection arising from a pre-existing condition - he left \"in good spirits\" after being kept for two nights.\n\nThe Duke of Edinburgh will formally retire on August 2, bowing out with a parade of the commandos at Buckingham Palace.\n\nPrince Philip joined the Royal Navy in 1939 when he was just 18.\n\nHe graduated from the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth before going on to serve in World War II.\n\nAppointed a midshipman at the start of 1940, Philip served on the battleship HMS Ramillies, later being posted on HMS Kent and HMS Shropshire.\n\nHe was later commissioned as a sub-lieutenant before going on to be promoted as a lieutenant in July 1942.\n\nJust months later, he became the first lieutenant of HMS Wallace - making him one of the youngest in that position in the Royal Navy at just 21-years-old.\n\nHe ultimately reached the rank of commander in 1952.\n\nHe was appointed Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom in 2011.\n\nPhilip Mountbatten married Elizabeth II in 1947.\n\nThe pair had previously been writing to each other for years previously, having first met in 1934.\n\nThe couple became engaged after seeking permission from Elizabeth's father King George VI.\n\nAfter a five month engagement, the pair were married on November 20 1947.\n\nPrince Philip has been a patron for more than 800 organisations, serving as chairman of the Duke of Edinburgh's Awards.",

Since 1952 -- when Queen Elizabeth II's father passed away and she ascended the throne -- Prince Philip has carried out over 22,000 solo engagements, in addition to attending events alongside Queen Elizabeth.

He made the decision to reduce his duties five years ago, but wanted to keep many responsibilities.\n\nThe royal will remain by his wife's side for some public events, and he will continue to keep up select official duties, including correspondence.\n\nClick through the gallery to see images of Prince Philip through the years, from his childhood in the 1930s to today.\n\nWant more?\n\nFrom the Archives: Prince Philip Through the Years\n\nPrince George's Cutest Shoe Style Moments Through the Years\n\nPrince George & Princess Charlotte Steal the Show at Trooping the Color Parade", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-02", "title": "After 64 Years of Service, Prince Philip Has Retired From Public Engagements", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-02", "id": "14913041", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3330847", "time": "15:45:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}, "type": "person", "id": "305814"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis", "label": {"eng": "Arthritis"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305816"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh", "label": {"eng": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh"}, "type": "person", "id": "306901"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21-gun_salute", "label": {"eng": "21-gun salute"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "319343"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)", "label": {"eng": "Prince (musician)"}, "type": "person", "id": "326296"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo", "label": {"eng": "Polo"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "328830"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage", "label": {"eng": "Patronage"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "330020"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Marines", "label": {"eng": "Royal Marines"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "438155"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_general", "label": {"eng": "Captain general"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "555682"}], "url": "http://footwearnews.com/2017/influencers/power-players/prince-philip-retirement-queen-elizabeth-ii-401081/", "timeCrawl": "15:45:00", "image": "https://pmcfootwearnews.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/prince-philip-1.jpg", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-02T15:45:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.6117647290229797}

At an engagement on the day of the announcement, a guest had told Philip he was sorry to hear he was standing down.\n\n\"I can't stand up much,\" quipped the prince.\n\nBoth the queen and Prince Philip have cut their workload in recent years, passing on many responsibilities to son and heir Prince Charles, and grandsons, Princes William and Harry.\n\nPhilip spent two days in hospital in June for treatment for an infection. The queen, the world's longest-reigning living monarch who celebrated her 91st birthday in April, will continue to carry out a full programme of official engagements.\n\nPhilip married Elizabeth at Westminster Abbey in 1947, and the couple are due to celebrate their 70th wedding anniversary in November.\n\nOutspoken, irascible and intensely private, Philip, a Greek-born former naval officer, developed a reputation for occasional brusque and sometimes politically incorrect comments at ceremonial events he attended.\n\nA stray remark about \"slitty eyes\" during a visit to China in the 1980s became symbolic of his gruff and often unguarded manner.\n\nDuring a visit to Oban in Scotland in 1995 he asked a driving instructor: \"How do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to pass the (driving) test ?\"\n\nWell into his 90s, he made headlines when he exasperatedly swore at a photographer at a 2015 event.\n\nNonetheless, the queen has described him as a crucial figure during her long reign.\n\n\"He has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years,\" Elizabeth said in a rare personal tribute to Philip made in a speech marking their 50th wedding anniversary in 1997.\n\nFor his final solo appearance on Wednesday, Philip, also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, will attend a parade of Royal Marines at Buckingham Palace and meet servicemen who have taken part in a 1,664 mile race to raise money for the Royal Marine's Charity.\n\nBuckingham Palace has said that Philip may choose to accompany Elizabeth at certain events in the future.\n\n(Reporting by Alistair Smout and Emma Rumney;

Literally.\n\nOne of Prince Philip's many titles is Captain General of the Royal Marines. On Wednesday afternoon, at Buckingham Palace, the 96-year-old is due to attend a parade marking the finale of the Marines' 1664 Challenge, a series of strength and endurance challenges raising money for charity.\n\nThis is to be his 22,219th official solo engagement since 1952, the year his wife became Queen.\n\nIt is to be his last. As announced in May (after a brief media panic when rumours spread he had died overnight), he has decided he will no longer carry out public engagements.\n\nRelated Articles Prince Philip hospitalised due to infection Social media a big hit for Queen's 91st celebrations\n\nThe symbolism of his last appointment is likely no coincidence. Captain General is one of his oldest duties, passed to him in June 1953 from his father-in-law, King George VI. It is reportedly now going to Prince Harry.\n\nIt will be marked in a very British way. After the Duke meets veteran and cadet Marines, the parade ends with a march, a Royal Salute - and \"three cheers for the Captain General\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Palace stresses Prince Philip is not going to disappear altogether.

He is patron of 785 organisations.\n\nHe has made more public appearances this year than either the Queen or the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge: 51 since January. In 2016 he was the fifth busiest royal.\n\nThe Duke will soon head up to Balmoral with the Queen for their annual summer holiday.\n\nAfter that, he is expected to spend most of his time at Windsor. Locals and visitors may catch sight of him whizzing about Windsor Great Park on antique royal carriages - his hobby, which he took up after giving up polo age 50.\n\nOther hobbies include oil painting, reading and photography.\n\nHe's not the type of man to put his feet up, Dickie Arbiter, the Queen's press secretary until 2000, told The Sun.\n\n\"He'll still be involved in something even if just from his office, from phone calls and talking to his patronages, talking to his charities, maybe even visiting them on a private visit.\n\n\"He's not giving up life, he's just stepping back from full-time public engagement and taking it a bit easier.\"\n\nHistorian Christopher Lee told the BBC the prince was the first man in Buckingham Palace to put computers in his office.\n\n\"He will want to know about the big issues. He will know every single touch, nuance on Brexit, for example. He is briefed on everybody he is likely to meet, even people he will never meet and he takes it in.\n\n\"I think he's never stopped being an admiral. Admirals are like that, they have to be, and admirals never retire.\"\n\nThe Duke has had several health scares in recent years: he spent two nights in hospital in June with an infection, missing the State Opening of Parliament and the last two days of Royal Ascot.\n\nIn 2008 he spent three days in hospital with a serious chest infection, in late 2011 he suffered chest pains and had heart surgery.\n\nIn 2012 during the Queen's diamond jubilee celebrations he suffered a bladder infection that put him in hospital for almost a week. The problem recurred later in the year.\n\nThen in 2013 he was admitted to hospital for 11 days for exploratory surgery on his abdomen.\n\nRoyal watchers say one reason for his retirement was he feared growing frail in public, and told close friends \"I'm past my sell-by date\".\n\nBut he is generally in good health for his age.\n\nHe was born on June 10, 1921 in the Greek island of Corfu, the fifth child of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, and Princess Alice of Battenburg.\n\nHis childhood was unsettled, as Greece went through political upheaval. Age 18 he began a naval career, serving in World War II, and ended active service in 1951, just before the Queen's coronation.\n\nPrince Philip and the Queen, distant cousins, were first friends then fell in love. They married in November 1947.\n\nIn 2015 he became the last person to be awarded an Australian knighthood, in the controversial and short-lived resurrection of the imperial-style honour by then prime minister Tony Abbott.\n\nHe has many other orders and titles - including lord high admiral of the Royal Navy, an appointment given to him by the Queen as a 90th birthday present.\n\nOver the years he has also been well-known for his gaffes - politically incorrect jokes that risked offence.\n\nIn 1966 he commented that \"British women can't cook\"; in 1986 he warned British students in China they might become \"slitty-eyed\"; and in 2002 he asked an indigenous Australian if they \"still throw spears at each other\". In 2013 he told Malala Yousafzai that children \"go to school because their parents don't want them in the house\".\n\nHe once said of Princess Anne, \"if it doesn't fart or eat hay, she's not interested\".\n\nBut he is loved by the public for his unswerving support for the Queen.\n\nAt their golden wedding anniversary in 1997 she described him as \"someone who doesn't take easily to compliments, but he has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years, and I and his whole family, in this and many other countries, owe him a debt greater than he would ever claim or we shall ever know\".", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-02", "title": "Prince Philip waves goodbye to a career of service, dedication... and gaffes", "dateCrawl":

He has also served as captain general of the Royal Marines since 1953, when he took over from the queen's father, King George VI, who had died the year before.\n\nPhilip has carried out 637 overseas visits on his own in the past 65 years, given almost 5,500 speeches, and served as patron, president or member of more than 780 organizations.\n\nElizabeth has called Philip, her husband of almost 70 years and the longest-serving consort in British history, \"my strength and stay.\" Good for her, then, that Philip remains healthy for a man of his age despite his two-night hospitalization in June for the treatment of an undisclosed infection.\n\nThough the queen supports her husband's decision to retire, she has no plans to do the same as her nation navigates its Brexit from the European Union.\n\n\"Her Majesty will continue to carry out a full program of official engagements with the support of members of the royal family,\" the palace announced earlier this year.\n\nAnd Brits may not have seen the last of their aged prince. A spokesperson said that, though Philip's string of individual events has come to an end, \"he may choose to attend engagements alongside the queen from time to time.\"\n\nHi six and a half decades of diplomacy were not without controversy, however. His propensity for gaffes caused no end of headlines and official apologies from Buckingham Palace. In 1997, he called German Chancellor Helmut Kohl \"Reichskanzler\" - the title taken by Adolf Hitler. He once asked an Aboriginal Australian whether indigenous people \"still throw spears at each other\" and told a teenager with sky-high dreams that he was \"too fat to be an astronaut.\"\n\nIn 1995, he publicly wondered whether Scots could be kept \"off the booze long enough\" to pass a driving test. And once told a group of British exchange students in China they would be \"all-slitty-eyed,\" if they stayed in the country much longer.\n\nGenerally, Philip was forgiven for his faux pas. \"Humor is important,\" as the Telegraph put it. \"The Duke's has brightened these decades.\"", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-02", "title": "Britain's Prince Philip makes final solo public appearance | News | DW | 02.08.2017", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-02", "id": "14851406", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3330847", "time": "07:18:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "id": "76", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "label": {"eng": "Infection"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302506"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "type": "org", "id": "303064"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence", "label": {"eng": "Adolescence"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303631"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303766"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303819"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany", "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Germany"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303908"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_(armed_forces)", "label": {"eng": "Officer (armed forces)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304952"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305325"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}, "type": "person", "id": "305814"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh", "label": {"eng": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh"}, "type": "person", "id": "306901"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "307227"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples", "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "307737"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing", "label": {"eng": "Ageing"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "308219"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler", "label": {"eng": "Adolf Hitler"}, "type": "person", "id": "311203"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}, "type": "org", "id": "317114"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_VI", "label": {"eng": "George VI"}, "type": "person", "id": "317125"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage", "label": {"eng": "Patronage"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "330020"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_British_Isles", "label": {"eng": "History of the British Isles"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "345870"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmut_Kohl", "label": {"eng": "Helmut Kohl"}, "type": "person", "id": "365791"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Australians", "label": {"eng": "Aboriginal Australians"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "366156"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Marines", "label": {"eng": "Royal Marines"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "438155"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_general", "label": {"eng": "Captain general"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "555682"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1268836"}], "url": "http://www.dw.com/en/britains-prince-philip-makes-final-solo-public-appearance/a-39928724", "timeCrawl": "10:58:00", "image": "http://www.dw.com/image/39346247_304.jpg", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-02T07:18:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.5960784554481506}

HELLO! has put together his top ten most memorable quotes, which include gaffes going all the way back to 1966 when he joked that \"British women [can't] cook,\" and a visit to Canada in 1969, where he said: \"I declare this thing open, whatever it is.\"\n\nREAD: Prince Philip's final engagement before he retires revealed\n\nThe Duke has also been caught asking his wife, the Queen, to hurry up as she spoke to her hosts in Belize. Shouting from the deck of Britannia in 1994, he said: \"Yak, yak, yak; come on, get a move on.\" He also caused a stir when he refused to stroke a koala bear in Australia, saying: \"Oh no, I might catch some ghastly disease.\" Furthermore, Prince Philip supposedly joked to the Queen about her crown on her coronation day, asking her: \"Where did you get that hat?\"\n\nVIEW GALLERY\n\nPrince Philip carries out his final engagement on Wednesday\n\nThe Duke announced his plans to retire in May. Buckingham Palace released a statement at the time which read: \"His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh has decided that he will no longer carry out public engagements from the autumn of this year. In taking this decision, The Duke has the full support of the Queen. Prince Philip will attend previously scheduled engagements between now and August, both individually and accompanying The Queen.

At an engagement on the day of the announcement, a guest had told Philip he was sorry to hear he was standing down.\n\n\"I can't stand up much,\" quipped the prince.\n\nBoth the queen and Prince Philip have cut their workload in recent years, passing on many responsibilities to son and heir Prince Charles, and grandsons, Princes William and Harry.\n\nPhilip spent two days in hospital in June for treatment for an infection. The queen, the world's longest-reigning living monarch who celebrated her 91st birthday in April, will continue to carry out a full program of official engagements.\n\nPhilip married Elizabeth at Westminster Abbey in 1947, and the couple are due to celebrate their 70th wedding anniversary in November.\n\nOutspoken, irascible and intensely private, Philip developed a reputation for occasional brusque and sometimes politically incorrect comments at ceremonial events he attended.\n\nA stray remark about \"slitty eyes\" during a visit to China in the 1980s became symbolic of his gruff and often unguarded manner.\n\nDuring a visit to Oban in Scotland in 1995 he asked a driving instructor: \"How do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to pass the (driving) test?\"\n\nWell into his 90s, he made headlines when he exasperatedly swore at a photographer at a 2015 event.\n\nNonetheless, the queen has described him as a crucial figure during her long reign.\n\n\"He has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years,\" Elizabeth said in a rare personal tribute to Philip made in a speech marking their 50th wedding anniversary in 1997.\n\nIn his last public engagement on Wednesday, Philip, sporting a bowler hat and mac, met serving troops, veterans and cadets in the pouring rain, before watching as a unit of marines marched past him in formation in a ceremonial procedure known as taking the salute.\n\nAfterwards, the soldiers let out three cheers for the prince, with one more coming from a watching crowd behind. As well as raising his hat for the troops, Philip also waved to the crowd as he left.\n\nPhilip has been captain general of the marines since 1953, and has a personal connection with the Royal Navy after serving with the force in the Second World War.", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-02", "title": "Britain's outspoken Prince Philip bows out of public life", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-02", "id": "14920082", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3330847", "time": "16:17:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "id": "47", "location": {"label": {"eng": "China"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "id": "76", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "id": "84296", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oban"}, "id": "85419", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Oban"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oban", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "label": {"eng": "Infection"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302506"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_correctness", "label": {"eng": "Political correctness"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302941"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(band)", "label": {"eng": "Queen (band)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303150"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303766"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}, "type": "org", "id": "304957"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}, "type": "person", "id": "305814"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Abbey", "label": {"eng": "Westminster Abbey"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "306893"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh", "label": {"eng": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh"}, "type": "person", "id": "306901"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "308814"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throne", "label": {"eng": "Throne"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "322083"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat", "label": {"eng": "Hat"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "328222"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Royal_Family", "label": {"eng": "British Royal Family"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "329310"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salute", "label": {"eng": "Salute"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "329974"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles,_Prince_of_Wales", "label": {"eng": "Charles, Prince of Wales"}, "type": "person", "id": "354698"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_anniversary", "label": {"eng": "Wedding anniversary"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "382180"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Marines", "label": {"eng": "Royal Marines"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "438155"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowler_hat", "label": {"eng": "Bowler hat"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "564343"}], "url": "http://nation.com.pk/international/02-Aug-2017/britain-s-outspoken-prince-philip-bows-out-of-public-life", "timeCrawl": "16:17:00", "image": "http://nation.com.pk/digital_images/large/2017-08-02/britain-s-outspoken-prince-philip-bows-out-of-public-life-1501689630-6475.jpg", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-02T16:17:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.5921568870544434}

Here's a brief look at the monarch's most loyal subject as he begins retirement.\n\nFLEEING THE COUP IN GREECE\n\nPrince Philip of Greece and Denmark was born on Corfu on June 10, 1921, to Princess Alice of Battenburg and Prince Andrew of Greece. When his uncle, King Constantine, was forced to abdicate in 1922, 18-month old Philip was evacuated on a Royal Navy ship - carried to safety in a cot made from an orange box. The family first settled in France, but his mother began to suffer mental health issues. At age 8, he traveled to England to live with his grandmother and uncle.\n\nFILE - In this Oct. 17, 1957 file photo President Dwight Eisenhower and first lady Mamie are flanked by their royal guests, Britain's Queen Elizabeth and her husband, Prince Philip, at the White House.

(AP Photo, File)\n\n___\n\nROYAL NAVY CAREER\n\nPhilip began his naval career at the Britannia Royal Naval College in 1939, and had a promising career. He joined the battleship HMS Ramillies in 1940. He later served on the HMS Valiant and is mentioned in dispatches for actions in the Battle of Matapan after spotting an unexpected enemy vessel. He rose through the ranks to be a commander.\n\n___\n\nSPOTTED BY COUSIN ELIZABETH\n\nPhilip first caught the attention of his 13-year-old cousin Elizabeth when she visited the naval college with her family. In 1943, Philip stayed with royal family a number of times during home leave. After one visit at Christmas, Princess Elizabeth placed photo of him on her dressing table.\n\nTwo years after the war ended, they married in 1947 at Westminster Abbey. Philip's naval career came to an abrupt end with the death of his father-in-law, King George VI, in 1952, and he settled into a life supporting his wife as queen.\n\nThey have four children: Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward.\n\n___\n\nINTERESTS FAR AND WIDE\n\nThe Duke of Edinburgh has long championed environmental and conservation issues, and has interests in science, engineering and industry. He was an accomplished sportsman and has been a patron, president or a member of more than 780 organizations.\n\nAn accomplished sportsman, Philip played polo regularly until 1971. He earned his RAF wings in 1953, his helicopter wings in 1956 and his private pilot's license in 1959.\n\n___\n\nTHERE HE GOES AGAIN\n\nPrince Philip is known for the colorful comments that have accompanied his many royal engagements. He has been described as a \"national treasure\" for his inability to resist off-the-cuff remarks and as referred to himself as the \"world's most experienced plaque-unveiler.\" On one visit to Canada, he said \"I declare this thing open, whatever it is.\"\n\nFILE - In this Wednesday, May 25, 2011 file photo President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama welcome Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip for a reciprocal dinner at Winfield House in London.

His replacement is up to the Queen, though media have speculated it's to be Prince Harry.\n\nPhilip is now retired - he will no longer carry out solo public engagements, though he will still accompany the Queen on occasion, and may choose to attend \"certain public events from time to time\", the palace said.\n\nHe will also keep up some official duties, including correspondence.\n\nBob Bruce, who served in the Royal Marines for 26 years, was at Buckingham Palace to see Prince Philip's last official public duty. Photo: Nick Miller\n\nIn the crowd outside the palace was Bob Bruce, who served in the Royal Marines for 26 years. He was there with his son, simply to mark the occasion.\n\n\"He's done a long stint,\" Bruce said of Philip. \"He'd turn out to all the important events of the Royal Marines and quite a lot of unimportant events and informal events as well - he's always been a great supporter.\"\n\nBruce said he had met the Duke, briefly, a couple of times.\n\n\"He's fantastic, he's well known as being able to chat with anybody at any level. He's always got a clever comment to make, or a quick humorous quip.\n\n\"He spoke at the 350th anniversary dinner of the Royal Marines [in 2014] when he wasn't expected to speak. He stood up at a moment's notice and had the whole hall in stitches of laughter with his funny stories.\n\n\"I think we're very proud to see him today. He's given great service to the Corps, but he's also given fantastic service to the country.\"\n\nBrigadier Richard Spencer, deputy commandant general of the Royal Marines, said the Marines had been \"hugely privileged\" to have the Duke of Edinburgh as their Captain General.\n\nHe had been much more than a figurehead, the brigadier said, he had been instrumental in drawing together the Corps family, and had provided advice and counsel to 25 commandants-general, the professional heads of the Marines.\n\n\"As always with people of such experience, they have the ability to see through the peaks and troughs of life,\" he said.\n\nAnd Philip had clearly enjoyed the military side to his job - a former naval officer who served in the Second World War, he had also been Admiral of the Fleet and Colonel of the Grenadier Guards.\n\n\"That was particularly evident when you saw him with our cadets and veterans,\" the brigadier said.\n\n\"You saw the sparkle in his eyes and the spring in his step as he spoke to them.\"", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-03", "title": "Prince Philip doffs his bowler hat in rain-drenched Buckingham Palace farewell", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-03", "id": "14997656", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3330847", "time": "00:09:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "id": "86522", "location": {"label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303766"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer", "label": {"eng": "General officer"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304309"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}, "type": "org", "id": "304957"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}, "type": "person", "id": "305814"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry_of_Wales", "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry of Wales"}, "type": "person", "id": "306417"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh", "label": {"eng": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh"}, "type": "person", "id": "306901"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigadier", "label": {"eng": "Brigadier"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "314736"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commandant", "label": {"eng": "Commandant"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "316808"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_VI", "label": {"eng": "George VI"}, "type": "person", "id": "317125"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat", "label": {"eng": "Hat"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "328222"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Save_the_Queen", "label": {"eng": "God Save the Queen"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "434071"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Marines", "label": {"eng": "Royal Marines"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "438155"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitter_(beer)", "label": {"eng": "Bitter (beer)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "458544"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_general", "label": {"eng": "Captain general"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "555682"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boddingtons_Brewery", "label": {"eng": "Boddingtons Brewery"}, "type": "org", "id": "561149"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowler_hat", "label": {"eng": "Bowler hat"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "564343"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_duties", "label": {"eng": "Public duties"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "584570"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Bruce", "label": {"eng": "Bob Bruce"}, "type": "person", "id": "594351"}], "url": "http://www.theherald.com.au/story/4830146/prince-philip-doffs-his-bowler-hat-in-rain-drenched-buckingham-palace-farewell/", "timeCrawl": "00:09:00", "image": "http://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/GJZ5TVpAk84wrTzsQfLQRB/34ae48a6-a8af-47bc-94bf-77c190302873.jpg/r1_0_619_349_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-03T00:09:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.5882353186607361}

His propensity for gaffes caused no end of headlines and official apologies from Buckingham Palace. In 1997, he called German Chancellor Helmut Kohl \"Reichskanzler\" - the title taken by Adolf Hitler. He once asked an Aboriginal Australian whether indigenous people \"still throw spears at each other\" and told a teenager with sky-high dreams that he was \"too fat to be an astronaut.\"\n\nIn 1995, he publicly wondered whether Scots could be kept \"off the booze long enough\" to pass a driving test. And once told a group of British exchange students in China they would be \"all-slitty-eyed,\" if they stayed in the country much longer.\n\nGenerally, Philip was forgiven for his faux pas. \"Humor is important,\" as the Telegraph put it. \"The Duke's has brightened these decades.\" And, indeed, Brits have taken to social media to offer a few jokes of their own.", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-02", "title": "Britain's Prince Philip makes final public appearance | News | DW | 02.08.2017", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-02", "id": "14810515", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3330847", "time": "07:24:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "id": "47", "location": {"label": {"eng": "China"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "id": "76", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "label": {"eng": "Infection"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302506"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "type": "org", "id": "303064"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence", "label": {"eng": "Adolescence"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303631"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303766"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303819"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany", "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Germany"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303908"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_(armed_forces)", "label": {"eng": "Officer (armed forces)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304952"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305325"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}, "type": "person", "id": "305814"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh", "label": {"eng": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh"}, "type": "person", "id": "306901"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "307227"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples", "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "307737"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing", "label": {"eng": "Ageing"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "308219"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler", "label": {"eng": "Adolf Hitler"}, "type": "person", "id": "311203"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}, "type": "org", "id": "317114"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_VI", "label": {"eng": "George VI"}, "type": "person", "id": "317125"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage", "label": {"eng": "Patronage"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "330020"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_British_Isles", "label": {"eng": "History of the British Isles"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "345870"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmut_Kohl", "label": {"eng": "Helmut Kohl"}, "type": "person", "id": "365791"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Australians", "label": {"eng": "Aboriginal Australians"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "366156"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Marines", "label": {"eng": "Royal Marines"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "438155"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_general", "label": {"eng": "Captain general"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "555682"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_withdrawal_from_the_European_Union", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1268836"}], "url": "http://www.dw.com/en/britains-prince-philip-makes-final-public-appearance/a-39928724", "timeCrawl": "07:24:00", "image": "http://www.dw.com/image/39346247_304.jpg", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-02T07:24:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.5843137502670288}

He was happy to be there and interested in what we've done.\"\n\nHe added that the Prince had commented on the weather as they stood talking beneath the pouring rain.\n\n\"He asked if we had rain running down our backs at the end. We said to him we've run in worse weather. You get into the zone where nothing hurts any more and you keep going.\"\n\nKeeping going is something the Duke of Edinburgh - who, as a Royal Navy midshipman, was mentioned in dispatches for his part in the Battle of Cape Matapan in 1941 - knows all about.\n\nSince the Queen's accession to the throne in 1952 he has given 5,496 speeches, carried out 637 solo overseas visits and sat as patron of 785 organisations.\n\nBut in May the palace announced his retirement from royal duties - though he will still continue to be at the Queen's side at various events - after he joked with friends that he was nearing his \"sell by date\".\n\nCorporal Jamie Thompson, 31, from Carlisle, who also ran the entire 1,664 miles of the challenge, said: \"It's special that it's the last thing he's doing and to be part of that is a real honour.\"\n\nCpl Gingell added: \"Because he's Captain General of the Royal Marines it's quite fitting he's doing this for his last event. It's a lot of years and a lot of service he's given to the Royal Marines and we're all very grateful for that.\"\n\nEvery man and woman present was aware of the parade's significance, and a lusty cry rang out across the forecourt when Regimental Sergeant Major Phil Gilby barked the call for \"three cheers for the Captain General\".\n\nIn return Prince Philip lifted his bowler hat and gave a little wave, in recognition of the men under his command.\n\nThen - as the Plymouth Band of the Royal Marines played \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\" - he turned on his heels, waved to the crowds outside the gates and strode across the forecourt to return inside Buckingham Palace for the last time in his official capacity, his duty to Queen and country done.", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-02", "title": "Prince Philip brushes off the rain to undertake his last official engagement", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-02", "id": "14934338", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3330847", "time": "17:25:00", "details": {"liCnt": 20}, "concepts": [{"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "id": "76", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303464"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303766"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant", "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305060"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}, "type": "person", "id": "305814"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry_of_Wales", "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry of Wales"}, "type": "person", "id": "306417"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh", "label": {"eng": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh"}, "type": "person", "id": "306901"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regiment", "label": {"eng": "Regiment"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "311565"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporal", "label": {"eng": "Corporal"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "315060"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_VI", "label": {"eng": "George VI"}, "type": "person", "id": "317125"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel", "label": {"eng": "Colonel"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "320424"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy", "label": {"eng": "Royal Navy"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "321994"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regimental_Sergeant_Major", "label": {"eng": "Regimental Sergeant Major"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "368451"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Marines", "label": {"eng": "Royal Marines"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "438155"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colours,_standards_and_guidons", "label": {"eng": "Colours, standards and guidons"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "442224"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midshipman", "label": {"eng": "Midshipman"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "451270"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentioned_in_dispatches", "label": {"eng": "Mentioned in dispatches"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "496621"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation_of_Queen_Elizabeth_II", "label": {"eng": "Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "527279"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_general", "label": {"eng": "Captain general"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "555682"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cape_Matapan", "label": {"eng": "Battle of Cape Matapan"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "971933"}], "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/08/02/prince-philip-brushes-rain-undertake-last-official-engagement/", "timeCrawl": "17:25:00", "image": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/08/02/TELEMMGLPICT000136377347_1-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqWxGSA6EqCkNPLXCjaqkxzZ79D9BS8bbJ_FbhHItqIBQ.jpeg", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-02T17:25:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.5803921818733215}

He and the queen plan to celebrate their 70th wedding anniversary in November. Since she ascended the throne in 1952, according to Buckingham Palace, he has had 22,219 solo engagements, given 5,496 speeches, and wrote 14 books -- among them \"Competition Carriage Driving.\"\n\nA native of Greece, Prince Philip courted the then-Princess Elizabeth during his time in the Royal Navy, a part of history that has captivated a new generation of Britons via the Netflix series \"The Crown.\" Their seven-decade marriage has seen Britain through postwar austerity, the creation of a welfare state, the loss of empire, entry into what became the European Union and, now, plans to exit it.\n\nPrince Philip, also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, has been lauded for his perseverance and unwavering sense of duty, while weathering criticism for being gaffe-prone and blunt. His many defenders say he is merely a product of his generation.\n\nBefitting a rugged former naval officer with a passion for the outdoors, he paid tribute on the grounds of Buckingham Palace to a group of Royal Marines who had just finished an athletic challenge including a 1,664-mile trek for charity.\n\nWearing a bowler hat and tanned jacket and appearing sprightly, he stood erect on an elevated stand, clasping his hands behind his back as the rain poured down, and marines marched by. A band played \"God Save the Queen,\" a nod to his hardworking wife, age 91, the longest-reigning monarch in British history. She has no plans to retire.\n\nPerhaps befitting a prince known for his periodic blunders, his departure from public life did not pass without any mishaps. On Wednesday, The Daily Telegraph, a conservative-leaning newspaper known for its royal coverage, accidentally published an article on its website stating that Prince Philip had died, commemorating his life and detailing his funeral. (It has since been taken down.)\n\nPrince Philip's retirement was announced in May, following news reports that all members of the queen's staff had been ordered to a very unusual meeting in London. The report prompted breathless rumors that a royal personage may have died, and members of the global news media scrambled to Buckingham Palace in the predawn hours.\n\nIn the end, after hours of waiting and anticipation, the palace announced the then-95-year-old prince was retiring, even as Buckingham Palace noted that he might still occasionally attend public events at the queen's side. At the time, Prime Minister Theresa May offered him \"our deepest gratitude and good wishes.\"\n\nPart diplomat, part royal consort, Prince Philip has served as a patron, a president or a member of more than 780 organizations. The nephew of King Constantine I of Greece, he was born in 1921 in somewhat unroyal surroundings: a villa's dining room table on Corfu, a Greek island.\n\nPrince Philip's departure from public life will deprive the British media of the king of the offensive one-liners, and, on Wednesday compilations of some of the greatest howlers once again circulated.\n\nOffered a gift by a Kenyan woman in 1984, he asked: \"You are a woman, aren't you?\"\n\nAsked his opinion of Beijing, while on a tour of China in 1986, his reply was succinct: \"Ghastly.\"\n\n\"How do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to pass the test?\" he said to a driving instructor in Oban, Scotland, in 1995.\n\nAddressing a group of deaf children standing next to a Caribbean steel drum band in Cardiff, Wales, in 1999, he said, \"If you're near there, no wonder you are deaf.\"\n\nHis very conspicuous lack of political correctness aside, on Wednesday he was mostly heaped with praise.\n\nThe BBC cited Lady Myra Butter, who, it noted, had known the prince since he was 8 or 9. \"I'm sure that he won't disappear; he will be greatly missed by everybody,\" she said. \"He's been such a stable character in all our lives -- he's always there and he's always been there for the queen and I think we're very, very lucky to have him.\"", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-02", "title":

Remarkable, but then he is a far more interesting and unusual personality than is often appreciated. His mother was born deaf, was mentally fragile, but dedicated to the cause of refugees: she eventually became a nun.\n\nOne aunt, Zia, was a lesbian (her lover was Gloria Vanderbilt) who hung out in gay bars in Cannes. Another aunt, Ella, now regarded as an Orthodox saint, ran a refuge for orphans and consumptives, refused to leave revolutionary Russia and was murdered by the Bolsheviks.\n\nPhilip had two sisters married to German aristocrats who became members of the Nazi party -- his brother-in-law, Prince Christoph of Hesse, wore an SS uniform -- but teenage Philip constantly burst out laughing whenever he witnessed the Hitler salute and had to be whisked out of Germany, pronto. His later, famed \"gaffes\" had an earlier rehearsal in brave adolescent mockery of the pomposity of fascism.\n\nHis first language was French, having grown up in the suburbs of Paris, spending time in Marseilles -- he probably knows some gangland argot -- and Le Touquet. He is a brilliant linguist but he is also a gifted mathematician, having won school prizes for maths. As a growing boy he literally never knew where home was, as Philip Eade's wonderful portrait of Prince Philip as a young man describes. When asked for his address, he would write \"no fixed abode\".\n\nWhen he came to school in England, it was noted that his belongings, such as they were, were \"threadbare\": sometimes he had no baggage save a razor. But his attitude was practical. \"Get on with it\" was his mantra.\n\nThe Dashing Duke of Edinburgh: Prince Philip - In pictures 15 show all The Dashing Duke of Edinburgh: Prince Philip - In pictures 1/15\n\nThe Duke Of Edinburgh leaving The Festival Club, Edinburgh in 1952\n\nDaily Mail\n\n2/15\n\nQueen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh wave at the crowds from the balcony at Buckingham Palace in 1953\n\nKeystone/Getty Images\n\n3/15\n\nPrincess Elizabeth (Now Queen Elizabeth II), the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles (Now Prince of Wales - Early Life) and Princess Anne (Now Princess Royal - Early Life).

The Queen Mother would have preferred some safe British aristocrat rather than this foreign prince born into straitened circumstances, sixth in line to the doomed Greek throne. But Philip always was for Elizabeth, and none other would ever do.\n\nHis background was kept fairly cloaked in post-war 1946 Britain, and the German relations did not attend the nuptials. Philip was discreetly received into the Church of England -- his childhood faith was Greek Orthodox and it is said that he retains a spiritual affection for it.\n\nPrince Philip: 10 memorable quotes\n\nOver a long life he has done public service heroically.

At an engagement on the day of the announcement, a guest had told Philip he was sorry to hear he was standing down.\n\n\"I can't stand up much,\" quipped the prince.\n\nBoth the queen and Prince Philip have cut their workload in recent years, passing on many responsibilities to son and heir Prince Charles, and grandsons, Princes William and Harry.\n\nPhilip spent two days in hospital in June for treatment for an infection. The queen, the world's longest-reigning living monarch who celebrated her 91st birthday in April, will continue to carry out a full programme of official engagements.\n\nPhilip married Elizabeth at Westminster Abbey in 1947, and the couple are due to celebrate their 70th wedding anniversary in November.\n\nOutspoken, irascible and intensely private, Philip developed a reputation for occasional brusque and sometimes politically incorrect comments at ceremonial events he attended.\n\nA stray remark about \"slitty eyes\" during a visit to China in the 1980s became symbolic of his gruff and often unguarded manner.\n\nDuring a visit to Oban in Scotland in 1995 he asked a driving instructor: \"How do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to pass the (driving) test ?\"\n\nWell into his 90s, he made headlines when he exasperatedly swore at a photographer at a 2015 event.\n\nNonetheless, the queen has described him as a crucial figure during her long reign.\n\n\"He has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years,\" Elizabeth said in a rare personal tribute to Philip made in a speech marking their 50th wedding anniversary in 1997.\n\nIn his last public engagement on Wednesday, Philip, sporting a bowler hat and mac, met serving troops, veterans and cadets in the pouring rain, before watching as a unit of marines marched past him in formation in a ceremonial procedure known as taking the salute.\n\nAfterwards, the soldiers let out three cheers for the prince, with one more coming from a watching crowd behind. As well as raising his hat for the troops, Philip also waved to the crowd as he left.\n\nPhilip has been captain general of the marines since 1953, and has a personal connection with the Royal Navy after serving with the force in the Second World War.\n\n(Reporting by Emma Rumney and Alistair Smout; Editing by Kate Holton and Maayan Lubell/Richard Balmforth)\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-02", "title": "Britain's outspoken Prince Philip bows out of public life - Times of India", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-02", "id": "14915447", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 51, "amb": false, "textEnd": 56, "date": "2017-08-02"}], "storyUri": "eng-3330847", "time": "15:57:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "id": "47", "location": {"label": {"eng": "China"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "id": "76", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "id": "84296", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oban"}, "id": "85419", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Oban"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oban", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "id": "86522", "location": {"label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "label": {"eng": "Infection"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302506"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}, "type": "org", "id": "302588"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_correctness", "label": {"eng": "Political correctness"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302941"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(band)", "label": {"eng": "Queen (band)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303150"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303766"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}, "type": "org", "id": "304957"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}, "type": "person", "id": "305814"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Abbey", "label": {"eng": "Westminster Abbey"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "306893"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh", "label": {"eng": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh"}, "type": "person", "id": "306901"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "308814"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throne", "label": {"eng": "Throne"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "322083"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat", "label": {"eng": "Hat"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "328222"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Royal_Family", "label": {"eng": "British Royal Family"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "329310"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salute", "label": {"eng": "Salute"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "329974"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles,_Prince_of_Wales", "label": {"eng": "Charles, Prince of Wales"}, "type": "person", "id": "354698"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_anniversary", "label": {"eng": "Wedding anniversary"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "382180"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Marines", "label": {"eng": "Royal Marines"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "438155"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_general", "label": {"eng": "Captain general"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "555682"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowler_hat", "label": {"eng": "Bowler hat"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "564343"}], "url": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/britains-outspoken-prince-philip-bows-out-of-public-life/articleshow/59885221.cms", "timeCrawl": "15:57:00", "image": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-02T15:57:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.5607843399047852}

As announced in May (after a brief media panic when rumours spread he had died overnight), he has decided he will no longer carry out public engagements.\n\nRelated Articles Prince Philip hospitalised due to infection Social media a big hit for Queen's 91st celebrations\n\nThe symbolism of his last appointment is likely no coincidence. Captain General is one of his oldest duties, passed to him in June 1953 from his father-in-law, King George VI. It is reportedly now going to Prince Harry.\n\nIt will be marked in a very British way. After the Duke meets veteran and cadet Marines, the parade ends with a march, a Royal Salute - and \"three cheers for the Captain General\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Palace stresses Prince Philip is not going to disappear altogether. He will still accompany the Queen on occasion, and may choose to attend \"certain public events from time to time\". He will also keep up some official duties including correspondence.\n\nYou will now receive updates from Breaking News Alert Breaking News Alert\n\nGet the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy .\n\nBut, essentially, this marks the retirement of Britain's longest-serving consort.\n\nThe royal household has calculated he took part in 637 solo overseas visits, gave 5496 speeches and wrote 14 books. He is patron of 785 organisations.\n\nHe has made more public appearances this year than either the Queen or the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge: 51 since January. In 2016 he was the fifth busiest royal.\n\nThe Duke will soon head up to Balmoral with the Queen for their annual summer holiday.\n\nAfter that, he is expected to spend most of his time at Windsor. Locals and visitors may catch sight of him whizzing about Windsor Great Park on antique royal carriages - his hobby, which he took up after giving up polo age 50.\n\nOther hobbies include oil painting, reading and photography.\n\nHe's not the type of man to put his feet up, Dickie Arbiter, the Queen's press secretary until 2000, told The Sun.\n\n\"He'll still be involved in something even if just from his office, from phone calls and talking to his patronages, talking to his charities, maybe even visiting them on a private visit.\n\n\"He's not giving up life, he's just stepping back from full-time public engagement and taking it a bit easier.\"\n\nHistorian Christopher Lee told the BBC the prince was the first man in Buckingham Palace to put computers in his office.\n\n\"He will want to know about the big issues. He will know every single touch, nuance on Brexit, for example. He is briefed on everybody he is likely to meet, even people he will never meet and he takes it in.\n\n\"I think he's never stopped being an admiral. Admirals are like that, they have to be, and admirals never retire.\"\n\nThe Duke has had several health scares in recent years: he spent two nights in hospital in June with an infection, missing the State Opening of Parliament and the last two days of Royal Ascot.\n\nIn 2008 he spent three days in hospital with a serious chest infection, in late 2011 he suffered chest pains and had heart surgery.\n\nIn 2012 during the Queen's diamond jubilee celebrations he suffered a bladder infection that put him in hospital for almost a week. The problem recurred later in the year.\n\nThen in 2013 he was admitted to hospital for 11 days for exploratory surgery on his abdomen.\n\nRoyal watchers say one reason for his retirement was he feared growing frail in public, and told close friends \"I'm past my sell-by date\".\n\nBut he is generally in good health for his age.\n\nHe was born on June 10, 1921 in the Greek island of Corfu, the fifth child of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, and Princess Alice of Battenburg.\n\nHis childhood was unsettled, as Greece went through political upheaval. Age 18 he began a naval career, serving in World War II, and ended active service in 1951, just before the Queen's coronation.\n\nPrince Philip and the Queen, distant cousins, were first friends then fell in love. They married in November 1947.\n\nIn 2015 he became the last person to be awarded an Australian knighthood, in the controversial and short-lived resurrection of the imperial-style honour by then prime minister Tony Abbott.\n\nHe has many other orders and titles - including lord high admiral of the Royal Navy, an appointment given to him by the Queen as a 90th birthday present.\n\nOver the years he has also been well-known for his gaffes - politically incorrect jokes that risked offence.\n\nIn 1966 he commented that \"British women can't cook\"; in 1986 he warned British students in China they might become \"slitty-eyed\"; and in 2002 he asked an indigenous Australian if they \"still throw spears at each other\". In 2013 he told Malala Yousafzai that children \"go to school because their parents don't want them in the house\".\n\nHe once said of Princess Anne, \"if it doesn't fart or eat hay, she's not interested\".\n\nBut he is loved by the public for his unswerving support for the Queen.\n\nAt their golden wedding anniversary in 1997 she described him as \"someone who doesn't take easily to compliments, but he has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years, and I and his whole family, in this and many other countries, owe him a debt greater than he would ever claim or we shall ever know\".", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-02", "title": "Prince Philip waves goodbye to a career of service, dedication... and gaffes", "dateCrawl":

He will still accompany the Queen on occasion, and may choose to attend \"certain public events from time to time\". He will also keep up some official duties including correspondence.\n\nYou will now receive updates from Breaking News Alert Breaking News Alert\n\nGet the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy .\n\nBut, essentially, this marks the retirement of Britain's longest-serving consort.\n\nThe royal household has calculated he took part in 637 solo overseas visits, gave 5496 speeches and wrote 14 books. He is patron of 785 organisations.\n\nHe has made more public appearances this year than either the Queen or the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge: 51 since January. In 2016 he was the fifth busiest royal.\n\nThe Duke will soon head up to Balmoral with the Queen for their annual summer holiday.\n\nAfter that, he is expected to spend most of his time at Windsor. Locals and visitors may catch sight of him whizzing about Windsor Great Park on antique royal carriages - his hobby, which he took up after giving up polo age 50.\n\nOther hobbies include oil painting, reading and photography.\n\nHe's not the type of man to put his feet up, Dickie Arbiter, the Queen's press secretary until 2000, told The Sun.\n\n\"He'll still be involved in something even if just from his office, from phone calls and talking to his patronages, talking to his charities, maybe even visiting them on a private visit.\n\n\"He's not giving up life, he's just stepping back from full-time public engagement and taking it a bit easier.\"\n\nHistorian Christopher Lee told the BBC the prince was the first man in Buckingham Palace to put computers in his office.\n\n\"He will want to know about the big issues. He will know every single touch, nuance on Brexit, for example. He is briefed on everybody he is likely to meet, even people he will never meet and he takes it in.\n\n\"I think he's never stopped being an admiral. Admirals are like that, they have to be, and admirals never retire.\"\n\nThe Duke has had several health scares in recent years: he spent two nights in hospital in June with an infection, missing the State Opening of Parliament and the last two days of Royal Ascot.\n\nIn 2008 he spent three days in hospital with a serious chest infection, in late 2011 he suffered chest pains and had heart surgery.\n\nIn 2012 during the Queen's diamond jubilee celebrations he suffered a bladder infection that put him in hospital for almost a week. The problem recurred later in the year.\n\nThen in 2013 he was admitted to hospital for 11 days for exploratory surgery on his abdomen.\n\nRoyal watchers say one reason for his retirement was he feared growing frail in public, and told close friends \"I'm past my sell-by date\".\n\nBut he is generally in good health for his age.\n\nHe was born on June 10, 1921 in the Greek island of Corfu, the fifth child of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, and Princess Alice of Battenburg.\n\nHis childhood was unsettled, as Greece went through political upheaval. Age 18 he began a naval career, serving in World War II, and ended active service in 1951, just before the Queen's coronation.\n\nPrince Philip and the Queen, distant cousins, were first friends then fell in love. They married in November 1947.\n\nIn 2015 he became the last person to be awarded an Australian knighthood, in the controversial and short-lived resurrection of the imperial-style honour by then prime minister Tony Abbott.\n\nHe has many other orders and titles - including lord high admiral of the Royal Navy, an appointment given to him by the Queen as a 90th birthday present.\n\nOver the years he has also been well-known for his gaffes - politically incorrect jokes that risked offence.\n\nIn 1966 he commented that \"British women can't cook\"; in 1986 he warned British students in China they might become \"slitty-eyed\"; and in 2002 he asked an indigenous Australian if they \"still throw spears at each other\". In 2013 he told Malala Yousafzai that children \"go to school because their parents don't want them in the house\".\n\nHe once said of Princess Anne, \"if it doesn't fart or eat hay, she's not interested\".\n\nBut he is loved by the public for his unswerving support for the Queen.\n\nAt their golden wedding anniversary in 1997 she described him as \"someone who doesn't take easily to compliments, but he has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years, and I and his whole family, in this and many other countries, owe him a debt greater than he would ever claim or we shall ever know\".", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-02", "title": "Prince Philip waves goodbye to a career of service, dedication... and gaffes", "dateCrawl":

As announced in May (after a brief media panic when rumours spread he had died overnight), he has decided he will no longer carry out public engagements.\n\nRelated Articles Prince Philip hospitalised due to infection Social media a big hit for Queen's 91st celebrations\n\nThe symbolism of his last appointment is likely no coincidence. Captain General is one of his oldest duties, passed to him in June 1953 from his father-in-law, King George VI. It is reportedly now going to Prince Harry.\n\nIt will be marked in a very British way.

He will still accompany the Queen on occasion, and may choose to attend \"certain public events from time to time\". He will also keep up some official duties including correspondence.\n\nYou will now receive updates from Breaking News Alert Breaking News Alert\n\nGet the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy .\n\nBut, essentially, this marks the retirement of Britain's longest-serving consort.\n\nThe royal household has calculated he took part in 637 solo overseas visits, gave 5496 speeches and wrote 14 books. He is patron of 785 organisations.\n\nHe has made more public appearances this year than either the Queen or the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge: 51 since January. In 2016 he was the fifth busiest royal.\n\nThe Duke will soon head up to Balmoral with the Queen for their annual summer holiday.\n\nAfter that, he is expected to spend most of his time at Windsor. Locals and visitors may catch sight of him whizzing about Windsor Great Park on antique royal carriages - his hobby, which he took up after giving up polo age 50.\n\nOther hobbies include oil painting, reading and photography.\n\nHe's not the type of man to put his feet up, Dickie Arbiter, the Queen's press secretary until 2000, told The Sun.\n\n\"He'll still be involved in something even if just from his office, from phone calls and talking to his patronages, talking to his charities, maybe even visiting them on a private visit.\n\n\"He's not giving up life, he's just stepping back from full-time public engagement and taking it a bit easier.\"\n\nHistorian Christopher Lee told the BBC the prince was the first man in Buckingham Palace to put computers in his office.\n\n\"He will want to know about the big issues. He will know every single touch, nuance on Brexit, for example. He is briefed on everybody he is likely to meet, even people he will never meet and he takes it in.\n\n\"I think he's never stopped being an admiral. Admirals are like that, they have to be, and admirals never retire.\"\n\nThe Duke has had several health scares in recent years: he spent two nights in hospital in June with an infection, missing the State Opening of Parliament and the last two days of Royal Ascot.\n\nIn 2008 he spent three days in hospital with a serious chest infection, in late 2011 he suffered chest pains and had heart surgery.\n\nIn 2012 during the Queen's diamond jubilee celebrations he suffered a bladder infection that put him in hospital for almost a week. The problem recurred later in the year.\n\nThen in 2013 he was admitted to hospital for 11 days for exploratory surgery on his abdomen.\n\nRoyal watchers say one reason for his retirement was he feared growing frail in public, and told close friends \"I'm past my sell-by date\".\n\nBut he is generally in good health for his age.\n\nHe was born on June 10, 1921 in the Greek island of Corfu, the fifth child of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, and Princess Alice of Battenburg.\n\nHis childhood was unsettled, as Greece went through political upheaval. Age 18 he began a naval career, serving in World War II, and ended active service in 1951, just before the Queen's coronation.\n\nPrince Philip and the Queen, distant cousins, were first friends then fell in love. They married in November 1947.\n\nIn 2015 he became the last person to be awarded an Australian knighthood, in the controversial and short-lived resurrection of the imperial-style honour by then prime minister Tony Abbott.\n\nHe has many other orders and titles - including lord high admiral of the Royal Navy, an appointment given to him by the Queen as a 90th birthday present.\n\nOver the years he has also been well-known for his gaffes - politically incorrect jokes that risked offence.\n\nIn 1966 he commented that \"British women can't cook\"; in 1986 he warned British students in China they might become \"slitty-eyed\"; and in 2002 he asked an indigenous Australian if they \"still throw spears at each other\". In 2013 he told Malala Yousafzai that children \"go to school because their parents don't want them in the house\".\n\nHe once said of Princess Anne, \"if it doesn't fart or eat hay, she's not interested\".\n\nBut he is loved by the public for his unswerving support for the Queen.\n\nAt their golden wedding anniversary in 1997 she described him as \"someone who doesn't take easily to compliments, but he has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years, and I and his whole family, in this and many other countries, owe him a debt greater than he would ever claim or we shall ever know\".", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-02", "title": "Prince Philip waves goodbye to a career of service, dedication... and gaffes", "dateCrawl":

He joined the Royal Navy in 1939, aged 18 and in October of 1942, he became first lieutenant of HMS Wallace at 21 years old - one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy.\n\nThe Duke met the then-Princess Elizabeth whilst he was training at the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth when she was just 13, but the pair continued to write to each other once the Princess returned to Windsor.\n\nIn the summer of 1946, Philip asked the King George VI for his daughter's hand in marriage, delaying the public announcement of their engagement until Elizabeth turned 21 the following April. The couple were then married on 20 November 1947 at Westminster Abbey. The day before the wedding, the King bestowed the style of Royal Highness on Philip and on the morning of the wedding, he was made the Duke of Edinburgh as he had abandoned both his Greek and Danish royal titles in order to marry Elizabeth. In 1957, the Queen granted her husband the title of a Prince of the United Kingdom, restoring the royal status that he had formally renounced ten years earlier.\n\nSince the Queen's accession to the throne in 1953, the Duke has supported his wife in her royal duties as sovereign, accompanying her to ceremonies, state dinners, and tours abroad.\n\nPrince Philip has been patron of almost 800 organisations, mainly focused on the environment, industry, sport, and education, in particular serving as Chancellor of the Universities of Cambridge, Edinburgh, Salford and Wales. In 1956, the Duke, with Kurt Hahn, founded the Duke of Edinburgh's Award in order to give young people \"a sense of responsibility to themselves and their communities\". Over the years, he has slowly bestowed theses patronages to his grand children, Prince William and Prince Harry, along with the Duchess of Cambridge, and following a bout of ill health, Kensington Palace announced in May 2017 that the Duke would retire from his royal duties in the following summer.\n\nAs he makes his last royal appearance at the the Captain General's Parade at Buckingham Palace, take a look back through his life in pictures.", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-02", "title": "Prince Philip: Life In Pictures", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-02", "id": "14952878", "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-05-", "textStart": 1944, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1952}], "storyUri": "eng-3330847", "time": "13:39:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "id": "58", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "id": "88", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "id": "82759", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "id": "89362", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language", "label": {"eng": "Greek language"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304874"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant", "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305060"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}, "type": "person", "id": "305814"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Highness", "label": {"eng": "Royal Highness"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "306326"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry_of_Wales", "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry of Wales"}, "type": "person", "id": "306417"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Duchess_of_Cambridge", "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge"}, "type": "person", "id": "306418"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_dinner", "label": {"eng": "State dinner"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "306555"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Abbey", "label": {"eng": "Westminster Abbey"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "306893"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh", "label": {"eng": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh"}, "type": "person", "id": "306901"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_VI", "label": {"eng": "George VI"}, "type": "person", "id": "317125"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_lieutenant", "label": {"eng": "First lieutenant"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "318792"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy", "label": {"eng": "Royal Navy"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "321994"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge", "label": {"eng": "University of Cambridge"}, "type": "org", "id": "323113"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage", "label": {"eng": "Patronage"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "330020"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_William,_Duke_of_Cambridge", "label": {"eng": "Prince William, Duke of Cambridge"}, "type": "person", "id": "342151"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Palace", "label": {"eng": "Kensington Palace"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "345550"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Edinburgh's_Award", "label": {"eng": "Duke of Edinburgh's Award"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "436805"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_Royal_Family", "label": {"eng": "Danish Royal Family"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "459673"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britannia_Royal_Naval_College", "label": {"eng": "Britannia Royal Naval College"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "683572"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Hahn", "label": {"eng": "Kurt Hahn"}, "type": "person", "id": "848053"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_prince", "label": {"eng": "British prince"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "960940"}], "url": "http://www.vogue.co.uk/gallery/prince-philip-life-in-pictures", "timeCrawl": "19:12:00", "image": "https://vg-images.condecdn.net/image/EJgPbOdgzA7/crop/1440/0.523560209424", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-02T13:39:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.5529412031173706}

The elderly Duke of Edinburgh has been struggling with his health for a number of years and the decision to retire from public duties was made at the start of the summer.\n\nHis last engagement - his 22,219th as royal consort - will be a meeting with Royal Marines who have run 16.64 miles per day for 100 days for charity, in reference to the foundation year of the Marines, 1664. He will attend a parade and meet participants in London. Prince Philip is Captain General of the Royal Marines, a title that is expected to pass to his grandson Prince Harry.\n\nCredit: PA\n\nHe began public duties back in 1952, when the Queen acceded to the throne on the death of her father, King George VI.\n\nAs the husband of the monarch - they married in 1947 - he has stood by her side for 70 years and is involved in a huge a range of organisations from the Royal Navy, where he is Lord High Admiral, down to 785 other charities.\n\nHis titular Duke of Edinburgh's Award has been taken by 4 million people across over 100 countries worldwide.\n\nThe 96-year-old consort to the Queen has suffered from a succession of physical issues, including a brief spell in hospital in June, which caused him to miss the State Opening of Parliament. He was previously too ill to travel to Sandringham in Norfolk, where the Royals traditionally spend Christmas.\n\nShaking hands with French cyclist Jose Beyaert in 1948. Credit: PA\n\nThe Prince is expected to begin his retirement by flying to Balmoral Castle in Scotland next week, where the Royal Family traditionally spend the late summer.\n\nIt is expected that the Prince will continue royal duties at his choosing. The Queen's schedule remains as normal.\n\nPhilip's career as a royal consort has often been marked by gaffes and missteps, most notably when he told a group of British expats: \"If you stay here much longer you'll all be slitty-eyed\" while on a trip to China.\n\nHe also asked a Scottish driving instructor: \"How do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to pass the test?\" and enquired, \"Still throwing spears?\" of an Indiginous Australian.\n\nAt the Aga Khan School, Pakistan, 1997. Credit: PA\n\nHowever, after over six decades in the public eye, he remains a popular member of the Royal Family.\n\n\"He's been such a stable character in all our lives - he's always there and he's always been there for the Queen and I think we're very, very lucky to have him\" said Lady Myra Butler, who has known Philip since childhood, to the BBC.\n\n\"\"I'm sure that he won't disappear, he will be greatly missed by everybody.\"\n\nSource: BBC\n\nFeatured Image Credit: PA", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-02", "title": "Duke Of Edinburgh Undertakes Final

His replacement is up to the Queen, though media have speculated it's to be Prince Harry.\n\nPhilip is now retired - he will no longer carry out solo public engagements, though he will still accompany the Queen on occasion, and may choose to attend \"certain public events from time to time\", the palace said.\n\nHe will also keep up some official duties, including correspondence.\n\nIn the crowd outside the palace was Bob Bruce, who served in the Royal Marines for 26 years. He was there with his son, simply to mark the occasion.\n\n\"He's done a long stint,\" Bruce said of Philip. \"He'd turn out to all the important events of the Royal Marines and quite a lot of unimportant events and informal events as well - he's always been a great supporter.\"\n\nBruce said he had met the Duke, briefly, a couple of times.\n\n\"He's fantastic, he's well known as being able to chat with anybody at any level. He's always got a clever comment to make, or a quick humorous quip.\n\n\"He spoke at the 350th anniversary dinner of the Royal Marines [in 2014] when he wasn't expected to speak. He stood up at a moment's notice and had the whole hall in stitches of laughter with his funny stories.\n\n\"I think we're very proud to see him today. He's given great service to the Corps, but he's also given fantastic service to the country.\"\n\nBrigadier Richard Spencer, deputy commandant general of the Royal Marines, said the Marines had been \"hugely privileged\" to have the Duke of Edinburgh as their Captain General.\n\nHe had been much more than a figurehead, the brigadier said, he had been instrumental in drawing together the Corps family, and had provided advice and counsel to 25 commandants-general, the professional heads of the Marines.\n\n\"As always with people of such experience, they have the ability to see through the peaks and troughs of life,\" he said.\n\nAnd Philip had clearly enjoyed the military side to his job - a former naval officer who served in the Second World War, he had also been Admiral of the Fleet and Colonel of the Grenadier Guards.\n\n\"That was particularly evident when you saw him with our cadets and veterans,\" the brigadier said.\n\n\"You saw the sparkle in his eyes and the spring in his step as he spoke to them.\"", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-03", "title": "Prince Philip doffs his bowler hat and wanders off into retirement", "dateCrawl":

inimitable style by joking with Royal Marines they should be \"locked up\" for their madcap fundraising efforts.\n\nAs a former Royal Navy officer Philip's last public solo event, after more than 65 years championing his own causes and charities, fittingly featured men from the Royal Marines, an integral part of the Navy.\n\nBut from the demeanour of the Queen's Consort you would never have guessed he was retiring after carrying out 22,219 solo engagements since 1952.\n\nHe waved warmly to the crowds, acknowledging their cheers and was described as \"chirpy\" by a senior officer.\n\nWearing a bowler hat and rain coat the Duke did not let a heavy downpour affect his final day which was staged in Buckingham Palace's forecourt.\n\nThe event marked the end of the 1664 Global Challenge, which recognises 1664, the year the Royal Marines were founded, and has seen marines push themselves to the limit with a series of physical exploits in aid of the Royal Marines Charity.\n\nThe Duke, who is the Captain General of the Royal Marines, met Corporal Will Gingell, 33, and Corporal Jamie Thompson, 31, who have run 1,664 miles over 100 days.\n\nHe also chatted to Sergeant Matt Burley, a physical training instructor, who swam 1,664 lengths underwater over 10 days and Lieutenant Colonel Aldeiy Alderson, who ran 100 kilometres in 12 hours wearing his Royal Marines uniform and polished boots.\n\nLooking at the group of marines he made them laugh with the quip: \"You all should be locked up.\"\n\nThe Queen's Consort announced in May he would be retiring from royal engagements, a decision which was fully supported by the Queen and was not medically related.\n\nBuckingham Palace has stressed, although the Duke's diary of engagements has come to an end, he may decide to attend certain events, alongside the Queen, from time to time.\n\nThe Queen's public schedule continues as normal but other members of the Royal Family will step up in support of the monarch in her role as head of state.", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-02", "title": "Prince Philip signs off from 65 years of royal duties with trademark quip",

Her husband, Prince Philip, has also been a public fixture for some time - best known in the UK for his ready wit and occasional PC faux-pas - and he has been in the news again lately as a result of a decision to retire from making public trips. Prince Philip has had a series of health scares in recent years, and at the age of 96, it has been decided that he will be bowing out from making public visits.\n\nHowever, this has led to some particularly poor taste mistakes being made in the media. In recent months, as it was initially suggest that the Prince would be bowing out of public engagements, some media outlets accidentally published statements as if he had passed on - similar occurrences emerged regarding former US President George HW Bush. This time, however, it was the turn of British news giant the Telegraph to get the wrong end of the stick - in possible the worst way possible.\n\nAs the Duke of Edinburgh recently made his last engagement, The Telegraph mistakenly announced to readers that the popular figurehead had passed away - in an article that advised his age to be 'XX years'. While the story now redirects to a different story regarding the Prince, the damage was already done - as The Sun will know only too well, having made the same mistake earlier this year, only to linger around on search results for some time afterwards. It is commonplace for famous people to have obituaries lined up in the media - as it allows for a quick and respectful coverage of their passing - but there have been numerous occasions this year of such a mishap taking place.\n\nPrince Philip retires from royal duties having clocked up over 22,000 different engagements purely on his own over the past 65 years - though it will likely not be the last we see of the Duke, as the opportunity is open for him to appear alongside the Queen in future engagements should he wish to do so - and should it be advisable.

It's an end of an era: In his nearly 70 years in service, the royal made 22,219 solo engagements, gave 5,496 speeches, wrote 14 books, and visited 143 countries. He holds the record for longest-serving consort in British history.\n\nThe 96-year-old, wearing a trenchcoat and a bowler hat, met with the Royal Marines to commend them on finishing a 1,664-mile journey for charity. In terms of official engagements, it's a low-key one -- it's no, say, Royal Ascot or a star-studded movie premiere. But is the perfect final solo event for Philip.\n\nYou see, the Prince has always been a military man. He joined the Britannia Royal Naval College in 1939 and served throughout World War II, even earning special recognition for his efforts at the Battle of Cape Matapan. He eventually rose through the ranks to become a commander, and moved to Malta with his young bride, the then-Princess Elizabeth, in the late 1940s. It's said that time in Eastern Europe was one of the happiest in their lives.\n\nHis naval career was stopped short upon the ascension of his wife to the throne, but he refused to let that pesky fact get in the way of his military sportsmanship. He got his Royal Air Force Wings in 1953, his helicopter wings in 1956, and his private pilot's license in 1959. And when it came time to become patron to a number of royal organizations (over his lifetime, he would be appointed to 785), he gravitated to many veteran and military organizations . . . including, yes, the Royal Marines, which named him Captain General.\n\nAnd today, did the audience applaud for their captain! When the band played \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow,\" the marines gave him an enthusiastic three cheers -- a touching response from a usually restrained crowd.

and workers even added a 'Gone Fishing' sign on the gate of Miniland's Buckingham Palace.\n\nA Legoland spokeswoman said: 'The Queen and Prince Philip visited our miniature LEGO Buckingham Palace in Miniland back in 2003, so we thought it was only right to wish the Duke of Edinburgh a very happy retirement by marking the occasion in Miniland in our own LEGOLAND way.'\n\nThe 96-year-old Duke may still accompany the Queen to certain events from time to time, but his own diary of royal engagements will end.\n\nHis decision to retire was not medically related and was fully supported by his wife.\n\nPhilip has supported the Queen in her role as head of state for more than 65 years, alongside attending events for his own charities and organisations.\n\nTheresa May said he had given the Queen 'steadfast support' and Jeremy Corbyn added that his 'clear sense of public duty' had inspired people for 60 years.", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-03", "title": "Legoland retires a tiny Prince Phillip figure from its Buckingham Palace display", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-03", "id": "15211611", "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-03", "textStart": 120, "amb": false, "textEnd": 130}], "storyUri": "eng-3330847", "time": "21:03:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "type": "org", "id": "302546"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "label": {"eng": "Email"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302685"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "type": "org", "id": "302866"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Message_Service", "label": {"eng": "Short Message Service"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303499"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303766"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state", "label": {"eng": "Head of state"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305553"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}, "type": "person", "id": "305814"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "306307"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh", "label": {"eng": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh"}, "type": "person", "id": "306901"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego", "label": {"eng": "Lego"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "319111"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat", "label": {"eng": "Hat"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "328222"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google ", "label": {"eng": "Google+"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "357814"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legoland", "label": {"eng": "Legoland"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "383807"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Edinburgh", "label": {"eng": "Duke of Edinburgh"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "436804"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Marines", "label": {"eng": "Royal Marines"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "438155"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legoland_Windsor_Resort", "label": {"eng": "Legoland Windsor Resort"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "452699"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowler_hat", "label": {"eng": "Bowler hat"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "564343"}], "url": "http://metro.co.uk/2017/08/03/legoland-retires-a-tiny-prince-phillip-figure-from-its-buckingham-palace-display-6827933/", "timeCrawl": "21:03:00", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/prc_48530272.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=80&strip=all&ssl=1", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-03T21:03:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.4823529422283173}

Only the Duke's family, friends and heads of state from Commonwealth countries will be in attendance.\n\nWill we be able to view his body before the burial?\n\nNo. The public will not be allowed to see the body while it is lying at St James's.\n\nWhere will he be buried?\n\nThe Duke would be buried in the grounds of Windsor Castle - specifically, in Frogmore Gardens.\n\nWhile most monarchs are buried in Westminster Abbey and St George's Chapel, Prince Philip would be joining Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in Frogmore Gardens, where they are buried in a mausoleum.\n\nWill there be a mourning period?\n\nYes. If the Queen survives Prince Philip, she will enter into an official eight-day period of mourning.\n\nDuring these eight days, laws will not be given the Royal Assent. State affairs will also be put on hold, out of respect.\n\nA further period of official Royal Mourning will then continue for 30 days.\n\nOnly after this month will the bereaved Queen make a full return to public duties.", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-02", "title": "Here's what will happen when Prince Philip dies", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-02", "id":

Philip -- who is Elizabeth's third cousin -- was originally born Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, but when he and Elizabeth decided to tie the knot in November 1947, he had to renounce both of his Greek and Danish titles on the morning of his wedding. As a result, Elizabeth's father, King George VI, made him the Duke of Edinburgh. Philip also switched to Anglicanism from Greek Orthodoxy to win the British public's favor and prove his allegiance to Elizabeth.\n\nWhen the king's health began to worsen in 1951, Philip abandoned his naval career to support Elizabeth and assume his royal duties. Philip had just acquired the title of commander of the Royal Navy at the time. \"I don't know how difficult it was, it was naturally disappointing,\" he said in a May 2011 interview with ITV. \"I had just been promoted to commander and the fact was that the most interesting part of my naval career was just starting.\"\n\nElizabeth eventually returned Philip's royal status in 1957 when she gave him the title of a Prince of the United Kingdom, and for his 90th birthday in June 2011, Elizabeth made Philip the head of the Royal Navy, giving him the title and office of Lord High Admiral of the Navy, a position Elizabeth held since 1964.

We are not doing this for ourselves but for the greater good of the people.\"\n\nAnd he insisted the Royals were still vital, adding: \"We don't want to dilute the magic.\n\n\"The British public and the whole world need institutions like it.\"\n\nThe long-serving royal is stepping back from a public role after 65 years of Royal duties.\n\nHis final solo engagement is The Captain General's Parade on August 2 when he will salute the Royal Marines at Buckingham Palace.\n\nDue to English common laws, he cannot become king.\n\nThe wife of a king is known as a \"Queen Consort\", and takes the title of Queen - although she doesn't rule as the monarch.\n\nBut if a female royal marries a man with a title below her own - as in the case of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip - she will retain the title

On Philip's side of the coin are the words \"Non sibi sed patriae,\" which translate to \"not for self but country\" in Latin (not to \"Prince George is my great-grandson, y'all,\" as we'd been hoping).\n\nPrince Charles himself arrived to help make the coins when he visited the Royal Mint in Wales last month. \"We are particularly delighted that the Prince of Wales struck the very first of the coins that will celebrate the contribution that the Duke of Edinburgh has made to public life,\" Royal Mint Chief Executive Adam Lawrence said.\n\nAs People points out, while Philip receiving his own coin is not particularly out of the ordinary, given it is \"standard fare for milestone royal occasions,\" there is a sweet sort of resonance here as Philip served as the president of the Royal Mint Advisory Committee for 47 years, stepping down from that role in 1999.", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-04", "title": "See the Special Way Prince Philip's Retirement Is Being Commemorated", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-04", "id": "15269754", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3330847", "time": "04:44:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "id": "82759", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin", "label": {"eng": "Coin"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304879"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}, "type": "person", "id": "305814"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh", "label": {"eng": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh"}, "type": "person", "id": "306901"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin", "label": {"eng": "Latin"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "311427"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles,_Prince_of_Wales", "label": {"eng": "Charles, Prince of Wales"}, "type": "person", "id": "354698"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_Duff", "label": {"eng": "Hilary Duff"}, "type": "person", "id": "376213"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales", "label": {"eng": "Prince of Wales"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "377248"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Mint", "label": {"eng": "Royal Mint"}, "type": "org", "id": "382786"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Edinburgh", "label": {"eng": "Duke of Edinburgh"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "436804"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_pounds_(British_coin)", "label": {"eng": "Five pounds (British coin)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1038532"}], "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/08/prince-philip-retirement-coin-royal-mint", "timeCrawl": "04:44:00", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57ffe111c666a0c056e7d1ed/16:9/pass/queen-philip-too-funny.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-04T04:44:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.4235294163227081}

Prince Philip, the Queen's husband (or \"consort\" to give him his official title) and Duke of Edinburgh is attending his last event on official business -- a royal marines' charity parade -- before retiring at the age of 96.\n\nBut while the moment will bring welcome respite to a man who recently joked that he \"can't stand up much longer\" and who has served in his role for longer than anyone else in British history, it will mean extra work for the younger royals. Particularly Prince Charles, first in line to the throne, and his son William, the next in the order of succession.\n\nThere is, says royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams, \"a new generation coming into play and taking over the activities of the older.\" Philip, he says, plans to remain attached to all the organizations he currently has a formal relationship with -- well over 700 -- and younger royals may need to fill in for him at their functions.\n\nDaily Emails and Alerts - Get the best of Newsweek delivered to your inbox\n\nMeanwhile the Queen, who is 91, is understood to have no plans to retire, but has already begun delegating some duties to Charles and the other royals. Charles is set to attend the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Australia, while William is moving his family to London permanently and finishing his job as an air ambulance pilot in order to take on more duties.\n\nFor Charles, taking on greater visibility may serve another function, too: It may not be long before the throne passes to him, and the more chances for positive appearances before the British public, the better. \"We know the Queen will never abdicate, but it only makes sense to adjust things gradually,\" says Fitzwilliams \"to give Charles a higher profile.\"\n\nMeanwhile, for the next generation of royals, the increased acitivity will bring more chances to promote their chosen causes. William, his wife Kate, and Prince Harry have all used their platforms to champion mental health awareness and other issues. The three are particularly well known on the world stage, while Harry's support for the Invictus Games, a Paralympics-style sporting event for wounded or sick armed forces personnel, has introduced him to a new audience.\n\nAnd as for the Duke of Edinburgh himself? \"I think we'll be seeing quite a lot of him,\" says Fitzwilliam, \"When the Duke does appear in the future... there'll be an extra bonus in the sense that people won't know whether he'll be there or not.\"", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-02", "title": "As Prince Philip retires, what does it mean for the future of the Royal family?", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-02", "id": "14851760", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3330847", "time": "02:34:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "id": "12", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "Australia (continent)"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "id": "86522", "location": {"label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)", "label": {"eng": "Family (biology)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303765"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)", "label": {"eng": "Order (biology)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305344"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}, "type": "person", "id": "305814"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "306080"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry_of_Wales", "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry of Wales"}, "type": "person", "id": "306417"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh", "label": {"eng": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh"}, "type": "person", "id": "306901"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "317450"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throne", "label": {"eng": "Throne"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "322083"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_medical_services", "label": {"eng": "Air medical services"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "328290"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_University", "label": {"eng": "Duke University"}, "type": "org", "id": "328772"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_British_Isles", "label": {"eng": "History of the British Isles"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "345870"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_family", "label": {"eng": "Royal family"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "348549"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}, "type": "org", "id": "348780"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles,_Prince_of_Wales", "label": {"eng": "Charles, Prince of Wales"}, "type": "person", "id": "354698"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Commonwealth_Games", "label": {"eng": "2018 Commonwealth Games"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "418142"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Edinburgh", "label": {"eng": "Duke of Edinburgh"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "436804"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_to_the_British_throne", "label": {"eng": "Succession to the British throne"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "822999"}], "url": "http://www.newsweek.com/prince-philip-retires-queen-elizabeth-644884", "timeCrawl": "11:01:00", "image": "http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2017/08/01/prince-philip.jpg", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-02T02:34:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.3960784375667572}

His family comes from the Danish-German house of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glucksburg and many of his relatives became members of the Greek, Norwegian and Danish royal families.\n\nPrince Philip, who turned 96 yesterday, pictured at age 9 when he was Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, wearing Greek national costume. pic.twitter.com/DePIawOQMR -- Mark (@markuslynnus)\n\nJune 11, 2017\n\nHis mother Princess Alice was German was by birth, but she diplomatically anglicized her surname, changing it from Battenberg to Mountbatten during World War One, as her family had by then moved to Britain.\n\nIn 1930 she was diagnosed with schizophrenia and was moved to a sanatorium in Switzerland, but in later life she lived in London's Buckingham Palace.\n\nPhilip's father was the brother of King Constantine of Greece, but Philip had to renounce his Greek citizenship - as well as his claims to the Danish and Greek thrones - before marrying into Britain's royal family.\n\nCuriously, he told his biographer Fiammetta Rocco in 1992 that \"if anything, I've thought of myself as Scandinavian. Particularly, Danish.\"\n\nProud of my Uncle Greek borne #PrincePhilip who dedicated his life to service of the Queen & her nation Thank you for your dedication at 96 pic.twitter.com/fDuitgWBQ0 -- Prince Pavlos of Gr (@pavlosgr1)\n\nMay 4, 2017\n\nWhen Elizabeth took the throne there was a big debate over what the royal family's surname should be. The queen wanted \"Mountbatten-Windsor\", but former prime minister and war hero Winston Churchill pushed for just \"Windsor\". Churchill had taken a dislike to Louis Mountbatten whom he blamed for losing India as a colony in 1947 and so the royal family became the \"House of Windsor.\"\n\nPhilip's unfortunate gaffes\n\nPhilip remains notorious for his public gaffes, delighting some of his British subjects and horrifying others.\n\nMost recently he lost his patience in 2015, telling an RAF photographer at an event to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain to \"just take the f***ing picture.\"\n\nHis legendary racist comments have often reminded Britons that he hails from an earlier and very different era when Britain still retained colonies across the world.\n\nOn a state visit to China in 1986 he told British students: \"If you stay here much longer, you'll all be slitty-eyed.\"\n\nThen in Australia in 2002 he told an Aboriginal businessman \"Do you still throw spears at each other?\"\n\nVisiting a hospital in 2013 he told a nurse of Filipino origin: \"The Philippines must be half empty as you're all here running the NHS.\"\n\nBack in 1961 he became president of the World Wildlife Fund in 1961 - and shot a tiger in India the same year.\n\nBut, being the Queen's husband he's somehow got away with the dozen or so foot-in-mouth moments during a career that has featured more than 22,000 public engagements since 1952.\n\nCareer highs and lows\n\nPhilip began writing to his future wife when she was just 13 and he's now the longest-serving consort - or spouse - of a reigning British monarch. (The Queen meanwhile is the longest serving head of state in the world today.)\n\nHe's a patron of around 780 organisations and his salary is 401,000 euros a year.\n\nOn ceremonial occasions he's had to walk behind his wife - and not alongside her - because she's the queen and he is merely her consort.\n\nHe's visited 143 countries as well as the Antarctic.\n\nAfter Philip's daughter-in-law the Princess of Wales was killed in a car crash, along with her Egyptian boyfriend Dodi Fayed, tycoon Mohamed Fayed accused Philip of ordering Diana's killing.", "eventUri": "eng-3330847", "isDuplicate":

For South Sudan Basketball Federation President Luol Deng, it was the culmination of everything that he and the team had worked so hard to achieve.\n\n\"When the national anthem was sung, you know, it just gave me goosebumps, and I realized that this was bigger than basketball,\" Deng told CNN Sport's Amanda Davies. \"And you know that the support is going to be there.\n\n\"This is really a credit to our fans who supported us from day one. And now, we have such a huge following and huge (fanbase) that we really believe that it's so inspiring because of the fans. The energy and everything that they're bringing is inspiring everybody else to pay attention to it.\"\n\nThe road to representation\n\nDeng is a former two-time NBA All-Star and spent 15 years in the league with the likes of the Chicago Bulls, Miami Heat and Los Angeles Lakers. He was born in Wau, in what is now South Sudan, before the country's independence. His family was displaced due to the Second Sudanese Civil War, moving to Egypt when Deng was a child before the family was granted political asylum in the UK, arriving in London, England.\n\nHe moved to the US at 14 to pursue a basketball career, going on to play college hoops at Duke before being drafted seventh overall by Chicago in 2004. He represented Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics in London.\n\nAfter his playing career concluded in 2019, Deng became heavily involved with allowing the country in which he was born to tell its story and be represented on the international stage. He currently serves as an assistant coach to the team alongside his role as president, having previously worked as head coach and player liaison.\n\nSouth Sudan officially gained independence from Sudan in 2011 following a referendum, making it the world's newest widely-recognized state. It has since experienced a civil war of its own that officially ended in 2018 and is listed as one of the least developed countries in the world by the United Nations.\n\nLike Deng, several of the players on the Olympic roster are refugees who were forced to leave South Sudan or were born elsewhere after their families had been displaced.\n\n\"We didn't just randomly put a team together. I've known a lot of these players since they were so young, and I've kept up with a lot of other players that I didn't know, but they were on my radar,\" he told CNN. \"And before I took over the president of the federation, I did imagine, 'What if those guys committed to play for our nation?' And this is the result because it's all come together.\n\n\"These guys believed that it could happen, and whoever didn't believe in the beginning,\n\nthat's fine. We got them on board with us because of, you know, what we've been able to do, and we're glad to have them.\"\n\nWith Deng as the driving force, the team has swiftly made history. It played its first competitive fixture in 2017 and qualified for the World Cup at the first time of asking, finishing 17th out of 32 teams at the tournament in 2023.\n\nAs the best-placed African team, South Sudan qualified for Olympics as the continent's sole representative and continued to show that it's far from a pushover by taking the historically dominant Team USA to the final buzzer in a warm-up game in London earlier this month.\n\n'We play to win'\n\nNo one can ever question Deng's commitment to the project - according to South Sudan head coach Royal Ivey, Deng has been funding the team out of his own pocket for four years.\n\nIt all appears to have been worth it, however, with Deng stating his pride at being part of \"nation building\" and that there is \"no better feeling\" than wearing a shirt that bears the name of South Sudan, though he wishes that he had gotten the opportunity to actually play for the team.\n\n\"For now, the polo is good,\" he laughed.\n\nAfter winning its first game and writing its name into the history books, speculation about how far this team can go has already ramped up, though Deng believes that the group's main goal has already been achieved.\n\nSouth Sudan players celebrate after defeating Puerto Rico.\n\nChristina Pahnke/sampics/Getty Images\n\n\"We've been able to tell a story that's really unique,\" the 39-year-old explained. \"We've worked very hard to get here. I think that we know that we are playing to show people how good we can be. I think the story itself is out there. People understand it, people know it. They can take it however they want to take it.\"\n\nThis is not a team that's here to make up the numbers, though.\n\n\"We play to win, we're not just happy to be here,\" said Deng. \"We feel like we do belong here, and we're representing the continent, and we want to represent it the right way. When people watch us play, they understand that, you know, we're well coached and we have great players.\"\n\nNext up for South Sudan in Paris is the tallest of tasks - a rematch against a Team USA that features the likes of LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Steph Curry. For the staff and players though, the message has always been the most important thing.\n\n\"I think we'll go out there and make a lot of people proud of how we play.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com",

But the backstory of this group from South Sudan, which only became an independent country in 2011, is the kind of endearing tale that makes the Olympic Games such an enduring event.\n\nPARIS OLYMPICS 2024: Follow USA TODAY's full coverage here\n\nThis is South Sudan's first time qualifying for the Olympics in any team sport, and any sport other than track and field. It seems poised to make a great first impression. Here's what else you should know about South Sudan's men's basketball team:\n\nSouth Sudan nearly pulled off a huge upset when it played the United States in an exhibition game in London on July 20. Team USA needed a basket by LeBron James with eight seconds to go, overcoming a 16-point deficit to pull off a 101-100 win. South Sudan, who entered the game as a 43-point underdog, had re-taken the lead on a late JT Thor 3-pointer.\n\nZILGITT: South Sudan men's basketball beats odds to inspire at Olympics\n\nMarial Shayok had 25 points for South Sudan, while guard Carlik Jones finished with a triple-double. A runner missed by Jones with four seconds left could have given South Sudan a stunning triumph.\n\nSouth Sudan won its first Olympic basketball game by beating Puerto Rico, 90-79, to begin Group C play on Sunday.\n\n\"It means everything,\" Wenyen Gabriel said. \"It's a unifying moment. We're all united through basketball right now and it's proof of what sport can do for a country.\"\n\nHOW USA STARTED: Kevin Durant, LeBron James propel USA men's basketball in Olympic opening win over Serbia\n\nThe South Sudan men's basketball team is known as the \"Bright Stars,\" a reference to the Bright Star campaign that began the country's quest for liberation more than 30 years ago.\n\nThe former NBA All-Star is an indispensable part of South Sudan's rise in men's basketball. Deng, who played for five NBA teams over 15 seasons after a successful career at Duke, was named the president of the South Sudanese Basketball Federation in 2019. He has subsequently used millions of dollars of his own money to help fund the program's rise.\n\n\"We don't have the pleasure of having a gymnasium, dorms, and other facilities,\" South Sudan coach Royal Ivey told reporters in Paris. \"We had a tough training camp in Rwanda, then traveled to Spain, moving around a lot, taking long flights, and giving up exit rows to my 7-footers. These are the things people don't talk about. They don't see us getting delayed for seven hours in the airport while we're in Chad.\"\n\n\"Luol Deng has been funding this thing for four years out of his own pocket,\" Ivey added. \"He pays for gyms, hotels, plane tickets -- everything. Kudos to Luol and the staff. We wouldn't have been able to put this team together without them.\"\n\nBorn in Wau, Sudan, Deng moved with his family to Egypt as a 3-year-old in the midst of the Sudanese civil war. They were later granted asylum in England and Deng eventually came to the United States after he was recruited for basketball by New Jersey's Blair Academy. Deng also credits former NBA star Manute Bol, another Sudanese transplant, for helping teach him the game.\n\nThe Luol Deng Foundation had already been running camps throughout South Sudan before Deng assumed his current role. One of those camps, in Kampala, South Sudan, helped identify one of Duke's top incoming recruits and 2025 NBA draft prospect, Khaman Maluach, according to ESPN.\n\nFormer NBA player and current Houston Rockets assistant coach Royal Ivey is serving as the head coach of the South Sudan Olympic men's basketball team. Ivey, who was a star for University of Texas, is a former high school teammate of Deng at Blair Academy. He played 11 seasons in the NBA, including two years with the Oklahoma City Thunder as a teammate of Kevin Durant, and helped lead the Longhorns to the Final Four under former coach Rick Barnes in 2003.\n\n\"My life is a movie right now,\" Ivey remarked after South Sudan beat Puerto Rico to begin the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: Former Texas basketball player Royal is coaching South Sudan at 2024 Paris Olympics\n\nMany of South Sudan's players spent much of their childhood as refugees outside of their home country due to the civil conflicts that took place prior to and after South Sudan declared its independence in 2011. There have also been some roster complications due to South Sudanese players competing for other countries in previous international events and tournaments because South Sudan either didn't have a program yet or was in the beginning stages of fielding a national team.\n\nNonetheless, South Sudan is fielding roster with four players who have appeared in an NBA game during this year's Olympic tournament. Its prominent members include:\n\nFormer NBA player Gilbert Arenas faced backlash over comments made on his podcast that were deemed xenophobic after South Sudan nearly beat the United States in their exhibition game. Arenas called the South Sudan team the \"Ahi Ahi tribe\" before referring to it as \"Cool Runnings,\" referencing the eponymous movie that centered on the Jamaica bobsleigh team at the 1988 Winter Olympics.\n\nPierce was also critical in the wake of Team USA's near-loss, declaring that South Sudan \"probably haven't got anyone over 6-3.\"\n\nDeng responded on Instagram, calling out Arenas and Pierce for \"disrespectful\" and \"cruel\" comments.\n\n\"Moments like this are not for us to get upset and lash out,\" Deng wrote. \"Many Africans and Black people who embrace their African heritage are working hard to bring all Black people closer by educating and sharing stories and historic moments, teaching that we have much more in common than differences.\"\n\n\"Personally, I don't care much,\" Deng added. \"I would never trade places with anyone; being African is special. However, for young African and African American kids who admire and listen to Gilbert, these comments can make you think less of yourself and make the rest of the world think less of Africans.\"\n\nPierce and Arenas have since apologized for their remarks.\n\n\"I did my research over the weekend,\" Pierce said in his apology on FS1's \"Undisputed.\"\n\n\"I apologize. I'll be watching South Sudan more because they were exciting to watch, and they really got my attention. I didn't realize Luol Deng was from South Sudan, or Manute Bol. So, my lack of knowledge, I continue to apologize, you guys. But the reason they're at where they're at is because of Luol. He's put his own money into the basketball program ... this is a country that we're gonna be seeing a lot of.\"\n\n\"I respected u as a player and will as a coach (Sorry for my Disrespectful comments),\" Arenas wrote to Deng on Instagram.\n\nThe Olympic men's basketball game between Team USA and South Sudan is scheduled to be broadcast Wednesday at 2:45 p.m. ET on the USA Network. The matchup can also be streamed on Peacock, NBCOlympics.com (with a cable login) and Fubo, which covers USA Network, which offers a free trial.\n\nWatch every Olympic event on Peacock\n\nWatch the 2024 Paris Olympics live with Fubo (free trial)\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

For South Sudan Basketball Federation President Luol Deng, it was the culmination of everything that he and the team had worked so hard to achieve.\n\n\"When the national anthem was sung, you know, it just gave me goosebumps, and I realized that this was bigger than basketball,\" Deng told CNN Sport's Amanda Davies. \"And you know that the support is going to be there.\n\n\"This is really a credit to our fans who supported us from day one. And now, we have such a huge following and huge (fanbase) that we really believe that it's so inspiring because of the fans. The energy and everything that they're bringing is inspiring everybody else to pay attention to it.\"\n\nThe road to representation\n\nDeng is a former two-time NBA All-Star and spent 15 years in the league with the likes of the Chicago Bulls, Miami Heat and Los Angeles Lakers. He was born in Wau, in what is now South Sudan, before the country's independence. His family was displaced due to the Second Sudanese Civil War, moving to Egypt when Deng was a child before the family was granted political asylum in the UK, arriving in London, England.\n\nHe moved to the US at 14 to pursue a basketball career, going on to play college hoops at Duke before being drafted seventh overall by Chicago in 2004. He represented Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics in London.\n\nAfter his playing career concluded in 2019, Deng became heavily involved with allowing the country in which he was born to tell its story and be represented on the international stage. He currently serves as an assistant coach to the team alongside his role as president, having previously worked as head coach and player liaison.\n\nSouth Sudan officially gained independence from Sudan in 2011 following a referendum, making it the world's newest widely-recognized state. It has since experienced a civil war of its own that officially ended in 2018 and is listed as one of the least developed countries in the world by the United Nations.\n\nLike Deng, several of the players on the Olympic roster are refugees who were forced to leave South Sudan or were born elsewhere after their families had been displaced.\n\n\"We didn't just randomly put a team together. I've known a lot of these players since they were so young, and I've kept up with a lot of other players that I didn't know, but they were on my radar,\" he told CNN. \"And before I took over the president of the federation, I did imagine, 'What if those guys committed to play for our nation?' And this is the result because it's all come together.\n\n\"These guys believed that it could happen, and whoever didn't believe in the beginning,\n\nthat's fine. We got them on board with us because of, you know, what we've been able to do, and we're glad to have them.\"\n\nWith Deng as the driving force, the team has swiftly made history. It played its first competitive fixture in 2017 and qualified for the World Cup at the first time of asking, finishing 17th out of 32 teams at the tournament in 2023.\n\nAs the best-placed African team, South Sudan qualified for Olympics as the continent's sole representative and continued to show that it's far from a pushover by taking the historically dominant Team USA to the final buzzer in a warm-up game in London earlier this month.\n\n'We play to win'\n\nNo one can ever question Deng's commitment to the project - according to South Sudan head coach Royal Ivey, Deng has been funding the team out of his own pocket for four years.\n\nIt all appears to have been worth it, however, with Deng stating his pride at being part of \"nation building\" and that there is \"no better feeling\" than wearing a shirt that bears the name of South Sudan, though he wishes that he had gotten the opportunity to actually play for the team.\n\n\"For now, the polo is good,\" he laughed.\n\nAfter winning its first game and writing its name into the history books, speculation about how far this team can go has already ramped up, though Deng believes that the group's main goal has already been achieved.\n\n\"We've been able to tell a story that's really unique,\" the 39-year-old explained. \"We've worked very hard to get here. I think that we know that we are playing to show people how good we can be. I think the story itself is out there. People understand it, people know it. They can take it however they want to take it.\"\n\nThis is not a team that's here to make up the numbers, though.\n\n\"We play to win, we're not just happy to be here,\" said Deng. \"We feel like we do belong here, and we're representing the continent, and we want to represent it the right way. When people watch us play, they understand that, you know, we're well coached and we have great players.\"\n\nNext up for South Sudan in Paris is the tallest of tasks - a rematch against a Team USA that features the likes of LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Steph Curry. For the staff and players though, the message has always been the most important thing.\n\n\"I think we'll go out there and make a lot of people proud of how we play.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

However, they had no team due to a lack of talent and financial resources.\n\nDeng, who played in the Olympics for Great Britain because South Sudan had no team, aimed to change that. He used some of his NBA earnings to help build the team, as revealed by South Sudan coach Royal Ivey.\n\nIn a statement earlier, Ivey stated, \"Luol Deng has been funding South Sudan's national basketball program out of his pocket for four years. He pays for gyms, hotels, plane tickets, everything. Kudos to Luol and the staff. We wouldn't be able to put this team together without them.\"\n\nDeng also serves as the president of the South Sudanese Olympic team. During the telecast of the United States-Serbia game, Deng's former Heat teammate Dwyane Wade, who was providing color commentary, gave him a shoutout.\n\nWade mentioned how proud he was of Deng for his accomplishments in South Sudan. The team lost to the U.S. in an exhibition game 101-100 after leading at halftime. South Sudan had a chance to win the game on the final possession but missed.\n\nSo, let's find out the earnings and net worth of the former South Sudanese-British small forward.\n\nFor the curious, as per various reports, the professional basket player has a whopping net worth of $200 million in 2024 and he had made a sum of $166 million during his 15-years NBA career.\n\nDeng, who began his professional career with a $2 million contract, is now a hundred times richer.\n\nHis first signing with the Bulls was a $2.5 million per year deal for four years. During his time with the Bulls, Deng earned most of his accolades, including two NBA All-Star selections (2012, 2013) and an NBA All-Defensive Second Team nod (2012).\n\nAfter his tenure with the Bulls, Deng played for various teams before finally settling with the LA Lakers in 2016. His $72 million four-year contract with the Lakers made him the fourth-highest-paid player on the team.\n\nDespite being waived in 2018 due to underperformance, Deng continued to receive $5 million increments per season.\n\nIn 2014, he ventured into the investment market with his private fund company, which also includes investments in real estate such as hotels, resorts, condos etc.\n\nHis business ventures and his non-profit organization, the Luol Deng Foundation, have significantly contributed to his gross net worth of $200 million.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsgrail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsGrail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reena_choudhary@thesportsgrail.com", "name": "Reena Choudhary", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luol_Deng", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luol Deng"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Sudan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Sudan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Ivey", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Ivey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwyane_Wade", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dwyane Wade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Color commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Defensive_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Defensive Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://thesportsgrail.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/NBA-Player-Shares-Recording-Of-His-Girl-Going-Off-On-Him-Because-He-Chose-Practice-Over-Her.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776607", "eventUri": "eng-9776607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

After stints in Egypt, London, and finally New Jersey growing up, Deng emerged as a one-and-done star while at Duke, before being selected by the Phoenix Suns on behalf of the Bulls in the 2004 NBA Draft (Chicago already had acquired his draft rights).\n\nDeng himself has bankrolled Team South Sudan in recent seasons, as the club has developed an international program good enough to qualify for this year's Paris Olympics, according to Donatas Urbonas of Basket News. Given that he's earned some $166.1 million on the court -- and upwards of $125 million of it, per Kurt Badenhausen of Forbes -- he seemingly can afford the scratch.\n\nOn Sunday, during their first official game of the group phase, South Sudan vanquished Puerto Rico, 90-79 -- netting the new nation's first-ever Olympic victory. To be fair, it's only a 13-year-old country.\n\n\"We don't have the pleasure of having a gymnasium, dorms, and other facilities.

They don't see us getting delayed for seven hours in the airport while we're in Chad,\" head coach Royal Ivey reflected. During the NBA season, Ivey serves as an assistant coach with the Houston Rockets.\n\n\"Luol Deng has been funding this thing for four years out of his own pocket. He pays for gyms, hotels, plane tickets -- everything. Kudos to Luol and the staff.

The club almost beat a star-studded Team USA during an exhibition bout, at one point leading by as many as 16 points. South Sudan ultimately fell, 101-100, after South Sudan center Wenyen Gabriel couldn't get a shot off against his former Los Angeles Lakers teammate Anthony Davis, manning the middle for the other side.\n\nRead More: LeBron James Hits Game-Winner as Team USA Survives Matchup Against South Sudan\n\nDeng was a critical contributor on several chippy also-ran East squads in Chicago and later with the Miami Heat, during a 15-year career that also featured stops on the Cleveland Cavaliers, Lakers, and Minnesota Timberwolves. In his prime, he was a terrific, switchy defender and supplemental scorer. Across 902 regular season contests (828 starts), he posted averages of 14.8 points while slashing .456/.332/.769, 6.1 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 1.0 steals, and 0.5 blocks a night.\n\nNext up for South Sudan is a rematch against Team USA on Wednesday night.

For South Sudan Basketball Federation President Luol Deng, it was the culmination of everything that he and the team had worked so hard to achieve.\n\n\"When the national anthem was sung, you know, it just gave me goosebumps, and I realized that this was bigger than basketball,\" Deng told CNN Sport's Amanda Davies. \"And you know that the support is going to be there.\n\n\"This is really a credit to our fans who supported us from day one. And now, we have such a huge following and huge (fanbase) that we really believe that it's so inspiring because of the fans. The energy and everything that they're bringing is inspiring everybody else to pay attention to it.\"\n\nThe road to representation\n\nDeng is a former two-time NBA All-Star and spent 15 years in the league with the likes of the Chicago Bulls, Miami Heat and Los Angeles Lakers. He was born in Wau, in what is now South Sudan, before the country's independence. His family was displaced due to the Second Sudanese Civil War, moving to Egypt when Deng was a child before the family was granted political asylum in the UK, arriving in London, England.\n\nHe moved to the US at 14 to pursue a basketball career, going on to play college hoops at Duke before being drafted seventh overall by Chicago in 2004. He represented Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics in London.\n\nAfter his playing career concluded in 2019, Deng became heavily involved with allowing the country in which he was born to tell its story and be represented on the international stage. He currently serves as an assistant coach to the team alongside his role as president, having previously worked as head coach and player liaison.\n\nSouth Sudan officially gained independence from Sudan in 2011 following a referendum, making it the world's newest widely-recognized state. It has since experienced a civil war of its own that officially ended in 2018 and is listed as one of the least developed countries in the world by the United Nations.\n\nLike Deng, several of the players on the Olympic roster are refugees who were forced to leave South Sudan or were born elsewhere after their families had been displaced.\n\n\"We didn't just randomly put a team together. I've known a lot of these players since they were so young, and I've kept up with a lot of other players that I didn't know, but they were on my radar,\" he told CNN. \"And before I took over the president of the federation, I did imagine, 'What if those guys committed to play for our nation?' And this is the result because it's all come together.\n\n\"These guys believed that it could happen, and whoever didn't believe in the beginning,\n\nthat's fine. We got them on board with us because of, you know, what we've been able to do, and we're glad to have them.\"\n\nWith Deng as the driving force, the team has swiftly made history. It played its first competitive fixture in 2017 and qualified for the World Cup at the first time of asking, finishing 17th out of 32 teams at the tournament in 2023.\n\nAs the best-placed African team, South Sudan qualified for Olympics as the continent's sole representative and continued to show that it's far from a pushover by taking the historically dominant Team USA to the final buzzer in a warm-up game in London earlier this month.\n\n'We play to win'\n\nNo one can ever question Deng's commitment to the project - according to South Sudan head coach Royal Ivey, Deng has been funding the team out of his own pocket for four years.\n\nIt all appears to have been worth it, however, with Deng stating his pride at being part of \"nation building\" and that there is \"no better feeling\" than wearing a shirt that bears the name of South Sudan, though he wishes that he had gotten the opportunity to actually play for the team.\n\n\"For now, the polo is good,\" he laughed.\n\nAfter winning its first game and writing its name into the history books, speculation about how far this team can go has already ramped up, though Deng believes that the group's main goal has already been achieved.\n\n\"We've been able to tell a story that's really unique,\" the 39-year-old explained. \"We've worked very hard to get here. I think that we know that we are playing to show people how good we can be. I think the story itself is out there. People understand it, people know it. They can take it however they want to take it.\"\n\nThis is not a team that's here to make up the numbers, though.\n\n\"We play to win, we're not just happy to be here,\" said Deng. \"We feel like we do belong here, and we're representing the continent, and we want to represent it the right way. When people watch us play, they understand that, you know, we're well coached and we have great players.\"\n\nNext up for South Sudan in Paris is the tallest of tasks - a rematch against a Team USA that features the likes of LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Steph Curry. For the staff and players though, the message has always been the most important thing.\n\n\"I think we'll go out there and make a lot of people proud of how we play.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

A year later, Deng served as the face of Great Britain basketball at the London Olympics, proudly repaying a debt he was happy to own after that country granted his family political asylum from war-torn Sudan when Deng was a kid.\n\nAnd now, as the president of the South Sudan Basketball Federation and assistant coach on the team that improbably qualified for the Paris Olympics, Deng is drawing praise from every corner for his selflessness and relentless vision.\n\n\"I had to figure out how we make this happen. I can't say it's been easy. But it's been a lot of fun,\" Deng said. \"Growing up, I always wanted to see a South Sudan national team. I wanted to see somebody reaching out to players and encouraging them. I wanted that connection.\n\n\"It was an honor for me to represent Great Britain. But I always had that hunger for South Sudan. It's all amazing.\"\n\nDeng said those words during an April 2021 appearance on the Bulls Talk Podcast, shortly after South Sudan improbably advanced from the AfroBasket tournament with Deng serving as a coach. This was before Deng hired longtime friend Royal Ivey, the current national team coach for whom Deng serves as an assistant.\n\nThis was when Deng was personally bankrolling the entire national program, including the womens and under-18 teams. He paid for gym usage, hotel stays, plane tickets, you name it.\n\nAll for the love and pride for the world's youngest country, which is appearing in the Olympics for the first time.\n\n\"As a kid, watching the Olympics or the World Cup or AfroBasket, EuroBasket, I always felt there's something within you---you could call it pride---that changes you as a person, your love for your country when you see your flag, the ceremony, the induction. For some countries, like the U.S., people don't think about it because it's guaranteed,\" Deng said on the Bulls Talk Podcast. \"Think about it as you're from a country where you had civil war and when anything in sports was represented, you didn't represent that flag. You felt some type of away because of the unrest.\"\n\nNot many athletes get to be the face of two separate countries' Olympic efforts. And Deng's connection to Great Britain basketball was palpable at those 2012 London Olympics.\n\nAfter waiting in Egypt for five years for some country to grant his family political asylum from the civil war in his native Sudan, Deng arrived in the Brixton neighborhood of South London with aspirations to play soccer, called, obviously, football there.\n\nBut he quickly took to basketball in a country where resources for that sport were extremely limited. Deng never missed a national team commitment, often paying for his own insurance to protect his NBA contract while he played for the Bulls.\n\n\"I looked at basketball in the UK as a challenge that I could make better,\" Deng said.\n\nThat's Deng's second home. His first is South Sudan.\n\nDeng joked that he turned into both Scott Skiles and Tom Thibodeau when he first took over coaching. But now he has happily slipped into an assistant coaching role under Ivey, who guided South Sudan to a one-point loss to the U.S. in last week's exhibition in London.\n\nThat was another full-circle moment for Deng, who played in that same O2 Arena for the Bulls in an exhibition game and for Great Britain at those 2012 London Olympics.\n\nSouth Sudan opened its Paris Olympics journey with a historic victory over Puerto Rico.\n\n\"We couldn't get players in the beginning to commit, to see the bigger picture,\" Deng said back in 2021 on the Bulls Talk Podcast. \"But we kept pushing.\"",

Former NBA All-Star has been pivotal in country's rise to reach Olympics", "body": "South Sudan men's basketball has been one of the best Cinderella stories of the Olympics.\n\nThe world's youngest country only gained independence from Sudan in 2011. Despite a severe lack of funding and resources, its men's basketball program emerged as the best in Africa to qualify for the 2024 Paris Games.\n\nFirst-time qualifiers rarely experience any success on the Olympic stage. South Sudan has completely exceeded expectations already.\n\nIt came one defensive stop shy of upsetting the United States in an exhibition tune-up and secured its first-ever Olympic victory over Puerto Rico in its debut game.\n\nThe team is coached by former NBA player Royal Ivey. He has compiled a roster of several current and former NBA players, including Carlik Jones, Wenyen Gabriel, Marial Shayok, Peter Jok and JT Thor. Even the future of the program is in good hands, with 17-year-old Duke commit and projected 2025 NBA Draft lottery pick Khaman Maluach coming off the bench.\n\nBut South Sudan's meteoric rise in men's basketball would not be possible without former NBA All-Star Luol Deng. Here's why.\n\nDeng is the president of South Sudan's basketball federation.\n\nThe former two-time NBA All-Star was appointed as South Sudan's head coach in 2020 and held that position for the AfroBasket Qualifiers in 2021.\n\nAfter one tournament, Deng was promoted to his current position and named Ivey -- who has 20 years of NBA experience as a player and assistant coach -- the head coach of the country's senior men's national team.\n\nUnder Deng and Ivey's leadership, South Sudan qualified for the Olympics for the first time in the country's young history.\n\nWith the team in the spotlight after nearly taking down the USA in an exhibition game and earning its first-ever Olympic win over Puerto Rico, it was revealed that Deng was funding part of the program out of his own pocket to give it the best chance to succeed.\n\nFollowing South Sudan's historic Olympic win over Puerto Rico, Ivey spoke on how Deng's contributions to the country's men's basketball program made the team's unprecedented rise possible. South Sudan has no indoor basketball courts nationwide.\n\n\"We don't have the pleasure of having a gymnasium, dorms, and other facilities. We had a tough training camp in Rwanda, then traveled to Spain, moving around a lot, taking long flights, and giving up exit rows to my seven-footers.\n\n\"These are the things people don't talk about. They don't see us getting delayed for seven hours in the airport while we're in Chad,\" Ivey told BasketNews.\n\n\"Luol Deng has been funding this thing for four years out of his own pocket,\" Ivey admitted.\n\n\"He pays for gyms, hotels, plane tickets -- everything. Kudos to Luol and the staff. We wouldn't have been able to put this team together without them.\"\n\nBeyond Deng's financial contributions, the 15-year NBA veteran has also been attributed to organizing local camps in South Sudan to help identify and maximize talent. 17-year-old phenom Maluach mentioned Deng's basketball camp as a moment he started playing the sport competitively.\n\n\"The history is continuing to be written,\" Ivey said after South Sudan's victory.\n\n\"This is the first debut, the first win, and the youngest team in the youngest nation -- 13 years independent. I keep on saying this is a great story. This is a legacy. We're trailblazers, and we're going to continue to ride this out, see what happens in the next couple of games, and have fun with it.\"", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news",

Alas, it's led by two of our favorite people in the sport, gentlemen who have been bringing smiles to us and all who love the game for almost as long as SLAM has been around: Luol Deng and Royal Ivey.\n\nDeng, who most of you should know from his longtime NBA career, if not the many remarkable steps in his life path before or since, is the crux of this story. I learned about Luol around 2000, when his older brother, Ajou, was a highly touted recruit at UConn and agents started whispering about a younger brother they called \"Louie\" who would be even better than Ajou. By late 2002, I was hanging out at Blair Academy for a feature on then-Blair senior Luol and his teammate, Queens' legend and future NBAer Charlie Villanueva. Luol was certainly one of the most impressive teenagers I've ever spoken to (as if writing about high schoolers for SLAM wasn't enough exposure, now I have a teen of my own), and he came with a breathtaking backstory.\n\nBorn in the southern part of Sudan when it was still one country in the throes of a civil war, Luol and his mother and siblings fled the country for a safer life in Egypt in 1990, and in '94, they reunited with his politician father, Aldo, in London. Luol spent some formative years in the South London neighborhood of Brixton, picking up a proper love for Arsenal and football but also hooping all the time. And growing. Luol followed Ajou's footsteps in coming to America for prep school, which is how we found him at Blair. And he wasn't just a nice kid playing some ball while getting a quality education to set himself up for a college scholarship; he was the second-best player in his high school class. Literally, pretty much every 2003 high school ranking system or all-star game had a No. 1 and No. 2 player. Luol was No. 2. No. 1 was LeBron James.\n\nDeng went to Duke for one season, leading the Blue Devils to the Final Four (where they lost by 1 point to Villanueva's UConn team, ironically). Deng was the seventh pick in the '04 Draft and began a 10-year stint with the Bulls that featured two All-Star appearances, two seasons leading the NBA in minutes per game and a ton of playoff games. This was mostly the Thibs-Derrick Rose Bulls, and Deng was the engine that made them go. He played five more seasons after Chicago to give himself a tidy 15-year career in which he was absolutely beloved by his coaches and teammates and always a pleasure to chat with in locker rooms (especially if I led with Arsenal check-ins).\n\nDeng was not satisfied just being a star on the court, though. Off it, he created the Luol Deng Foundation and was regularly going back to London and Africa to take part in various charitable efforts and basketball events designed to grow the game. In 2021, he was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire, which is one of those very British things that, at least in Great Britain, means that he should be presented as Luol Deng OBE; becoming \"Sir Luol Deng\" might happen in the future. At the same time that he was making his mark with charitable work in his adopted home of England, Deng was reigniting his relationship with his real home of South Sudan. He'd been named President of the South Sudan Basketball Federation in 2019 and began spending more time there. \"Imagine your family fleeing a country and going to find life somewhere else,\" Deng says in a mini-doc about the team qualifying for the Olympics that was shared with SLAM. \"And instead of you being in that other country and forgetting about South Sudan and enjoying your professional basketball career, you're actually committing to come back and play for that same country that you fled because of the war, and you're the one now bringing all this positivity to it.\"\n\nBeautifully said, Luol. Unsurprisingly for a country of less than 13 million that has been around only 13 years -- and suffered through internal fighting and development challenges the whole time -- building a basketball program was not a priority. But there is a heritage of the sport there and in the people who come from there, beginning with famed NBA shot blocker Manute Bol (who originally inspired Deng and his brothers) and continuing with Deng, former Syracuse star Kueth Duany, Manute's son (and SLAM fave) Bol Bol and heading into the future with young stars like Khaman Maluach, a 17-year-old incoming freshman at Duke who is projected to be a top-five pick in the 2025 NBA Draft.\n\nSince his appointment as president of the SSBF, Deng has instilled structure around the team and sought to get the best players from the South Sudanese diaspora suiting up for the country of their roots. Things coalesced last summer when South Sudan, playing in its first-ever FIBA World Cup, earned an Olympic berth by finishing as the highest-ranked team from Africa.\n\nIf Deng has been the SSBF's Jerry West -- the retired legend now building a roster with guile and conviction -- Royal Ivey has been their Pat Riley, a retired role player turned motivational master as head coach.\n\nIvey, currently an assistant coach with the Houston Rockets, has been on my radar since 1999, when he led what was once unquestionably the #SLAMfam's favorite high school, Queens' (NY) Cardozo (shout out Ronnie Z and Coach Naclerio!), to an NYC PSAL title, earning MVP honors in a 57-47 win at Madison Square Garden that gave Naclerio, now the winningest coach in New York State public school history, his very first title.\n\nAfter graduating from Cardozo with that '99 title on his CV, Ivey spent a post-grad year at Blair where he played alongside...a young Luol Deng. \"Luol has been like my little brother since I met him his freshman year at Blair,\" says Ivey over Zoom from Kigali, Rwanda, where the South Sudan team is holding pre-Olympic training camp. \"I was older and I wanted to protect him, but he was also motivation to me. I was 17 years old and he was 13, waking me up at 6 a.m. to get in the gym. Then we were in the same draft class and we'd hang out in Chicago and stay in touch. Later on, I worked his camps in London.\"\n\nIvey was a 6-3 2-guard who couldn't shoot all that well, but he always played hard -- especially on defense -- and he was a great teammate. He played four years at the University of Texas, reaching the '03 Final Four and making such a mark with his intangibles that he was the 37th pick in the '04 NBA Draft despite four-year college averages of 8 points, 3 rebounds and 2 assists per game.\n\nIvey's numbers were even lower in the pros, but he lasted a decade in the League and then, after his final stint with the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2014, OKC GM Sam Presti asked if Ivey would serve as an assistant with their G League team, the Blue. Ivey's been on the coaching grind ever since.\n\n\"The way I got this job was crazy,\" Ivey shares today. \"I was watching Luol coach [South Sudan] on Instagram. I'm coaching in New York. [Then-Knicks head coach David] Fizdale gets fired. I was looking for a new opportunity and I was intrigued about helping Luol move forward. I told him I'd love to be part of the staff. You don't have to be a part, Luol told me. I want you to run this thing.\"\n\nAnd with that, the two -- friends through two wild decades in the business of basketball -- were off and running, coming out of the pandemic with a fast playing style and the buy-in of more and more good players. South Sudan has plenty of work to do as a nation, but when the basketball team, nicknamed the Bright Stars, plays and wins, there's a national pride that is not typically on display. \"We're here to put South Sudan on the map,\" Ivey says. \"We're here to heal. To bring a country together through sports is something life-changing. I've been there and touched the ground and touched the people.\"\n\nAdds Deng in the mini-doc: \"I want these guys to realize what sports does for the country. Sports is gonna be the vehicle of unity.\"\n\nClearly, there's a full-length movie to be made here. I know I'll watch it.", "source": {"uri": "slamonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SLAM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "deyscha_smith@slamonline.com", "name": "Deyscha Smith", "type": "author",

Its first international impact came in AfroBasket 2021 when it finished seventh out of 16 countries.\n\nTwo years later, when Ivey and Deng acquired more talent to upgrade the roster, South Sudan finished 17th in the FIBA World Cup, qualifying for Paris 2024 as the highest-finishing African country. South Sudan is a team filled with former NCAA players, some who have played in the NBA or overseas. JT Thor is in the Charlotte Hornets' system. Marial Shayok played briefly with the Philadelphia 76ers and averaged nearly 20 points per game last year in the NBA G-League.

South Sudan beat Puerto Rico, 90-79, and the U.S. knocked off Serbia, 110-84. The win marked the welcome return of Kevin Durant, who led the team with 23 points on 8-of-9 shooting, but did not play in the previous matchup with South Sudan.\n\nThe U.S. trailed that game by as many as 16 points and head coach Steve Kerr laid into the team for being outsprinted by the opponent for layups and open jump shots.\n\n\"We have appropriate fear. We know we can't just sleepwalk through any game and feel like you're going to win,\" Team USA's Steph Curry said of Wednesday's rematch with South Sudan.\n\nThe Bright Stars are shooting for a second consecutive Summer Games win, while the Americans are chasing a fifth consecutive gold in the Olympics.\n\nFormer Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers forward Luol Deng is funding the South Sudanese basketball program. The country itself is only 13 years old.\n\n\"Luol Deng has been funding this thing for four years out of his own pocket. He pays for gyms, hotels, plane tickets -- everything. Kudos to Luol and the staff. We wouldn't have been able to put this team together without them,\" South Sudan coach Royal Ivey said.\n\nIvey is a current assistant coach for the Houston Rockets and focuses on spreading out defenses with 3-point shooting and starting possessions off of missed-shot rebounds defensively to beat the opponent back down the court. The Bright Stars made 14 3-pointers against the U.S.\n\nWhile Kerr can mix-and-match with tricks available like bringing Durant off the bench or not playing Celtics MVP candidate Jayson Tatum for one solitary second against Serbia, Ivey doesn't have any current NBA players on his roster.\n\nWhile James and Curry and other Team USA stars said they would be leaving Olympic Village in Paris' dorm-room like arrangements for the creature comforts of hotels and villas to which they're accustomed, South Sudan doesn't have an indoor basketball facility.\n\nBright Stars center Wenyen Gabriel, a Sudanese refugee from the Civil War that led to the creation of South Sudan, said most of the roster was far more concerned with whether they would have a country than a basketball team.\n\nBut Deng, himself a refugee from Egypt who eventually played at Duke, made it possible and the current club is committed to making the two-time All-Star's dream of \"changing the narrative\" around South Sudan a reality.\n\n\"Knowing that there's a bunch of kids, a bunch of youth, that are from South Sudan that look up to us, that are inspired by what we do, that think that maybe they can make it next -- for me to go represent the country, be one of the first group is just an honor to me,\" he said.\n\nGabriel, who had a chance for the game-winner in the exhibition loss, has played for the Lakers and Clippers and shooting guard Marial Shayok was a second-round pick of the Philadelphia 76ers in 2019. He scored 24 points against Team USA this month and plays professionally in China.\n\nKerr said not to read into the roster comparison or a narrative that South Sudan lacks the firepower to match up with NBA All-Stars after \"they came within one shot of beating us.\"\n\n\"I'm really glad that we played them so we can feel their speed and their 3-point shooting ability and feel how good they are,\" said Kerr. \"We'll be much better prepared, but doesn't guarantee anything.\"", "source": {"uri": "kansas.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wichita Eagle"}, "authors": [{"uri":

See the full US Olympic men's basketball schedule here. And see today's Olympic highlights here.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about how to watch the Olympics\n\nAfter finishing 17th in the 2023 FIBA World Cup to become Africa's top finisher, South Sudan qualified for their first Olympics in men's basketball.\n\nSouth Sudan, which gained independence in 2011 after being engulfed in civil war and had violence continue in the world's youngest country until 2020, joined the Olympic games for the first time in 2016.\n\nThe Bright Stars upended Puerto Rico, 90-79, to record their first men's basketball Olympic victory during these Games behind 19 points from Charlik Jones.\n\n16-year NBA veteran and two-time NBA All-Star Luol Deng has funded the Bright Stars for the past four years, paying for hotels, gym fees, and plane tickets. Deng was born in 1985 in Wau, South Sudan, and fled the country in 1990 due to the civil war. He moved from London to New Jersey in 1999 and was ranked as the second-highest rated high school recruit in 2003, behind LeBron James. He returned to South Sudan for the first time in 2010.\n\nDeng serves as the President of the South Sudanese Basketball Federation. Early in his tenure, a lanky 13-year-old named Khaman Maluach first picked up a basketball at Luol Deng Foundation camp in Kampala, Uganda. Five years later, the Duke commit will be one of the talented players donning the South Sudan jersey.\n\n\"I want to help the growth of the game, but I want to use basketball to change the narrative and the stories of South Sudan, but also find a way to bring communities along and for everyone to get something inspirational behind it,\" Deng told ESPN.\n\nKevin Durant returned after missing the exhibition contests with a calf strain, leading the Americans off the bench with 23 points, 21 of which came in the first half. LeBron James posted another strong effort, finishing with 21 points, 9 assists, and 7 rebounds.\n\nNeither Tatum nor Indiana Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton entered the game against Serbia, even as it turned into a blowout.\n\n\"[Tatum will] make his mark,\" said US men's coach Steve Kerr. \"Our guys know the key to this whole thing is to put all the NBA stuff in the rear-view mirror and just win six games. Jayson is the ultimate pro and champion and he handled it well, and he's going to be ready for the next game.\"\n\nHead coach Royal Ivey: The 42-year-old Ivey played 10 seasons in the NBA, averaging 3.3 points, 1.1 rebounds, and 1.0 assists. He has been an NBA assistant since 2016 and currently coaches for the Rockets. Ivey will lead South Sudan's first-ever Olympic campaign in men's basketball.\n\nWenyen Gabriel: The 27-year-old center who played high school basketball at Wilbraham & Monson Academy in western Mass. made his NBA debut in the 2019-20 season. Gabriel has played for seven NBA teams in five seasons, averaging 4.4 points and 3.4 rebounds.\n\nCarlik Jones: Jones was named NBA G-League MVP in the 2022-23 season. At the NBA level, he has played 12 career games across the 2021-22 and 2022-23 seasons with the Mavericks, Nuggets, and Bulls, averaging two points per game. In a 101-100 exhibition loss to Team USA on July 20, Jones had a triple-double with 15 points, 11 assists, and 11 rebounds.\n\nJT Thor: The 21-year-old power forward for the Hornets was drafted 37th in 2021. In 165 games over three seasons, Thor has averaged 3.2 points and 2.3 rebounds. He scored 14 points against Team USA, including a go-ahead 3 with 20 seconds remaining.\n\nMarial Shayok: Selected 54th in the 2019 draft by the 76ers, the former Virginia Cavalier and Iowa State Cyclone appeared in four games for Philadelphia in 2020, tallying 11 total points and seven rebounds. Shayok thrived from behind the arc against Team USA, scoring a team-high 24 points on six 3s.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [],

Central to this inspiring journey is Luol Deng, whose presidency of the South Sudan Basketball Federation has heralded a new era for the country's sports development. Deng's mission extends beyond building a competitive basketball program; he envisions using the sport as a catalyst for unity and national growth.\n\nAs Deng reflects, \"Our culture has been put second to everything where people don't understand the kind of people that we are and what we strive for.\" Despite enduring a prolonged civil war, Deng emphasizes that most South Sudanese had little part in it, and their vibrant culture of mutual support and community has often been overlooked. His goal is to leverage basketball to highlight this positive cultural identity, with the hope that, given peace and time, South Sudan's talent and unity will gain global recognition.\n\nSouth Sudan's men's basketball team has emerged as one of the most compelling Cinderella stories of the Olympics, making significant strides with the backing of the South Sudanese government and Deng's strategic vision. In an interview with Forbes.com, Deng elaborates on the program's rapid progress despite limited infrastructure and resources. His efforts have not only created a promising pipeline for future stars, both domestically and abroad but have also elevated South Sudan's standing on the international stage. Through relentless perseverance and collaboration, Deng and his team have inspired hope and unity among South Sudan's people, setting a powerful example for the entire continent.\n\nLuol Deng's presidency of the South Sudan Basketball Federation marked the beginning of a transformative era for South Sudanese basketball. Reflecting on the start of the journey four years ago, Deng stated, \"We had an election, I won and was elected as the president of the Basketball Federation and I just had to come up with a plan on how to be different in order for the federation to move forward.\" Deng's vision was not just about immediate success but about laying the groundwork for a long-lasting impact on South Sudanese basketball.\n\nCentral to Deng's vision was identifying and cultivating talent, a process that began with his experience running basketball camps since he got drafted in 2004. \"I always kept an eye on South Sudanese and African players in general and I was able to do camps all over where we have a lot of diaspora and a lot of young kids who are playing basketball,\" Deng explained.\n\n\"Every time I went back home I was able to see the talent and the potential of it,\" he added. Deng's professional career provided him with the knowledge and skills to build a team capable of competing at the highest level. His experience in camps enabled him to lay the groundwork for developing the next generation of talent, ensuring a steady pipeline of athletes.\n\nBuilding a basketball program in South Sudan came with significant challenges, particularly in terms of infrastructure and resources. Deng reflected on the shared struggles across African federations: \"I think that a lot of African countries and a lot of federations share the same kind of struggle, just across the continent in many countries you can see the lack of facilities but it is also the lack of belief and the lack of support.\" Despite these obstacles, Deng was determined to create a program that would inspire both players and supporters, demonstrating that basketball could be a catalyst for unity and development within the nation.\n\nA pivotal step in building this program was gaining the trust and commitment of players. Deng recognized the importance of creating an environment where players felt valued and supported. \"I had guys from the beginning that committed right away, they understood what I was trying to tell them and they wanted that opportunity also to give something back and to have something to be proud of, and from our first tournament, I knew right away that this is bigger than basketball.\" This tournament reinforced what they were building and was the bedrock of their vision, showcasing something greater than just the sport itself.\n\nTo cultivate a thriving basketball culture, Deng emphasized the importance of building a supportive environment that prioritized the players' well-being and development. He explained, \"The players are the number one priority in our program in terms of listening to them and trying to fix any of the issues that we have had in the past.\" Along with cultivating a culture that values the players, Deng understood the need for buy-in from players, including those in the diaspora who had the option of playing for other countries.\n\nHe noted, \"Players talk about how you treat athletes and how you treat everyone within your program from top to bottom. I think everybody in our federation knows where our heart is - there is no pretending within our federation, our main goal is to get this program to be successful, to unify us and also to put a message out there that we are for South Sudan and we are for the continent and that is what is in our mind.\" This culture of openness and commitment helped foster a sense of responsibility among players. Deng noted that \"players convince each other and also encourage each other and recruit each other and do it together, and once somebody is in our program they see it from the inside. The impact that it is making is beyond basketball and for us - we welcome those that come into our circle and have the same mindset.\"\n\nDeng's commitment to building a successful program has started to yield impressive results on the international stage. Initially, he faced limited resources, but his persistence began to change perceptions. \"In the beginning, we didn't really know what direction we were going, but once we started showing the capability and the potential of it, our government has been very supportive,\" Deng reflected. He praised the backing received from the South Sudanese government, stating, \"I think that our government can be proud of what they have done so far, and also be an example hopefully to a lot of other African countries. Our government has supported us and our youth program, and I think in the future because of what we did, they will support a lot of other talent just across the board, not just in sports.\"\n\nThis governmental support, coupled with the program's success, has been instrumental in changing the narrative around African sports development and showcasing what can be achieved with dedication and hard work. Deng added, \"What we have been able to do, I think a lot of people believe that it could be done across the board, a lot of people are motivated. I always encourage everyone to somehow start. A lot of times -- and you see this a lot on the continent -- people ask for support without really putting in the necessary work to show that the program or whatever they are trying to achieve can be successful and that by itself is challenging.\"\n\nReflecting on the collective effort behind their achievements, Deng remarked, \"I would say I did commit to really making this happen, but there is no way that I could've kept going if the players and the staff and everyone hadn't bought into it. With the success that we've had, we were able to gain more support, not only from sponsors but also from individuals who supported us and also the government and our President Salva Kiir Mayardit by supporting us. Now, today I can sit here and say that it has been a collective effort to get this far and we are very proud of that.\"\n\nThe journey of the South Sudan men's basketball team to the Paris 2024 Olympics has been characterized by extraordinary accomplishments and an overwhelming wave of support. Their near-upset against the USA, missing victory by a single point, demonstrated their ability to compete on the global stage\n\nThe team's Olympic debut was highlighted by a historic win against Puerto Rico, which saw them overcome a slow start to secure a 90-79 victory. This win was not just a triumph on the court but another powerful statement of South Sudan's arrival at basketball's highest level. As they prepare to face the USA once again, the team's focus remains sharp, despite the considerable media attention and praise they've received.\n\nDeng reflected on the feedback and growing recognition of African basketball, noting, \"Just in general, the feedback -- people believing in what we are doing, people really acknowledging African basketball and how far it's come -- has been very positive. Growing up and watching the Dream Team take on Angola or other African countries, often winning by 50 points, it's clear the game has evolved. The success of any African country is seen as a victory for the entire continent. For me, it's crucial to remind my players to stay grounded amidst the praise. We must maintain the same hunger that brought us here, challenging and influencing each other to stay focused on our goals.\"\n\nSouth Sudan will take on Team USA again tonight, with Deng acknowledging the challenge, saying, \"We know that it is a difficult task but to come this far and to be respected and to play the best in the world, is a good place to be in and it is a good test to have. We are looking forward to playing as hard as we can again and we'll see how it goes\"\n\nAs South Sudan continues its Olympic journey, the team remains committed to changing the narrative about their country and showcasing their talent. Deng emphasized the importance of using their platform to inspire and educate, stating, \"To be a role model, you don't need to fake it. We are playing not only for South Sudan but also to change perceptions about our talent and potential. Our success is a responsibility we embrace, and we hope to see South Sudan excel in other areas as well. By continuing to shine, we encourage others and reinforce the progress we've made.\"\n\nThe team's focus is on taking each game as it comes and maintaining their momentum. Deng added, \"We need to keep taking it step by step. Despite the negativity and scepticism we've faced, we see every challenge as an opportunity to educate and prove ourselves. We're here to compete and make our people proud, but we've already achieved so much by raising awareness of our story. Now, we must continue to advance, game by game, and show the world what we're capable of.\"\n\nDeng's vision extends beyond immediate achievements, aiming to set a precedent for other African nations. He is optimistic that the success of the South Sudan Basketball Federation will encourage similar initiatives across the continent, emphasizing that substantial progress requires both vision and dedication. His commitment to excellence and the collective effort of all involved promises a bright future for South Sudanese basketball.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luol_Deng", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luol Deng"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Sudan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Sudan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cultural identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinderella (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diaspora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_basketball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national basketball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salva_Kiir_Mayardit", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salva Kiir Mayardit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angola", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angola"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Angola"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Self-Help", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Self-Help", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66aa2345862a643b8d2735c3/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1987,1118,x0,y13,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776607", "eventUri": "eng-9776607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Now South Sudan's Young Team Is in the Olympics.", "body": "When South Sudan's young basketball team took to the court for an exhibition game against America's basketball royalty, there were few expectations that they could hold on against the likes of LeBron James and Stephen Curry. Then they lost by just one point, 101-100, stunning not only their loyal followers, but also the team's players, who had grown up revering the N.B.A. stars.\n\nThe South Sudanese will face the United States again Wednesday, this time at the Paris Olympics, and with the Americans now on notice, the odds are distinctly against the African team. But for many of their fans in Africa and elsewhere, that is beside the point.\n\nThe way they see it, it is a bit of a miracle that a team of refugees and their descendants, whose home country is just 13 years old and has suffered through devastating wars, made it to the Olympics at all.\n\nDespite having no place of their own to train, the team won the only slot open to Africa for men's basketball. They already beat the odds by not only coming within a hair of winning against the Americans -- James made the winning layup with just 8 seconds remaining -- but also by beating Puerto Rico in their first match of the Games in Paris.\n\n\"South Sudan and its people are known all over the world now,\" said Aninyesi Tereza Mark, a 33-year-old university lecturer in the South Sudanese capital, Juba. \"We are very proud of them and we are happy.\"\n\nSouth Sudan is the world's youngest country. It won its freedom from neighboring Sudan only in 2011, and since then, has suffered through a civil war that has claimed the lives of some 400,000 people and displaced more than 4 million. While a shaky peace deal has been in place since 2018, inter-communal violence persists. Poverty and corruption are endemic.\n\nNone of the members of the basketball team -- nicknamed the Bright Stars -- live in the country; many of their parents fled its wars before and after independence.\n\nStill, their accomplishments so far have offered a modicum of hope to those who have remained behind.\n\nMs. Mark, who has been watching the games with her four children and brother, said, \"Our image is not positive outside\" the country, but \"they made it to the top.\"\n\nSouth Sudan's president, Salva Kiir, weighed in, gushing about the near-win against the American team, and posting the score on X along with this message: \"Your impressive performance has inspired many open-minded people across the globe to get to know that South Sudan as a country has more to offer the world.\"\n\nThe team's road to Paris was not an easy one.\n\nAlthough it was created after independence, South Sudan's men's basketball team only began its dizzying ascent in 2019, after Luol Deng, a former N.B.A. player, became the president of the South Sudan Basketball Federation. Deng, whose family fled to Egypt in 1990 during the war of independence and later moved to Britain, used his own money to fund and corral the team.\n\nIn 2021, he was joined in the endeavor by Royal Ivey, who was then an assistant coach for the Brooklyn Nets. In an interview, Ivey said he had called Deng to propose working as an assistant coach, but Deng offered him the head coaching job instead, and he accepted.\n\nHe was attracted by the idea of helping South Sudanese people put aside their differences, and nurturing new talent.\n\n\"We are blazing a new path for the nation,\" said Ivey, now an assistant coach with the Houston Rockets. \"Through sports, you can bring a country together, heal, give hope and inspire.\"\n\nTogether, Deng and Ivey began to bring together players of South Sudanese descent.\n\nIn some places, the only practice venues they could get featured concrete courts with no gyms, and in one case, a flooded field. Many players, spread across the globe in pro leagues, brought vastly different styles.\n\nWith no home court in South Sudan, the team assembled ahead of the Olympics to train at the BK Arena in the Rwandan capital, Kigali. When the arena lights went off for a short time on a recent afternoon, some players laughed, saying it was par for the course, given their previous experiences.\n\n\"I have never been a part of something where you have to travel to a different country just to have some resources,\" said Ivey. \"This whole thing has been humbling.\"\n\nStill, over time, Ivey and several players said they managed to build camaraderie. Their big break came last September, when the team qualified for the Olympics by beating Angola at the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup in the Philippines.\n\nThat did not stop the naysayers.\n\nBefore and after the Olympics warm-up match against the United States, two former N.B.A. players from the United States, Paul Pierce and Gilbert Arenas, belittled the team, suggesting, among other things, that they were not tall enough to win.\n\n\"Almost lost to some Africans,\" Arenas said dismissively after the nail-biter of a game.\n\nThe comments generated widespread public condemnation, including from Deng, who said the remarks were \"disrespectful and cruel\" and \"showed misinformation and a lack of research.\" The two players later apologized for their comments.\n\nAlthough some team members have been in the N.B.A., none currently play for an N.B.A. team and many of them have gone undrafted. Some play in leagues in countries including Australia, Canada, China and Serbia. The roster includes rising stars like Khaman Maluach, a 17-year-old, 7-foot-2 player who grew up in Uganda, and is an incoming freshman at Duke University.\n\nIn interviews, team members admitted to challenges, including sloppy play when new athletes joined. But they said they learned to embrace their different playing styles, with a goal of making their homeland proud.\n\n\"I am here not just to be a basketball player but also to be a brother,\" said Carlik Jones, a point guard who recorded a historic triple-double during the friendly game against the U.S. and scored 19 points against Puerto Rico.\n\n\"It's more than just basketball.\"\n\nDespite their differences, the team's players also share similarities. Many of them said they were united by their experience of being migrants and the financial hardships, language barriers, discrimination and social isolation that can come with it. At least some harbor lofty ambitions of playing full-time in the N.B.A.\n\nNuni Omot, who was named the Most Valuable Player at the Basketball Africa League last year, said he is thrilled about being at the Olympics, and especially excited that his mother plans to be in the stands. He said she worked two jobs while raising him and a brother in Minnesota and said she always had wanted to see Paris.\n\nBut he is also proud of what the team is accomplishing for South Sudan, saying he expected their successes to challenge the negative stereotypes that many have about his country or other African nations.\n\n\"Nobody can deny that we made it to the biggest stage on earth,\" he said. \"Everybody's going to be tuned into it.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Ivey",

This sounds like a pretty usual practice for professional basketball players. But in that case, we were talking about something majorly unique.\n\nPrior to that, the former Los Angeles Lakers superstar never walked in his homeland, forced to escape with his family as a refugee - just like the rest of the South Sudanese team, which is all older than the actual country of South Sudan - to the United States, growing up in Massachusetts.\n\nThanks to the collaboration of the UNHCR, the promising power forward managed to come back to his country, finally sovereign after gaining independence in 2011. He told the whole story right after the narrow defeat to Team USA in London, a few days ago.\n\n\"I'm happy we were able to represent our country. A lot of people around the world don't know what South Sudan was, but today we were able to represent our country with pride, put up a good fight, and show them the potential of our country. It was a proud moment for a lot of people\", he first said.\n\nSouth Sudan recently wrote history once again, winning for the first time on the Olympic stage by getting their revenge against Puerto Rico, which beat them in the opener of the FIBA Basketball World Cup 2023.\n\nTheir climb up to success, helped by the astonishing work done by Luol Deng, who decided to give back to his people what he couldn't fulfill during his professional career when the South Sudanese basketball program wasn't even imaginable, is a history-making lesson.\n\nIn only a matter of few years, they went from qualifying for their first-ever FIBA AfroBasket to the Olympic Games in Paris 2024, arriving in the Eiffel Tower's shadow by being the best-classified African team in the competition, in their debut.\n\nListening to Wenyen Gabriel's words makes these achievements even more powerful. \"We don't have any indoor basketball courts in our country. We are a bunch of refugees who come together for a few weeks out of the year, trying our best, playing against some of the best players ever. This is bigger than basketball for us\", he stressed out.\n\n\"To show people that we can compete and understand that hoops in Africa are something for the future. It's only a matter of time before the next generation gets built up. There are millions of people in the country who are no different from any of us. We were able to represent us and get to this level, based on these opportunities\", Wenyen Gabriel continued, emphasizing the concept of opportunity.\n\nHis words reached audiences worldwide, giving a whole other power to South Sudan's basketball story. And going back to his visit two years ago. \"There are some tall kids back in the village, I remember I came back home to South Sudan to visit them, and they didn't have any opportunities. Seven feet tall and they're herding cows\", he said.\n\n\"Some people around the world don't have the opportunity to play basketball for a living, to go shoot hoops, to go fish for food, do different things to survive. Today was an example and something to bring us together. We've been a war-torn country, been through a lot, every single year a lot of bloodshed. For us to have something to have together, to stop looking at each other differently\", he added.\n\nTonight, the circle goes full way, as South Sudan crosses paths once again with Team USA. On the other side of the floor, he will meet once again LeBron James, with whom he shared a season with the Los Angeles Lakers, which made his visit to Juba possible back in 2022.\n\nRight after that friendly encounter in Great Britain, the King spoke highly of the 27-year-old. \"Wenyen [Gabriel] is like a little brother of mine. I had a lot of great time in Los Angeles. Fun guy, a charismatic guy. He loves the game\", Team USA's flag-bearer said.\n\n\"I told him tonight how much, continuing his journey in the game of basketball, It's always great to have someone in his home country to be able to play professional basketball. Wenyen [Gabriel] is an inspiration to all of his brothers and sisters from where he's from\", LeBron James continued.\n\nThis time it isn't only a friendly game in London, but a five-interlaced rings matchup to write history once again at the Olympic stage. Wenyen Gabriel has come a long way.\n\nVisualizza questo post su Instagram\n\nUn post condiviso da UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency (@refugees)\n\nPHOTO CREDIT: FIBA Basketball\n\nRead all the latest news from the basketball world", "source": {"uri": "eurohoops.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eurohoops"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cesare_milanti@eurohoops.net", "name": "Cesare Milanti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.eurohoops.net/2024/07/82fd5337-wenyen-gabriel-south-sudan-puerto-rico-olympic-games-paris-2024-600x314.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776607", "eventUri": "eng-9776607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

It backfires", "text": "Social media is full of seemingly clever travel hacks for everything from getting cheaper tickets and avoiding the dreaded middle seat to getting more stuff on the plane when you\u2019re supposed to be traveling light. But it doesn\u2019t usually show when hacks go terribly wrong. One trick seen all over TikTok is the travel pillow hack. Usually, travelers will debone (aka remove the stuffing from) a pillow and restuff it with soft items, like clothing and underwear. Now, their pillow doubles as a place to rest their head and an extra storage item. This trick is especially handy for people whose plane ticket only allows them a carry-on or checked bag. (One person even used their empty Auntie Anne\u2019s pretzel bag to store her extra belongings before a flight.) But some people take things a bit too far, as is the case with this now-viral passenger. A hack turns into a \u2018fail\u2019 In a viral TikTok, nearly a million people witnessed a man get in serious trouble for taking this hack to an exaggerated level. \u201cStop letting these sites, social media, give you tips and tricks because sometimes it\u2019s not gonna work,\u201d Natasha (@natashaorganic) said in the video. A man flying with Frontier Airlines (one of those budget airlines that you have to pay extra for a carry-on bag) tried being slick and seemingly brought a whole pillow on the plane that was stuffed with clothes and other items which he insisted was \u201csimply just a pillowcase.\u201d The Frontier employees clocked exactly what he was trying to do (bring on more items than he was allowed) and purportedly gave him a chance to pay for his pseudo-carry-on so he could still board the plane. Most people in this situation would take the L and pay the $54 to $99 fee (with Frontier how much you pay can vary based on when you pay, the earlier the cheaper). Instead, Natasha said this man didn\u2019t pay right away and waited until the plane finished boarding and closed doors to finally pay. Well, at that point, it\u2019s too late. Once plane doors are closed, it\u2019s highly unlikely you\u2019re getting on that flight. \u201cWe gave you your chance, and you didn\u2019t pay for it,\u201d Natasha recalled the workers telling him. In the video, the man is seen trying to force his way in while arguing with several airport workers. @natashaorganic Stop listening to the internet #airline #travelhacks #pillow #frontier #mco #orlando \u266c original sound \u2013 natashaorganic Natasha said the situation escalated and the cops were called on him, who escorted him out. Plenty of people in the comments section brought up the idea that they wouldn\u2019t want to mess around like this man at an airport. \u201cThe airport is the one place I\u2019m making sure I\u2019m a model citizen. Are ppl not afraid of felonies and the no fly list?\u201d a top comment read. \u201cNo fly list for a bag charge smh smh,\u201d a person pointed out. \u201cI come to the airport ACTING CORRECT One place you will not find me is the no fly list,\u201d another added. Can you get on the no-fly list? Getting on the federal no-fly list is not quite that simple. This list, managed by the FBI, prohibits a person from boarding an aircraft \u201cflying within, to, from, and over the United States,\u201d according to the TSA website. But as of right now, that list is only made up of people involved in or suspected of involvement in terrorism or related activities. But TSA is currently trying to change that and has brought the legal issue before Congress to make it so unruly passengers \u201cconvicted or fined for assaulting or interfering with airline crew members\u201d can be on that list too, AP News reported. \u201cStrong penalties are needed to curb violent and unacceptable behavior. Bad behavior should not fly,\u201d Cher Taylor, a Frontier Airlines flight attendant, said. But opponents to this proposal say the FBI no-fly list is notoriously shrouded in secrecy and unfairly targets people of color. Adding more people to this list would only exacerbate the issue.

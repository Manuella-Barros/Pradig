These factors are said to have led to massive erosion of both Hindu as well as minority votes from the LDF to the UDF and the BJP. The LDF vote share fell to 36% from 40% in 2014 and that of the NDA rose to 16% in 2019 from 11 % in 2014.\n\nIn 2019, the BJP made significant inroads in several constituencies such as Attingal, Pathanamthitta, Palakkad and Alappuzha. In Palakkad, Thrissur, Chalakudy, Kottayam, Alappuzha, Mavelikkara, Pathanamthitta and Attingal, its vote share increased between five to 17 percentage points. In 2014, of these 8 Lok Sabha seats, 4 each were held by LDF and UDF. In 2019, the LDF won 1.\n\nPolitical pundits say the BJP is expected to give a tough fight in 6 seats - Thiruvananthapuram, Attingal, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Thrissur and Palakkad - where the LDF vote share had gone down in 2019 by five to 10 percentage points. However, in north Kerala, the contests will be direct - LDF vs UDF - with the BJP having a marginal presence.\n\nWhether the BJP wins or not will be clear on June 4, but for now, there are enough indications that the LDF may see a comeback of sorts this time as the party has fielded strong candidates such as KK Shailaja, Thomas Isaac, Sunil Kumar and MV Jayarajan. In 2019, the LDF managed to win only Alappuzha.\n\nThe 2024 election campaign, however, has been different.\n\nApart from local issues, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the Centre's alleged mishandling of the ethnic riots in Manipur and the fraud at cooperative banks controlled by the CPI(M) were some of the issues that voters talked about. The final leg of the campaign was riddled with war of words between Rahul Gandhi and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan over the former's allegations that the Enforcement Directorate was \"lenient\" with the CM over allegations of government money given to a company run by Vijayan's daughter. The CPI(M) has also alleged that the Congress MP failed to adequately raise Kerala's issues in the Parliament, especially related to the Centre allegedly not disbursing funds to the state.\n\nEdge for the UDF\n\nMost opinion polls have given an edge to the UDF, though the seat count varies in different opinion polls. While an ABP News-C-Voter poll predicted all 20 seats for the UDF, the Mathrubhumi News-P MARQ survey gave it 14 seats, with five seats going to the LDF. The NDA is predicted to get one seat, as per the latter.\n\nThe trend in 17 Lok Sabha elections since 1956, when Kerala was formed, has been that Congress-led alliances have been far more successful than those led by the Communist parties, with the UDF winning more seats than the Left in 13 of them. The explanation has often been that the Congress, compared to the Left which is only present in a few states, is better placed to form governments at the Centre.\n\nHowever, the voting pattern changes completely in assembly elections in which the Left have had reasonable success. An example is when the LDF returned to power in Kerala with 99 seats out of the 140-member-strong in the assembly in 2021, just two years after the coalition lost 19 of the 20 seats it contested in the parliamentary elections. \"Many see that the Left is no longer in a position to challenge the BJP at the Centre. Therefore, some Left voters also prefer Congress in the national elections,\" said political analyst Asharaf A, who is also the head of the department of Islamic and West Asian studies at University of Kerala.\n\nLike 2019, the UDF this time also enjoys the advantage of not being in power either in the state or at the Centre, thereby leaving no scope for anti-incumbency. However, by fielding 18 of its 19 sitting MPs, the UDF has exposed some of its MPs to allegations of non-performance in Parliament and in their respective constituencies, experts believe.\n\n\"The UDF has the support of a section of Christians and Muslims, key minority demographics in the state. But there is a feeling within the Muslim community that the performance of some of its MPs has not been good, particularly with respect to minority issues. So, the contests in those constituencies will be tighter,\" Asharaf said, adding that the CPI(M) has turned the \"non-performance\" of Congress MPs into a poll issue.\n\nBJP's vote share\n\nAlthough Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the state almost half a dozen times since January this year, the key question is what would be the BJP's vote share and its impact on the other two political fronts. The party's vote share has increased from 1.75% in 1984 to 13% in 2019 and is expected to rise further. The BJP's performance may also decide the fortunes of UDF and LDF candidates. In 2019, the party saw a big jump in its vote share in constituencies such as Thrissur, Alappuzha, Pathanamthitta, Palakkad, Attingal and Thiruvananthapuram.\n\nIn Attingal, a CPI(M) area secretary, who did not wish to be named, said, \"The BJP candidate in 2019, Sobha Surendran, made significant inroads into the LDF's Ezhava vote bank, resulting in the victory of the Congress candidate there. In the backdrop of the Sabarimala protests, there was a shift of our Hindu voter base towards the BJP and the Congress. This time, we are expecting the return of all those votes.\"\n\nLocals claim that the BJP's influence among communities such as Ezhava, a strong vote bank of the CPI(M), has increased and it would impact the LDF more than the UDF. \"I doubt whether the BJP can actually win a seat in Kerala this time too. But yes, there could be a rise in their vote share,\" political analyst Sunnykutty Abraham said.\n\nAbraham believes the Hindutva sentiment is now slowly growing in the state and the BJP can take credit for it. \"At the grassroot level, there are a lot of CPI(M) workers and sympathisers among whom such sentiments exist. The over-the-top agitation by the LDF on issues such as the CAA could also result in them losing their primary Hindu voter base to parties like the BJP,\" he said. Experts also said the BJP's rise may dent the Congress vote bank among the upper caste Hindus to some extent.\n\nMeanwhile, the BJP pitting the CPI(M) and Congress against each other - part of the INDIA bloc national alliance, yet opponents in Kerala - does not seem to have much impact on ground. \"This is not an issue in Kerala,\" Abraham added.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Democratic_Front", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Left Democratic Front"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Democratic_Front_(Kerala)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Democratic Front (Kerala)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_India_(Marxist)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of India (Marxist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alappuzha", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alappuzha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alappuzha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attingal", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attingal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Attingal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palakkad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palakkad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palakkad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathanamthitta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pathanamthitta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pathanamthitta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrissur", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thrissur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Thrissur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_(Amendment)_Act,_2019", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Indian_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2019 Indian general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalakudy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chalakudy"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mavelikkara", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mavelikkara"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayanad_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wayanad district"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wayanad district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kottayam", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kottayam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kottayam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiruvananthapuram", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thiruvananthapuram"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Thiruvananthapuram"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._M._Thomas_Isaac", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

From Thiruvananthapuram's intense triangular battle to the nuanced dynamics in Ernakulam and Chalakudy, each constituency presents its own set of challenges and opportunities for the competing political factions. Let's delve into the intricate political landscape of Kerala as the state braces for the upcoming elections.\n\nThiruvananthapuram\n\nA victory margin of one lakh votes twice, interventions in development projects including Vizhinjam, a global citizen image- UDF candidate Shashi Tharoor had enough to be confident about this Lok Sabha elections. BJP, which came second in the constituency the last two elections, fielded Union Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar to challenge Tharoor. However, LDF believes that CPI leader Pannyan Ravindran is acceptable among the common people. UDF believes that anti-government sentiment is higher in Thiruvananthapuram and that it will help its chances in the constituency.\n\nRead Know your candidate: When Tharoor takes on tycoon in Thiruvananthapuram\n\nAttingal\n\nUDF believes that Adoor Prakash's activities in the constituency and anti-government sentiment will help the front secure a win in Attingal. Meanwhile, LDF hopes to capitalise the strength of its organisational structure, particularly since CPM district secretary and Varkala MLA V Joy is contesting. Joy is a resident of the constituency. In the constituency where BJP won 25% of the votes last time, it is crucial to see which front will be affected if Union Minister V Muraleedharan gains more votes.\n\nKollam\n\nAs national and state issues were highlighted elsewhere, the campaign in Kollam surrounded the persona of sitting UDF MP NK Premachandran. CPM is in the final test to win back the constituency by putting actor Mukesh, also a sitting MLA, at the forefront. However, BJP's efforts to increase the vote percentage by bringing in another film actor, G Krishnakumar, need not pay fruit.\n\nRead: Know Your Candidate: Performer of a different kind takes on two screen performers in Kollam.\n\nMavelikkara\n\nWill Kodikkunnil Suresh, the experienced candidate, or CA Arunkumar, the fresh face win in Mavelikkara? While LDF senses a strong desire for change in the constituency, UDF expects Suresh's experience to come in handy in this competitive arena. Baiju Kalashala, formerly with Congress, has joined BDJS to fight the battle for the NDA in the constituency.\n\nPathanamthitta\n\nThough the entry of senior CPM leader Thomas Isaac from the LDF sparked an exciting contest in the first phase, UDF's sitting MP Anto Antony gained momentum in the second leg of the campaign. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself sought votes for NDA candidate Anil Antony. However, after Priyanka Gandhi's campaign, UDF's confidence surged.\n\nRead Know Your Candidate: Sitting MP takes on ED's prey and Modi's pick in Pathanamthitta\n\nAlappuzha\n\nUDF's courage in Alappuzha is centred around the initials 'KC'. The LDF, on the other hand expects AM Ariff who secured a win even amidst UDF's sweeping victory in 2019, to retain the seat. Meanwhile, BJP's Shobha Surendran arrives in Alappuzha with the promise of a Union Minister from the constituency. The votes secured by her will influence the final results.\n\nKottayam\n\nThe Kottayam constituency will witness a test of the splintered Kerala Congress groups this April 26. The prediction of a sure victory for Francis George by different surveys lends confidence to the UDF. Although CPM argues that Thomas Chazhikadan can win if LDF and Kerala Congress votes unite, Francis George holds the upper hand as the candidate supported by the Congress in an election where national politics loom large. There is a strong concern in the Left Front that NDA candidate Thushar Vellappally will siphon their votes.\n\nIdukki\n\nThough candidate selection and early campaigning helped LDF in Idukki, not much has favored Joyce George since. Wild animal attacks and fatalities have also put LDF on the defence. LDF attempted to revive the issue of Kasthurirangan and Gadgil reports without discussing construction bans and pattaya land issues. UDF believes anti-government sentiment is strong and Dean's victory is certain. NDA's Sangeeta Viswanathan hopes to increase BJP vote share.\n\nErnakulam\n\nErnakulam, which has traditionally sided with the Congress, is likely to continue its preference this time. Sitting MP Hibi Eden hopes for a good majority for the second time from the constituency. However, LDF believes candidate KJ Shine has impressed voters. Though Dr Radhakrishnan is a candidate who can increase BJP's vote share, the party's organisational structure in the area is not impressive.\n\nChalakkudy\n\nDespite Twenty20's presence in Chalakkudy, UDF appears to hold sway. UDF's Benny Behnan is known to be an active MP in the area. Overcoming the initial lethargy, UDF launched a vigorous campaign in the final days in the constituenct. LDF hopes that the goodwill surrounding its candidate C Ravindranath will benefit it. Twenty20 candidate Charlie Paul may draw more UDF votes. BDJS candidate KA Unnikrishnan's hope lies in solid NDA votes.\n\nThrissur\n\nThis grand finale of the war of votes. It can be described as an 'equilateral triangle' competition. K Muraleedharan, VS Sunil Kumar and Suresh Gopi are engaged in a neck-and-neck contest. All three fronts are eagerly awaiting to see if the Pooram imbroglio has an impact on voting. The lapse on the part of the government and the police has annoyed the LDF camp to no end. The hasty damage-control actions were born out of those worries. The Left will also find the Karuvannur Cooperative Bank scam hard to negotiate. Voting day undercurrents are crucial given that all three candidates are popular with voters.\n\nRead Know Your Candidate: In Thrissur, saffron star meets seasoned Congressman & popular comrade\n\nAlathur\n\nThe LDF's initial confidence in recapturing Alathur seems to have waned a bit. UDF's Remya Haridas is campaigning vigorously. LDF's hope lies in the popularity of Minister K Radhakrishnan and his good performance in the assembly poll. Former DCC president AV Gopinath is an added support to the CPM leader. There is sentiment against the state government in the agriculture sector, which could prove decisive. NDA candidate TN Sarasu is campaigning vigorously to increase the vote share.\n\nPalakkad\n\nUDF's hope lies in MP VK Sreekandan's popularity and acceptance among voters. If the anti-BJP votes and farmers' sentiment against the Left government come together, the incumbent MP from Congress will win again. However, CPM is confident that A Vijayaraghavan, who has a strong political base, will win in the constituency. The LDF believes that the votes won by the BJP candidate C Krishnakumar will dent the UDF's chances.\n\nPonnani\n\nIn the constituency, where an ex-League leader is contesting on the CPM's symbol against an IUML veteran, MP Abdussamad Samadani is likely to maintain his supremacy. The LDF tried to strengthen the competition through KS Hamza. But with the Samastha, the congregation of Sunni clerics, throwing its weight behind the League, the UDF's confidence has sky rocketed. NDA is hoping to increase its vote share through Nivedita Subrahmanyan.\n\nMalappuram\n\nIn the stronghold of the League, the LDF has matched the dominant party with its campaigning strategies. UDF's ET Muhammad Basheer and LDF's V Wasif have covered all nooks and corners of the constituency. The League highlights ET's fight against the Citizenship Act. The Left tried to create confusion among the UDF by questioning the Congress' stand on the issue. Modi's controversial remark has put a huge question mark on Dr M Abdul Salam's prospects.\n\nKozhikode\n\nOn the strength of MK Raghavan's image, UDF is aiming for a fourth win in a row. The LDF, through Elamaram Karim, is aiming for a coup d'etat banking on the undercurrents of minority votes. It is also working to stop the leakage of Left votes which it believed happened in the past three times. The UDF is counting on the consolidation of the anti-BJP votes and the support of the Welfare Party and others. The BJP, which has fielded MT Ramesh, aims to better its performance.\n\nWayanad\n\nUDF is confident that Rahul Gandhi's margin of victory will cross the 4 lakh-mark this time. LDF candidate Annie Raja hopes to gain votes on the organisational cohesion of the Left and on the campaign that Rahul's performance as MP did not meet people's expectations. The left front will consider it an achievement if Rahul's victory margin is brought down to less than 3 lakh. BJP state president K Surendran attempts to collect maximum party votes by making controversial remarks.\n\nRead Know Your Candidate: In Wayanad, CPI & BJP dream of turning Rahul Gandhi's safe house to short-stay\n\nVadakara\n\nThe final round of the campaign saw UDF candidate Shafi Parambal going ahead of the rest after what seemed an even-steven initial round. The obscene video controversy has boomeranged on the LDF. KK Shailaja explained later that she did not say the word 'video'. The LDF is banking on the women voters who flock to see and hear former state health ministers. The rigorous punishment imposed by the high court on CPM leaders in the TP Chandrasekharan murder case and the killing of a CPM worker while making a bomb in Panur are the topics of discussion ahead of the election.\n\nRead Know Your Candidate: Teacher vs charmer fight wows Vadakara\n\nKannur\n\nNo matter who wins, the margin of victory will be thin. UDF calculates that K Sudhakaran will get what he needs to win even though it may receive fewer minority votes. While LDF hopes to get all the 'party votes' for its candidate MV Jayarajan, it will be crucial to see how many votes he will get from non-party voters. The UDF believes that Sudhakaran's popularity and credibility in Kannur will help him eventually. C Raghunath, an old supporter of Sudhakaran, is fighting as the NDA candidate.\n\nKasaragod\n\nThough UDF's Raj Mohan Unnithan is likely to retain the seat, LDF candidate MV Balakrishnan has seen a surge in support in the final lap. UDF pins hopes on Unnithan's image and popularity among voters. The question is whether the LDF's organisational prowess can outdo the incumbent MP's acceptance among the electorate. Who will win the minority vote is also crucial. NDA's ML Ashwani has managed to have a prominent presence during campaigns.", "source": {"uri": "onmanorama.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OnManorama"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Democratic_Front", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Left Democratic Front"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Council_of_Ministers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Union Council of Ministers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalakudy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chalakudy"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kerala Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashi_Tharoor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shashi Tharoor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Democratic_Front_(Kerala)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Democratic Front (Kerala)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_India_(Marxist)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of India (Marxist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alappuzha", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alappuzha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alappuzha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attingal", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attingal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Attingal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernakulam", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ernakulam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ernakulam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kollam", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kollam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kollam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiruvananthapuram", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thiruvananthapuram"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Thiruvananthapuram"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_George_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Francis George (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathanamthitta_district", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pathanamthitta district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mavelikkara", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mavelikkara"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._M._Thomas_Isaac", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T.

The state witnessed high decibel campaign from the two major blocks, the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the opposition United Democratic Front (UDF).\n\nA variety of issues, including the possible implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), attack on federalism and the Constitution, financial autonomy of the state government, developmental activities, and the role of elected MPs (18 from the UDF) were raised by the LDF.\n\nThe UDF seems to be banking on the anti-incumbency factor against LDF, which has been ruling the state since 2016, the Rahul Gandhi factor (he is the Congress candidate from Wayanad) and the anger against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Union government.\n\nEven as the principal fight is between the LDF and UDF, the BJP is trying to make inroads through its attempts to lure Christian votes, a traditional base of the Congress- led UDF, besides trying to evoke Hindu nationalism.\n\nThe LDF began its election campaign much earlier, even before the Election Commission of India (ECI) announced the seven-phase polls. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] is contesting from 15 constituencies, the Communist Party of India (CPI) from four and Kerala Congress (Mani) from one constituency.\n\nThe LDF campaign, led by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, besides a host of the party's national leadership, including CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, raised issues, including the controversial CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act), financial challenges imposed on Kerala by the Union government and the \"negligent\" attitude of UDF and its MPs.\n\nVijayan accused both UDF and BJP of positioning themselves against Kerala, under the guise of opposing the LDF government. \"The 18 UDF MPs did not utter a word against the injustice meted out to the people of Kerala by the BJP government. The unitary decision to cut down funds to the state affected the developmental activities, distribution of welfare pensions and infrastructure development\", he said.\n\nThe LDF leaders also accused UDF of remaining silent on CAA. Vijayan questioned Congress why it had not addressed CAA in its manifesto, which enables providing citizenship on religious lines.\n\nThe LDF campaign also addressed in detail challenges faced by farmers, women, youth and students, of falling prices of agriculture products, increasing unemployment, reduction in allocation for public education by the Union government.\n\nThe roadshows of the UDF candidates, particularly that of the Congress, refrained from using any party flags. Even when Rahul Gandhi held a massive show ahead of filing his nomination, the flags of Congress or ally Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) were not used. The LDF accused the Congress leadership of being wary about a smear campaign by BJP and Sangh Parivar.\n\nBrinda Karat, polit bureau member of CPI(M) accused the Congress party of bowing down to the Sangh Parivar organisations. Addressing an election rally in Wayanad in support of CPI candidate, Annie Raja, carrying a flag of the LDF ally Indian National League (INL), she said \"This is the green flag of the INL, a respected ally of the LDF. We also have the red flags of the communist parties. But where are the tricolour flags of Congress and green flags of IUML Is Congress afraid of the Sangh Parivar campaign\".\n\nAdding insult to injury, supporters of IUML who carried party flags to public meetings were reportedly asked to remove those by Congress volunteers. This created an uproar among the rank and file of IUML. LDF is hoping to reap the dividends of this dissent.\n\nThe UDF, with 18 MPs in the outgoing Lok Sabha, is once again hoping to reap rich dividends from the state. The Congress leadership reportedly worked overtime to ensure the candidature of Rahul Gandhi from Wayanad again. However, the clout of his candidature has apparently reduced compared with 2019.\n\nIn addition to the negative impact of the Sabarimala temple entry issue, the UDF is also banking on anti-incumbency against the LDF government. The delay in distributing the welfare pension of Rs 1,600 to around 60 lakh beneficiaries was the primary focus of the UDF's campaign, which seems to have reached the appropriate audience.\n\nRahul Gandhi, too, raked up a controversy during his campaign by alleging that BJP and CPI(M) were \"hand in glove\" and hence the Union government was not acting against the government of Kerala and the Chief Minister.\n\nThe UDF also laid emphasis on the increasing human- animal conflicts and the subsequent increase in deaths due to wild animal attacks. It refrained from raising national, political issues, focussing only on the state- level issues.\n\nThe BJP is contesting from 15 constituencies while leaving five constituencies to its ally, Bharatiya Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS). The party is hoping to make inroads in the state. It has fielded two Union ministers -- Rajiv Chandrasekhar (Thiruvananthapuram) and V Muraleedharan (Attingal), in the hope of making some impact.\n\nThe party is also banking on the slogan of 'Modi's Guarantee' while unleashing an advertisement blitzkrieg across different media platforms. The number of visits made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other national leaders reflect BJP's desperation to win at least one seat from the state.\n\nThe saffron party also made attempts to create a divide among the two principal minority communities, Christians and Muslims. The screening of the film, Kerala Story, through Doordarshan just ahead of the elections created an uproar. The screening of the movie by a few Christian dioceses also created dissent among the community.", "source": {"uri": "newsclick.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsClick"}, "authors": [],

In addition to these rallies and constituency tours, parties have also intensified micro-level campaigning by organising house visits and family meetups.\n\nAs the campaign winds down, the UDF that has fielded the Kerala Congress veteran Francis George, remains confident in securing a significant victory, citing several key factors. The historical allegiance of Kottayam to the UDF adds to their optimism. Furthermore, they aim to capitalise on the constituency's caste composition, dominated by the Christians communities, Ezhavas and Nairs . The UDF strategises to leverage the perceived discord between the Church and the LDF government on issues such as human-wildlife conflicts and the challenges faced by rubber farmers.\n\nHowever, the coalition faces challenges as the election date approaches, including defections from the Kerala Congress.\n\nIn contrast, the LDF emphasises their numerical strength, with over three lakh assured votes in the constituency. They highlight the impressive vote tally secured by V.N. Vasavan of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] in the previous election, which, when combined with Kerala Congress (M) votes, could secure victory. The LDF also underscores the untarnished image of their candidate Thomas Chazhikadan and his effective utilisation of MP funds.\n\nYet, the coalition remains wary of potential anti-incumbency sentiments and concerns among Christian voters regarding the LDF government. The candidacy of Thushar Vellappally for the NDA poses a threat, potentially siphoning Ezhava votes from the LDF.\n\nMeanwhile, the NDA pins its hopes on the nearly three lakh Ezhava votes in the constituency. The extent of Ezhava support garnered by him will significantly influence the election outcome in Kottayam.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kerala Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Democratic_Front_(Kerala)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Democratic Front (Kerala)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Democratic_Front", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Left Democratic Front"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kottayam", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kottayam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kottayam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaduthuruthy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kaduthuruthy"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christians"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezhava", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ezhava"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nair", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_India_(Marxist)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of India (Marxist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caste"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rubber", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural rubber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Chazhikadan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Chazhikadan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala_Congress_(M)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kerala Congress (M)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/og-image.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509487", "eventUri": "eng-9509487", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

According to political experts and opinion polls, the UDF has an edge over the others in the polls this time.\n\nThe 2019 Lok Sabha elections, fought in the shadow of the agitation over entry of women in Sabarimala temple and the candidacy of then Congress president Rahul Gandhi in Wayanad, saw a landslide result in favour of the UDF in Kerala with the alliance notching over 47% votes and winning 19 of the 20 seats.\n\nFor the LDF, the vote-share dropped nearly 4% and its candidate emerged triumphant only in one seat - Alappuzha. As for the NDA, which picked up over 350 seats across the country, in Kerala, it was unable to open its account yet again despite a 4.8% rise in vote-share.\n\nThe 2024 election campaign in the state was marked by issues like the implementation of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the Centre's alleged mishandling of the ethnic riots in Manipur, the fraud at cooperative banks controlled by the CPI(M) in the state, sentiments of anti-incumbency against the LDF government, alleged non-performance of UDF MPs and the war of words between Rahul Gandhi and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.\n\nThough both the CPI(M) and Congress are partners of the INDIA bloc at the national level and are fighting elections together in several states such as Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Rajasthan, they are part of rival LDF and UDF coalitions respectively in Kerala, a state whose politics has been largely bipolar in nature. The BJP, which has never won a Lok Sabha seat in the southern state, is a formidable force in at least half a dozen constituencies, forcing triangular contests in these places.\n\nUpper-hand for UDF\n\nMost opinion polls have given an edge for the UDF in the state with the number of seats varying in different polls. While an ABP News-CVoter poll predicted all 20 seats for the UDF, the Mathrubhumi News-P MARQ survey gave it 14 seats with five seats going to the LDF. The NDA is predicted to get one seat as per the latter.\n\nThe trend in Lok Sabha elections since 1956 when Kerala was formed has been that Congress-led alliances have been far more successful than those led by the Communist parties. In the 17 general elections held so far in the state, the Congress-led alliances have won more seats than the Left in 13 of them. The explanation has often been that the Congress, compared to the Left which is only present in a few states, is better placed to form governments at the Centre. However, the voting pattern changes completely in assembly elections in which the Left have had reasonable success. An example is when the LDF returned to power in Kerala with 99 seats out of 140 in the assembly in 2021, just two years after the coalition lost 19 of the 20 seats it contested in the Lok Sabha polls.\n\nLike 2019, the UDF this time also enjoys the advantage that it is not in power either in the state or the Centre and therefore faces no anti-incumbency. However, by fielding 18 of its 19 sitting MPs, the UDF has exposed some of its MPs to allegations of non-performance in Parliament and in their respective constituencies, according to political experts.\n\nPolitical analyst Asharaf A who is also the head of the department of Islamic and West Asian studies at Kerala University, said that UDF \"definitely has the upper hand\" in the elections.\n\n\"They have the support of a section of Christians and Muslims, key minority demographics in the state. But there is a feeling within the Muslim community that the performance of some of its MPs has not been good particularly with respect to minority issues. So the contests in those constituencies will be tighter,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the minority consolidation behind the UDF, like in 2019, will not repeat this time. \"Many of the minorities believe that there should be more Left MPs in Parliament as a strong voice from Kerala. So the Left will certainly improve its tally,\" he said.\n\nAll eyes on BJP's vote-share\n\nThe key question that did the rounds of this election campaign was around the BJP's vote-share and how its rise or fall could impact the other two political fronts.\n\nWhile BJP has never won a Lok Sabha seat in Kerala, the votes it gets often decides the fortunes of the UDF and LDF candidates. In 2019 polls, the party saw a big jump in its vote-shares in some constituencies like Thrissur, Alappuzha, Pathanamthitta, Palakkad, Attingal and Thiruvananthapuram.\n\nIn Attingal for example, a CPI(M) area secretary, who did not want to be named, said: \"The BJP candidate in 2019 Sobha Surendran made significant inroads into the LDF's Ezhava vote-bank, resulting in the victory of the Congress candidate there\". \"In the backdrop of the Sabarimala protests, there was an erosion of our Hindu vote-base to the BJP and to the Congress. This time, we are expecting the return of all those votes,\" he said.\n\nIndications on the ground also suggest that the BJP's inroads into communities like Ezhava, a strong votary of the CPI(M), will affect the LDF more than the UDF.\n\nAnother political analyst Sunnykutty Abraham said, \"I doubt whether the BJP can actually win a seat in Kerala this time too. But yes, there could be a rise in their vote-share in the state.\"\n\n\"It can be safely said that the Hindutva sentiment is slowly growing in the state. At the grassroot level, there are a lot of CPI(M) workers and sympathisers among whom such sentiments are present. They could either vote for BJP or UDF. The over-the-top agitation by the LDF on issues like CAA could also result in loss of their primary Hindu vote base to parties like BJP,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com",

The Election Commission said there are over 2.75 crore voters in Kerala where polling will commence at 7 am on Friday.\n\nChief Electoral Officer Sanjay Kaul said 63,100 bottles of ink are used to prevent fraudulent voting and ensure flawless and transparent elections. This time there are 2,77,49,159 voters in the state out of which more than five lakh are first-time voters.\n\nKottayam constituency boasts the highest number of candidates at 14, while Alathur has the fewest at five. Other notable figures are - 13 candidates in Kozhikode and 12 each in Kollam and Kannur. Of the total 194 candidates, 169 are men and 25 are women. The Vadakara constituency stands out with the highest number of female candidates, at four.\n\nThe Election Commission said steps have been taken to ensure safe and peaceful polling by deploying 66,303 security personnel. Kerala Police and Central forces are providing tight security for the polling in a total of 25,231 booths arranged at 13,272 places.\n\nPolice deployment has been made throughout the state as per the instructions of the Central Election Commission. When the polling for 20 constituencies in the state begins at 7 am on Friday, more than five lakh first-time voters will go to the polling booth.\n\nAs the curtains fell on Wednesday evening, marking the conclusion of the over-month-long, high-octane public campaigning for the April 26 polls, Kerala on Thursday witnessed a silent campaign before the state votes.\n\nTwo union ministers, a state minister, three actors and a few MLAs are among the total candidates who try their political luck this time. BJP-led NDA is fielding the most number of women candidates - five. Unlike the previous general elections, Kerala has seen a highly active and aggressive campaign.\n\nDiverse issues ranging from the implementation of the CAA, the alleged existence of 'love jihad', controversies surrounding 'The Kerala Story' movie, the Manipur violence, Rahul Gandhi's candidature in Wayanad, as well as alleged appeasement of minorities by various political parties, dominated the high-decibel public campaigns.\n\nIn the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the UDF won 19 of the 20 seats, while the LDF had to settle for just a single seat.\n\nOf the 20 constituencies in Kerala going to polls on Friday, two seats - Alathur and Mavelikara- are reserved for Scheduled Caste (SC) candidates.\n\n1. Wayanad: Congress leader and sitting MP Rahul Gandhi is recontesting against Annie Raja of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).

BJP, which is yet to open its account in the state, has fielded its state president K Surendran in the constituency.\n\n2. Thiruvananthapuram: Senior Congress leader and former Union Minister Shashi Tharoor won this seat in the 2009, 2014 and 2019 general elections.

Campaigning started in Kottayam even before the announcement of elections, marking the beginning of a fierce battle for votes. LDF candidate and KC(M) leader, Thomas Chazhikadan, has been tirelessly campaigning for nearly two-and-a-half months. On the other side, UDF candidate Francis George, representing the Kerala Congress PJ Joseph faction, has also been actively engaging with voters for over two months. Despite a delayed start, NDA candidate Thushar Vellappally of BDJS has joined the race and is making up for the lost time with his vigorous campaign efforts.\n\nIn the heartland of rubber and Kerala Congress' political turf, the competition is fiercer than ever. The battle is particularly intense as two factions of the Kerala Congress are pitted against each other, while the BDJS has transformed the race into a three-way contest. All three political fronts are pulling out all the stops in their quest for victory.\n\nAs the campaign reaches its fag end, the UDF camp is optimistic about a comfortable win, citing various factors. One key reason for their confidence is that Kottayam is traditionally a UDF stronghold. They are also counting on the communal dynamics in the constituency, with Christian voters making up 37.9 per cent, the Nair community at 17.5 percent, and the Ezhava community at 23.4 percent. The UDF hopes to capitalise on anti-communist sentiments among Christians, as well as the Church's face-off with the LDF government on issues such as man-animal conflict and the crisis facing rubber farmers.", "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abhilash_chandran@newindianexpress.com", "name": "Abhilash Chandran", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kottayam", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kottayam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kottayam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kerala Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_George_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francis George (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Chazhikadan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Chazhikadan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharath_Dharma_Jana_Sena", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharath Dharma Jana Sena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala_Congress_(M)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kerala Congress (M)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Democratic_Front_(Kerala)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Democratic Front (Kerala)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Democratic_Front", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left Democratic Front"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christians"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nair", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rubber", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural rubber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/newindianexpress%2F2024-02%2Fad88b224-3566-43f0-a856-7e20fe57dd8b%2Fudf.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9509487", "eventUri": "eng-9509487", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kottayam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Though his party is in the opposite camp, he hopes to replicate his success in 2019 on the back of his popularity and hold on voters.\n\nShocked by the unexpected move of the Kerala Congress (M) faction to ally with LDF, the rival Kerala Congress (Joseph) faction supported by the UDF aims to exploit this loyalty switch and anti-incumbency sentiment along with disillusionment with the LDF government. It has nominated K Francis George, son of the former Kerala Congress leader, KM George, as its candidate.\n\nThe NDA's delayed selection of Tushar Vellappally, president of the Bharat Dharma Jana Sena, has further intensified the electoral battleground. Although the arithmetic seems straightforward and potentially decisive, the NDA anticipates a closely contested battle this time, buoyed by the rollout of welfare measures for rubber growers by the central government.\n\nSince 1951, the Congress or its allies have clinched victory around ten times in Kottayam, including the last three elections. However, the Left has also managed to disrupt this trend, out-polling the UDF on six occasions in what is often deemed a \"conservative constituency.\"\n\nKottayam's elections have historically revolved around the crisis in the natural rubber sector as it is the largest producer of the commodity in the state. This time, the scenario appears altered with domestic prices mirroring the high prices in the international market. However, the issues are different - lower production due to the hot weather and unavailability of stocks with farmers. Nonetheless, the contesting factions have adhered to tradition, focusing their campaigns around it.\n\nConcurrently, issues such as the Manipur violence, attacks on Christians in North India, and concerns regarding minority appeasement and the protection of Hindu faith have emerged as prominent topics in the political discourse.\n\nIn the constituency, with a dominant Christian population, the positions of the Catholic Church, the rift between Orthodox and Jacobite factions, and the stance of the Nair Service Society, an ardent supporter of the faithful, are poised to significantly influence the election's outcome. Moreover, the sizeable presence of Knanaya Christians and SNDP Yogam members may further fragment the vote share among the leading contenders.\n\nAs the campaign hots up in the sweltering summer heat, the pressing question is whether the LDF can extend its winning streak to the Lok Sabha leveraging its growing grassroots support acquired since the previous local body polls.\n\nSHARE Copy

However, there is a discernible anti-incumbency sentiment among the electorate towards the LDF government under Pinarayi Vijayan, which is giving the UDF an advantageous position this time.\n\nThe LDF government has been facing the wrath of the people due to its failure to timely disburse social security pensions, delays in government employees' salaries, and outstanding DA instalments owed to them. Additionally, subsidised grocery items are not being distributed properly through the supply company outlets.\n\nThe death of JS Sidharthan, a second-year veterinary student at the Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Pookode campus in Wayanad, inside the hostel after a brutal ragging and assault allegedly by the SFI leaders on February 18 has sparked outrage. Additionally, incidents such as the Panoor bomb blast, the Karuvannur cooperative bank scam, corruption allegations against the Pinarayi Vijayan government, including the Life Mission housing project kickback case and the monthly pay-off case involving the Chief Minister's daughter Veena Vijayan, have significantly tarnished the image of the LDF government.\n\nFurthermore, the temporary disruption of the Pooram festival due to stringent rules imposed by the police also went against the LDF.\n\nKnowing well that the LDF government is facing massive anti-incumbency, the front leaders tried to overcome it by raising the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) issue. The CAA notification has come as a blessing in disguise for the ruling CPI-M, which has been grappling with massive anti-incumbency sentiment. With an eye on the minority votes, the LDF had been harping on the CAA and atrocities against Christians in Manipur and north Indian states in their poll campaign meetings. However, it remains to be seen whether the CAA issue can overcome the people's ire against the government.\n\nWhile the main contenders in the state continue to be the traditional political formations, namely the CPI-M-led LDF and the Congress-led UDF, the BJP-led NDA has managed to give a tough fight to both fronts in several constituencies this time.\n\nBJP candidates -- Union Minister Rajiv Chandrasekhar in Thiruvananthapuram, Shobha Surendran in Alappuzha, Anil Antony in Pathanamthitta, Suresh Gopi in Thrissur and Union Minister V Muraleedharan in Attingal -- are giving tough fights to their LDF and UDF rivals.\n\nThe UDF might not be able to win all 19 of the total 20 seats it got in 2019. However, according to political analysts, the front may win around 16 seats this time. Rahul Gandhi is predicted to win Wayanad with a reduced margin this time. Last time, he won the seat with a massive majority of over four lakh votes.\n\nIn Ernakulam, Hybi Eaden of the Congress is believed to be in a comfortable position and so is UDF's RSP nominee N K Premachandran in Kollam.\n\nThe Alappuzha constituency is in the national spotlight as Congress general secretary KC Venugopal is contesting from here. He is pitted against sitting MP AM Arif, who won the seat in 2019 by a slender margin of 10,474 votes, and senior BJP leader Shobha Surendran, who has a track record of lifting the BJP vote percentage wherever she contested, albeit losing the elections.\n\nIn Vadakara, where former minister K K Shailaja of CPI-M is taking on Shafi Parambil of the UDF, the poll outcome is unpredictable.\n\nIn Thrissur, the BJP has fielded actor-turned-politician Suresh Gopi, who is facing Congress' K Muraleedharan, and CPI's V S Sunilkumar. In Thiruvananthapuram, sitting Congress MP Shashi Tharoor is pitted against BJP's Union Minister Rajeev Chandrashekhar. CPI's Pannyan Raveendran is making it a three-cornered contest.\n\nThe BJP, which has never won any Lok Sabha seat in Kerala, is intensifying its efforts to break its electoral dry spell in Kerala. The BJP expects that the party can win two or three Lok Sabha seats in Kerala this time. BJP candidates have successfully transformed the contests in Thiruvananthapuram, Thrissur, Attingal, Alappuzha, Pathanamthitta and Palakkad into three-cornered fights.\n\nThe BJP's major expectation rests on Thiruvananthapuram. In Thiruvananthapuram, sitting Congress MP Sashi Tharoor is facing a stiff challenge from BJP's Rajeev Chandrasekhar. Tharoor is facing anti-incumbency, as he hasn't delivered much as an MP in 15 years.

HT caught up with Muraleedharan during his campaign and spoke about his campaign, the BJP's weaknesses in Kerala and its stand on issues such as the Citizenship Amendment Act. Edited excerpts:\n\nThe BJP came third in the Attingal Lok Sabha constituency in 2019 and registered a significant increase in its vote share. What makes you confident of a BJP victory this time?\n\nWe are getting a favourable response from the voters throughout the campaign. In Lok Sabha elections in Kerala, national factors are as important as local factors. The Attingal constituency spreads from coastal areas to hilly areas; there are sectors like farming and traditional industries. There are a lot of possibilities for development in these areas which have not been fulfilled over the years. Also, there is massive public sentiment against the state government due to corruption and frequent attacks perpetrated by youth wings of the CPI(M). In the past, such sentiments worked in favour of the UDF. But this time, no one believes that Congress will come to power at the Centre. So the BJP in Attingal and across the state will be a beneficiary of such anti-LDF sentiments.\n\nDoes being the MoS for external affairs and parliamentary affairs strengthen your chances as a candidate?\n\nYes, certainly. My role is also there as part of the Narendra Modi government which worked for the progress of Kerala as well as other states. I had a direct role in several rescue missions and evacuation exercises, which has cast a positive feeling (in this campaign).\n\nThe LDF and UDF have extensively campaigned by raising issues such as the CAA and Manipur violence. Won't such issues work against the BJP?\n\nI don't think they are such big issues. I have noticed in my campaign this time that there is a big change within the Muslim community. I don't know to what extent it will translate into votes. Muslims used to be bound by the narratives of the LDF and UDF. But now, they have begun to take an independent view. Our government projects have never discriminated based on religion, be it housing, gas connections, drinking water or roads. LDF and UDF may spread canards that the Modi government discriminates on the basis of religion, but the minorities don't believe it. The triple talaq law has come as a huge blessing for Muslim women and they feel more empowered. So the earlier misunderstandings about the BJP have changed to a large extent. Communities like Muslims cannot be kept away from the mainstream and be treated as captive vote-banks anymore.\n\nThe BJP is seen as organisationally weak in Kerala, compared to parties such as CPI(M) and Congress. That's one of the factors attributed to your party's low strike rate in elections. Have there been efforts to improve?\n\nKerala cannot be compared to a state such as Gujarat where the BJP has been in power for decades and has MLAs and MPs. But if you compare it to a state like Tamil Nadu, our organisational system is much better. Even though the party has had MLAs and MPs in Tamil Nadu, there is no uniform organisational set-up. We have such a set-up in Kerala. Yes, in some booths here, there may be inexperienced party workers, but there are efforts to improve it.\n\nWho do you see as your chief rival in Attingal, LDF or UDF?\n\nFor me, both are equal. There is no chief rival here. Individually, both candidates are experienced so I consider them equal.\n\nBoth CPM and Congress in Kerala are part of larger coalitions where they have allies whereas the BJP still doesn't have any major allies in the state. Why has the party not been able to attract good allies?\n\nOther parties will come into our (NDA) fold when they realise that the BJP is winning. They have not come yet because that feeling is not there. This dilemma exists for all parties in states where they are a third alternative. The situation will change when the BJP can break that idea. For example, the BJP has grown in Odisha and Karnataka. In both states, the BJP was in third position earlier. But now, in Karnataka, through issue-based support and organisational growth, BJP is at number one or two. The JDS has fallen to third. In Odisha, the fight today is between BJD and BJP and Congress is irrelevant. It's a long process.

Except for Sebastian Paul, who contested as a CPI (M)-supported independent candidate, the constituency, spread over seven assembly segments, has always elected a Congress nominee as its representative in the LS elections.\n\nBoth the LDF and the UDF vie with each other to select candidates from the Latin Catholic community, which accounts for nearly 45 per cent of the population. Overall, the constituency comprises 55 per cent Christians, who exert a considerable influence on candidate selection and electoral outcomes.\n\nHibi Eden, the sitting MP, won the seat with a record majority in 2019. He is politically well-known for his dynamism and wide contacts, cutting across party affiliations. The Congress camps in the constituency started pre-poll preparations almost six months before the party formally announced the candidature of Eden, who defeated P Rajeeve by a margin of 1.69 lakh votes in the last election, which witnessed a voting percentage of 78.68.\n\nThe choice fell on Hibi Eden as Congress satrap KV Thomas, who had represented the constituency several times, found himself sidelined by the party leadership due to internal squabbles. Denial of a ticket in the 2019 election led to his migration to CPI (M).\n\nThe CPI (M)-led Left Democratic Front has sprung a surprise this time by fielding a woman municipal councillor from the nearby North Paravur Municipality as its candidate. A teacher by profession, KJ Shine has made her presence felt in the constituency with her dynamism and articulation. The BJP has fielded KS Radhakrishnan, former vice chancellor and chairman of the Kerala Public Service Commission.\n\nTwenty20, the political arm of Kitex Group, is also trying its luck in the 2024 polls, encouraged by a 50 per cent jump in voting percentage in the last polls. Sabu Jacob, State president of Twenty20, believes that his political entity can be a third option for the people who wish for a corruption-free government.\n\nLike in many other places, political issues dominate the campaign in Ernakulam, with the UDF and the LDF focusing their attention on the misdeeds of the Union Government headed by the BJP. The UDF is equally vehement in exposing the LDF government's failure on many fronts in the state. The BJP is focusing on the theme of the Modi Ki Guarantee, coupled with the shortcomings of both the UDF and LDF in the state over the years.\n\nUnfortunately, as the campaign gathers pace, some of the burning issues in Ernakulam are getting ignored. As a fast-growing metropolis in the Tier-II category, Kochi is facing a plethora of infrastructure deficiencies, including severe waterlogging and traffic jams. The district, with its long coastline, is also vulnerable to many ecological dangers arising from climate change.\n\nThe constituency encompasses Kalamassery, Paravur, Vypeen, Kochi, Tripunithura, Ernakulam, and Thrikkakara assembly constituencies.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on April 24, 2024", "source": {"uri": "thehindubusinessline.com",

Though the day was peaceful as no untoward incidents getting reported from anywhere in the State, the inspection wing of the Election Commission seized deadly weapons like iron rods, machetes, knives and swords from the campaign vehicle of K Radhakrishnan, the CPI(M) candidate contesting from Alathur early Thursday morning. But Radhakrishnan, a Minister in Pinarayi Vijayan's government, claimed that they were gadgets for removing the flex boards and posters which have been put up as part of campaigning.\n\nK Muraleedharan, the Congress candidate at Thrissur said his party could organise public meetings in support of Hamas soldiers fighting against Israel. \"We do not have a military of our own and whatever military is there is under the command of Prime Minister Modi. Had we been ruling India, situation would have been different,\" said Muraleedharan who has taken a vow that he would not allow the BJP candidates anywhere in the State to come to the third place.\n\nShobha Surendran, the BJP candidate at Alappuzha, made a startling disclosure on Thursday that a prominent CPI(M) leader was in touch with BJP leadership to crossover to the Hindutva party but he called off the move following death threats from the Marxists. Though she refused to divulge the name of the \"leader\", K Sudhakaran, the Congress candidate contesting from Kannur declared that E P Jayarajan, the LDF convenor, who is cut up with CPI(M) leadership was the one who was about to jump fence. Jayarajan was upset over the CPI(M) leadership ignoring his claims to the post of Kerala secretary and electing M V Govindan, a lower primary school drill master for the post.\n\nElsewhere in the State, pollsters and observers took stock of the intensity of the campaign and most of them were unanimous in their view of a UDF sweep. P Rajan, author and former senior editor of Mathrubhumi said that the Congress-led UDF has a discernible advantage.\n\n\"If the BJP manages to increase the vote share, it may help the LDF to win three or four sats. But the interesting point to note is that Kerala voters have learn to vote in a discriminate manner and that is the reason why we see a change in pattern during assembly and Lok Sabha polls in the State,\" said Rajan. The octogenarian poll pundit also made it clear that his assessment was based on newspaper and TV channel reports.\n\nKevin Peter, founder, CASA, an umbrella organization of all Christian sects in the State said there would be many surprises once the election results are declared on 4 June. \"The dressing down received by K Muraleedharan from the bishop of Thrissur is a good example. The bishop was highly critical of Manmohan Singh's stance in 2006 that Muslims should get preference over the national assets. Though we Christians too are minorities, the Congress Government and the CPI(M) appease the Muslim population and this has to be condemned,\" said Kevin Peter. He said there is a perceived change in the attitude of Christian community towards the BJP.\n\nThe crowd that had gathered to listen to Narendra Modi and greet him whenever he visited Kerala is proof of his ever growing popularity in the State. \"Those who are not members of the BJP too find hope in Modi and it is a signal of the political churning that is happening in the State,\" said P Sujathan, former editor. Kerala Kaumudi.\n\nThe electorate in the State believe that the BJP is likely to win at Thiruvananthapuram (Rajeev Chandrasekhar) and Thrissur (Suresh Gopi) while the party's firebrand leader Shobha Surendran at Alappuzha and Anil Antony (Pathanamthitta) likely to pull off shocks. Anti-incumbency wave against Pinarayi Vijayan is very high and voters themselves ask what is the fun in casting votes for the CPI(M). \"Anyway, once they cross Kerala borders, they are friends in INDI.Alliance,\" said T G Mohan Das, political commentator.\n\nBoth the UDF and the LDF has a deadly electoral weapon with them- wholesale transfer of votes to each other in constituencies where the BJP has some advantage.

At the end of the high-voltage campaign, Mr. Kuriakose interacted with people from an earth mover.\n\nNDA constituent Bharat Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS)'s candidate Sangeetha Vishwanathan conducted a roadshow at Thodupuzha town and attended the finale at the Thodupuzha Gandhi Square.\n\nHowever, during the final lap of the election campaign at Thodupuzha town, an altercation was reported between UDF and LDF workers. UDF leaders alleged that LDF workers tried to encroach on the allotted area of the UDF candidate, which resulted in a clash. The police reached the spot and removed LDF workers from the spot.\n\nAs the election campaign entered the final phase, the utilisation of MP funds became a major point of discussion in the constituency. In a statement, LDF chief election agent C.V. Varghese claimed that the Idukki MP and UDF candidate Dean Kuriakose did not utilise \u20b93.66 crore from the fund.\n\nMr. Kuriakose and the UDF leadership countered this, asserting that the funds had been fully utilised.\n\nHowever, the Idukki Collector warned Mr. Varghese against publishing any notice without updating data from the utilisation of the MP fund. According to leaders, UDF district chairman Joy Vettikuzhi approached the Collector over Mr. Varghese's statement.

The CPI(M) is probably aiming at increasing the number of MPs to maintain its national party status. At present, the party has nothing to fear as the Left coalition is intact until the 2026 Assembly polls in Kerala. Meanwhile, the BJP is laying the groundwork for the next Assembly polls.\n\nBattle for Kerala | Infographics\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) should roughly share the 20 seats in Kerala. However, the present situation appears to be exceptional, similar to that in 2019, even though nearly all pre-poll surveys indicate a third term for the BJP-led government at the Centre.\n\nFor the ruling CPI(M) in Kerala, its survival instinct has become relevant in Parliament, as it had won just a seat, Alappuzha, in a cliff-hanger of sorts in the 2019 elections. By transforming electoral battles into war zones through its muscular party machinery, the CPI(M) may notch up additional seats this time. That would mean it has not only bucked the anti-incumbency but also wooed the electorate through organisational heft and meticulous planning, including pitching heavyweight candidates to take on Congress MPs.\n\nLok Sabha polls 2024 in Kerala | Constituency watch\n\nPolitically on a strong footing, the CPI(M) has been cautious in gauging the electorate, which often becomes disenchanted with the ruling dispensation in the State for a multitude of reasons, even during the Lok Sabha polls. Through vigorous campaigning against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the party leadership is anticipating that the UDF will not secure the same 65% of Muslim and 70% of Christian votes as in the 2019 polls. Even if the party underperforms, it has the option for course correction, given it still has two full years before the Assembly polls, sources said.\n\nStriving to replicate 2019 success\n\nFor the Congress party, the leadership is striving to replicate the success of the 2019 polls banking on the anti-incumbency against the Kerala government. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's candidacy in Wayanad is expected to once again attract support from the Muslim and Christian communities, boosting the electoral chances of Congress candidates in constituencies in north Kerala.\n\nHowever, if the party fails to secure 10 or more seats, it could likely disrupt coalition politics, with the anti-Congress faction in the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) upping the ante against the Congress leadership. The bone of contention between the Congress and the IUML over the winnable Rajya Sabha seat, which falls vacant in July, will further escalate, particularly if Shafi Parambil of the Congress wins from the politically and communally sensitive constituency of Vadakara, as the latter would take credit for the victory in the sweepstakes.\n\nFor the BJP, the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi five times to Kerala this year and his manoeuvred outreach programmes to various Christian denominations has turned bipolar State polity in a tripolar character in many constituencies this time. The party is aspiring to make a quantum jump in its vote share.\n\nSecuring a seat or two would be a bonus for the BJP, but the party leadership is apprehensive about a potential Muslim consolidation against winnable candidates, particularly in Thiruvananthapuram and Thrissur constituencies.\n\nEyes on turnout\n\nHowever, all parties are keeping their fingers crossed regarding the turnout as well. Historically, a high turnout has often benefitted the UDF, but it is not always the case, as various results suggest.\n\nIn the 2019 polls, the turnout was 81.3%, with the UDF winning 19 out of the 20 seats. In the 2014 elections, the LDF, including Independents, won eight seats. The turnout then was 73.9%. In the 2009 polls, when the turnout was 73.5%, the CPI(M) secured four seats, while the Congress won 13 seats. In 2004, when the turnout was 71.2%, the UDF won just one seat - Ponnani by E. Ahamed of the IUML. Except for one seat secured by the now-defunct Indian Federal Democratic Party, won by P.C. Thomas, who was with the BJP-led NDA, the LDF emerged victorious in the remaining 18 seats.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_India_(Marxist)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of India (Marxist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Indian_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2019 Indian general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_(Amendment)_Act,_2019", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Democratic_Front_(Kerala)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Democratic Front (Kerala)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Democratic_Front", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left Democratic Front"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Union_Muslim_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Union Muslim League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Kerala", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Kerala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayanad_district", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wayanad district"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wayanad district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alappuzha", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alappuzha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alappuzha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Indian_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2014 Indian general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shafi_Parambil", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shafi Parambil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._C._Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "P.

While UDF, led by Congress, is banking heavily on its clout as the main opponent of BJP nationally, CPM-led LDF is also trying to emerge as a 'credible' contender by branding Congress as the 'B team' of BJP. UDF had won 19 of the 20 seats in the 2019 LS polls fought almost on the same lines.\n\nUDF initially appeared almost in disarray as the party and its netas functioned like members of a divided house.But now it appears that the public derision towards Congress has been submerged by a burgeoning anti-incumbency wave against the Pinarayi Vijayan govt, in office since 2016.\n\nWhen CM Vijayan came out all guns blazing against Congress and repeatedly questioned the integrity of its leaders, it seemed to be working in LDF's favour. \"How do you know Congress MPs won't defect to BJP?\" he asked. The defection of A K Antony's son Anil and K Karunakaran's daughter Padmaja Venugopal to BJP gave more credence to the attack. But it backfired almost irreparably when Rahul Gandhi tore into his claims and even asked why the CM was not in jail despite facing several allegations. Almost parallelly, a spat between CPM's K K Shailaja and Congress candidate Shafi Parambil worked to the latter's advantage as the CPM veteran could produce little evidence to prove her claims.\n\nUDF also emerged as the preferred side for Muslim parties, the support of which LDF enjoyed in the last assembly elections. SDPI, the political arm of the outlawed PFI, was the first to declare its support for Congress-led UDF. Welfare Party, the political face of Jamaat-e-Islami, followed suit. Following criticism from CPM and BJP, Congress functionaries declined SDPI's offer, but the latter was unfazed. SDPI claims it has 10,000-50,000 votes in at least 13 Lok Sabha constituencies. This also indicates that Muslims have not subscribed to CPM's claim that voters, especially minorities who voted in favour of Congress in 2019, got carried away by claims that Rahul Gandhi would become PM. Kerala being a state with 45% voters belonging to the minority communities, their support is decisive on all fronts.\n\nThrissur and Thiruvananthapuram are the only seats where BJP has put up a major fight. Being a three-corner contest, the chances of BJP candidate Suresh Gopi have brightened in Thrissur. Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar is taking on three-time MP Shashi Tharoor in Thiruvananthapuram. The lack of formidable allies and the failure to influence Christians have made BJP's prospects bleak this time, too, though it is expected to improve its vote share significantly.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bs_anil_kumar@timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "name": "Bs Anil Kumar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Democratic_Front", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Left Democratic Front"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Democratic_Front_(Kerala)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Democratic Front (Kerala)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinarayi_Vijayan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pinarayi Vijayan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_India_(Marxist)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of India (Marxist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padmaja_Venugopal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Padmaja Venugopal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shafi_Parambil", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shafi Parambil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social Democratic Party of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Karunakaran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

Shailaja, and another seeking action against the alleged attempt to communalise the election campaign through social media accounts.\n\nSniping, muckraking, political fireworks and final pitch to voters mark election eve 'silent campaigning'\n\nIn the first complaint, the LDF said that during an event to mark the culmination of the public campaigning at Anchuvilakku near Vadakara on April 24, the UDF activists raised slogans calling Ms. Shailaja a thief. The second complaint pertained to a communal message found in a WhatsApp group, run in the name of the Muslim Youth League, seeking votes for Mr. Shafi. Youth League activists, however, claimed that there was no such WhatsApp group.\n\nMeanwhile, the UDF also filed a complaint against K. Riyas, an assistant professor at the Government Arts and Science College, Kozhikode. The complaint said that Mr. Riyas, who had earlier been accused of making communal remarks through a Facebook account against Muslims, was found to have been assigned the duty of a presiding officer for the elections. The UDF demanded that Mr. Riyas be removed from the electoral responsibilities.\n\nEarlier, the LDF camp had sent a legal notice to B.

But, the people of Thiruvananthapuram want to move away from a time-warp that Thiruvananthapuram has been stuck in for several decades,\" he said.\n\nHe also accused his rivals of attempting to spread fear among various sections including minority communities. \"They have been striving to convince the Muslim community on who is the principal opposition to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). I have met many members of the community and they too aspire for growth, education, investments, skills and jobs. Such brazen strategies will not work for either of them,\" the BJP leader said.\n\nAttingal:\n\nThe LDF, UDF and NDA candidates in the Attingal constituency were busy with private programmes, including house visits and visiting areas where they could meet the maximum number of voters in a short span of time on the eve of polling day\n\n.LDF candidate V Joy visited colonies at Maikonam near Nagaroor in the Chirayinkeezhu taluk in the morning, while UDF candidate Adoor Prakash visited houses of voters, including marriage functions, and visited the election committee offices of the UDF in the constituency to take a final review of the polling arrangements. The campaign managers of all three candidates were also busy mobilising the maximum number of voters to firm up their vote bases as part of the silent campaign.\n\nFurther, they have coordinated the booth-level squads that made a last-minute effort to ensure their votes by knocking at the doors of people with voting slips in the morning. Meanwhile, NDA candidate V. Muraleedharan will cast his vote at Kottaram booth, Ulloor, in Thiruvananthapuram at 7 a.m., while Mr. Joy will vote at the Government LPS, Perunguzhi, at 7 a.m. Mr. Prakash will go to Konni in Pathanamthitta to exercise his franchise and is expected to return to Attingal by 9 a.m. (EOM)\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Democratic_Front", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Left Democratic Front"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashi_Tharoor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shashi Tharoor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiruvananthapuram", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thiruvananthapuram"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Thiruvananthapuram"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiruvananthapuram_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thiruvananthapuram district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Democratic_Front_(Kerala)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Democratic Front (Kerala)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shiva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parassala", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parassala"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kovalam", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kovalam"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neyyattinkara", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neyyattinkara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Neyyattinkara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirayinkeezhu_taluk", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chirayinkeezhu taluk"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konni,_Kerala", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Konni, Kerala"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V._Muraleedharan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "V.

One needs to wait until June 4 to know whether he meant what he said while interacting with newspersons.\n\nOutcome may favour UDF\n\nAnalysts differed to agree that the outcome may favour the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) thanks to strong anti-incumbency against the ruling CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front which is halfway through a rare second term. The results may point more to a negative vote to the LDF than an outright popular mandate for the UDF.\n\nWhile there is absolutely no singular decisive factor for voters to rally around this time, unlike the Sabarimala agitation of 2019, the anti-Modi wave too is conspicuous by its absence. In fact, the Prime Minister himself visited the state a number of times to pre-empt build-up of negative vibes against the BJP. His outreach to Christian votes, the X-factor in the electoral scheme of things, was noted for its intent and clarity of purpose.\n\nThree-cornered contests\n\nThe upshot is strong and intense three-cornered contests in a number of constituencies. Out of the 20, some are too close to call, while potential upsets could be in store in a few. The bugbear of cross voting/vote transfer on the day of polling can confound even the best predictive models while the swing factor in the form of undecided or marginal voters is often masked until the time they exercise their franchise.\n\nYoung, first voter numbers\n\nAn estimated 3.11 lakh voters in the 18-19 age group were added to the electoral rolls in the past few months. Their votes could prove decisive, though the number has reduced to 5,34,394 this year from 5,49,969 in 2019 due to migration on varied pursuits. Similarly, votes in the 20-29 age group has reduced by more than 2.5 lakh to 44,71,938 from 47,22,867, while those in the 30-39 age group fell by the biggest margin of three lakh to 54,28,204 this year from 57,67,127 of 2019.\n\nUnpredictable contests\n\nThis has rendered results unpredictable in Thiruvananthapuram and Thrissur, which are top picks among A-class seats for the BJP. Sitting MP Shashi Tharoor of the Congress is seeking a fourth term in the fight against Rajeev Chandrasekhar of the BJP, his toughest opponent till date. Chandrasekhar has taken special care to cover coastal areas which have proved BJP's Achilles' heel in past elections, while urban Hindu votes in Thiruvananthapuram, Vattiyoorkav and Nemom Assembly segments may back him.\n\nThrissur, toughest to crack\n\nThrissur may prove the toughest nut to crack, with an entrenched Rajya Sabha MP and actor Suresh Gopi of the BJP taking on K Muraleedharan of the Congress and popular MLA VS Sunil Kumar. The Prime Minister indicated that Gopi is his 'chosen one' by launching the election campaign from Thrissur, followed by more two more visits. Analysts say part of the Christian votes disillusioned with the LDF rule is likely to shift to the BJP, lending Gopi an outside chance in a clash of equals. This trend is likely to be replicated in other seats as well where Christians are a significant minority.\n\nLots at stake for CPI(M)\n\nConstituencies in the northern districts, traditional CPI(M) strongholds, too are witnessing tight contests, even photo finishes. Vadakara, Kannur, Palakkad and Alathur fall in this category. Any adverse results can upend the party's plans to retain national party status. Shailaja Teacher, former health minister, has run into a strong Congress candidate in a much younger Shafi Parambil in Vadakara. Vibes from the remaining 11 seats from where the party is contesting are not reassuring either.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on April 25, 2024",

[+] Geneva. Christopher Elliott Dianna and John Mellers had no idea what Swisstainable meant until they landed in Z\u00fcrich for a one-week train tour of Switzerland. That\u2019s when their tour guide, Rob Early, started to talk about Switzerland's ambitious sustainability initiatives meant to encourage visitors to experience nature, Swiss culture, local products \u2014 and to stay longer. The Swiss even have a word for it: Swisstainable. \"We didn't realize we were on a sustainability tour,\" says John Mellers, an engineer from Oviedo, Fla. It's a common reaction. Technically, Mellers and his wife were on Trafalgar's Contrasts of Switzerland tour. But it's a rail tour with an agenda. Along the way, there are stops that showcase Switzerland's next-level commitment to sustainability, including in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland's financial capital, St. Moritz, Zermatt, Geneva and Lucerne. It turns out Swisstainability is a thing, with clearly defined goals that challenge the way visitors think about their environment. Organizers hope tour participants will come away with ideas about how to improve sustainability back home, but it is all done in such an understated way that if you're not paying attention, you could miss the message.

Russia\u2019s War On Ukraine: News And Information From Ukraine Why a Swisstainable tour? Trafalgar already had a popular one-week train tour, but when Switzerland rolled out its Swisstainable designation, it saw an opportunity to explore ways to reduce its footprint even further. It decided to turn its train tour into a Swisstainable adventure. How do you make a tour Swisstainable? Use the train. In the past, guests' luggage didn't come on the train with them because there was no storage space. Instead, Trafalgar used trucks to transport the suitcases to the next hotel. In becoming a Swisstainable tour, it found a way to also have the luggage delivered by train. Emphasize local food. Most of the meals on Trafalgar's Swisstainable itinerary are locally sourced or from the neighboring region. Most of the food is organic and the majority of restaurant providers have some sort of management system in place to reduce, recycle or upcycle their waste. The whole point of sustainability in tourism is making it accessible for guests so that it is enjoyable. Screen your partners. The tour operator also screened its hotel and restaurant partners to make sure they were dedicated to sustainability. Switzerland offers numerous ways to certify a company's sustainability. Trafalgar says it was keen to reduce the impact of its passengers while promoting local food and experiences. But what's it like to be on a sustainability tour? Maxime Sother, owner of Ch\u00e2teau de Malessert, an organic winery near Geneva, Switzerland. Christopher Elliott What does a Swisstainable tour do? Trafalgar's Swisstainable tour shows off some of Switzerland's marquee destinations with a sustainability angle. Among the highlights are Switzerland's famous Glacier Express, which has a strong reputation for sustainability, and Zermatt, which has banned gas-powered vehicles in the city. There's also a tour of Ch\u00e2teau de Malessert, a sustainable family winery near Geneva. Maxime Sother, the winery's owner, says when he took over in 2020, he removed chemical pesticides and created his own oak barrels in an effort to become sustainable. As he wrapped up a tour of his family farm on a recent summer afternoon, Sother said the goal wasn't to create a wine that people wanted to enjoy because they were sustainable, but to make wines that were excellent \u2014 and happened to be sustainable. \"It has to be good wine,\" he says. For visitors from the United States, it's sometimes difficult to wrap their heads around the sustainability imperatives driving Swiss tourism. They struggle to understand why there are no washcloths in their bathrooms or why there is a $5 deposit for a second room key. (If you don't return it to be recycled, they charge you $5.) \"But then there's that lightbulb moment,\" says Early, the Trafalgar tour guide. It can happen any time. On the Mellers' tour in late June, it was the moment participants saw the flooded Matter Vispa River in the iconic ski area of Zermatt. Other times, it happens more slowly \u2014 as in, during the eight-hour train ride on the iconic Glacier Express train between St. Moritz and Zermatt. There, you can see the magnificent glaciers of the Swiss Alps, which are slowly receding as temperatures warm. If you're a skier, you can bemoan the fact that year-round skiing, long a staple of the Swiss mountain experience, may soon be a thing of the past. Early says a Swisstainability tour is full of \"aha\" moments when many group members understand that climate change is happening. There's a sense of urgency that if the tourism industry doesn't get sustainability right, there might not be anything left to sustain.

Most of those comments are reserved for the Swiss railroad system. It is fast, efficient, expensive and runs on 95% sustainable energy. When a flooded river and a train accident disrupted the Mellers' rail tour on several occasions, the Swiss railroads were lightning-fast in their recovery. \"I really liked the Swiss trains,\" says Dianna Mellers, who has traveled throughout Europe by rail. \"They were really the best we've seen.\" John Mellers says he was impressed by Switzerland's sustainability efforts and that many were import-worthy. Mellers, who works in the energy sector, says there's a tendency elsewhere to impose ideas about sustainability \u2014 particularly green energy \u2014 on other places. He says he was impressed by the way Switzerland leaned toward hydroelectric and nuclear power, both of which are non-carbon-emitting forms of energy. But Switzerland's ideas suggest a more incremental approach to sustainability that could be copied by other destinations. A low-key approach to sustainability Like the Swiss themselves, a Swisstainability tour is modest and understated. There are no declarations of impending doom or lectures about destroying the planet. It's more \"show\" than \"tell.\" And really, all it takes to change your mind about sustainability is a week spent using Switzerland's fast and always-punctual trains. Or seeing a disappearing glacier. Or witnessing firsthand what an alpine village without cars feels like. Sadly, some Swiss sustainability initiatives are unlikely to gain traction elsewhere. For example, the country's almost obsessive recycling programs probably would never work in the United States. And banning gas-powered cars from a city might be impractical in most major tourist destinations. If nothing else, Switzerland's low-key approach to sustainability is a worthy tourist attraction in and of itself. And in a time when some people are thoughtlessly booking the same old vacations, what's the harm in challenging your conventions? This is part two of a series on sustainable tourism in Switzerland. Here\u2019s part one on Z\u00fcrich\u2019s sustainability efforts. Next up: Grindelwald tries to take sustainability to new heights. Check out my website.

Please, support the peace summit with your personal leadership and participation,\u201d Zelensky added, addressing Biden and Xi directly in English in a video posted on the social media platform Telegram. Switzerland has invited around 160 countries to a peace summit on June 15-16 to discuss possible ways to achieve lasting peace in Ukraine. Russia, which invaded Ukraine more than two years ago, has not received an invitation. According to Zelensky, Moscow is currently preparing another attack in northern Ukraine after a recent offensive near the northeastern city of Kharkiv. Military experts say another Russian offensive in the northern Sumy region is possible. Russia\u2019s aim could be to exploit its manpower and material superiority, overstretch the Ukrainian defence lines and thus achieve the collapse of the Ukrainian front line. Kharkiv, which lies only 30 kilometres from the Russian border, has been one of the worst-hit cities in Moscow\u2019s bombing campaign since its invasion of Ukraine in February, 2022.

(AP) - Veteran diplomat Martin S. Indyk, an author and leader at prominent U.S. think tanks who devoted years to finding a path toward peace in the Middle East, died Thursday. He was 73.\n\nHis wife, Gahl Hodges Burt, confirmed in a phone call that he died from complications of esophageal cancer at the couple's home in New Fairfield, Connecticut.\n\nThe Council on Foreign Relations, where Indyk had been a distinguished fellow in U.S. and Middle East diplomacy since 2018, called him a \"rare, trusted voice within an otherwise polarized debate on U.S. policy toward the Middle East.\"\n\nA native of Australia, Indyk served as U.S. ambassador to Israel from 1995 to 1997 and from 2000 to 2001. He was special envoy for the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations during former President Barack Obama's administration, from 2013 to 2014.\n\nWhen he resigned in 2014 to join The Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, it had symbolized the latest failed effort by the U.S. to forge an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. He continued as Obama\u00b4s special adviser on Mideast peace issues.\n\n\"Ambassador Indyk has invested decades of his extraordinary career to the mission of helping Israelis and Palestinians achieve a lasting peace. It\u00b4s the cause of Martin\u00b4s career, and I\u00b4m grateful for the wisdom and insight he\u00b4s brought to our collective efforts,\" then-Secretary of State John Kerry said at the time, in a statement.\n\nFILE - Martin S.

(AP Photo/Charles Dharapak, File)\n\nIn a May 22 social media post on X, amid the continuing war in Gaza, Indyk urged Israelis to \"wake up,\" warning them their government \"is leading you into greater isolation and ruin\" after a proposed peace deal was rejected. Indyk also called out Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in June on X, accusing him of playing \"the martyr in a crisis he manufactured,\" after Netanyahu accused the U.S. of withholding weapons that Israel needed.\n\n\"Israel is at war on four fronts: with Hamas in Gaza; with Houthis in Yemen; with Hezbollah in Lebanon; and with Iran overseeing the operations,\" Indyk wrote on June 19. \"What does Netanyahu do? Attack the United States based on a lie that he made up! The Speaker and Leader should withdraw his invitation to address Congress until he recants and apologizes.\"\n\nIndyk also served as special assistant to former President Bill Clinton and senior director for Near East and South Asian affairs at the National Security Council from 1993 to 1995. He served as assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs in the U.S. Department of State from 1997 to 2000.\n\nBesides serving at Brookings and the Council on Foreign Relations, Indyk worked at the Center for Middle East Policy and was the founding executive director of The Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Indyk's successor at the Washington Institute called him \"a true American success story.\"\n\n\"A native of Australia, he came to Washington to have an impact on the making of American Middle East Policy and that he surely did - as pioneering scholar, insightful analyst and remarkably effective policy entrepreneur,\" Robert Satloff said. \"He was a visionary who not only founded an organization based on the idea that wise public policy is rooted in sound research, he embodied it.\"\n\nIndyk wrote or co-wrote multiple books, including \"Innocent Abroad: An Intimate Account of American Peace Diplomacy in the Middle East\" and \"Master of the Game: Henry Kissinger and the Art of Middle East Diplomacy,\" which was published in 2021.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

Indyk, Diplomat Who Sought Middle East Peace, Dies at 73", "body": "Mark Landler covered the Middle East peace process as a diplomatic correspondent and White House correspondent.\n\nMartin S. Indyk, a diplomat, author and foreign-policy thinker who spent decades trying to solve the riddle of Middle East peace, twice as the United States ambassador to Israel and later as a special envoy for President Barack Obama, died on Thursday at his home in New Fairfield, Conn. He was 73.\n\nThe cause was complications of esophageal cancer, his wife, Gahl Burt, said.\n\nAn Australian-bred academic with a quick wit, blunt manner and pro-Israel pedigree, Mr. Indyk cut an unconventional figure in the State Department of the 1990s. But he propelled himself to the heart of America's efforts to make peace between the Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nIn 2013, he shuttled from one side to the other as Mr. Obama's emissary. Fifteen years earlier, he helped craft an agreement between them at the Wye Plantation in Maryland on behalf of President Bill Clinton.\n\nMr. Indyk balanced a fervent commitment to Israel, rooted in his time as a graduate student in Jerusalem during the Yom Kippur War in 1973, with an abiding skepticism of Jewish settlements, which he saw as blighting the prospect of a two-state solution, which would allow Israelis and Palestinians to end decades of bloody conflict.\n\nIn his final months, he watched in dismay as Hamas fighters attacked Israeli citizens, prompting a ferocious Israeli military retaliation in the Gaza Strip. For Mr. Indyk, the violence carried a tragic echo of what he had referred to in an interview with the journal Foreign Affairs as Israel's \"hubris\" before the Yom Kippur War.\n\n\"That same hubris has manifested itself again in recent years, even as many people told the Israelis that the situation with the Palestinians was unsustainable,\" Mr. Indyk said. \"They thought the problem was under control. But now all their assumptions have been blown up, just like they were in 1973.\"\n\nMr. Indyk described the Yom Kippur War as a \"defining moment\" in his life. At Hebrew University of Jerusalem, he listened to BBC radio reports about Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger's efforts to negotiate a cease-fire. (He later wrote an admiring book about Mr. Kissinger's Middle East diplomacy, drawing on interviews with him.) Mr. Indyk volunteered on a kibbutz in southern Israel and considered immigrating.\n\nInstead, he returned to Australia, where he had grown up in a Jewish family, to finish his Ph.D. in international relations at the Australian National University. In 1982, he moved with his young family to New York for a sabbatical at Columbia University.\n\nMr. Indyk began in Washington as a researcher for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the influential pro-Israel lobbying group, before founding a think tank, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\n\nHis first job in government was on the National Security Council, where he soon became one of Mr. Clinton's principal advisers on the Middle East. In 1995, the president appointed him ambassador to Israel, making him the first Jewish American envoy to that country (he had become a naturalized American). Seven months after his arrival, Mr. Indyk consoled Leah Rabin in a hospital after her husband, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, was assassinated by a right-wing Jewish law student.\n\nMr. Indyk returned to Washington in 1997 to be assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs. In that post he helped negotiate the Wye River Memorandum, linking Israel's phased withdrawal from the West Bank to Palestinian pledges to crack down on terrorism. Mr. Clinton sent Mr. Indyk back to Israel for a second stint as ambassador in 2000, reflecting the credibility he had built with leaders on both sides and Mr. Clinton's hunger to achieve a breakthrough.\n\n\"He brought enormous talent and skill to the task of diplomacy,\" said Dennis B. Ross, a fellow peace negotiator in the Clinton administration. \"But he brought decency and honesty to it as well. His passion for making peace drove him.\"\n\nStrobe Talbott, another Clinton official who worked with Mr. Indyk subsequently at the Brookings Institution, said, \"He never despaired in seemingly intractable situations.\"\n\nMr. Clinton's efforts to broker a deal between the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, and the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, ultimately fell short. And Mr. Indyk returned again to Washington, where he served as executive vice president at Brookings and advised Democratic presidential hopefuls. In 2009, he published \"Innocent Abroad: An Intimate Account of American Peace Diplomacy in the Middle East,\" a chronicle of his work during the Clinton years.\n\nAt Brookings, Mr. Indyk faced an awkward moment. The New York Times reported in 2014 that Qatar, a backer of Hamas, had donated $14.8 million to fund two projects at the institute. Brookings was one of several think tanks that had accepted money from foreign governments. Mr. Indyk defended the arrangement, but critics said it compromised Brookings' neutrality.\n\nSome Israeli officials grumbled that it also raised questions about his impartiality as an envoy, though there was never evidence he had tilted against the Israelis. In 2018, he left Brookings to become the Lowy distinguished fellow in U.S.-Middle East diplomacy at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.\n\nMartin Sean Indyk was born in London on July 1, 1951, to John and Mary Indyk. He was raised in Sydney, Australia, where his father was a surgeon. Mr. Indyk received his bachelor's degree in international relations from the University of Sydney in 1972.\n\nMr. Indyk, who was awarded the Order of Australia medal last December for his contributions to foreign policy, recalled being rejected by Australia's diplomatic service after he clashed with his interviewers over the Vietnam War. \"My whole career path went out the window,\" he said. But that stinging setback, he said, set him on a different path that led to Jerusalem and Washington.\n\nIn addition to his wife, Mr. Indyk is survived by two children, Sarah and Jacob; a sister, Shelley; a brother, the academic Ivor Indyk; two stepchildren, Christopher and Caroline Burt; and five grandchildren. His first marriage, to Jill Collier, ended in divorce.\n\nFor all his good will in Israel, some Israeli officials were rankled by Mr. Indyk's criticism, a candor that friends attributed to his Australian upbringing. In 2014, he was fingered as the unnamed \"senior American official\" who told the columnist Nahum Barnea that Israel was to blame for the failure of negotiations with the Palestinians because it had approved new settlements while talks were underway.\n\nMr. Indyk did not let up. Last year, on a visit to Israel, he joined a rally against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposed overhaul of the judiciary, and he continued to criticize what he viewed as Mr. Netanyahu's cynical approach to the peace process.\n\nBut Mr. Indyk's words were delivered more in sorrow than anger. He was serious about his Jewish faith, studying the Torah in a group with other prominent Washingtonians. He was a passionate Zionist, who believed Israel's survival was best secured by a lasting agreement with the Palestinians. And he was eternally frustrated that successive American presidents had been unable to strike that elusive deal.\n\n\"What is it about the United States that its leaders feel obliged to sally forth with such virtuous determination to transform the bazaars and back alleys of the Middle East?\" Mr. Indyk wrote. \"And what is it about the Middle East that holds them up, sets them back and sucks them down into its swamps?\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_landler@nytimes.com", "name": "Mark Landler", "type":

His wife, Gahl Hodges Burt, said the cause was esophageal cancer, The Washington Post reported. He died at home in New Fairfield, Connecticut.\n\nIndyk, who grew up in Australia, twice served as U.S. ambassador to Israel and was assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs, all during the Clinton Administration. He later served as a peace negotiator.\n\nHe was tireless, and never shied from a confrontation. He never lost his Australian accent even as he rose to the heights of U.S. diplomacy, nor his sarcastic wit.\n\n\"Ambassador Indyk calls it as he sees it,\" an Obama administration official told the Forward in 2014, the last time Indyk had an official U.S. role, as a special envoy supervising the 2013-2014 Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. \"It's the Australian in him, perhaps. He's more frank than most diplomats, but he is speaking out because he cares about Israel's future.\"\n\nAs recently as last month, Indyk deployed typically biting rhetoric to excoriate one of his nemeses, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but in terms that made clear that what most upset Indyk most was the danger he believed Netanyahu posed to Israel.\n\n\"Israel is at war on four fronts: with Hamas in Gaza; with Houthis in Yemen; with Hezbollah in Lebanon; and with Iran overseeing the operations,\" Indyk said on June 19 on X, a day after Netyanyahu claimed -- and the Biden administration denied -- that President Joe Biden was withholding weapons from Israel.\n\n\"What does Netanyahu do?\" Indyk continued. \"Attack the United States based on a lie that he made up! The Speaker and Leader should withdraw his invitation to address Congress until he recants and apologizes.\" (Netanyahu did not recant, was not disinvited and delivered the speech on Wednesday.)\n\nIndyk was an unusual diplomat in that he rarely held back, in public or private interactions. He may be the only U.S. diplomat to have the distinction of enduring public anti-Jewish slurs from both Israeli and Arab officials.\n\nOnce, while serving as U.S. ambassador to Israel in 1997, Indyk seemed close to coming to blows with a hardline right-wing Israeli politician, Rehavam Ze'evi, who called him a \"yehudon,\" the Hebrew equivalent of an antisemitic slur. Ze'evi was angry at Indyk for pushing Israel to make concessions in negotiations with the Palestinians.\n\n\"The last time someone called me a Jew-boy I was 15 years old and he got a punch in the face,\" Indyk, then the U.S. ambassador to Israel, told Ze'evi at a public event.\n\nZe'evi and Israel's government later apologized for the slur.\n\nA year after that, Indyk was promoted to assistant secretary of state, in part because he wanted out of the ambassador's job because he found it so hard to get along with Netanyahu, then in his first term.\n\nIndyk nonetheless kept a hand in trying to bring about Israeli-Palestinian peace, but was also in charge of a vexing challenge for the Clinton administration -- how to contain both Iraq and Iran, two countries that were deeply antagonistic to the United States but also deadly enemies to one another.\n\nOnce again, he came under antisemitic attack. In a letter to the U.N. Security Council, just 15 months after the Ze'evi incident, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf wrote, \"The statements of the United States Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk, who is a known Jew and Zionist, are simply an official and documented reaffirmation of the enmity of the United States administration toward Iraq.\"\n\nBill Richardson, then the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, demanded an apology, which he did not receive.\n\nIndyk was born in London and raised in Australia. He traced his ambitions to become a peacemaker to 1973, when he was studying at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, during the Yom Kippur War.\n\n\"It taught me just how fragile Israel's existence was and how central the United States is to war and peace in the Middle East,\" Indyk said in 1995 of his experience in Israel during Senate confirmation hearings for his first diplomatic role, as U.S. ambassador to Israel.\n\nHe volunteered on a kibbutz in 1973, and considered settling in Israel. Instead, he returned to Australia and launched a career in government as a Middle East analyst.\n\nIndyk came to the United States in 1982 on a sabbatical and soon found work with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the pro-Israel lobby, where he was mentored by Steve Rosen, AIPAC's hard-charging director of foreign policy who saw in Indyk a version of himself -- impatient with niceties and eager to find out what exactly was at the essence of the vague bromides U.S. diplomats dispensed.\n\nIndyk and Rosen noticed that conservative think tanks, a relatively recent phenomenon, were putting out policy papers that were soon becoming Reagan administration policy. It was a revelation. A think tank could come up with detail-rich policies, and find officials eager to claim the plans as their own.\n\nSo in 1985 Indyk launched the Washington Institute in partnership with Barb Weinberg, a top AIPAC donor. The think tank remains influential, with direct lines into the governments of the United States, Israel and multiple Arab nations.\n\n\"From the outset, Indyk emphasized bipartisan approaches to regional problems and outreach that transcended traditional zero-sum thinking about the Arab-Israeli conflict, packaged in highly accessible formats that brought the analytical product of Institute experts directly to readers across the government,\" the Washington Institute said in its memorial for Indyk.\n\nAIPAC also mourned Indyk, even though in recent years if he attended an AIPAC event, there were tensions over his tendency to criticize Israel's right-wing governments and their pro-settlement policies.\n\n\"Martin's leadership helped make the Institute one of Washington's premier foreign policy research organizations,\" AIPAC said.\n\nIn presidential election years, AIPAC reaches out to candidates for brief meetings to assess their Israel policy, and to offer advice. Rosen scheduled a meeting in the 1992 presidential cycle with Bill and Hillary Clinton and had a hunch: Indyk and the Clintons, all three infatuated with the deep intricacies of policy, would get along.\n\nIndyk, directing the Washington Institute, was no longer with AIPAC, but Rosen asked him to come to the meeting. At the meeting with the Clintons, the usually loquacious Rosen sat back and watched history unfold as the three clicked with each other. A scheduled 20-minute meeting stretched for hours.\n\nThe Clintons were not afraid to display their ignorance, asking blunt questions. Indyk intuited they would also not be afraid to hear and absorb long, complex answers which would prompt more questions.\n\n\"I like it when you're around, Martin,\" Clinton once joked, \"because you and I both have funny accents.\"\n\nOnce elected president, Clinton brought Indyk on to the National Security Council as a Middle East specialist. Indyk played a central role in bringing about the Oslo accords, and the September 1993 handshake between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat.\n\nWithin two years, Indyk, who became a U.S. citizen, made history when Clinton named him the first Jewish U.S. ambassador to Israel.\n\nIndk left government with Clinton in 2001 and watched his dreams of a two-state outcome crumble under the pressures of the Second Intifada, and increased Palestinian-Israeli mistrust.\n\n\"He battled cancer the way he lived his life, with purpose and an unrelenting spirit,\" tweeted Dennis Ross, who served as a peace negotiator alongside Indyk. \"Martin lived a life of meaning; he pursued peace-making between Israel and its neighbors with passion, skill and decency.\"\n\nAfter leaving government, he transitioned into permanent think tank mode, housed for years at the Brookings Institution and then at the Council on Foreign Relations. He briefly returned to government under President Barack Obama to supervise the 2013-2014 peace talks, the last serious round of negotiations, which were also unsuccessful.\n\nHe claimed not to have patience for Jewish and Israeli agonizing over whether American leaders liked them, lashing out in 2011 at Bush administration alumnus Elliott Abrams, who fretted on a panel they were both on that Obama had \"no great love in his heart for Israel.\"\n\n\"It's time to grow up,\" Indyk said. \"We should get over the question of whether he loves me or he loves me not, and focus on [the] question of finding a solution to conflict with the Palestinians. When Israel decides by itself to solve that problem, it will have the overwhelmingly cuddly support of the US President.\"\n\nAnd yet, Indyk was no stranger to sentiment. Taking on his last government role in 2013, he said he still held dear the notion that one day, he could help forge an Israeli-Palestinian peace.\n\n\"Fifteen years ago my son, Jacob, who was 13 at the time, designed a screensaver for my computer,\" he said, addressing then-Secretary of State John Kerry, who selected Indyk for the job. \"It consisted of a simple question that flashed across the screen constantly: Dad, is there peace in the Middle East yet?\"\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Gahl Hodges Burt, two children from his first marriage, Jacob and Sarah, and five grandchildren.",

(AP) -- Veteran diplomat Martin S. Indyk, an author and leader at prominent U.S. think tanks who devoted years to finding a path toward peace in the Middle East, died Thursday. He was 73.\n\nHis wife, Gahl Hodges Burt, confirmed in a phone call that he died from complications of esophageal cancer at the couple's home in New Fairfield, Connecticut.\n\nThe Council on Foreign Relations, where Indyk had been a distinguished fellow in U.S. and Middle East diplomacy since 2018, called him a \"rare, trusted voice within an otherwise polarized debate on U.S. policy toward the Middle East.\"\n\nA native of Australia, Indyk served as U.S. ambassador to Israel from 1995 to 1997 and from 2000 to 2001. He was special envoy for the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations during former President Barack Obama's administration, from 2013 to 2014.\n\nWhen he resigned in 2014 to join The Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, it had symbolized the latest failed effort by the U.S. to forge an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. He continued as Obama's special adviser on Mideast peace issues.\n\n\"Ambassador Indyk has invested decades of his extraordinary career to the mission of helping Israelis and Palestinians achieve a lasting peace. It's the cause of Martin's career, and I'm grateful for the wisdom and insight he's brought to our collective efforts,\" then-Secretary of State John Kerry said at the time, in a statement.\n\nIn a May 22 social media post on X, amid the continuing war in Gaza, Indyk urged Israelis to \"wake up,\" warning them their government \"is leading you into greater isolation and ruin\" after a proposed peace deal was rejected. Indyk also called out Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in June on X, accusing him of playing \"the martyr in a crisis he manufactured,\" after Netanyahu accused the U.S. of withholding weapons that Israel needed.\n\n\"Israel is at war on four fronts: with Hamas in Gaza; with Houthis in Yemen; with Hezbollah in Lebanon; and with Iran overseeing the operations,\" Indyk wrote on June 19. \"What does Netanyahu do? Attack the United States based on a lie that he made up! The Speaker and Leader should withdraw his invitation to address Congress until he recants and apologizes.\"\n\nIndyk also served as special assistant to former President Bill Clinton and senior director for Near East and South Asian affairs at the National Security Council from 1993 to 1995. He served as assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs in the U.S. Department of State from 1997 to 2000.\n\nBesides serving at Brookings and the Council on Foreign Relations, Indyk worked at the Center for Middle East Policy and was the founding executive director of The Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Indyk's successor at the Washington Institute called him \"a true American success story.\"\n\n\"A native of Australia, he came to Washington to have an impact on the making of American Middle East Policy and that he surely did - as pioneering scholar, insightful analyst and remarkably effective policy entrepreneur,\" Robert Satloff said. \"He was a visionary who not only founded an organization based on the idea that wise public policy is rooted in sound research, he embodied it.\"\n\nIndyk wrote or co-wrote multiple books, including \"Innocent Abroad: An Intimate Account of American Peace Diplomacy in the Middle East\" and \"Master of the Game: Henry Kissinger and the Art of Middle East Diplomacy,\" which was published in 2021.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

He moved to the United States in 1982 to serve as a visiting professor and fellow at Columbia University, becoming a U.S. citizen in 1993.\n\nThe top Middle East policy adviser on Clinton's National Security Council before his tours in Israel and time at the State Department, Indyk was deeply involved in Clinton's failed 2000 effort to coax the Israelis and Palestinians to a peace deal. He wrote a book about the experience, \"Innocent Abroad: An Intimate Account of American Peace Diplomacy in the Middle East.\"\n\nResigning as Middle East peace envoy in 2014 following the collapse of Israeli-Palestinian talks, Indyk returned to the world of policy analysis. On his departure from government, Secretary of State John Kerry praised Indyk as an indefatigable diplomat who had dedicated decades of his career to trying to achieve peace.\n\nMore recently, Indyk was a leading scholar on Middle East policy at the Brookings Institution and the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nHis books also included \"Master of the Game: Henry Kissinger and the Art of Middle East Diplomacy,\" published in 2021.\n\n(Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; Additional reporting by Rami Ayyub and Susan Heavey; Editing by Leslie Adler)\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE",

He moved to the United States in 1982 to serve as a visiting professor and fellow at Columbia University, becoming a U.S. citizen in 1993.\n\nThe top Middle East policy adviser on Clinton's National Security Council before his tours in Israel and time at the State Department, Indyk was deeply involved in Clinton's failed 2000 effort to coax the Israelis and Palestinians to a peace deal. He wrote a book about the experience, \"Innocent Abroad: An Intimate Account of American Peace Diplomacy in the Middle East.\"\n\nResigning as Middle East peace envoy in 2014 following the collapse of Israeli-Palestinian talks, Indyk returned to the world of policy analysis. On his departure from government, Secretary of State John Kerry praised Indyk as an indefatigable diplomat who had dedicated decades of his career to trying to achieve peace.\n\nMore recently, Indyk was a leading scholar on Middle East policy at the Brookings Institution and the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nHis books also included \"Master of the Game: Henry Kissinger and the Art of Middle East Diplomacy,\" published in 2021.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

His wife, Gahl Hodges Burt, said the cause was esophageal cancer, The Washington Post reported. He died at home in New Fairfield, Connecticut.\n\nIndyk, who grew up in Australia, twice served as U.S. ambassador to Israel and was assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs, all during the Clinton Administration. He later served as a peace negotiator.\n\nHe was tireless, and never shied from a confrontation. He never lost his Australian accent even as he rose to the heights of U.S. diplomacy, nor his sarcastic wit.\n\n\"Ambassador Indyk calls it as he sees it,\" an Obama administration official told the Forward in 2014, the last time Indyk had an official U.S. role, as a special envoy supervising the 2013-2014 Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. \"It's the Australian in him, perhaps. He's more frank than most diplomats, but he is speaking out because he cares about Israel's future.\"\n\nAs recently as last month, Indyk deployed typically biting rhetoric to excoriate one of his nemeses, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but in terms that made clear that what most upset Indyk most was the danger he believed Netanyahu posed to Israel.\n\n\"Israel is at war on four fronts: with Hamas in Gaza; with Houthis in Yemen; with Hezbollah in Lebanon; and with Iran overseeing the operations,\" Indyk said on June 19 on X, a day after Netyanyahu claimed -- and the Biden administration denied -- that President Joe Biden was withholding weapons from Israel.\n\n\"What does Netanyahu do?\" Indyk continued. \"Attack the United States based on a lie that he made up! The Speaker and Leader should withdraw his invitation to address Congress until he recants and apologizes.\" (Netanyahu did not recant, was not disinvited and delivered the speech on Wednesday.)\n\nIndyk was an unusual diplomat in that he rarely held back, in public or private interactions. He may be the only U.S. diplomat to have the distinction of enduring public anti-Jewish slurs from both Israeli and Arab officials.\n\nOnce, while serving as U.S. ambassador to Israel in 1997, Indyk seemed close to coming to blows with a hardline right-wing Israeli politician, Rehavam Ze'evi, who called him a \"yehudon,\" the Hebrew equivalent of an antisemitic slur. Ze'evi was angry at Indyk for pushing Israel to make concessions in negotiations with the Palestinians.\n\n\"The last time someone called me a Jew-boy I was 15 years old and he got a punch in the face,\" Indyk, then the U.S. ambassador to Israel, told Ze'evi at a public event.\n\nZe'evi and Israel's government later apologized for the slur.\n\nA year after that, Indyk was promoted to assistant secretary of state, in part because he wanted out of the ambassador's job because he found it so hard to get along with Netanyahu, then in his first term.\n\nIndyk nonetheless kept a hand in trying to bring about Israeli-Palestinian peace, but was also in charge of a vexing challenge for the Clinton administration -- how to contain both Iraq and Iran, two countries that were deeply antagonistic to the United States but also deadly enemies to one another.\n\nOnce again, he came under antisemitic attack. In a letter to the U.N. Security Council, just 15 months after the Ze'evi incident, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf wrote, \"The statements of the United States Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk, who is a known Jew and Zionist, are simply an official and documented reaffirmation of the enmity of the United States administration toward Iraq.\"\n\nBill Richardson, then the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, demanded an apology, which he did not receive.\n\nIndyk was born in London and raised in Australia. He traced his ambitions to become a peacemaker to 1973, when he was studying at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, during the Yom Kippur War.\n\n\"It taught me just how fragile Israel's existence was and how central the United States is to war and peace in the Middle East,\" Indyk said in 1995 of his experience in Israel during Senate confirmation hearings for his first diplomatic role, as U.S. ambassador to Israel.\n\nHe volunteered on a kibbutz in 1973, and considered settling in Israel. Instead, he returned to Australia and launched a career in government as a Middle East analyst.\n\nIndyk came to the United States in 1982 on a sabbatical and soon found work with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the pro-Israel lobby, where he was mentored by Steve Rosen, AIPAC's hard-charging director of foreign policy who saw in Indyk a version of himself -- impatient with niceties and eager to find out what exactly was at the essence of the vague bromides U.S. diplomats dispensed.\n\nIndyk and Rosen noticed that conservative think tanks, a relatively recent phenomenon, were putting out policy papers that were soon becoming Reagan administration policy. It was a revelation. A think tank could come up with detail-rich policies, and find officials eager to claim the plans as their own.\n\nSo in 1985 Indyk launched the Washington Institute in partnership with Barb Weinberg, a top AIPAC donor. The think tank remains influential, with direct lines into the governments of the United States, Israel and multiple Arab nations.\n\n\"From the outset, Indyk emphasized bipartisan approaches to regional problems and outreach that transcended traditional zero-sum thinking about the Arab-Israeli conflict, packaged in highly accessible formats that brought the analytical product of Institute experts directly to readers across the government,\" the Washington Institute said in its memorial for Indyk.\n\nAIPAC also mourned Indyk, even though in recent years if he attended an AIPAC event, there were tensions over his tendency to criticize Israel's right-wing governments and their pro-settlement policies.\n\n\"Martin's leadership helped make the Institute one of Washington's premier foreign policy research organizations,\" AIPAC said.\n\nIn presidential election years, AIPAC reaches out to candidates for brief meetings to assess their Israel policy, and to offer advice. Rosen scheduled a meeting in the 1992 presidential cycle with Bill and Hillary Clinton and had a hunch: Indyk and the Clintons, all three infatuated with the deep intricacies of policy, would get along.\n\nIndyk, directing the Washington Institute, was no longer with AIPAC, but Rosen asked him to come to the meeting. At the meeting with the Clintons, the usually loquacious Rosen sat back and watched history unfold as the three clicked with each other. A scheduled 20-minute meeting stretched for hours.\n\nThe Clintons were not afraid to display their ignorance, asking blunt questions. Indyk intuited they would also not be afraid to hear and absorb long, complex answers which would prompt more questions.\n\n\"I like it when you're around, Martin,\" Clinton once joked, \"because you and I both have funny accents.\"\n\nOnce elected president, Clinton brought Indyk on to the National Security Council as a Middle East specialist. Indyk played a central role in bringing about the Oslo accords, and the September 1993 handshake between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat.\n\nWithin two years, Indyk, who became a U.S. citizen, made history when Clinton named him the first Jewish U.S. ambassador to Israel.\n\nIndk left government with Clinton in 2001 and watched his dreams of a two-state outcome crumble under the pressures of the Second Intifada, and increased Palestinian-Israeli mistrust.\n\n\"He battled cancer the way he lived his life, with purpose and an unrelenting spirit,\" tweeted Dennis Ross, who served as a peace negotiator alongside Indyk. \"Martin lived a life of meaning; he pursued peace-making between Israel and its neighbors with passion, skill and decency.\"\n\nAfter leaving government, he transitioned into permanent think tank mode, housed for years at the Brookings Institution and then at the Council on Foreign Relations. He briefly returned to government under President Barack Obama to supervise the 2013-2014 peace talks, the last serious round of negotiations, which were also unsuccessful.\n\nHe claimed not to have patience for Jewish and Israeli agonizing over whether American leaders liked them, lashing out in 2011 at Bush administration alumnus Elliott Abrams, who fretted on a panel they were both on that Obama had \"no great love in his heart for Israel.\"\n\n\"It's time to grow up,\" Indyk said. \"We should get over the question of whether he loves me or he loves me not, and focus on [the] question of finding a solution to conflict with the Palestinians. When Israel decides by itself to solve that problem, it will have the overwhelmingly cuddly support of the US President.\"\n\nAnd yet, Indyk was no stranger to sentiment. Taking on his last government role in 2013, he said he still held dear the notion that one day, he could help forge an Israeli-Palestinian peace.\n\n\"Fifteen years ago my son, Jacob, who was 13 at the time, designed a screensaver for my computer,\" he said, addressing then-Secretary of State John Kerry, who selected Indyk for the job. \"It consisted of a simple question that flashed across the screen constantly: Dad, is there peace in the Middle East yet?\"\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Gahl Hodges Burt, two children from his first marriage, Jacob and Sarah, and five grandchildren.",

Indyk, diplomat who sought Middle East peace, dies at 73 - The Boston Globe", "body": "An Australian-bred academic with a quick wit, blunt manner, and pro-Israel pedigree, Dr. Indyk cut an unconventional figure in the State Department of the 1990s. But he propelled himself to the heart of the United States' efforts to make peace between the Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nIn 2013, he shuttled from one side to the other as Obama's emissary. Fifteen years earlier, he helped craft an agreement between them at the Wye Plantation in Maryland on behalf of President Clinton.\n\nDr. Indyk balanced a fervent commitment to Israel, rooted in his time as a graduate student in Jerusalem during the Yom Kippur War in 1973, with an abiding skepticism of Jewish settlements, which he saw as blighting the prospect of a two-state solution, which would allow Israelis and Palestinians to end decades of bloody conflict.\n\nIn his final months, he watched in dismay as Hamas fighters attacked Israeli citizens, prompting a ferocious Israeli military retaliation in the Gaza Strip. For Dr. Indyk, the violence carried a tragic echo of what he had referred to in an interview with the journal Foreign Affairs as Israel's \"hubris\" before the Yom Kippur War.\n\n\"That same hubris has manifested itself again in recent years, even as many people told the Israelis that the situation with the Palestinians was unsustainable,\" Dr. Indyk said. \"They thought the problem was under control. But now all their assumptions have been blown up, just like they were in 1973.\"\n\nDr. Indyk described the Yom Kippur War as a \"defining moment\" in his life. At Hebrew University of Jerusalem, he listened to BBC radio reports about US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's efforts to negotiate a cease-fire. (He later wrote an admiring book about Kissinger's Middle East diplomacy, drawing on interviews with him.) Dr. Indyk volunteered on a kibbutz in southern Israel and considered immigrating.\n\nInstead, he returned to Australia, where he had grown up in a Jewish family, to finish his doctorate in international relations at Australian National University. In 1982, he moved with his young family to New York for a sabbatical at Columbia University.\n\nDr. Indyk began in Washington as a researcher for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, an influential pro-Israel lobbying group, before founding a think tank, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\n\nHis first job in government was on the National Security Council, where he soon became one of Clinton's principal advisers on the Middle East. In 1995, Clinton appointed him ambassador to Israel, making him the first Jewish American envoy to that country (he had become a naturalized American). Seven months after his arrival, Indyk consoled Leah Rabin in a hospital after her husband, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, was assassinated by a right-wing Jewish law student.\n\nDr. Indyk returned to Washington in 1997 to be assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs. In that post, he helped negotiate the Wye River Memorandum, linking Israel's phased withdrawal from the West Bank to Palestinian pledges to crack down on terrorism. Clinton sent Dr. Indyk back to Israel for a second stint as ambassador in 2000, reflecting the credibility he had built with leaders on both sides and Clinton's hunger to achieve a breakthrough.\n\n\"He brought enormous talent and skill to the task of diplomacy,\" said Dennis B. Ross, a fellow peace negotiator in the Clinton administration. \"But he brought decency and honesty to it as well. His passion for making peace drove him.\"\n\nStrobe Talbott, another Clinton official who worked with Indyk subsequently at the Brookings Institution, said, \"He never despaired in seemingly intractable situations.\"\n\nClinton's efforts to broker a deal between the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, and the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, ultimately fell short. And Indyk returned again to Washington, where he served as executive vice president at Brookings and advised Democratic presidential hopefuls. In 2009, he published \"Innocent Abroad: An Intimate Account of American Peace Diplomacy in the Middle East,\" a chronicle of his work during the Clinton years.\n\nAt Brookings, Dr. Indyk faced an awkward moment. The New York Times reported in 2014 that Qatar, a backer of Hamas, had donated $14.8 million to fund two projects at the institute. Brookings was one of several think tanks that had accepted money from foreign governments. Dr. Indyk defended the arrangement, but critics said it compromised Brookings' neutrality.\n\nSome Israeli officials grumbled that it also raised questions about his impartiality as an envoy, although there was never evidence he had tilted against the Israelis. In 2018, he left Brookings to become the Lowy distinguished fellow in US-Middle East diplomacy at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.\n\nMartin Sean Indyk was born in London on July 1, 1951, to John and Mary Indyk. He was raised in Sydney, where his father was a surgeon. Dr. Indyk received his bachelor's degree in international relations from the University of Sydney in 1972.\n\nDr. Indyk, who was awarded the Order of Australia medal in December for his contributions to foreign policy, recalled being rejected by Australia's diplomatic service after he clashed with his interviewers over the Vietnam War. \"My whole career path went out the window,\" he said. But that stinging setback, he said, set him on a different path that led to Jerusalem and Washington.\n\nIn addition to his wife, Dr. Indyk leaves two children, Sarah and Jacob; a sister, Shelley; a brother, academic Ivor Indyk; two stepchildren, Christopher and Caroline Burt; and five grandchildren. His first marriage, to Jill Collier, ended in divorce.\n\nFor all his goodwill in Israel, some Israeli officials were rankled by Dr. Indyk's criticism, a candor that friends attributed to his Australian upbringing. In 2014, he was fingered as the unnamed \"senior American official\" who told columnist Nahum Barnea that Israel was to blame for the failure of negotiations with the Palestinians because it had approved new settlements while talks were underway.\n\nDr. Indyk did not let up. Last year, on a visit to Israel, he joined a rally against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposed overhaul of the judiciary, and he continued to criticize what he viewed as Netanyahu's cynical approach to the peace process.\n\nBut Dr. Indyk's words were delivered more in sorrow than anger. He was serious about his Jewish faith, studying the Torah in a group with other prominent Washingtonians. He was a passionate Zionist, who believed Israel's survival was best secured by a lasting agreement with the Palestinians. And he was eternally frustrated that successive US presidents had been unable to strike that elusive deal.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"},

Satloff praised Indyk as a pioneering scholar, insightful analyst, and highly effective policy entrepreneur, noting that his vision and contributions to both the institute and US Middle East policy were legendary and immeasurable.", "source": {"uri": "vinnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "vinnews.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_feldman@vinnews.com", "name": "Joseph Feldman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Indyk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Martin Indyk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dennis Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_peace_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diplomat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Satloff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert Satloff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://vinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP13072911057-e1375114095879-640x400-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764042", "eventUri": "eng-9764042", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 897, "textEnd": 904}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

Indyk, Diplomat Who Sought Middle East Peace, Dies at 73", "body": "Martin S. Indyk, a diplomat, author and foreign-policy thinker who spent decades trying to solve the riddle of Middle East peace, twice as the United States ambassador to Israel and later as a special envoy for President Barack Obama, died on Thursday at his home in New Fairfield, Conn. He was 73.\n\nThe cause was complications of esophageal cancer, his wife, Gahl Burt, said.\n\nAn Australian-bred academic with a quick wit, blunt manner and pro-Israel pedigree, Mr. Indyk cut an unconventional figure in the State Department of the 1990s. But he propelled himself to the heart of America's efforts to make peace between the Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nIn 2013, he shuttled from one side to the other as Mr. Obama's emissary. Fifteen years earlier, he helped craft an agreement between them at the Wye Plantation in Maryland on behalf of President Bill Clinton.\n\nMr. Indyk balanced a fervent commitment to Israel, rooted in his time as a graduate student in Jerusalem during the Yom Kippur War in 1973, with an abiding skepticism of Jewish settlements, which he saw as blighting the prospect of a two-state solution, which would allow Israelis and Palestinians to end decades of bloody conflict.\n\nIn his final months, he watched in dismay as Hamas fighters attacked Israeli citizens, prompting a ferocious Israeli military retaliation in the Gaza Strip. For Mr. Indyk, the violence carried a tragic echo of what he had referred to in an interview with the journal Foreign Affairs as Israel's \"hubris\" before the Yom Kippur War.\n\n\"That same hubris has manifested itself again in recent years, even as many people told the Israelis that the situation with the Palestinians was unsustainable,\" Mr. Indyk said. \"They thought the problem was under control. But now all their assumptions have been blown up, just like they were in 1973.\"\n\nMr. Indyk described the Yom Kippur War as a \"defining moment\" in his life. At Hebrew University of Jerusalem, he listened to BBC radio reports about Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger's efforts to negotiate a cease-fire. (He later wrote an admiring book about Mr. Kissinger's Middle East diplomacy, drawing on interviews with him.) Mr. Indyk volunteered on a kibbutz in southern Israel and considered immigrating.\n\nInstead, he returned to Australia, where he had grown up in a Jewish family, to finish his Ph.D. in international relations at the Australian National University. In 1982, he moved with his young family to New York for a sabbatical at Columbia University.\n\nMr. Indyk began in Washington as a researcher for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the influential pro-Israel lobbying group, before founding a think tank, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\n\nHis first job in government was on the National Security Council, where he soon became one of Mr. Clinton's principal advisers on the Middle East. In 1995, the president appointed him ambassador to Israel, making him the first Jewish American envoy to that country (he had become a naturalized American). Seven months after his arrival, Mr. Indyk consoled Leah Rabin in a hospital after her husband, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, was assassinated by a right-wing Jewish law student.\n\nMr. Indyk returned to Washington in 1997 to be assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs. In that post he helped negotiate the Wye River Memorandum, linking Israel's phased withdrawal from the West Bank to Palestinian pledges to crack down on terrorism. Mr. Clinton sent Mr. Indyk back to Israel for a second stint as ambassador in 2000, reflecting the credibility he had built with leaders on both sides and Mr. Clinton's hunger to achieve a breakthrough.\n\n\"He brought enormous talent and skill to the task of diplomacy,\" said Dennis B. Ross, a fellow peace negotiator in the Clinton administration. \"But he brought decency and honesty to it as well. His passion for making peace drove him.\"\n\nStrobe Talbott, another Clinton official who worked with Mr. Indyk subsequently at the Brookings Institution, said, \"He never despaired in seemingly intractable situations.\"\n\nMr. Clinton's efforts to broker a deal between the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, and the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, ultimately fell short. And Mr. Indyk returned again to Washington, where he served as executive vice president at Brookings and advised Democratic presidential hopefuls. In 2009, he published \"Innocent Abroad: An Intimate Account of American Peace Diplomacy in the Middle East,\" a chronicle of his work during the Clinton years.\n\nAt Brookings, Mr. Indyk faced an awkward moment. The New York Times reported in 2014 that Qatar, a backer of Hamas, had donated $14.8 million to fund two projects at the institute. Brookings was one of several think tanks that had accepted money from foreign governments. Mr. Indyk defended the arrangement, but critics said it compromised Brookings' neutrality.\n\nSome Israeli officials grumbled that it also raised questions about his impartiality as an envoy, though there was never evidence he had tilted against the Israelis. In 2018, he left Brookings to become the Lowy distinguished fellow in U.S.-Middle East diplomacy at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.\n\nMartin Sean Indyk was born in London on July 1, 1951, to John and Mary Indyk. He was raised in Sydney, Australia, where his father was a surgeon. Mr. Indyk received his bachelor's degree in international relations from the University of Sydney in 1972.\n\nMr. Indyk, who was awarded the Order of Australia medal last December for his contributions to foreign policy, recalled being rejected by Australia's diplomatic service after he clashed with his interviewers over the Vietnam War. \"My whole career path went out the window,\" he said. But that stinging setback, he said, set him on a different path that led to Jerusalem and Washington.\n\nIn addition to his wife, Mr. Indyk is survived by two children, Sarah and Jacob; a sister, Shelley; a brother, the academic Ivor Indyk; two stepchildren, Christopher and Caroline Burt; and five grandchildren. His first marriage, to Jill Collier, ended in divorce.\n\nFor all his good will in Israel, some Israeli officials were rankled by Mr. Indyk's criticism, a candor that friends attributed to his Australian upbringing. In 2014, he was fingered as the unnamed \"senior American official\" who told the columnist Nahum Barnea that Israel was to blame for the failure of negotiations with the Palestinians because it had approved new settlements while talks were underway.\n\nMr. Indyk did not let up. Last year, on a visit to Israel, he joined a rally against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposed overhaul of the judiciary, and he continued to criticize what he viewed as Mr. Netanyahu's cynical approach to the peace process.\n\nBut Mr. Indyk's words were delivered more in sorrow than anger. He was serious about his Jewish faith, studying the Torah in a group with other prominent Washingtonians. He was a passionate Zionist, who believed Israel's survival was best secured by a lasting agreement with the Palestinians. And he was eternally frustrated that successive American presidents had been unable to strike that elusive deal.\n\n\"What is it about the United States that its leaders feel obliged to sally forth with such virtuous determination to transform the bazaars and back alleys of the Middle East?\" Mr. Indyk wrote. \"And what is it about the Middle East that holds them up, sets them back and sucks them down into its swamps?\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Indyk", "type": "person",

(July 25, 2024) - With great sadness, The Washington Institute extends its deepest condolences to the family of Ambassador Martin Indyk, the organization's founding executive director, who passed away today. He was 73.\n\n\"Martin was a true American success story. A native of Australia, he came to Washington to have an impact on the making of American Middle East policy and that he surely did - as pioneering scholar, insightful analyst and remarkably effective policy entrepreneur,\" said Dr. Robert Satloff, the Institute's Segal Executive Director Robert Satloff and Indyk's successor at the helm of the research organization.\n\n\"He was a visionary who not only founded an organization based on the idea that wise public policy is rooted in sound research, he embodied it. His contributions to the growth and development of The Washington Institute -- and to the definition and execution of U.S. Middle East policy, more generally -- are both legendary and immeasurable.\"\n\nAfter receiving his doctorate at the Australian National University, Indyk moved to Washington and soon thereafter joined with the Institute's founding chairman, Barbi Weinberg of Los Angeles, to establish the organization in 1985. Under their leadership, the Institute quickly developed a reputation for in-depth, practical Middle East research that found eager consumers in the White House, State Department, the Pentagon, intelligence agencies, foreign embassies, newsrooms, and Capitol Hill. From the outset, Indyk emphasized bipartisan approaches to regional problems and outreach that transcended traditional zero-sum thinking about the Arab-Israeli conflict, packaged in highly accessible formats that brought the analytical product of Institute experts directly to readers across the government.\n\nThe formula proved a great success - so much so that just eight years after he launched the Institute, President Bill Clinton tapped Indyk to serve as his top Middle East policy advisor as special assistant to the president and senior director for Near East and South Asian affairs at the National Security Council (1993-1995). During the Clinton presidency, Indyk was later named assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, the first person ever appointed to the position from outside the State Department (1997-2000), and he served two separate tours as U.S. ambassador to Israel (1995 to 1997 and again from 2000 to 2001). He was recalled to government by President Barack Obama to serve as special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations from July 2013 to June 2014.\n\n\"From the Oslo process to the policy of 'dual containment' of Saddam's Iraq and Islamic Iran, Martin left a deep and lasting imprint on the making and shaping of American Middle East policy. In a region known for volatility, whatever progress America made to advance the cause of peace and security was due in no small measure to Martin's enormous contributions,\" said Satloff, the Institute's Howard P. Berkowitz Chair in U.S. Middle East policy.\n\nAfter leaving government, Indyk continued to play an important role in public debate over U.S. foreign policy in his positions as founding director of the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, Brookings' executive vice president and director of its foreign policy program, and then, most recently, as the Lowy Distinguished Fellow in U.S.-Middle East Diplomacy at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.\n\nIn addition, Indyk was the author of the much-acclaimed Master of the Game: Henry Kissinger and the Art of Middle East Diplomacy (A.A. Knopf, 2021) and a personal memoir of his public service, Innocent Abroad: An Intimate Account of American Peace Diplomacy in the Middle East (Simon and Schuster, 2009). He was also co-author of Bending History: Barack Obama's Foreign Policy with Michael O'Hanlon and Kenneth Lieberthal (Brookings Institution Press, 2012).\n\nBeyond his literary achievements and public policy successes, Indyk's professional legacy lives on in the scores of scholars, analysts and policymakers he mentored over the years and the encouragement he gave them to apply the principle on which he founded the Washington Institute -

This notice comes in response to a petition filed by a Kinnaur resident, Layak Ram Negi, who is seeking to set aside Ranaut's election on the grounds of alleged wrongful rejection of his nomination papers to contest from the Lok Sabha constituency. Justice Jyotsna Rewal, overseeing the case, has directed Ranaut to file a reply by August 21.\n\nKangana Ranaut emerged victorious in the Mandi Lok Sabha seat, securing a significant lead over her rival Congress candidate Vikramaditya Singh by 74,755 votes.

He highlights that he was given additional requirements to fulfill regarding certificates from other departments (from the electricity, water, and telephone departments), which he promptly submitted. Despite his efforts, the nomination papers were rejected, leading Negi to believe that this decision significantly affected the election outcome.\n\nNegi asserts that had his nomination papers been accepted, he could have potentially won the election, emphasizing the impact of the rejection on the electoral process.

Judge Thomas Glegola excoriated the telecommunications giant for making \"flawed and erroneous assertions regarding the law and regulatory policy,\" and said no alternative landline provider exists to take AT&T's place. Services the utility claimed could replace landlines, including internet-based phone service and cell service, could not do the job, either, Glegola wrote.\n\nCommissioners voted unanimously to reject AT&T's proposal.\n\nAT&T, which is backing proposed legislation that would let it pull out of some landline services, said, \"We want to keep our customers connected and help them upgrade to modern technology.\"\n\nThe company's plan to stop being the designated \"carrier of last resort,\" requiring it to provide phone service to anyone wanting it in its service area, drew furious opposition from thousands of residents all over California voicing their concerns in comments to the commission. Governments including Santa Clara, San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties attacked the proposal, along with 11 members of the U.S. Congress including four from the Bay Area.\n\nCritics said AT&T's proposal would have stripped many older people and rural residents of a communications lifeline in cases of a natural disasters like fires and floods, power outages or emergency health crises. Internet and cell phone services are unreliable in many rural areas, and wildfires in recent years have shown that internet and cell phone services frequently go down because of damaged infrastructure and power loss.\n\nSan Mateo County Supervisor Ray Mueller, addressing the commission Thursday in a public comment period before the vote, said residents, especially during power outages, rely on the carrier-of-last-resort obligations \"to be able to reach out and ask for help.\"\n\nAT&T applied to the commission in March 2023 to exit as carrier of last resort. The telecommunications giant told this news organization in February that fewer than 7% of households in its territory use traditional landlines, \"and a great number of those households also have alternatives available where they live.\" In its proposal to the utilities commission, AT&T claimed its landline services were \"fast becoming a historical curiosity\" and serve no \"valid public purpose.\"\n\nBay Area members of Congress Ro Khanna, Barbara Lee, Anna Eshoo and Mark DeSaulnier joined 11 other California U.S. representatives in telling the commission in a Feb. 20 letter that the proposal threatened public safety \"in an area plagued by earthquakes, severe storms, floods, and fires, and that has a geography that often disrupts cellular service for days, if not weeks, at a time.\"\n\nThis week, Santa Clara County's Office of the County Executive took aim at AT&T's plan, with county executive James Williams pointing out that many county residents \"live in areas where mobile phone and internet service is non-existent or spotty, and rely on landline telephone services, especially in an emergency.\"\n\nSan Mateo County officials earlier attacked the utility's claim that cell phone and internet-phone service can replace landlines does not hold up, arguing that power outages and disaster-damaged infrastructure have shown those technologies to be unreliable.\n\nSanta Cruz County supervisors also criticized the plan, including Manu Koenig, who reported at a February county meeting that he had heard from \"people who are frankly terrified at the idea of these lines going away and rightfully so.\"\n\nAT&T became carrier of last resort thanks to its previous monopoly status and state law requiring voice communications for all who want them.",

Judge Thomas Glegola excoriated the telecommunications giant for making \"flawed and erroneous assertions regarding the law and regulatory policy,\" and said no alternative landline provider exists to take AT&T's place. Services the utility claimed could replace landlines, including internet-based phone service and cell service, could not do the job, either, Glegola wrote.\n\nAT&T, which is backing proposed legislation that would let it pull out of some landline services, said, \"We want to keep our customers connected and help them upgrade to modern technology.\"\n\nThe company's plan to stop being the designated \"carrier of last resort,\" requiring it to provide phone service to anyone wanting it in its service area, drew furious opposition from thousands of residents all over California voicing their concerns in comments to the commission. Governments including Santa Clara, San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties attacked the proposal, along with 11 members of the U.S. Congress including four from the Bay Area.\n\nInternet and cell phone services are unreliable in many rural areas, and wildfires in recent years have shown that internet and cell phone services frequently go down because of damaged infrastructure and power loss.\n\nSan Mateo County Supervisor Ray Mueller, addressing the commission Thursday in a public comment period before the vote, said residents, especially during power outages, rely on the carrier-of-last-resort obligations \"to be able to reach out and ask for help.\"\n\nAT&T applied to the commission in March 2023 to exit as carrier of last resort. The telecommunications giant told this news organization in February that fewer than 7% of households in its territory use traditional landlines, \"and a great number of those households also have alternatives available where they live.\" In its proposal to the utilities commission, AT&T claimed its landline services were \"fast becoming a historical curiosity\" and serve no \"valid public purpose.\"\n\nBay Area members of Congress Ro Khanna, Barbara Lee, Anna Eshoo and Mark DeSaulnier joined 11 other California U.S. representatives in telling the commission in a Feb. 20 letter that the proposal threatened public safety \"in an area plagued by earthquakes, severe storms, floods, and fires, and that has a geography that often disrupts cellular service for days, if not weeks, at a time.\"\n\nThis week, Santa Clara County's Office of the County Executive took aim at AT&T's plan, with county executive James Williams pointing out that many county residents \"live in areas where mobile phone and internet service is non-existent or spotty, and rely on landline telephone services, especially in an emergency.\"\n\nSan Mateo County officials earlier attacked the utility's claim that cell phone and internet-phone service can replace landlines does not hold up, arguing that power outages and disaster-damaged infrastructure have shown those technologies to be unreliable.\n\nSanta Cruz County supervisors also criticized the plan, including Manu Koenig, who reported at a February county meeting that he had heard from \"people who are frankly terrified at the idea of these lines going away and rightfully so.\"\n\nAT&T became carrier of last resort thanks to its previous monopoly status and state law requiring voice communications for all who want them.",

It's held that designation since 1996, and remains one of the only companies in the state to offer traditional copper-based landline service.\n\nThousands of Californians submitted public comments and called into public meetings over the last year to urge the commission to reject AT&T's application due to public safety. They say the move could hurt older adults, people with disabilities and other groups impacted by the digital divide.\n\nPublic commenters also highlighted the unreliability of cell phone networks or VoIP (voice over internet protocol), which allows users to make calls over an internet connection.\n\nIn the case of an emergency, copper landlines are considered more dependable because they work during power outages -- especially for people who live in rural or coastal communities.\n\n\"We're now in fire season and people had better have a way to receive emergency alerts and communicate with each other when the power goes out,\" said Regina Costa of the advocacy group TURN. It helped organize residents around the landline issue.\n\nLast month, the California Public Utilities Commission issued a proposed denial of AT&T's request, citing public feedback and the fact that no other telecommunications company stepped up to replace AT&T in that role (Other companies could still offer landline service if they wanted to, but would not be legally required to do so).\n\n\"Specifically, AT&T failed to demonstrate the availability of replacement providers willing and able to serve as COLR, nor did AT&T prove that alternative providers met the COLR definition,\" the CPUC said in a statement.\n\nThe proposal will now be fully voted on by the commission during its June 20 meeting.\n\n\"AT&T did not prove its case at the commission ... they didn't present any evidence to show that customers would have any real alternatives, and in fact, they admitted that they don't,\" Costa said.\n\nCalifornia may be something of an outlier in this issue. Twenty states have already given the telecom giant permission to drop landlines. In Illinois, the company agreed to pay $23 million in fines for allegedly bribing lawmakers to end mandated landline service.\n\n\"In California, we tend to look at things a little more closely, so hopefully [lawmakers] will see through this,\" Costa said.\n\nAbout 5% of AT&T's customers, or 500,000 people, have traditional copper-based phone service. A spokesperson said it plans to phase out its copper-based network over the next few years because it's an \"older, antiquated technology,\" and that people are leaving the network everyday in favor of advanced services like fiber.\n\n\"We remain committed to keeping our customers connected to voice service and will continue working with state leaders on policies that allow us to bring modern communications to Californians,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nAT&T says state regulators dismissed its application before it had the chance to create a plan that would ensure that no customer would be left behind.\n\nIt recently partnered with Assemblymember Tina McKinnor of Inglewood on a new bill that would \"modernize\" the state's communications infrastructure and essentially remove any carrier of last resort obligations. It's expected to be heard in the Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee in early July.\n\nMeanwhile the CPUC says it will also consider updating the rules for carrier of last resort service obligations in its meeting this week.", "source": {"uri": "laist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LAist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AT&T"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Voice over IP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Public_Utilities_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California Public Utilities Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital divide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_outage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Power outage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telephone company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_McKinnor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tina McKinnor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telecommunications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California State Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Optical fiber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglewood,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Carriers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Carriers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Consulting", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Regulation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Regulation", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e9e8400/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4288x2412+0+218/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F15%2Fdb%2F84be83984a3585dd34ff887b956d%2Fdan-dennis-wqqviz-zd8m-unsplash.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669103", "eventUri": "eng-9669103", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 2030, "textEnd": 2037}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

The CPUC said it received more than 5,000 public comments and drew more than 5,800 attendees through its eight forums.\n\nCPUC announced a proposal to reject AT&T's request on May 10, explaining that the phone company failed to prove there were replacement providers willing to replace AT&T as the COLR.\n\nIn a Thursday news release announcing the proposal's rejection, the CPUC doubled down on its intent to reject the request, explaining that \"AT&T failed to demonstrate the availability of replacement providers willing and able to serve as COLR, nor did AT&T prove that alternative providers met the COLR definition.\"\n\nThe CPUC also announced a new process to address service obligations the agency refers to as a \"Rulemaking.\" In short, the next time a company wants to be relieved from the COLR obligation, hearings and public comment will be required similar to what AT&T went through.", "source": {"uri": "kcra.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KCRA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_ayestas@kcra.com", "name": "Jonathan Ayestas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Public_Utilities_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California Public Utilities Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AT&T"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Telephone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Joaquin_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Joaquin County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Joaquin County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placer_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Placer County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Placer County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KCRA-TV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KCRA-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Carriers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Carriers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Telephones_and_Telegraphs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Telephones and Telegraphs", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/vidthumb/696a39c2-afd6-4892-9682-d19f589d0af3/108f1cee-1e66-4a3e-b493-8bba94ca8cd1.jpg?crop=0.783xw:0.783xh;0.0506xw,0&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669103", "eventUri": "eng-9669103", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 1570, "textEnd": 1576, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The party represented the marginal section and the farmers which helped the reign continue for a historic 34 years.\n\nJyoti Basu resigned as Chief Minister of West Bengal on October 28, 2000, and the sceptre was passed to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the Left won emphatically and the credit fell upon Buddhadeb's no corruption, unsullied image and popularity in West Bengal.\n\nLeft Front won 35 out of 42 constituencies in West Bengal. While the Indian National Congress won six seats, the Trinamool Congress had to settle for just one seat with the sole winner being the current CM Mamata Banerjee. The Left Front won again in the assembly elections held in April-May 2006. The Left Front won 196 seats in the 294-member Bengal Legislative Assembly. CPM alone managed to win 143 members.\n\nIt was during this time of unbridled rule that Bhattacharjee felt the need to adopt an industry-friendly approach. Ratan Tata was looking for a place to start a Nano car factory in West Bengal and zeroed Singur in the Hooghly district.\n\nSingur is the most fertile region in the state and the government acquired 997 acres of land for the car factory much to the chagrin of the farming community. The farmers protested when Bhattacharjee's government attempted to acquire the property under the Land Acquisition Act 1894. The government offered huge compensation but they did not budge. Political parties like Trinamool Congress and SUCI and various Maoist groups coalesced in support of the famers, kick starting a strong agitation.\n\nDespite many farmers being CPM loyalists, the government turned a blind eye and went with the acquisition. Mamata Banerjee started an indefinite hunger strike on December 4, declaring her support for the Singur strike. By December 27, Mamata faced death after her condition worsened and even doctors feared that she would die anytime. With persuasion from President APJ Abdul Kalam, Mamata Banerjee ended her fast at midnight on December 29.\n\nThe Singur protest shook the core of communism in Bengal altogether while effigies of Mamata started appearing across the state. On 21 January 2007, the construction of the car factory at Singur was formally started, but Tata could not make much progress.\n\nOn October 3, 2008, Ratan Tata announced his decision to withdraw from the Singur project and blamed the negative attitude espoused by Mamta Banerjee. Tata moved their factory to Gujarat after CM Narendra Modi rolled the red carpet for the business tycoon.\n\nIf Singur was a trailer, then Nandigram would be the real movie which settled the fate of the left-front government in West Bengal. 10,000 acres of land was required to create a special economic zone and set up a chemical factory for Indonesia's Salim Group. To clamp down on the farmer's protest, police opened fire killing 14 and injuring 70 people. CPM workers aided the police which aggravated the tensions.\n\nFarmers ran for their lives from Nandigram to other places. Bhumi Uchhed Pratirodh Committee with support from Trinamool Congress, SUCI and Maoist groups resisted the violence. Writers and filmmakers like Medha Patkar, Anuradha Talwar, Arundhati Roy, Mahasweta Devi, Aparna Sen and Sunil Gangopadhyay have declared their support for the Nandigram movement putting the left government in a dock.\n\nEven Jyothi Basu blamed the police action in Nandigram as unfortunate. Following this, land acquisition was stopped and farmers returned to Nandigram. But in November 2007 and May 2008, clashes erupted again. In an ensuing clash with CPM workers, many farmers were killed and unrest followed. The real setback for the government happened in the May 2008 elections to the East Midnapore Zilla Parishad, where the left front lost its majority.\n\nIn the 2009 LS elections, left only managed paltry few seats in the western belt of Bengal. The Trinamool-Congress alliance won all the areas adjacent to Bangladesh, massively becoming popular among the Muslim sections of the borderland and thus starting a new era of vote polarization. The Nandigram protest made the Muslim voters change their stance and move towards TMC. The 2011 assembly elections became a waterloo for the Left Front. Trinamool Congress won 184 seats with ally Congress winning 42 seats. The Left Front was limited to just 62 seats.\n\nIn 2011, Mamata Banerjee annulled the deal made with Tata in Singur and won the case in the Supreme Court. She also made an impactful decision to return the acquired lands to the farmer community. The single decision prepared the coffin for the left party in Bengal and the final nail in the coffin came during late 2018 when the third alternative BJP emerged as a popular player in Bengal politics. Red flags paved the way for orange and were pushed into the abyss of redundancy by the people of Bengal since then.", "source": {"uri": "keralakaumudi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Keralakaumudi.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "keralakaumudi_daily@keralakaumudi.com", "name": "Keralakaumudi Daily", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhadeb_Bhattacharjee", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamata_Banerjee", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mamata Banerjee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_India_(Marxist)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of India (Marxist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singur", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Singur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Singur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Bengal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bengal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinamool_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trinamool Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_(Germany)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Left (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_Legislative_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bengal Legislative Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Indian_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2004 Indian general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Front_(West_Bengal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left Front (West Bengal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Nano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tata Nano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyoti_Basu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jyoti Basu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Unity_Centre_of_India_(Communist)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bengal"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooghly_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hooghly district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratan_Tata", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ratan Tata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maoism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maoism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nandigram", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nandigram"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nandigram"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._P._J._Abdul_Kalam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.

He was put on life support last year after he contracted pneumonia. He is survived by his wife Meera and daughter Suchetana.\n\nAn alumnus of Presidency College, Bhattacharjee was a school teacher before he joined politics full-time. After serving as an MLA and a state minister, he was elevated to the post of Deputy Chief Minister before Jyoti Basu stepped down as the Chief Minister in 2000. As the Chief Minister, Bhattacharjee led the Left Front to Assembly poll victories in 2001 and 2006.\n\nEven during the closing years of the Left Front regime in West Bengal, when the entire state was rocked by a movement against land acquisition for industry, Bhattacharjee maintained that without industrial development, the long-term welfare of the workers could not be achieved.\n\nAnd there lies the irony.\n\nSailing over a wave of slogans for industrialisation, the CPI(M)-led Left Front retained power in Bengal for a record seventh consecutive term in 2006 with a brute majority, winning 235 seats in the 294-member West Bengal Assembly.\n\nBuoyed by the landslide victory, Bhattacharjee went about his task of fulfilling the industrialisation dream.\n\nOn the day of his swearing-in ceremony that year, Tata Group Chairman Ratan Tata announced to set up a Tata Motors small car factory at Singur in Hooghly district.\n\nProposals for WIPRO's second unit and Infosys' first unit on the outskirts of Kolkata followed, and both these I-T giants were allotted 50 acres of land each.\n\nNext came the proposal from Indonesia-based Salim Group for setting up a chemical hub at Nandigram in the East Midnapore district.\n\nHowever, amid all these, discontent was growing among the farmers in both Singur and Nandigram over the proposed land acquisition by the state government for the industrial projects.\n\nTrinamool Congress, the principal opposition party of the time, and its leader Mamata Banerjee did not make any mistake in sensing that the farmers' unrest could be the turning point in bringing down the Left Front government after three decades of rule.\n\nThe rest is history.\n\nIn Singur, the Trinamool led the agitations for days by blocking the National Highway in front of Tata Motors' Nano small car project site.\n\nThe Trinamool also launched agitations against fresh government approval for a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) which posed uncertainty for the proposed projects of WIPRO and Infosys.\n\nAmid all these, Bhattacharjee did not hesitate to walk against his party line and stick to his industrialisation goal. He even said that unfortunately, he belonged to a party which still believed in 'strikes and lockouts'.\n\n\"Thousands of talented youths are passing out college every year with dreams in their eyes. Unfortunately, they have to travel to far-off places in search of jobs. We will have to stop this brain-drain at any cost and for that purpose, we need large-scale investments both in the manufacturing as well as the services sector,\" he told mediapersons frequently at the Writers' Buildings, which used to be the state secretariat then.\n\nHowever, as the agitations in Singur and Nandigram grew in scale posing a serious threat to the state government, the latter was forced to scrap the project in Nandigram, before Ratan Tata announced the Group's decision to pull out from Singur in October 2008.\n\n\"I think some time back I mentioned that if somebody puts a gun to my head, you will pull the trigger or you take the gun away because I will not move my head. I think Ms (Mamata) Banerjee has pulled the trigger,\" Ratan Tata famously said that day.\n\nSince then, mediapersons covering the events and the Chief Minister closely noticed Bhattacharjee getting into a shell, as his daily interactions with reporters started to become less frequent.\n\nHe isolated himself from the outer world further after the 2011 Assembly polls, which not only marked the end of the 34-year Left Front rule, but also his defeat from the Jadavpur Assembly constituency, a seat he held for five consecutive terms, at the hands of Trinamool's Manish Gupta.\n\nNow with his demise, an 'industrially-rejuvenated Bengal' continues to remain an unfulfilled dream.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Dressed in traditional dhoti, kurta and Kolhapuri sandals, he epitomized the quintessential Bengali gentleman. He served as the chief minister for 11 years. He passed away on Thursday.\n\nBorn on 1 March, 1944, in north Kolkata, Bhattacharjee's roots go back to present-day Bangladesh. He graduated from Shailendra Sircar Vidyalaya and later pursued Bengali Honours at Presidency College. Though related to poet Sukanta Bhattacharya, he was not deeply involved in student politics, initially. A sports enthusiast, he had to give up cricket due to eye problems but maintained his romanticism for the game, sharing a bond with Sourav Ganguly, over their mutual love for cricket. Bhattacharjee grew up in a leftist family, which significantly influenced him. After the India-China war in 1962 and the subsequent split of CPI in 1964, he joined CPM in 1966. Initially, he focused on editing and writing for party publications.\n\nAmid internal conflicts in leftist student politics, his rise began as an organizer of the youth movement, eventually becoming the state secretary of DYFI's West Bengal committee. In the late 1960s, Bhattacharjee participated in the food movement and actively campaigned against the US during the Vietnam War. By the early 1970s, he strengthened his organization in Kolkata, maintaining close ties with leftist intellectuals. He became a state committee member of CPM and won his first election from the Kashipur constituency in 1977, serving as minister of information and public relations, later known as the information and culture department.\n\nIn 1982, he lost his Assembly seat but returned in 1987 from Jadavpur, where he served until his political defeat in 2011. During the 1990s, he resigned from Jyoti Basu's cabinet due to a conflict with a secretary, allegedly stating he wouldn't stay in a \"cabinet of thieves,\" although this was never confirmed. He returned to the cabinet and continued his work, even writing a play, \"Shomoy, Oshomoy, Dushomoy.\"\n\nBhattacharjee also handled the home department. He joined CPM's central committee in 1984 and became a Politburo member in 2000. After Jyoti Basu retired, Bhattacharjee became chief minister in November 2000. In the 2001 elections, despite strong opposition, the Left Front, under his leadership retained power. In 2006, they won 235 out of 294 seats, and Bhattacharjee announced the Tata car factory project in Singur.\n\nHowever, facing strong opposition from villagers and political opponents, the project failed. His industrialization efforts led to significant unrest, especially in Nandigram, where police firing resulted in 14 deaths. The political turmoil from Singur and Nandigram, led to setbacks in subsequent elections. By the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the Left Front lost 27 out of 42 seats, indicating a loss of control. This decline culminated in the 2011 Assembly elections, where the Left Front was defeated by Mamata Banerjee's Trinamul Congress, ending over 34 years of Left rule. Post-defeat, Bhattacharjee maintained that his government's industrial policies were correct, viewing incidents like Singur and Nandigram as exceptions. He acknowledged administrative mistakes and sought to learn from them.\n\nThe Nandigram incident deeply affected him, and he publicly took responsibility. In 2013, he expressed regret for the police firing. His writings on land acquisition and the exceptions in Singur and Nandigram emphasized the need for industrial land despite inevitable challenges.\n\nBhattacharjee's industrial vision was not accepted by the people, leading to his political isolation. His call for internal changes within CPM faced resistance from within the party.\n\nAfter 2011, Bhattacharjee's health deteriorated, leading to his gradual withdrawal from active politics. Despite declining health, he continued to visit the party office for reading until he could no longer do so. Suffering from COPD, he couldn't travel by air and required constant oxygen support. His last public appearance was at a Left Front rally in 2019, though he couldn't leave his car due to health issues. He remained in his modest two-room government flat on Palm Avenue, refusing to move even during his tenure as chief minister. As his eyesight worsened, he couldn't write and had his final book transcribed by someone else. A literary enthusiast, he wrote numerous plays and essays, translating works of foreign authors and criticizing modern Chinese policies in his book \"Swarger Nichey Mahabiswrangsha.\" Veteran Communist leader Bhattacharjee was fond of quoting a phrase from Charles Dickens's 'A Tale of Two Cities'. \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...\" It was a phrase he repeated at almost every public event he attended as CM for his two terms, 2001 to 2011.\n\nThis was not only because he understood the importance of the hope and aspirations of the people of his state, particularly the young generation. As the world settled into the first decade of the new millennium, he became the chief minister in 2000 when he was 66 years old. He moved quickly to initiate changes as he dreamt of changing the status quo, and to deliver the people of West Bengal from the stagnation they were in.\n\nBhattacharjee had personal ties with many cultural figures and leaders across political parties. In 2022, he declined the Padma Bhushan award. Despite controversies, Bhattacharjee's straightforward life and simple living earned him respect beyond the Left's base. He will be remembered as a central figure during critical junctures in Bengal's politics.", "source": {"uri": "thestatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Statesman"}, "authors": [],

After stepping down from office, Bhattacharjee presented a document within the CPM stating that his govt's policy of pursuing industrialization was correct.Acquiring land for industry was also a necessity of the time. He argued that the incidents in Singur and Nandigram were \"exceptions\" in this inevitable process. He acknowledged that there were some administrative and political mistakes in both cases and emphasized learning from these exceptions. Bhattacharjee firmly believed that industrialization should not be abandoned due to these exceptions.\n\nYet, even as he defended his policies, incident of villagers being shot dead in Nandigram deeply affected Buddhadeb. In a public meeting right after his loss, he pointed to himself and said that he was \"responsible\" for the incident. In a 2013 interview, Buddhadeb admitted the mistake of police firing in Nandigram and expressed regret.\n\nAs late as 2021, Bhattacharjee had claimed Singur and Nandigram were witnessing the \"silence of a crematorium\". \"The conspirators behind the 'devious conspiracy at Singur and Nandigram are now divided in two groups and throwing muck at each other,' he had said. \"It was an irreparable damage to the state. Sometimes I wonder where I made the mistake. Was it land acquisition itself or was the process of land acquisition that was wrong? Was I too soft on the opposition? We will take lessons from that experience,\" Bhattacharjee had stated.\n\nMany in Singur and Nandigram acknowledge that he was quick to admit mistake but equally adamant in defending what he thought he had little role. \"Bhattacharjee was very clear about Singur. I vividly remember his interaction with press in 2009. He had stated there was no question of apologizing for Singur and blamed TMC for the fiasco. But he was man enough to admit mistake on firing at Nandigram. This is because he could move beyond rigid ideology and wanted genuine change,\" said Bikas Pakhira of Joymalla.\n\n\"He will be remembered as a tragic hero with the right intentions but the wrong methods. Salute to him,\" former TMC Rajya Sabha MP Kunal Ghosh wrote in the X handle.\n\nAbdur Rezzak Mollah, who was the minister for land and land reforms in the Left Front govt from 1977 to 2011 before he got expelled leading to him joining the Trinamool had claimed that \"there was no socio-economic impact-assessment by CPM in Singur and Nandigram before the govt decided on land acquisition.\" He added that the top leadership of the CPM, including Bhattacharjee, were \"cut off\" from the ground reality. \"The party had succumbed to a neo-liberal orientation foisted from the top,\" Mollah had assessed.\n\n(With inputs from Falguni Banerjee in Singur and Suman Mondal in Nandigram)", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dwaipayan_ghosh@timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "name": "Dwaipayan Ghosh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bengal"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrialisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Industrialisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nandigram", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nandigram"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nandigram"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singur", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Singur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Singur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamata_Banerjee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mamata Banerjee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_India_(Marxist)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of India (Marxist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinamool_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trinamool Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament,_Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Front_(West_Bengal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left Front (West Bengal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neoliberalism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Geomatics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Geomatics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Landsailing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Landsailing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Associations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Undeveloped_or_Vacant", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Undeveloped or Vacant", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112387763,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-42842,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803237", "eventUri": "eng-9803237", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Perhaps it was because of these dreams and broken dreams that he remained a man with a broken heart.\n\nBuddhadeb Bhattacharjee, a politician with rare personal integrity who served as the chief minister of West Bengal for 11 years, died on Thursday morning.\n\nBuddhadeb Bhattacharjee was born in Kolkata on March 1, 1944, though his ancestral home was in erstwhile Bangladesh. Upon passing out of Shailendra Sarkar School, in Shyampukur area of Kolkata, he went to Presidency College.\n\nA nephew of Sukanta Bhattacharya, the young rebel poet who earned fame for his fiery writing against the estabishment and the powerful, Buddhadev did not initially participate in mainstream student politics. His interest lay in sports.\n\nA kabaddi player once, he played cricket too, but eyesight issues forced him to give up cricket. However, his love for cricket did not fade. And that could be one of the reasons why he maintained close ties with Sourav Ganguly, who told Anandabazar Patrika Thursday the \"sports crazy\" leader never discussed politics with him.\n\nBuddhadeb grew up in a family that believed in Left politics, and that definitely shaped his own politics.\n\nFollowing the 1962 Sino-Indian War, the Communist Party of India (CPI) split in 1964 and the Communist Party of India (Marxist), also known as the CPM, became a new party. Buddhadeb joined the CPM two years later, in 1966. Until that point, he had been a Left-leaning student who experimented with different literary genres.\n\nHis primary role after joining the party was to write and edit the party newspaper. Buddhadeb rose during a significant rift in Left-leaning student politics over the issues of armed struggle and cultural revolution, with leaders such as Shaibal Mitra-Azizul Haque taking a different track. His first assignment was to lead the organising team for the youth movement. The CPM then launched its youth organisation.\n\nBuddhadeb joined the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) in the late 1960s and was elected secretary of the West Bengal State Committee. During the Vietnam War, he actively participated in anti-American campaigns. He worked to strengthen the organisation, primarily in the Kolkata district, during the 1970s. Though he travelled to speak in rural Bengal for the party's needs, his activities at the time were centered in Kolkata. He felt at ease among the group of Left-leaning thinkers.\n\nAround the beginning of the 1970s, Buddhadeb joined the CPM's West Bengal State Committee. He won the Kashipur assembly constituency's first election in 1977 and held the position of information and public relations minister in the West Bengal State Cabinet from 1977 to 1982. The department later became 'Information and Culture'.\n\nIn the assembly elections of 1982, Buddhadeb lost. In 1987, he won from Jadavpur and was appointed minister of information and culture. Jadavpur had been his seat since, until 2011, when the same centre rejected him. The 34 long years of Left Front rule came to an end in the state that year.\n\nBuddhadeb oversaw crucial ministries, like home affairs, in his predecessor Jyoti Basu's cabinet, in addition to information and culture. The police department was under him.\n\nBuddhadeb had been a guest member of the CPM Central Committee since 1984. From 1985, he also served as a member of the Central Committee. He joined the Politburo in 2000 after being appointed as the deputy chief minister of West Bengal in January 1999.\n\nJyoti Basu retired on November 6 the same year, and Buddhadev took over as the chief minister of West Bengal, holding that position until 2011.\n\nIn the 2001 assembly elections, many believed Mamata Banerjee, the leader of the opposition, had \"wind in her sails\". However, the Left Front, headed by Buddhadeb, was re-elected. The following election, in 2006, saw the Left Front win 235 out of 294 seats. Once again, Buddhadev took oath as CM.\n\nOn the same day, Buddhadeb announced the Tata Group's plan to industrialise the state, and said Tata will build its \"Rs 1 lakh car\" factory in Singur.\n\nHe faced the first wave of opposition a few days later, when villagers demonstrated their disapproval when Tata representatives visited Singur.\n\nUltimately, a Tata Nano plant in Singur never became a reality. In response to criticism from opponents, including Mamata, Ratan Tata ultimately declared that he was shutting down the Singur project.\n\nBuddhadeb was serious about the industrialization of the state, and wanted to achieve that as soon as possible. \"Agriculture is our base, industry is our future\" was his government's slogan at the time.\n\nHowever, his efforts in Singur and Nandigram backfired, and his government drew the allegations of \"forced' acquisition of agricultural land\", which ultimately became the source of all political complications for the CPM in Bengal.\n\nIn Nandigram, the police opened fire on March 14, 2007. The conflict claimed the lives of 14 villagers. That was the beginning of the end of the CPM government and Buddhadeb's political career.\n\nIn the 2008 panchayat polls, the Left Front experienced a narrow defeat, two years after a one-sided victory in the 2006 assembly polls.\n\nOpposition Trinamool took control of the district councils in East Mednipur and South 24 Parganas. Though the Left Front prevailed in North 24 Parganas and Nadia, it did not take the Trinamool to close the gap.\n\nIn the Lok Sabha elections of 2009, the surprise was even bigger.\n\nThe Left Front lost 27 of the 42 seats. Trinamool won 19, and its support helped SUCI win an additional seat.\n\nThe state soon started to spiral out of control for Buddhadeb's administration.\n\nHe found himself alone, deserted by many of his party colleagues, grassroots workers and supporters, as a spree of defection started and the Left Front continued to bleed.\n\nFinally, the state swung, bringing a new party to the helm.\n\nThe Congress-Trinamool alliance, led by Mamata Banerjee, defeated the Left Front, led by Buddhadeb. The 34-and-a-half-year Left Front regime was over.\n\nBuddhadeb had been invited to CM Mamata's swearing-in ceremony at Raj Bhavan, but he declined the invitation.\n\nBuddhadeb had believed in his industrialisation policy, but it was questioned by his own party.\n\nFollowing his resignation, he presented relevant documents before the CPM and declared that his government's industrialisation policy was correct. At the time, there was also a demand for land acquisition for industry.\n\nHe claimed that this process was inevitable and that the Singur-Nandigram incident was only an \"exception\". There were some administrative and political errors, he admitted, and asked the party to \"learn from the exceptions\". It was his firm belief that industrialisation could not be stopped.\n\nHowever, the killing of villagers in Nandigram had a profound effect on Buddhadeb. Speaking at a public meeting, he accused himself of being \"responsible\" for the incident. During a 2013 interview also, Buddhadeb expressed regret for the Nandigram shooting.\n\nFollowing his defeat in the 2011 election, Buddhadeb's health began to deteriorate. He started to disappear from the party activities.\n\nHowever, he would still visit the Alimuddin Street office of the party, primarily for academic purposes, even after his ouster. That also eventually stopped.\n\nHis eyesight was deteriorating, and his body was gradually breaking down. The complication of breathlessness reappeared, which required multiple hospital stays.\n\nBuddhadeb, an avid reader, penned numerous plays and essays during his lifetime. He also translated poems and other writings from other countries.\n\nAmong other works, he translated legendary Colombian writer Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's 'The Story of a Shipwrecked Sailor'.\n\nIn his Bangla book, \"Swarger Neeche Maha Bishrinkhala (Great Chaos Under Heaven)\", he even criticised China for one of its latest policies.\n\nBuddhadeb was personally connected with a number of well-known national and international cultural figures. He would have direct communication with the leaders of main opposition political parties. The central government nominated Buddhadeb for the Padma Bhushan in 2022, but he turned it down.\n\nBuddhadeb had this quintessential Bengali 'bhadralok' image that he carried with him till the end, an image that stayed clean despite the various controversies surrounding him and all the stains his Left party suffered during its 34-year rule in West Bengal.\n\nHe lived in a modest two-room, 770-square-foot flat in south Kolkata's Palm Avenue, a house he never left even after becoming the CM. Family members insisted, and officials in charge of security wanted him to move out, but he remained firm.\n\nCOPD has prevented him from flying since 2010. That's the reason why, during his tenure with Politburo and the party's central committee, Buddhadeb did not attend meetings held outside the state. In later years, he started to travel with an oxygen cylinder, and was under strict monitoring at home. He was last seen in public at a Left Front Brigade rally in 2019.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the CPM shared a Buddhadeb video generated using artificial intelligence. The ailing former CM could be seen urging people to vote for the Left and secular forces.\n\nBuddhadeb was in charge when the Leftist political system collapsed in Bengal. He was the main character during that \"betrayal\" phase, in a sense. But Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee's image of an \"honest\" politician remained unscathed, and he will live on in the collective memory of Bengal.", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news",

Being the second-only chief minister from a party that ran the longest serving democratically-elected Communist government in the world, is nonetheless a record, especially in the parlance of Parliamentary politics. Having said that, being known as the last chief minister from a party that ruled for a long 34 years, doesn't augur well for any politician.\n\nThe life and times of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the last Communist chief minister of West Bengal, who passed away on Thursday, could well serve as an eye-opener for the CPM elsewhere in the country, especially in Kerala. At a time when the Left has been going through challenging times, how the Bengal veteran bowed down in 2011 after being in office for 11 consecutive years, can enlighten the Left leaders.\n\nAs in Kerala, in WB too, the CPM had surged forward making notable progress through reforms like power decentralisation, Panchayat Raj, protecting the rights of tenants and development of the agricultural sector. The state was moving rapidly to the next phase of progress. The Singur and Nandigram blunders, however, cost dearly, with the 2011 election turning out to be his personal Waterloo.\n\n\"Budhadebda was aiming at an industrial uprising, through people's participation. It could have well addressed unemployment in Bengal. Large scale land acquisition became the state government's responsibility. The Bengal experience teaches us a valuable lesson that land for any purpose should be acquired, only after taking farmers into confidence,\" said\n\nCPM politburo member M A Baby.\n\nIt was not Buddhadeb's decision to go for industrialisation, but the selection of Nandigram, which was most fertile land used for agriculture, for it that turned out to be a big blunder, said political observer Appukkuttan Vallikkunnu.

All these traits are not very usual for many of his party colleagues who rose from the ranks.\n\nCPM state secretary Promode Dasgupta hand-picked this Presidency College alumnus and poet Sukanta Bhattacharya's nephew -- Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee -- to lead the party's youth front.\n\nBhattacharjee didn't hesitate to take on the Left trade unions over the \"bandh culture\". As a CM, he even attended office during a bandh called by Left trade unions, including the CITU. \"Personally, if you ask me, I think it (strike) is not helping us, our country. But unfortunately, as I belong to one party and (when) they call a strike, I keep mum. But I have finally decided that next time I will open my mouth,\" Bhattacharjee had said in 2008.\n\nAll his life, Bhattacharjee tried marrying the Communist ideals of human emancipation with real life politics that moved like parallel lines with the gap widening in course of time. He preferred glasnost and perestroika to the iron curtains in former communist regimes.\n\nIn the process, he ended up as a misunderstood Marxist even among his ilk. Few would believe that this man had once given CPM a fresh lease of life in 2006, and took the party tally to 235 out of 294 in the 2006 pollsBhattacharjee could make people believe that his govt would break barriers, charting out a development course quite different from the Jyoti Basu govt.\n\nHe didn't mind inviting Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata to the oath taking ceremony in 2006 even though it didn't go well with the traditional communist convention. The mission tripped in Singur and Nandigram. The bhadraloks who once stood by him while he was chasing the dream started complaining about his lack of tact, his foolhardy approach in land acquisition.\n\nAnd to copybook communists, Bhattacharjee often crossed the Marxist 'lakshman rekha' despite all his good intentions. Sabyasachi Sen, industry secretary during 2003 to early 2010, said: \"I respect him very much and I am deeply shocked at his demise.\" It would be going against history if one puts the entire blame for the CPM reversal on Bhattacharjee.\n\nIn its long stint for 30 years, the CPM had gathered by then all the garbage that comes with power -- arrogance, nepotism, corruption, using organisation muscle to establish hegemony at all walks of life. Buddhababu was aware of these and was at times vocal against them.\n\nAll these could be a reason why he took legal land acquisition route to keep local land sharks at bay. The process was smooth in parts of West Midnapore.\n\nBut while taking the sarkari route, he antagonised those who ran his party machinery. The poor and marginal farmers, a major chunk being Muslims, also felt alienated in the so called industrialisation programme.\n\nIt's a tragedy that Bhattacharjee lost sight of this fact in the pursuit of industry that finally devoured the once powerful CPM machinery", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The late politician's career is often associated with the case of Tata Nano Singur controversy. The citizens of Singur expressed their thoughts on the demise and what could have been if things were different.\n\nIn 2006, under the leadership of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the then CM of West Bengal, the state government had allocated 1,200 acres of land in Singur to the Tata Group. The company and the government aimed to implement SEZ projects in the region, for the manufacturing of Nano cars.\n\nIt was the beginning of the state's ruling government's downfall, as the project was marred with controversies regarding land acquisition. As per reports, the state government came under fire for citing the 1894 Land Acquisition Act rule, which was used to take over 997 acres of land for the Tata project. So, the project gained a lot of criticism from activists as well as the opposition parties of the state, eventually being shut down.\n\nLocal18 reports that 13 years have passed since the controversy, leaving the citizens of Singur hopeless. One of the residents of the place admitted to the regrets they feel, in a conversation with Local18. According to him, the project could have proven to be a developmental force in the state and the region, opening job opportunities for the citizens.\n\nAs per the reports of the Economic Times, the farmers were handed over the lands which were acquired for the Tata project. Now, they are forced to depend on the government and petty jobs to make a livelihood.

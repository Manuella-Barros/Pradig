Jim Jordan of Ohio, told Wray: \"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation.\"\n\nThough the FBI has avoided the same level of scrutiny over the shooting directed at the Secret Service over security failures that preceded the shooting, culminating Tuesday in the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle, Wray is likely to be questioned by lawmakers skeptical of the bureau's assessment that Crooks left behind no obvious ideological motive that could explain his actions.\n\nRelated Story: Trump Announces He Will Meet with Netanyahu on Friday at Mar-a-Lago\n\nThe FBI has said it is investigating the shooting, which killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism and an attempted assassination. Trump's campaign said the presumptive GOP nominee was doing \"fine\" after the shooting, which Trump said pierced the upper part of his right ear.\n\nWray and other senior officials privately briefed members of Congress last week, telling them that Crooks had photos on his phone of Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden and other officials and had looked up the dates for the Democratic National Convention as well as Trump's appearances.\n\nA law enforcement official told The Associated Press last week that Crooks had also flown a drone above the rally site before the event in an apparent effort to scope out the scene in advance.", "source": {"uri": "gvwire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GV Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@gvwire.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Though the FBI has avoided the same level of scrutiny directed at the Secret Service over security lapses that preceded the shooting, culminating Tuesday in the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle, Wray is likely to be questioned by lawmakers skeptical of the bureau's assessment that Crooks left behind no obvious ideological motive that could explain his actions.\n\nThe FBI has said that it is investigating the Butler, Pennsylvania, shooting, which killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism and an attempted assassination. Trump's campaign said the presumptive GOP nominee was doing \"fine\" after the shooting, which he said pierced the upper part of his right ear.\n\nWray and other senior officials privately briefed members of Congress last week, telling them that Crooks had photos on his phone of Trump and President Joe Biden and other officials and had looked up the dates for the Democratic National Convention as well as Trump's appearances.

Kennedy from a sniper's perch in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.\n\nThe revelation to the House Judiciary Committee was part of a collection of new details offered by Wray about the July 13 shooting at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The FBI's investigation has thrust the bureau into a political maelstrom months before the presidential election, with lawmakers and the public pressing for details about what may have motivated Crooks in the most serious attempt to assassinate a president or presidential candidate since President Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981.\n\nThe FBI has built out a detailed timeline of Crooks' movements and online activity, but the precise motive -- or why Trump was singled out -- remains elusive, Wray said.\n\n\"A lot of the usual repositories of information have not yielded, anything notable in terms of motive or ideology,\" Wray said. He did note that Crooks had grown interested in public officials -- besides Trump, Crooks also had photos on his phone of Democratic President Joe Biden and other prominent figures -- and in the days before the shooting had appeared particularly consumed by Trump, the Republicans' White House nominee.\n\nWray also said that Crooks, about two hours before the shooting, had flown a drone about 200 yards (180 meters) from the rally stage where Trump would later stand and that Crooks used the device to livestream and watch footage. The use of the drone so close the rally site just hours before Trump took the stage for the rally add to the questions about the security lapses preceding the event.\n\nWray pledged to lawmakers that the FBI would \"leave no stone unturned\" in its investigation.\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment, and tragically the Butler County assassination attempt is another example -- a particularly heinous and public one -- of what I've been talking about,\" Wray said.\n\nThe hearing had been scheduled well before the shooting, as part of the committee's routine oversight of the FBI and the Justice Department. Questions about the shooting dominated the session.\n\nDespite being appointed by Trump, Wray typically faces antagonistic questions from the Republican-led panel, a reflection of lingering discontent over the FBI's investigation into potential ties between Russia and the 2016 campaign, when Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThat sentiment was made clear early in the hearing when the committee chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told Wray: \"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation.\"\n\nThe FBI so far has avoided the same level of scrutiny over the shooting directed at the Secret Service over security failures that preceded the shooting and has led to the the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle,\n\nThe FBI has said it is investigating the shooting, which killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism and an attempted assassination. Trump's campaign said the presumptive GOP nominee was doing \"fine\" after the shooting, which Trump said pierced the upper part of his right ear.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of FBI Director Christopher Wray at https://apnews.com/hub/christopher-wray.", "source": {"uri": "bradfordera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Bradford Era"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@bradfordera.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "eric_tucker@bradfordera.com", "name": "Eric Tucker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

The use of the drone so close the rally site just hours before Trump took the stage for the rally add to the questions about the security lapses preceding the event.\n\nWray pledged to lawmakers that the FBI would \"leave no stone unturned\" in its investigation.\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment, and tragically the Butler County assassination attempt is another example -- a particularly heinous and public one -- of what I've been talking about,\" Wray said.\n\nThe hearing had been scheduled well before the shooting, as part of the committee's routine oversight of the FBI and the Justice Department. Questions about the shooting dominated the session.\n\nDespite being appointed by Trump, Wray typically faces antagonistic questions from the Republican-led panel, a reflection of lingering discontent over the FBI's investigation into potential ties between Russia and the 2016 campaign, when Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThat sentiment was made clear early in the hearing when the committee chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told Wray: \"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation.\"\n\nThe FBI so far has avoided the same level of scrutiny over the shooting directed at the Secret Service over security failures that preceded the shooting and has led to the the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle,\n\nThe FBI has said it is investigating the shooting, which killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism and an attempted assassination.

That is the same day that it appears he registered\" for the Trump rally scheduled for July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania, Wray told the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the shooting, which killed one rally-goer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism.\n\nCrooks was killed by a Secret Service countersniper.\n\nThe investigation has thrust the bureau into a political maelstrom months before the presidential election, with lawmakers and the public pressing for details about what may have motivated Crooks in the most serious attempt to assassinate a president or presidential candidate since President Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981.\n\nThe agency has built out a detailed timeline of Crooks' movements and online activity, but the precise motive - or why Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, was singled out - remains elusive, Wray said.\n\n\"A lot of the usual repositories of information have not yielded, anything notable in terms of motive or ideology,\" Wray said.\n\nThe FBI's assessment is that Crooks acted alone.\n\nWray noted that Crooks had grown interested in public officials - besides Trump, Crooks also had photos on his phone of Democratic President Joe Biden and other prominent figures - and in the days before the shooting had appeared particularly consumed by Trump.\n\nCrooks is believed to have visited the rally site a week before the event, staying for about 20 minutes, and then returned on the morning of July 13.\n\nAbout two hours before the shooting, Wray said, Crooks flew a drone about 200 yards from the rally for about 11 minutes, using the device to livestream and watch footage and obtain what Wray said would have been a \"rear view mirror\" of the scene behind him.\n\nThe use of the drone, which along with a controller were recovered from Crooks' car, so close to the rally site just hours before Trump took the stage add to the questions about the security lapses.\n\nOn the afternoon of the rally, Crooks attracted law enforcement scrutiny because of odd behavior around the edges of the event, including shouldering a backpack and peering into the lens of a range finder toward the rooftops behind the stage where Trump would stand within the hour.\n\nUsing what Wray said was mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping, Crooks was able to hoist himself up onto the roof of a squat manufacturing building that was within 135 meters of the stage. Crooks fired eight shots from an AR-style rifle before being he was killed.\n\nThe FBI thinks Crooks may have managed to avoid detection despite being armed because his weapon had a collapsible folding stock, Wray said.\n\nWray pledged to lawmakers that the FBI would \"leave no stone unturned\" in its investigation.\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment, and tragically the Butler County assassination attempt is another example - a particularly heinous and public one - of what I've been talking about,\" Wray said.\n\nThe hearing had been scheduled well before the shooting - as part of the committee's routine oversight of the FBI and the Justice Department. Questions about the shooting dominated the session.\n\nThe FBI so far has avoided the same level of scrutiny over the shooting directed at the Secret Service over security failures that preceded the shooting and has led to the the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle.\n\nEven so, Wray was not able to entirely avoid the antagonistic questions he typically receives from the Republican-led committee, a reflection of the lingering perception that the FBI and Justice Department have become politicized against Trump - something Wray has consistently denied.\n\nThat sentiment was made clear early in the hearing when the committee chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told Wray: \"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation.\"", "source": {"uri": "gulftoday.ae", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Gulf Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Crooks was killed by a Secret Service countersniper. The investigation has thrust the bureau into a political maelstrom months before the presidential election, with lawmakers and the public pressing for details about what may have motivated Crooks in the most serious attempt to assassinate a President or presidential candidate since President Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981.\n\nThe agency has built out a detailed timeline of Crooks' movements and online activity, but the precise motive -- or why Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, was singled out -- remains elusive, Wray said.\n\n\"A lot of the usual repositories of information have not yielded, anything notable in terms of motive or ideology,\" Wray said.\n\nThe FBI's assessment is that Crooks acted alone.\n\nWray noted that Crooks had grown interested in public officials -- besides Trump, Crooks also had photos on his phone of Democratic President Joe Biden and other prominent figures -- and in the days before the shooting had appeared particularly consumed by Trump.\n\nCrooks is believed to have visited the rally site a week before the event, staying for about 20 minutes, and then returned on the morning of July 13. About two hours before the shooting, Wray said, Crooks flew a drone about 200 yards from the rally for about 11 minutes, using the device to livestream and watch footage and obtain what Wray said would have been a \"rear view mirror\" of the scene behind him.\n\nThe use of the drone, which along with a controller were recovered from Crooks' car, so close to the rally site just hours before Trump took the stage add to the questions about the security lapses.\n\nOn the afternoon of the rally, Crooks attracted law enforcement scrutiny because of odd behavior around the edges of the event, including shouldering a backpack and peering into the lens of a range finder toward the rooftops behind the stage where Trump would stand within the hour.\n\nUsing what Wray said was mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping, Crooks was able to hoist himself up onto the roof of a squat manufacturing building that was within 135 meters (157 yards) of the stage. Crooks fired eight shots from an AR-style rifle before being he was killed.\n\nThe FBI thinks Crooks may have managed to avoid detection despite being armed because his weapon had a collapsible folding stock, Wray said.\n\nWray pledged to lawmakers that the FBI would \"leave no stone unturned\" in its investigation.\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment, and tragically the Butler County assassination attempt is another example -- a particularly heinous and public one -- of what I've been talking about,\" Wray said.\n\nThe hearing had been scheduled well before the shooting -- as part of the committee's routine oversight of the FBI and the Justice Department. Questions about the shooting dominated the session.\n\nThe FBI so far has avoided the same level of scrutiny over the shooting directed at the Secret Service over security failures that preceded the shooting and has led to the the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle.\n\nEven so, Wray was not able to entirely avoid the antagonistic questions he typically receives from the Republican-led committee, a reflection of the lingering perception that the FBI and Justice Department have become politicized against Trump -- something Wray has consistently denied.\n\nThat sentiment was made clear early in the hearing when the committee Chair, Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, told Wray: \"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation.\"\n\n___\n\nRepublished with permission of The Associated Press.", "source": {"uri": "floridapolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections.

Though the FBI has avoided the same level of scrutiny directed at the Secret Service over security lapses that preceded the shooting, culminating Tuesday in the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle, Wray is likely to be questioned by lawmakers skeptical of the bureau's assessment that Crooks left behind no obvious ideological motive that could explain his actions.\n\nThe FBI has said that it is investigating the Butler, Pennsylvania, shooting, which killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism and an attempted assassination. Trump's campaign said the presumptive GOP nominee was doing \"fine\" after the shooting, which he said pierced the upper part of his right ear.\n\nWray and other senior officials privately briefed members of Congress last week, telling them that Crooks had photos on his phone of Trump and President Joe Biden and other officials and had looked up the dates for the Democratic National Convention as well as Trump's appearances. A law enforcement official told The Associated Press last week that Crooks had also flown a drone above the rally site before the event in an apparent effort to scope out the scene in advance.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

Jim Jordan of Ohio, told Wray: \"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation.\"\n\nThough the FBI has avoided the same level of scrutiny over the shooting directed at the Secret Service over security failures that preceded the shooting, culminating Tuesday in the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle, Wray is likely to be questioned by lawmakers skeptical of the bureau's assessment that Crooks left behind no obvious ideological motive that could explain his actions.\n\nThe FBI has said it is investigating the shooting, which killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism and an attempted assassination. Trump's campaign said the presumptive GOP nominee was doing \"fine\" after the shooting, which Trump said pierced the upper part of his right ear.\n\nWray and other senior officials privately briefed members of Congress last week, telling them that Crooks had photos on his phone of Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden and other officials and had looked up the dates for the Democratic National Convention as well as Trump's appearances.\n\nA law enforcement official told The Associated Press last week that Crooks had also flown a drone above the rally site before the event in an apparent effort to scope out the scene in advance.\n\nMore National Politics videos Can Vice President Harris beat Trump?

Kennedy from a sniper's perch in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.\n\n\"That is a search that is significant in terms of his state of mind. That is the same day that it appears he registered\" for the Trump rally scheduled for July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania, Wray told the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the shooting, which killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism.\n\nCrooks was killed by a Secret Service countersniper.\n\nThe investigation has thrust the bureau into a political maelstrom months before the presidential election, with lawmakers and the public pressing for details about what may have motivated Crooks in the most serious attempt to assassinate a president or presidential candidate since President Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981.\n\nThe agency has built out a detailed timeline of Crooks' movements and online activity, but the precise motive -- or why Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, was singled out -- remains elusive, Wray said.\n\n\"A lot of the usual repositories of information have not yielded, anything notable in terms of motive or ideology,\" Wray said.\n\nThe FBI's assessment is that Crooks acted alone.\n\nWray noted that Crooks had grown interested in public officials -- besides Trump, Crooks also had photos on his phone of Democratic President Joe Biden and other prominent figures -- and in the days before the shooting had appeared particularly consumed by Trump.\n\nCrooks is believed to have visited the rally site a week before the event, staying for about 20 minutes, and then returned on the morning of July 13.\n\nAbout two hours before the shooting, Wray said, Crooks flew a drone about 200 yards from the rally for about 11 minutes, using the device to livestream and watch footage and obtain what Wray said would have been a \"rear view mirror\" of the scene behind him.\n\nThe use of the drone, which along with a controller were recovered from Crooks' car, so close to the rally site just hours before Trump took the stage add to the questions about the security lapses.\n\nOn the afternoon of the rally, Crooks attracted law enforcement scrutiny because of odd behavior around the edges of the event, including shouldering a backpack and peering into the lens of a range finder toward the rooftops behind the stage where Trump would stand within the hour.\n\nUsing what Wray said was mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping, Crooks was able to hoist himself up onto the roof of a squat manufacturing building that was within 135 meters (157 yards) of the stage. Crooks fired eight shots from an AR-style rifle before being he was killed.\n\nThe FBI thinks Crooks may have managed to avoid detection despite being armed because his weapon had a collapsible folding stock, Wray said.\n\nWray pledged to lawmakers that the FBI would \"leave no stone unturned\" in its investigation.\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment, and tragically the Butler County assassination attempt is another example -- a particularly heinous and public one -- of what I've been talking about,\" Wray said.\n\nThe hearing had been scheduled well before the shooting -- as part of the committee's routine oversight of the FBI and the Justice Department. Questions about the shooting dominated the session.\n\nThe FBI so far has avoided the same level of scrutiny over the shooting directed at the Secret Service over security failures that preceded the shooting and has led to the the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle.\n\nEven so, Wray was not able to entirely avoid the antagonistic questions he typically receives from the Republican-led committee, a reflection of the lingering perception that the FBI and Justice Department have become politicized against Trump -- something Wray has consistently denied.\n\nThat sentiment was made clear early in the hearing when the committee chairman, Rep.

Kennedy from a sniper's perch in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.\n\nThe revelation to the House Judiciary Committee was part of a collection of new details offered by Wray about the July 13 shooting at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The FBI's investigation has thrust the bureau into a political maelstrom months before the presidential election, with lawmakers and the public pressing for details about what may have motivated Crooks in the most serious attempt to assassinate a president or presidential candidate since President Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981.\n\nThe FBI has built out a detailed timeline of Crooks' movements and online activity, but the precise motive -- or why Trump was singled out -- remains elusive, Wray said.\n\n\"A lot of the usual repositories of information have not yielded, anything notable in terms of motive or ideology,\" Wray said. He did note that Crooks had grown interested in public officials -- besides Trump, Crooks also had photos on his phone of Democratic President Joe Biden and other prominent figures -- and in the days before the shooting had appeared particularly consumed by Trump, the Republicans' White House nominee.\n\nWray also said that Crooks, about two hours before the shooting, had flown a drone about 200 yards (180 meters) from the rally stage where Trump would later stand and that Crooks used the device to livestream and watch footage. The use of the drone so close the rally site just hours before Trump took the stage for the rally add to the questions about the security lapses preceding the event.\n\nWray pledged to lawmakers that the FBI would \"leave no stone unturned\" in its investigation.\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment, and tragically the Butler County assassination attempt is another example -- a particularly heinous and public one -- of what I've been talking about,\" Wray said.\n\nThe hearing had been scheduled well before the shooting, as part of the committee's routine oversight of the FBI and the Justice Department. Questions about the shooting dominated the session.\n\nDespite being appointed by Trump, Wray typically faces antagonistic questions from the Republican-led panel, a reflection of lingering discontent over the FBI's investigation into potential ties between Russia and the 2016 campaign, when Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThat sentiment was made clear early in the hearing when the committee chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told Wray: \"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation.\"\n\nThe FBI so far has avoided the same level of scrutiny over the shooting directed at the Secret Service over security failures that preceded the shooting and has led to the the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle,\n\nThe FBI has said it is investigating the shooting, which killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism and an attempted assassination. Trump's campaign said the presumptive GOP nominee was doing \"fine\" after the shooting, which Trump said pierced the upper part of his right ear.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy from a sniper's perch in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.\n\n\"That's a search obviously that is significant in terms of his state of mind. That is the same day that it appears that he registered\" for the Trump rally scheduled for July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania, Wray told the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the shooting, which killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism. Crooks was killed by a Secret Service countersniper. The investigation has thrust the bureau into a political maelstrom months before the presidential election, with lawmakers and the public pressing for details about what may have motivated Crooks in the most serious attempt to assassinate a president or presidential candidate since President Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981.\n\nThe agency has built out a detailed timeline of Crooks' movements and online activity, but the precise motive -- or why Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, was singled out -- remains elusive, Wray said.\n\n\"In terms of what we've been able to find so far, a lot of the usual repositories of information have not yielded anything notable in terms of motive or ideology,\" Wray said.\n\nThe FBI's assessment continues to be that Crooks acted alone, though agents are still investigating.\n\nWray noted that Crooks had grown interested in public officials -- besides Trump, Crooks also had photos on his phone of Democratic President Joe Biden and other prominent figures -- and in the days before the shooting had appeared particularly consumed by Trump and the Butler rally.\n\nCrooks is believed to have visited the rally site a week before the event, staying for about 20 minutes, and then returned on the morning of July 13. More than two hours before the shooting, Wray said, Crooks flew a drone about 200 yards from the rally stage for about 11 minutes, using the device to livestream and watch footage and obtain what Wray said would have been a \"rearview mirror\" of the scene behind him.\n\nThe use of the drone, which along with a controller were recovered from Crooks' car, so close to the rally site just hours before Trump took the stage add to the questions about the security lapses that preceded the shooting.\n\nOn the afternoon of the rally, Crooks attracted law enforcement scrutiny because of odd behavior around the edges of the event, including shouldering a backpack and peering into the lens of a range finder toward the rooftops behind the stage where Trump would stand within the hour.\n\nUsing what Wray said was mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping, Crooks was able to hoist himself up onto the roof of a squat manufacturing building that was within 135 meters (157 yards) of the stage. Crooks fired eight shots from an AR-style rifle before he was killed. (The Warren Commission report that analyzed the Kennedy assassination assessed that Kennedy had been shot through the neck at a range of 174.9 feet to 190.8 feet, or about 53.3 meters to 58.1 meters.)\n\nThe FBI thinks Crooks may have managed to avoid detection in the crowd despite being armed because his weapon had a collapsible folding stock, Wray said.\n\nWray pledged to lawmakers that the FBI would \"leave no stone unturned\" in its investigation.\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment, and tragically the Butler County assassination attempt is another example -- a particularly heinous and very public one -- of what I have been talking about,\" Wray said.\n\nThe hearing had been schedule well before the shooting as part of the committee's routine oversight of the FBI and the Justice Department. Questions about the shooting dominated the session, but other topics included the FBI's diversity efforts, election interference and the Jan 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThough the FBI so far has avoided the same level of scrutiny over the shooting directed at the Secret Service over security failures, culminating Tuesday in the resignation of Kimberly Cheatle as the agency's director, Wray was not able to entirely avoid the antagonistic questions he typically receives from the Republican-led committee.\n\nThat's a reflection of the lingering perception among some GOP lawmakers that the FBI and Justice Department in the Biden administration have become politicized against Trump -- something Wray has consistently denied.\n\nThat sentiment was made clear early in the hearing when the committee chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told Wray: \"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation.\"", "source": {"uri": "kurv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "710 KURV - The Valley's News/Talk Station"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

More than two hours before the shooting, Wray said, Crooks flew a drone about 200 yards from the rally stage for about 11 minutes, using the device to livestream and watch footage.\n\nThe use of the drone, which along with a controller were recovered from Crooks' car, so close to the rally site just hours before Trump took the stage add to the questions about the security lapses that preceded the shooting.\n\nOn the afternoon of the rally, Crooks attracted law enforcement scrutiny because of odd behavior around the edges of the event, including shouldering a backpack and peering into the lens of a range finder toward the rooftops behind the stage where Trump would stand within the hour.\n\nUsing what Wray said was mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping, Crooks was able to hoist himself up onto the roof of a squat manufacturing building that was within 135 meters (157 yards) of the stage. Crooks fired eight shots from an AR-style rifle before he was killed. (The Warren Commission report that analyzed the Kennedy assassination assessed that Kennedy had been shot through the neck at a range of 174.9 feet to 190.8 feet, or about 53.3 meters to 58.1 meters.)\n\nTrump's campaign said the GOP nominee was doing \"fine\" after the shooting, which Trump said pierced the upper part of his right ear. Wray said his understanding was that either a bullet or some shrapnel \"is what grazed his ear.\"\n\nHe pledged that the FBI would \"leave no stone unturned\" in its investigation.\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment, and tragically the Butler County assassination attempt is another example -- a particularly heinous and very public one -- of what I have been talking about,\" Wray said.\n\nHe later added, \"I think this is a moment where, in the most stark way possible, all of us as Americans can see how out of control political violence is in this country, and it's an opportunity for everyone to come together and to try to show that this is not the kind of thing we're going to tolerate in this country.\"\n\nThe hearing had been scheduled well before the shooting as part of the committee's routine oversight of the FBI and the Justice Department. Questions about the shooting dominated the session, but other topics included the FBI's diversity efforts, election interference, the Jan 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol and whether Wray had personally observed any cognitive decline in meetings with Biden that preceded the president's announcement Sunday that he would not seek reelection.\n\nAfter Wray testified that his interactions had been \"completely professional,\" Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that the FBI director he appointed in 2017 \"has to resign, and NOW, for LYING TO CONGRESS!\"\n\nThe FBI was not involved in ensuring security for the rally and has therefore avoided the same level of scrutiny directed at the Secret Service over the lapses that preceded the event. On Tuesday, Kimberly Cheatle resigned as the agency's director.\n\nEven so, Wray was not entirely spared the politically charged and occasionally combative questions he typically receives from the Republican-led committee.\n\nThat's a reflection of the lingering perception among some GOP lawmakers that the FBI and Justice Department in the Biden administration have become politicized against Trump -- something Wray has consistently denied.\n\nThat sentiment was made clear early in the hearing when the committee chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told Wray, \"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation.\"\n\nAt the conclusion of the daylong hearing, he praised Wray for having \"told us some things that weren't even prompted by questions.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of FBI Director Christopher Wray at https://apnews.com/hub/christopher-wray.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

About two hours before the shooting, Wray said, Crooks flew a drone about 200 yards from the rally for about 11 minutes, using the device to livestream and watch footage and obtain what Wray said would have been a \"rear view mirror\" of the scene behind him.\n\nThe use of the drone, which along with a controller were recovered from Crooks' car, so close to the rally site just hours before Trump took the stage add to the questions about the security lapses.\n\nOn the afternoon of the rally, Crooks attracted law enforcement scrutiny because of odd behavior around the edges of the event, including shouldering a backpack and peering into the lens of a range finder toward the rooftops behind the stage where Trump would stand within the hour.\n\nUsing what Wray said was mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping, Crooks was able to hoist himself up onto the roof of a squat manufacturing building that was within 135 meters (157 yards) of the stage. Crooks fired eight shots from an AR-style rifle before being he was killed.\n\nThe FBI thinks Crooks may have managed to avoid detection despite being armed because his weapon had a collapsible folding stock, Wray said.\n\nWray pledged to lawmakers that the FBI would \"leave no stone unturned\" in its investigation.\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment, and tragically the Butler County assassination attempt is another example -- a particularly heinous and public one -- of what I've been talking about,\" Wray said.\n\nThe hearing had been scheduled well before the shooting -- as part of the committee's routine oversight of the FBI and the Justice Department.

Though the FBI has avoided the same level of scrutiny directed at the Secret Service over security lapses that preceded the shooting, culminating Tuesday in the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle, Wray is likely to be questioned by lawmakers skeptical of the bureau's assessment that Crooks left behind no obvious ideological motive that could explain his actions.\n\nThe FBI has said that it is investigating the Butler, Pennsylvania, shooting, which killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism and an attempted assassination. Trump's campaign said the presumptive GOP nominee was doing \"fine\" after the shooting, which he said pierced the upper part of his right ear.\n\nWray and other senior officials privately briefed members of Congress last week, telling them that Crooks had photos on his phone of Trump and President Joe Biden and other officials and had looked up the dates for the Democratic National Convention as well as Trump's appearances. A law enforcement official told The Associated Press last week that Crooks had also flown a drone above the rally site before the event in an apparent effort to scope out the scene in advance.\n\nShooter flew drone 200 yards from site hours before shooting\n\nThe shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, flew a drone about 200 yards from the rally venue, and had it up in the air for about 11 minutes, just hours before the shooting, Wray told the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.\n\nThe drone -- which was recovered in the shooter's car -- was flown at about 3:50 p.m., he said.\n\n\"Let me be clear about the area -- not over the stage, and that part of the area itself, but, I would say, about 200 yards, give or take, away,\" he said. \"And that we think, but we do not know.

More than two hours before the shooting, Wray said, Crooks flew a drone about 200 yards from the rally stage for about 11 minutes, using the device to livestream and watch footage.\n\nThe use of the drone, which along with a controller were recovered from Crooks' car, so close to the rally site just hours before Trump took the stage add to the questions about the security lapses that preceded the shooting.\n\nOn the afternoon of the rally, Crooks attracted law enforcement scrutiny because of odd behavior around the edges of the event, including shouldering a backpack and peering into the lens of a range finder toward the rooftops behind the stage where Trump would stand within the hour.\n\nUsing what Wray said was mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping, Crooks was able to hoist himself up onto the roof of a squat manufacturing building that was within 135 meters (157 yards) of the stage. Crooks fired eight shots from an AR-style rifle before he was killed. (The Warren Commission report that analyzed the Kennedy assassination assessed that Kennedy had been shot through the neck at a range of 174.9 feet to 190.8 feet, or about 53.3 meters to 58.1 meters.)\n\nTrump's campaign said the GOP nominee was doing \"fine\" after the shooting, which Trump said pierced the upper part of his right ear. Wray said his understanding was that either a bullet or some shrapnel \"is what grazed his ear.\"\n\nHe pledged that the FBI would \"leave no stone unturned\" in its investigation.\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment, and tragically the Butler County assassination attempt is another example -- a particularly heinous and very public one -- of what I have been talking about,\" Wray said.\n\nHe later added, \"I think this is a moment where, in the most stark way possible, all of us as Americans can see how out of control political violence is in this country, and it's an opportunity for everyone to come together and to try to show that this is not the kind of thing we're going to tolerate in this country.\"\n\nThe hearing had been scheduled well before the shooting as part of the committee's routine oversight of the FBI and the Justice Department. Questions about the shooting dominated the session, but other topics included the FBI's diversity efforts, election interference, the Jan 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol and whether Wray had personally observed any cognitive decline in meetings with Biden that preceded the president's announcement Sunday that he would not seek reelection.\n\nAfter Wray testified that his interactions had been \"completely professional,\" Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that the FBI director he appointed in 2017 \"has to resign, and NOW, for LYING TO CONGRESS!\"\n\nThe FBI was not involved in ensuring security for the rally and has therefore avoided the same level of scrutiny directed at the Secret Service over the lapses that preceded the event. On Tuesday, Kimberly Cheatle resigned as the agency's director.\n\nEven so, Wray was not entirely spared the politically charged and occasionally combative questions he typically receives from the Republican-led committee.\n\nThat's a reflection of the lingering perception among some GOP lawmakers that the FBI and Justice Department in the Biden administration have become politicized against Trump -- something Wray has consistently denied.\n\nThat sentiment was made clear early in the hearing when the committee chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told Wray, \"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation.\"\n\nAt the conclusion of the daylong hearing, he praised Wray for having \"told us some things that weren't even prompted by questions.\"", "source": {"uri": "vaildaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vail Daily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy from a sniper's perch in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.\n\nThe revelation to the House Judiciary Committee was part of a collection of new details offered by Wray about the July 13 shooting at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The FBI's investigation has thrust the bureau into a political maelstrom months before the presidential election, with lawmakers and the public pressing for details about what may have motivated Crooks in the most serious attempt to assassinate a president or presidential candidate since President Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981.\n\nThe FBI has built out a detailed timeline of Crooks' movements and online activity, but the precise motive -- or why Trump was singled out -- remains elusive, Wray said.\n\n\"A lot of the usual repositories of information have not yielded, anything notable in terms of motive or ideology,\" Wray said. He did note that Crooks had grown interested in public officials -- besides Trump, Crooks also had photos on his phone of Democratic President Joe Biden and other prominent figures -- and in the days before the shooting had appeared particularly consumed by Trump, the Republicans' White House nominee.\n\nWray also said that Crooks, about two hours before the shooting, had flown a drone about 200 yards (180 meters) from the rally stage where Trump would later stand and that Crooks used the device to livestream and watch footage.

AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, File\n\nWASHINGTON -- The gunman in the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump is believed to have done a Google search one week before the shooting of \"How far away was Oswald from Kennedy?\" FBI Director Christopher Wray said Wednesday, revealing new details about a suspect he said had taken a keen interest in public figures but had otherwise not left behind clear clues of an ideological motive.\n\nThe search, recovered from a laptop tied to 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, is a reference to Lee Harvey Oswald, the shooter who killed President John F. Kennedy from a sniper's perch in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.\n\nThe revelation to the House Judiciary Committee was part of a collection of new details offered by Wray about the July 13 shooting at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The FBI's investigation has thrust the bureau into a political maelstrom months before the presidential election, with lawmakers and the public pressing for details about what may have motivated Crooks in the most serious attempt to assassinate a president or presidential candidate since President Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981.\n\nThe FBI has built out a detailed timeline of Crooks' movements and online activity, but the precise motive -- or why Trump was singled out -- remains elusive, Wray said.\n\n\"A lot of the usual repositories of information have not yielded, anything notable in terms of motive or ideology,\" Wray said. He did note that Crooks had grown interested in public officials -- besides Trump, Crooks also had photos on his phone of Democratic President Joe Biden and other prominent figures -- and in the days before the shooting had appeared particularly consumed by Trump, the Republicans' White House nominee.\n\nWray also said that Crooks, about two hours before the shooting, had flown a drone about 200 yards (180 meters) from the rally stage where Trump would later stand and that Crooks used the device to livestream and watch footage. The use of the drone so close the rally site just hours before Trump took the stage for the rally add to the questions about the security lapses preceding the event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWray pledged to lawmakers that the FBI would \"leave no stone unturned\" in its investigation.\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment, and tragically the Butler County assassination attempt is another example -- a particularly heinous and public one -- of what I've been talking about,\" Wray said.\n\nThe hearing had been scheduled well before the shooting, as part of the committee's routine oversight of the FBI and the Justice Department. Questions about the shooting dominated the session.\n\nDespite being appointed by Trump, Wray typically faces antagonistic questions from the Republican-led panel, a reflection of lingering discontent over the FBI's investigation into potential ties between Russia and the 2016 campaign, when Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThat sentiment was made clear early in the hearing when the committee chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told Wray: \"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation.\"\n\nThe FBI so far has avoided the same level of scrutiny over the shooting directed at the Secret Service over security failures that preceded the shooting and has led to the the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle,\n\nThe FBI has said it is investigating the shooting, which killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism and an attempted assassination. Trump's campaign said the presumptive GOP nominee was doing \"fine\" after the shooting, which Trump said pierced the upper part of his right ear.\n\nCopy the Story Link Related Headlines Three days after attempted assassination, Trump shooter remains an enigma Secret Service director steps down after Trump assassination attempt\n\nComments are not available on this story.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nfiled under: Donald Trump, FBI Related Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri": "pressherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Portland Press Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Crooks fired eight shots from an AR-style rifle before being he was killed.\n\nThe FBI thinks Crooks may have managed to avoid detection despite being armed because his weapon had a collapsible folding stock, Wray said.\n\nWray pledged to lawmakers that the FBI would \"leave no stone unturned\" in its investigation.\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment, and tragically the Butler County assassination attempt is another example -- a particularly heinous and public one -- of what I've been talking about,\" Wray said.\n\nThe hearing had been scheduled well before the shooting -- as part of the committee's routine oversight of the FBI and the Justice Department.

Kennedy from a sniper's perch in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.\n\n\"That is a search that is significant in terms of his state of mind. That is the same day that it appears he registered\" for the Trump rally scheduled for July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania, Wray told the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the shooting, which killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism. Crooks was killed by a Secret Service countersniper. The investigation has thrust the bureau into a political maelstrom months before the presidential election, with lawmakers and the public pressing for details about what may have motivated Crooks in the most serious attempt to assassinate a president or presidential candidate since President Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981.\n\nThe agency has built out a detailed timeline of Crooks' movements and online activity, but the precise motive -- or why Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, was singled out -- remains elusive, Wray said.\n\n\"A lot of the usual repositories of information have not yielded, anything notable in terms of motive or ideology,\" Wray said.\n\nThe FBI's assessment is that Crooks acted alone.\n\nWray noted that Crooks had grown interested in public officials -- besides Trump, Crooks also had photos on his phone of Democratic President Joe Biden and other prominent figures -- and in the days before the shooting had appeared particularly consumed by Trump.\n\nCrooks is believed to have visited the rally site a week before the event, staying for about 20 minutes, and then returned on the morning of July 13. About two hours before the shooting, Wray said, Crooks flew a drone about 200 yards from the rally for about 11 minutes, using the device to livestream and watch footage and obtain what Wray said would have been a \"rear view mirror\" of the scene behind him.\n\nThe use of the drone, which along with a controller were recovered from Crooks' car, so close to the rally site just hours before Trump took the stage add to the questions about the security lapses.\n\nOn the afternoon of the rally, Crooks attracted law enforcement scrutiny because of odd behavior around the edges of the event, including shouldering a backpack and peering into the lens of a range finder toward the rooftops behind the stage where Trump would stand within the hour.\n\nUsing what Wray said was mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping, Crooks was able to hoist himself up onto the roof of a squat manufacturing building that was within 135 meters (157 yards) of the stage. Crooks fired eight shots from an AR-style rifle before being he was killed.\n\nThe FBI thinks Crooks may have managed to avoid detection despite being armed because his weapon had a collapsible folding stock, Wray said.\n\nWray pledged to lawmakers that the FBI would \"leave no stone unturned\" in its investigation.\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment, and tragically the Butler County assassination attempt is another example -- a particularly heinous and public one -- of what I've been talking about,\" Wray said.\n\nThe hearing had been scheduled well before the shooting -- as part of the committee's routine oversight of the FBI and the Justice Department. Questions about the shooting dominated the session.\n\nThe FBI so far has avoided the same level of scrutiny over the shooting directed at the Secret Service over security failures that preceded the shooting and has led to the the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle.\n\nEven so, Wray was not able to entirely avoid the antagonistic questions he typically receives from the Republican-led committee, a reflection of the lingering perception that the FBI and Justice Department have become politicized against Trump -- something Wray has consistently denied.\n\nThat sentiment was made clear early in the hearing when the committee chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told Wray: \"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation.\"\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

Kennedy from a sniper\u2019s perch in Dallas on November 22, 1963.\n\n\u201cThat is a search that is significant in terms of his state of mind. That is the same day that it appears he registered\u201d for the Trump rally scheduled for July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania, Wray told the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the shooting, which killed one rally-goer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism. Crooks was killed by a Secret Service countersniper.\n\nThe investigation has thrust the bureau into a political maelstrom months before the presidential election, with lawmakers and the public pressing for details about what may have motivated Crooks in the most serious attempt to assassinate a US president or presidential candidate since President Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981.\n\nThe agency has built out a detailed timeline of Crooks\u2019 movements and online activity, but the precise motive \u2013 or why Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, was singled out \u2013 remains elusive, Wray said.\n\n\u201cA lot of the usual repositories of information have not yielded, anything notable in terms of motive or ideology,\u201d Wray said.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s assessment is that Crooks acted alone.\n\nWray noted that Crooks had grown interested in public officials \u2013 besides Trump, Crooks also had photos on his phone of Democratic US President Joe Biden and other prominent figures \u2013 and in the days before the shooting had appeared particularly consumed by Trump.\n\nCrooks is believed to have visited the rally site a week before the event, staying for about 20 minutes, and then returned on the morning of July 13.\n\nAbout two hours before the shooting, Wray said, Crooks flew a drone about 180 metres (200 yards) from the rally for about 11 minutes, using the device to live-stream and watch footage and obtain what Wray said would have been a \u201crear view mirror\u201d of the scene behind him.\n\nThe use of the drone, which along with a controller were recovered from Crooks\u2019 car, so close to the rally site just hours before Trump took the stage add to the questions about the security lapses.\n\nOn the afternoon of the rally, Crooks attracted law enforcement scrutiny because of odd behaviour around the edges of the event, including shouldering a backpack and peering into the lens of a rangefinder toward the rooftops behind the stage where Trump would stand within the hour.\n\nUsing what Wray said was mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping, Crooks was able to hoist himself up onto the roof of a squat manufacturing building that was within 135 metres (157 yards) of the stage. Crooks fired eight shots from an AR-style rifle before being he was killed.\n\nThe FBI thinks Crooks may have managed to avoid detection despite being armed because his weapon had a collapsible folding stock, Wray said.\n\nWray pledged to lawmakers that the FBI would \u201cleave no stone unturned\u201d in its investigation.\n\n\u201cI have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment, and tragically the Butler County assassination attempt is another example \u2013 a particularly heinous and public one \u2013 of what I\u2019ve been talking about,\u201d Wray said.\n\nThe hearing had been scheduled well before the shooting \u2013 as part of the committee\u2019s routine oversight of the FBI and the Justice Department. Questions about the shooting dominated the session.\n\nThe FBI so far has avoided the same level of scrutiny over the shooting directed at the Secret Service over security failures that preceded the shooting and has led to the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle.\n\nEven so, Wray was not able to entirely avoid the antagonistic questions he typically receives from the Republican-led committee, a reflection of the lingering perception that the FBI and Justice Department have become politicised against Trump \u2013 something Wray has consistently denied.\n\nThat sentiment was made clear early in the hearing when the committee chairman, Republican congressman Jim Jordan, told Wray: \u201cI\u2019m sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy scepticism regarding the FBI\u2019s ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation.\u201d", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

The FBI's investigation has thrust the bureau into a political maelstrom months before the presidential election, with lawmakers and the public pressing for details about what may have motivated Crooks in the most serious attempt to assassinate a president or presidential candidate since President Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981.\n\nThe FBI has built out a detailed timeline of Crooks' movements and online activity, but the precise motive -- or why Trump was singled out -- remains elusive, Wray said.\n\n\"A lot of the usual repositories of information have not yielded, anything notable in terms of motive or ideology,\" Wray said. He did note that Crooks had grown interested in public officials -- besides Trump, Crooks also had photos on his phone of Democratic President Joe Biden and other prominent figures -- and in the days before the shooting had appeared particularly consumed by Trump, the Republicans' White House nominee.\n\nWray also said that Crooks, about two hours before the shooting, had flown a drone about 200 yards (180 meters) from the rally stage where Trump would later stand and that Crooks used the device to livestream and watch footage.

Kennedy, the FBI director told U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray appeared on Capitol Hill to provide lawmakers testimony and reveal new details at a congressional hearing on the recent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump in western Pennsylvania.\n\n\"The attempted assassination of the former president was an attack on our democracy and our democratic process and we will not and do not tolerate political violence of any kind, especially a despicable account of this magnitude,\" Wray said in his opening remarks.\n\nTrump was shot at by Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, at least eight times with an AR15-style semi-automatic rifle, Wray confirmed at Wednesday's House Judiciary Committee hearing. He also told the panel it was a weapon with a collapsible stock, which he added \"could explain why it might've been less easy for people to observe.\"\n\nWray's comments come the day after Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned from her post amid bipartisan calls to do so after a Monday congressional hearing left many lawmakers unsatisfied with her answers about the security failure.\n\nOn Tuesday, Cheatle stepped down the same day a bipartisan House Task Force was announced to seek answers regarding the attempted assassination of the now-Republican presidential nominee. Several investigations are underway by Congress, law enforcement and federal agencies into Trump's attempted July 13 assassination at a campaign event in Butler, Penn., by 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks.\n\nCrooks was identified as \"suspicious\" earlier the day of the shooting when he was on the property and although he never attempted to get into the secured perimeter of the rally. Eventually, he was spotted with a rangefinder, according to a state police official in Pennsylvania.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pennsylvania State Police Col. Christopher Paris told the House Homeland Security Committee that Butler County Emergency Services Unit officers had spotted Crooks from a second-story window, leaving their post to search for the shooter.\n\nMeanwhile, the FBI director said Wednesday that Crooks became \"very focused\" on Trump and the Butler rally sometime around July 6.\n\nIt was revealed by Wray the would-be presidential assassin on July 6 conducted a Google search for \"how far away was Oswald from Kennedy,\" alluding to the 1963 assassination of former President John F. Kennedy in Dallas by Lee Harvey Oswald, the same day Crooks registered for Trump's Butler rally.\n\n\"That's a search that obviously is significant in terms of his state of mind,\" Wray remarked.\n\nHowever, the FBI is still in the \"legal process\" of getting access to Crooks' other digital accounts but so far why he shot at Trump is still not clear. The shooter, Wray says, appeared to have performed Internet searches of public figures \"in general.\"\n\n\"We do not yet have a clear picture of his motive,\" Wray told lawmakers, adding that Crooks has so far left no trace of a \"manifesto\" or other documents outlining his reasoning like multiple shooters typically have.\n\nAnd the bureau has not found any accomplices \"at this time,\" he said, noting the investigation is ongoing.\n\n\"We're going to leave no stone unturned,\" said Wray. \"The shooter may be deceased but the FBI's investigation is very much ongoing.\"\n\nWray says the description of Crooks as a loner \"fit[s] with what we're seeing\" on his devices. He lived with his parents in Bethel Park, Penn., and the family has cooperated with the investigation.\n\n\"There doesn't appear to be a whole lot of interactions between him, face-to-face or digital, with a lot of people,\" the director said, adding that \"that doesn't mean there's not any.\"\n\nAccording to Wary, the FBI recovered 8 cartridges from roof where a Secret Service sniper killed Crooks. He said 14 guns were found in the Crooks home, which Wray stated had been bought legally through the father.\n\nWray told Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., that the FBI \"did not have any information about the shooter\" and that Crooks \"was not in our holdings before the shooting.\"\n\nA drone and remote controller were found in his car, along with explosives also being discovered at the family home. One of the three explosives was found at his home; the other two in the car.\n\nCrooks had a transmitter on him, according to Wray, adding it appears the remote detonation \"would not have worked.\" He was flying the drone in the area roughy 200 yards from the stage where Trump was standing at about 4 p.m. EDT the day of the July 13 shooting.\n\nThe FBI is in the middle of analyzing the drone. Wray said \"we think\" the drone was producing a live-stream footage for a total of 11 minutes.\n\n\"At a moment, it looks like because of the on/off position on the receivers, that if he had tried to detonate those devices from the roof, it would not have worked, but that doesn't mean the explosives weren't dangerous,\" Wray said.", "source": {"uri": "gephardtdaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gephardt Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "united_press_international@gephardtdaily.com", "name": "United Press International", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_congressional_hearing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States congressional hearing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John F.

The display frustrated lawmakers and forced her to resign on Tuesday.\n\nHere are five takeaways from Wray's testimony:\n\nShooter's laptop revealed searches on JFK assassination\n\nAmong the most startling new facts, an analysis of the shooter's laptop found that a week before the rally he had conducted a Google search for \"how far away was Oswald from Kennedy,\" a reference to Lee Harvey Oswald, who shot and killed former President Kennedy in 1963, according to Wray.\n\nThat same day, July 6, Crooks registered for Trump's speaking event.\n\n\"We've, just in the last couple days, found that ... [the] laptop that the investigation ties to the shooter reveals that on July 6 he did a Google search 'how far away was Oswald from Kennedy?'\" Wray said.\n\nHe said the search is \"significant\" in terms of the shooter's state of mind.\n\nWray also revealed that the FBI was able to get into Crooks' phone, which he called a \"significant technical challenge.\" Once cracked, they found Crooks had been using encrypted messaging applications.\n\nWray also said Crooks had one phone but the FBI has identified others he may have used, including his father's, though not necessarily related to the attack.\n\nIn addition, he noted Crooks was a \"gamer\" with accounts on different gaming platforms, but no information has yet been found on those.\n\n\"We're trying to make sure we process and exploit every device he could have used,\" Wray said, earlier indicating that the bureau is involved in a \"legal process\" to gain access to Crooks' other accounts.\n\n\"We keep identifying new pieces of equipment, new accounts, what have you.\"\n\nBased on what the FBI has observed on his laptop and phone, the bureau has found no evidence that Crooks had accomplices or co-conspirators, foreign or domestic, with those interviewed describing the shooter as a \"loner,\" according to Wray.\n\n\"There doesn't appear to be a whole lot of interactions between him, face-to-face or digital, with a lot of people,\" Wray said before adding, \"that doesn't mean there's not any.\"\n\nThe FBI still does \"not yet have a clear picture of his motive.\"\n\nShooter had 'collapsible stock' on gun purchased from his father\n\nWray told lawmakers that Crooks' AR-style rifle had a collapsible stock, which \"could explain why it might've been less easy for people to observe.\"\n\nThe FBI has yet to find any witnesses who saw or video that displays Crooks walking around the fairground area with a gun, with observers only spotting him with a firearm when he was already on the roof he shot from, according to Wray.\n\nThe collapsible stock is \"potentially a very significant feature that might be relevant to that,\" he said.\n\nAnd earlier in the day on July 13, Crooks purchased 50 rounds of ammunition for his firearm which had been legally bought by his father in 2013. Using \"documentation,\" investigators confirmed Crooks later legally purchased the rifle from his father in October 2023.\n\nWray confirmed previous knowledge that Crooks fired approximately eight times at Trump before being killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nWray also confirmed that Crooks bought a roughly 5-foot ladder before the shooting but it was not found at the scene.\n\nAgents instead believe Crooks got on the roof from the back of the building \"using some mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping on the side\" of the building, Wray said. \"In other words, we do not believe he used a ladder to get up there.\"\n\nShooter flew drone over area two hours ahead of rally\n\nWray offered new information that the shooter flew a drone over the Butler fairgrounds about two hours before Trump spoke at the rally location.\n\nThe FBI director said Crooks flew the drone around the area, roughly 200 yards away from the stage, around 3:50 p.m. to 4 p.m. Trump took the stage around two hours later at 6 p.m.\n\n\"We think -- but we do not know, so again, this is one of these things that is qualified because of our ongoing review -- that he was live-streaming, viewing the footage [for] about 11 minutes,\" Wray said.\n\nThe drone was in Crooks' vehicle at the time of the shooting. The device is now \"being exploited and analyzed by the FBI lab,\" which has reverse-engineered its flight path on the day of the rally.\n\n\"It would have shown the shooter, we think - again, we're still doing more work on this . . . we think it would have shown him, kind of, what would have been behind him when he was shooting,\" giving Crooks a \"rearview mirror of the scene,\" Wray explained.\n\nThree 'crude' explosive devices found\n\nThe FBI also recovered three \"relatively crude\" explosive devices, two in Crooks' car and one other at his home.\n\nCrooks was found with a transmitter that would have allowed him to detonate the bombs in his car remotely, but initial findings suggest if he had tried to he would not have been successful.\n\n\"At a moment, it looks like because of the on-off position on the receivers, that if he had tried to detonate those devices from the roof, it would not have worked,\" Wray said before adding, \"that doesn't mean the explosives weren't dangerous.\"\n\nWray later said the discovered explosives were compelling as it's unclear if Crooks had been planning further mayhem during or after the rally.\n\n\"What else he may have had in mind is something that I think is very much of an open question,\" he said.\n\nIn addition, investigators \"located a number of firearms associated with the shooter and his family,\" a total of 14 in the house, Wray said.\n\nOfficers first spotted gunman with rifle 'only seconds' before shooting\n\nWray attempted to clarify the timeline as to what took place from the time Crooks was identified on the roof and when he shot at Trump.\n\nA member of the public first spotted Crooks on the roof a \"handful of minutes\" before he opened fire at 6:11 p.m. Though it's unclear whether this individual saw Crooks had a gun, they \"saw him in a way that was concerning,\" Wray said.\n\nHe added that local law enforcement first viewed Crooks with the rifle \"literally just seconds\" before the shooting.\n\nThe local police officer, after being hoisted up by another, was able to view the roof, where he saw Crooks in a \"prone shooting position.\" The gunman then turned and pointed his gun at the officer, Wray confirmed.\n\n\"This is all seconds before the shooter took his shots,\" he said.\n\nWray also said local police observed the shooter with a rangefinder \"in a way that was odd and suspicious\" about an hour before the shooting.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ellen_mitchell@thehill.com", "name": "Ellen Mitchell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Agents are investigating the 20-year-old gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, and what was the most serious attempt to assassinate a president or presidential candidate since President Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981.\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment and tragically the Butler County assassination attempt is another example - a particularly heinous and public one - of what I've been talking about,\" Wray said.\n\nThe hearing had been scheduled well before the shooting, as part of the committee's regular oversight of the FBI and Justice Department.\n\nDespite being appointed by Trump, Wray typically faces antagonistic questions from the Republican-led committee, a reflection of lingering discontent over the FBI's investigation into potential ties between Russia and the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe FBI so far has avoided the same level of scrutiny directed at the Secret Service over security lapses that preceded the shooting.

Eventually, he was spotted with a rangefinder, according to a state police official in Pennsylvania.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pennsylvania State Police Col. Christopher Paris told the House Homeland Security Committee that Butler County Emergency Services Unit officers had spotted Crooks from a second-story window, leaving their post to search for the shooter.\n\nMeanwhile, the FBI director said Wednesday that Crooks became \"very focused\" on Trump and the Butler rally sometime around July 6.\n\nIt was revealed by Wray the would-be presidential assassin on July 6 conducted a Google search for \"how far away was Oswald from Kennedy,\" alluding to the 1963 assassination of former President John F. Kennedy in Dallas by Lee Harvey Oswald, the same day Crooks registered for Trump's Butler rally.\n\n\"That's a search that obviously is significant in terms of his state of mind,\" Wray remarked.\n\nHowever, the FBI is still in the \"legal process\" of getting access to Crooks' other digital accounts but so far why he shot at Trump is still not clear. The shooter, Wray says, appeared to have performed Internet searches of public figures \"in general.\"\n\n\"We do not yet have a clear picture of his motive,\" Wray told lawmakers, adding that Crooks has so far left no trace of a \"manifesto\" or other documents outlining his reasoning like multiple shooters typically have.\n\nAnd the bureau has not found any accomplices \"at this time,\" he said, noting the investigation is ongoing.\n\n\"We're going to leave no stone unturned,\" said Wray. \"The shooter may be deceased but the FBI's investigation is very much ongoing.\"\n\nWray says the description of Crooks as a loner \"fit[s] with what we're seeing\" on his devices. He lived with his parents in Bethel Park, Penn., and the family has cooperated with the investigation.\n\n\"There doesn't appear to be a whole lot of interactions between him, face-to-face or digital, with a lot of people,\" the director said, adding that \"that doesn't mean there's not any.\"\n\nAccording to Wary, the FBI recovered 8 cartridges from roof where a Secret Service sniper killed Crooks. He said 14 guns were found in the Crooks home, which Wray stated had been bought legally through the father.\n\nWray told Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., that the FBI \"did not have any information about the shooter\" and that Crooks \"was not in our holdings before the shooting.\"\n\nA drone and remote controller were found in his car, along with explosives also being discovered at the family home. One of the three explosives was found at his home; the other two in the car.\n\nCrooks had a transmitter on him, according to Wray, adding it appears the remote detonation \"would not have worked.\" He was flying the drone in the area roughy 200 yards from the stage where Trump was standing at about 4 p.m. EDT the day of the July 13 shooting.\n\nThe FBI is in the middle of analyzing the drone. Wray said \"we think\" the drone was producing a live-stream footage for a total of 11 minutes.\n\n\"At a moment, it looks like because of the on/off position on the receivers, that if he had tried to detonate those devices from the roof, it would not have worked, but that doesn't mean the explosives weren't dangerous,\" Wray said.", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_benson@myrtlebeachonline.com", "name": "Chris Benson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_congressional_hearing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States congressional hearing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Experts call that 'ridiculous' ROBERT YOON Associated Press\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment, and tragically the Butler County assassination attempt is another example -- a particularly heinous and public one -- of what I've been talking about,\" Wray said.\n\nThe hearing had been scheduled well before the July 13 shooting as part of the committee's routine oversight of the FBI and the Justice Department, and though lawmakers may touch on a broad array of topics, questions about the shooting are expected to dominate the session.\n\nDespite being appointed by Trump, Wray typically faces antagonistic questions from the Republican-led panel, a reflection of lingering discontent over the FBI's investigation into potential ties between Russia and the 2016 campaign.\n\nThat sentiment was made clear early in the hearing when the panel's Republican chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, told Wray: \"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation.\"\n\nThough the FBI has avoided the same level of scrutiny over the shooting directed at the Secret Service over security failures that preceded the shooting, culminating Tuesday in the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle, Wray is likely to be questioned by lawmakers skeptical of the bureau's assessment that Crooks left behind no obvious ideological motive that could explain his actions.\n\nThe FBI has said it is investigating the shooting, which killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism and an attempted assassination. Trump's campaign said the presumptive GOP nominee was doing \"fine\" after the shooting, which Trump said pierced the upper part of his right ear.\n\nWray and other senior officials privately briefed members of Congress last week, telling them that Crooks had photos on his phone of Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden and other officials and had looked up the dates for the Democratic National Convention as well as Trump's appearances.\n\nA law enforcement official told The Associated Press last week that Crooks had also flown a drone above the rally site before the event in an apparent effort to scope out the scene in advance.\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "wcfcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wcfcourier.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "manuel_balce_ceneta@wcfcourier.com", "name": "Manuel Balce Ceneta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Jim Jordan of Ohio, told Wray: \"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation.\"\n\nThough the FBI has avoided the same level of scrutiny over the shooting directed at the Secret Service over security failures that preceded the shooting, culminating Tuesday in the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle, Wray is likely to be questioned by lawmakers skeptical of the bureau's assessment that Crooks left behind no obvious ideological motive that could explain his actions.\n\nThe FBI has said it is investigating the shooting, which killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism and an attempted assassination.

Kennedy from a sniper's perch in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.\n\n\"That's a search obviously that is significant in terms of his state of mind. That is the same day that it appears that he registered\" for the Trump rally scheduled for July 13 in Butler, Pa., Wray told the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the shooting, which killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism. Crooks was killed by a Secret Service countersniper. The investigation has thrust the bureau into a political maelstrom months before the presidential election, with lawmakers and the public pressing for details about what may have motivated Crooks in the most serious attempt to assassinate a president or presidential candidate since President Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981.\n\nThe agency has built out a detailed timeline of Crooks' movements and online activity, but the precise motive -- or why Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, was singled out -- remains elusive, Wray said.\n\n\"In terms of what we've been able to find so far, a lot of the usual repositories of information have not yielded anything notable in terms of motive or ideology,\" Wray said.\n\nThe FBI's assessment continues to be that Crooks acted alone, though agents are still investigating.\n\nWray noted that Crooks had grown interested in public officials -- besides Trump, Crooks also had photos on his phone of Democratic President Joe Biden and other prominent figures -- and in the days before the shooting had appeared particularly consumed by Trump and the Butler rally.\n\nCrooks is believed to have visited the rally site a week before the event, staying for about 20 minutes, and then returned on the morning of July 13. More than two hours before the shooting, Wray said, Crooks flew a drone about 200 yards from the rally stage for about 11 minutes, using the device to livestream and watch footage and obtain what Wray said would have been a \"rearview mirror\" of the scene behind him.\n\nThe use of the drone, which along with a controller were recovered from Crooks' car, so close to the rally site just hours before Trump took the stage add to the questions about the security lapses that preceded the shooting.\n\nOn the afternoon of the rally, Crooks attracted law enforcement scrutiny because of odd behavior around the edges of the event, including shouldering a backpack and peering into the lens of a range finder toward the rooftops behind the stage where Trump would stand within the hour.\n\nUsing what Wray said was mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping, Crooks was able to hoist himself up onto the roof of a squat manufacturing building that was within 157 yards of the stage. Crooks fired eight shots from an AR-style rifle before he was killed. (The Warren Commission report that analyzed the Kennedy assassination assessed that Kennedy had been shot through the neck at a range of 174.9 feet to 190.8 feet.\n\nThe FBI thinks Crooks may have managed to avoid detection in the crowd despite being armed because his weapon had a collapsible folding stock, Wray said.\n\nWray pledged to lawmakers that the FBI would \"leave no stone unturned\" in its investigation.", "source": {"uri": "news-gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News-Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Trump's campaign said the presumptive GOP nominee was doing \"fine\" after the shooting, which Trump said pierced the upper part of his right ear.\n\nWray and other senior officials privately briefed members of Congress last week, telling them that Crooks had photos on his phone of Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden and other officials and had looked up the dates for the Democratic National Convention as well as Trump's appearances.\n\nA law enforcement official told The Associated Press last week that Crooks had also flown a drone above the rally site before the event in an apparent effort to scope out the scene in advance.\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally 0 Comments Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "buffalonews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Buffalo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@buffalonews.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Wray has to resign, and NOW, for LYING TO CONGRESS!'\n\nTrump hired Wray to head the FBI in 2017.\n\nAt a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., veered off-topic to ask about Bide's decline.\n\nDonald Trump demanded FBI Director Christopher Wray be fired for refusing to say he saw cognitive decline in President Biden before he dropped out of the running for 2024\n\n'When did you notice his decline?' Gaetz said.\n\n'In my interactions, in my role, all my interactions with the current president have been completely professional,' Wray replied.\n\n'Right, but I mean the cognitive decline,' the lawmaker pressed.\n\n'Again, I don't meet with him very often, but what you're describing is not something that I've observed during my interactions with him,' Wray explained.\n\nWray described his interactions with Biden as 'uneventful and unremarkable.'\n\n'It never occurred to you that this guy wasn't up to it in all these briefings you did?' Gaetz pushed again.\n\n'As I said, my briefings with the president have all been completely fine,' Wray insisted.\n\n'Were they between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.?' Gaetz wanted to know. 'We hear those are his good hours.'\n\n'Times that I have briefed, I've included outside those hours,' the FBI director observed.\n\nBiden stepped down from the 2024 race on Sunday after steep pressure from Democrats who had woken up to concerns about his advanced age and cognitive decline after the debate with Trump.\n\nTrump's would-be assassin Thomas Crooks searched online 'how far' Lee Harvey Oswald was from John F. Kennedy when he shot him, the FBI director also revealed in stunning testimony to Congress.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray also told lawmakers the 20-year-old gunman flew a drone 200 yards from the stage just two hours before he opened fire in Butler, Pennsylvania, and had three explosives in his car.\n\nThe bombshell revelations from the bureau's chief give more insight into Crooks' preparation before he shot the former president, including his online research on the sniper that took out JFK in 1963.\n\nWray said Crooks had been 'interested in public figures' and 'somewhere around July 6 or so he became very focused on former President Trump and his rally.'\n\nThe director said an analysis of Crooks' laptop revealed he had searched on Google on July 6 'how far away was Oswald from Kennedy.' It was the same day he registered to attend the Butler rally.\n\nLee Harvey Oswald shot and killed former President John F. Kennedy in 1963.\n\nCrooks was flying a drone above the rally site two hours before the shooting and just 200 yards away from the stage, Wray has also revealed.\n\nWray made the bombshell revelation to Congress on Wednesday during a grilling by lawmakers on the investigation into the assassination attempt on the former president and the massive security failures.\n\nIn this handout, American Marxist and former US Marine Lee Harvey Oswald (1939 - 1963) in a mug shot after he was arrested for assassinating President John F Kennedy in Dallas, 23rd November 1963\n\nCrooks shot Trump in the ear just 400 feet away from the stage in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13 from the roof of a nearby building just outside the security perimeter of the event.\n\nWray revealed that investigators found Crooks had a drone that he used to survey the scene hours before the event started, which was recovered from his car parked nearby.\n\nHe flew the drone around 4 p.m. over the area of the rally close to '200 yards' from the stage to survey the scene. Trump took the stage around 6:03 p.m., over two hours later.\n\nThe FBI has also recovered three 'explosive devices' in possession of Crooks.\n\nThey were 'relatively crude devices' but had the ability 'to be detonated remotely,' Wray said.\n\nThe FBI director also revealed the weapon used had a 'collapsible stock,' which he said 'could explain why it might've been less easy for people to observe.'\n\nWray could not say whether Crooks carried the gun up to the roof with him before he fired the shots or had stashed it there prior. He said the gunman did not use a ladder to get onto the roof but rather some sort of 'vertical piping.'\n\nHe said Crooks and his family owned a combined 14 guns and Crooks had visited a shooting range one day before the rally. Crooks used an AR-style weapon that had been purchased legally by his father and sold to him in October 2023.\n\nDramatic new footage shows law enforcement standing over the dead body of Donald Trump 's attempted assassin moments after he was shot dead\n\nWray also confirmed the FBI had recovered three 'explosive devices' in possession of Crooks\n\nWray said eight bullet cartridges had been recovered from the roof where Crooks fired off his shots toward the former president.\n\nAnd he wouldn't rule out that Crooks did not have any accomplices to the crime, saying it's still being looked at by law enforcement.\n\nAs Wray faced questions about why the president was allowed on stage despite the 'threat' being identified 20 minutes before the shots were fired, Wray said, 'we don't know the answer to that.'\n\nHe said that no one in law enforcement saw Crooks with lying down in a shooting position with a gun in hand until 'moments before' he fired, but had seen him on the roof 'minutes before.'\n\nRead More Wray to face grilling on Trump shooting after hearing that led Secret Service director to resign\n\nBut he insisted his investigation was not focused on the security breach and the Secret Service failures.\n\n'Our investigation is focused on the shooter and all things related to his attack.'\n\nWray was peppered with veiled references to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) measures that some Republicans have taken to blaming the security breach on.\n\nWray insisted the physical fitness standards for getting in to the FBI 'actually exceed' what they've been in years past and insisted his agency does not factor in DEI when making hiring decisions.\n\nHis hearing comes days after the former Director of Secret Service Kimberly Cheatle was forced to resign after evading answering rounds of questioning by punting to the FBI in another congressional hearing earlier this week.\n\nWray promised his agency would leave 'no stone unturned' and emphasized that he wanted to provide all the information he had at this point of the ongoing investigation.\n\n'The shooter may be deceased but the FBI's investigation is very much ongoing.'\n\nHe also made a reference to the warnings he has been giving Congress for years now about the threats of domestic terrorism.\n\nThe shooting is 'another example, particularly heinous and very public one of what I have been talking about.'\n\nWray again warned about 'passion and heated rhetoric turning into actual violence.'\n\n'We've seen it against public officials of all sorts, we've seen it against law enforcements the number of officers shot and killed in the line of duty is alarming.'\n\n'It's almost every five days that a law enforcement officer is killed in the line of duty, that is an example of the kinds of ways passion and heated rhetoric can bubble over into violence.'\n\nThe Judiciary Committee hearing focused on both the shooting at the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally and the 'ongoing politicization' of the FBI.\n\nQuestioning on a separate foiled Iranian plot to assassinate Donald Trump was also a subject of contention.\n\nA bombshell report last week revealed the U.S. received intelligence of an Iranian assassination plot in the weeks before Trump was shot at the Pennsylvania rally.\n\nMeanwhile, House Republicans are expected to set up a bipartisan task force to investigate the shooting in a vote this week.\n\nMembers of Congress are expected to demand answers from FBI Director Chris Wray about the Trump assassination attempt on Wednesday\n\nThe FBI and Secret Service revealed to lawmakers last week they spotted shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks as a person of interest a full 62 minutes before he fired a shot.\n\nTwenty minutes passed between the time Secret Service agents spotted Crooks with a gun on the rooftop and he fired shots at the president.\n\nIn a staggering moment, Cheatle admitted on Monday her agents on the ground were warned between two and five times that there was a 'suspicious person' reported before Trump took the stage.\n\nWhile Trump walked around with little more than a bloody ear, Crooks killed former fire chief Corey Comperatore, 50, and critically injured two other rally goers sitting close to where the former president was speaking last weekend before he was neutralized.\n\nThe security chief had faced mounting questions over why an agent was not stationed on the roof from where gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire on the former president, and why Trump was allowed to take the stage even when a threat was detected.\n\nShe had also been ridiculed for suggesting her agency did not have a presence on the roof because it was 'sloped.'\n\nThe 20-year-old shooter Crooks, was able to get within 160 yards of the stage where the former president was speaking when he opened fire. The building on which he stood was outside the security perimeter, despite clearly being within rifle shooting range.\n\nAnd that was despite the FBI learning of a threat on Trump's life from Iran leading to a bump in security for the former president in the days before the July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nCheatle said she believed she was the 'best person' to lead the Secret Service at this time, but later acquiesced to the bipartisan demands for her resignation.\n\nOn the day of the rally, Trump walked out onto the stage at 6:02 p.m.\n\nThen at around 6:12 p.m. Crooks' first shots rang out.\n\nCheatle could not tell lawmakers how the shooter had gotten onto the roof.\n\nAt the time of the shooting, law enforcement agents were inside the building, 147 yards away from where Trump stood, but not on top of it.\n\n'That building in particular has a sloped roof at its highest point. And so, you know, there's a safety factor that would be considered there that we wouldn't want to put somebody up on a sloped roof,' she told ABC News in an interview Tuesday.\n\nComer said on Fox News Sunday the hearing would go on for six hours and Cheatle would face 'hundreds of questions'\n\n'And so, you know, the decision was made to secure the building, from inside.'\n\nWhat transpired instead was a security nightmare: Thomas Matthew Crooks was able to scale the building and secure his own position, while law enforcement struggled to locate him even amid pressing warnings from members of the Trump crowd. But there wasn't sufficient time to act on the tips, she explained.\n\n'The shooter was actually identified as a potential person of suspicion,' Cheatle said. 'Unfortunately, with the rapid succession of how things unfolded, by the time that individual was eventually located, they were on the rooftop and were able to fire off at the former president.'\n\nShe was referencing claims by witnesses that they alerted law enforcement about the threat, but agents weren't able to eliminate the threat in time. Officials have pointed to the initial responding officer, who lifted himself up on the roof only to lower himself back when the gunman turned his weapon at him.\n\nRead More Secret Service Director branded a 'DEI horror show' by Republican as she responds grilling about the agents in Trump's protective detail when he was shot\n\nCheatle has taken blame for the fateful security breach, but has denied calls to step down.\n\n'The buck stops with me,' she said.\n\n'It was unacceptable,' she told ABC. 'And it's something that shouldn't happen again.'\n\n'While we give overwhelming thanks to the individual Secret Service agents who did their jobs under immense pressure, this tragedy was preventable. The Secret Service has a zero fail mission, but it failed on July 13 and in the days leading up to the rally,' Comer is also expected to say, as he will again call for Cheatle's resignation.\n\nAlso coming into question on the call was the possible motive for Crooks to commit such an atrocity.\n\nOfficials did not confirm an operating motive and said that his rationale remains a mystery.\n\nAuthorities said that they have yet to find any ideological material that could shine light on why Crooks decided to shoot the former president.\n\nBut, they did reveal that Crooks operated several accounts on encrypted platforms that they are still working to gain access to.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Gaetz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Gaetz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Kennedy shooting from his laptop and flew a drone in the area near the rally just two hours before the former president took the stage, FBI Director Christopher Wray said Wednesday.\n\nThe stunning revelations are the latest details about the investigation to come to light this week in congressional hearings about the Trump rally on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nAt the wide-ranging House Judiciary Committee hearing, Wray also shared that investigators believe that Thomas Matthew Crooks use a gun with a collapsable stock and that he accessed the roof of the building by climbing, not with a ladder.\n\nThe hearing included a large share of politics, as Republicans repeatedly mentioned Vice President Kamala Harris as they sought to tie the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee to border policy and other actions, and Democrats asked Wray repeatedly about Project 2025.\n\nHere are the key takeaways from Wednesday's hearing:\n\nAccording to the FBI's analysis of Crooks' laptop, Crooks searched how far Lee Harvey Oswald was when he shot and killed Kennedy in 1963.\n\nThe search was on July 6, the same day he registered to attend the rally.\n\n\"On July 6, he did a Google search for: 'how far away was Oswald from Kennedy,'\" Wray told the House Judiciary Committee.\n\n\"That's a search that's obviously significant in terms of his state of mind,\" the FBI director added. \"That is the same day that it appears that he registered for the Butler rally.\"\n\nWray revealed that \"around 4 p.m.,\" Crooks \"was flying the drone around the area\" of the rally, approximately 200 yards from the stage.\n\nThe drone was in the air for approximately 11 minutes, and investigators believe Crooks watched a live feed from the drone on his phone. CNN previously reported that the drone was found in his car following the shooting.\n\nIn addition, Crooks had two explosives in his car at the time of the shooting and one in his home, but likely did not have the ability to detonate them from the roof where he was killed, Wray testified.\n\n\"It looks like because of the on/off position on the receivers, that if he had tried to detonate those devices from the roof, it would not have worked,\" Wray said.\n\nWray said that investigators have been able to \"reverse-engineer the flight path of the drone from the day of the rally,\" and now think that the drone footage \"would have shown [the shooter] what would have been behind him.\"\n\n\"It was almost like giving him a rear-view mirror of the scene behind him,\" Wray said.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the shooting as both an attempted assassination and as a potential act of domestic terrorism. FBI officials have repeatedly asserted that they believe Crooks acted alone, and Wray reiterated that there is no evidence of any co-conspirators.\n\nInvestigators say that Crooks fired approximately eight times from an AR-style rifle at the former president before being killed by a US Secret Service counter sniper.\n\nThe rifle Crooks used was purchased from his father, Wray testified.\n\n\"The weapon that he used for the attempted assassination was an AR-style rifle that was purchased legally, that he - as my understanding - acquired, I think bought actually from his father, who was the one who originally bought it,\" Wray said.\n\nPreviously, officials said they believed the firearm belonged to Crooks' father - not the shooter - and they didn't know how Crooks accessed the weapon.\n\n\"I have been saying some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment,\" Wray said. \"The shooter may be deceased but the FBI's investigation is ongoing.\"\n\nInvestigators have gone through the shooter's phone and computer, scoured his search history and bedroom and have interviewed his family and friends, but have struggled to identify what motivated the 20-year-old would be assassin to act.\n\nCrooks also had no prior contacts with the FBI, officials say, and had not been previously on their radar or databases.\n\nThe FBI thinks Crooks used equipment and piping attached to the building to climb up onto the roof where he shot at Trump.\n\n\"We now believe the subject climbed onto the roof using some mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping on the side of the AGR building,\" Wray said. \"In other words, we do not believe he used a ladder to get up there.\"\n\nThe FBI, according to Wray, confirmed that Crooks had previously purchased a roughly five-foot ladder.\n\nPennsylvania State Police Commissioner Christopher Paris testified Tuesday that Crooks was on the roof for roughly three minutes before he fired at Trump.\n\nAs Wray testified, GOP members pushed the FBI director to discuss any meetings he has had with Harris during her tenure as vice president, a notable line of questioning now that she is the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nThe questions ranged from whether Wray has regular briefings with Harris, what her behavior is like in those meetings and what sort of issues she has expressed concerns about.\n\nIn one exchange, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz asked how frequently Harris attends briefings that Wray has with President Joe Biden. Wray declined to answer with any specificity.\n\nWisconsin Rep. Tom Tiffany asked Wray whether Harris \"has met with you in regard to the border, or whether she has \"specifically asked you for a meeting\" about the \"threats that are at the border.\"\n\nWray said that he had \"been in meetings that include the vice president\" in which the border was discussed, but again declined to discuss specific meetings or conversations.\n\nIndiana Rep. Victoria Spartz also asked about Wray's meetings about the border with Harris, asking whether the vice president has \"actually initiated\" meetings on a regular basis \"as the leading border czar.\" Wray did not answer.\n\nWray pushed back against reports that Crooks searched for images of specific prominent public officials online, saying that it appears he was actually searching for news articles.\n\n\"The shooter appears to have done a lot of searches of public figures in general, but so far we are seeing kind of news articles and things like that,\" Wray said. He continued, \"so the images that have been reported about, really what we are talking about there are when you do a news search of an article the image appears in a cache as opposed to like a search for that specific individual.\"\n\nThe FBI director cautioned that the effort to uncover Crooks' motive is ongoing, but warned that \"it is, quite frankly, a dangerous time to be a prominent public official.\"\n\nWray said Wednesday that an FBI employee is being internally investigated for posting something \"totally inappropriate\" about the Trump assassination attempt.\n\nRepublican Rep. Chip Roy asked the director whether \"any FBI agents texted, emailed or expressed disappointment that Trump survived the assassination attempt or otherwise editorialized about the assassination attempt?\"\n\nWray said he wasn't aware of any agents acting inappropriately but that there had been one instance \"of an individual who posted something that I consider outrageous, totally inappropriate, and unacceptable.\"\n\n\"That individual has been referred to our inspection division, which is our sort of internal affairs investigatory arm that does the disciplinary process,\" Wray said.\n\nWray did not say where the post was made.\n\nWray said on Wednesday that the FBI informed the US Secret Service about an Iranian plot to assassinate former President Donald Trump, saying that it's likely law enforcement agencies are going to see more such \"brazenness\" from Iran in the future.\n\nThe director declined to provide details of \"specific, classified information,\" to the committee but stressed that his agency has been calling out \"efforts by the Iranian government to attempt to retaliate for the killing of (Iranian General) Soleimani by going after current or former prominent US officials.\"\n\n\"I think we need to recognize the brazenness of the Iranian regime, including right here in the United States, and I expect that we're going to see more of it and I expect there will be more coming on that,\" Wray said.\n\nCNN has previously reported that US authorities obtained intelligence from a human source in recent weeks on a plot by Iran to try to assassinate Trump, a development that led to the Secret Service increasing security around the former president, multiple people briefed on the matter told CNN. There's no indication that Thomas Matthew Crooks, the would-be assassin who attempted to kill the former president, was connected to the plot, the sources said.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Adam Schiff pressed Wray on the agency's hiring standards in an effort to criticize the Republican Party's decision to make Trump, a convicted felon, its 2024 presidential nominee.\n\n\"Do candidates for the FBI have to go through background checks?\" Schiff asked, to which Wray said yes.\n\n\"Would someone with dozens of felony convictions survive a background check for the bureau?\" Schiff said.\n\n\"Clearly, the bureau has higher standards for their hiring than one of America's great political parties,\" Schiff said.\n\nTrump was convicted earlier this year on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records as part of a hush money scheme he orchestrated ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nWray testified that he opposes the idea of having the head of the law enforcement agency report directly to the president, a proposal pushed by some Trump supporters.\n\nThe restructuring proposal for the FBI is outlined in Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for the next Republican president that was created in part by more than 140 former Trump administration employees. Under the plan, the FBI director would no longer report directly to officials within the Justice Department and instead would answer to the president.\n\n\"I don't think that would be a wise approach,\" Wray told Georgia Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson, when asked about the idea.\n\n\"I was appointed by President Trump - I respect that. I think that's part of our structure,\" Wray said. \"But independence in terms of how we do our work is what matters to me. And we need to be able to do our work in a way that is free from political interference.\"\n\nWray said he has not read or reviewed Project 2025 and did not comment specifically on it.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Jim Jordan of Ohio, told Wray: \"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation.\"\n\nThough the FBI has avoided the same level of scrutiny over the shooting directed at the Secret Service over security failures that preceded the shooting, culminating Tuesday in the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle, Wray is likely to be questioned by lawmakers skeptical of the bureau's assessment that Crooks left behind no obvious ideological motive that could explain his actions.\n\nThe FBI has said it is investigating the shooting, which killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism and an attempted assassination. Trump's campaign said the presumptive GOP nominee was doing \"fine\" after the shooting, which Trump said pierced the upper part of his right ear.\n\nWray and other senior officials privately briefed members of Congress last week, telling them that Crooks had photos on his phone of Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden and other officials and had looked up the dates for the Democratic National Convention as well as Trump's appearances.\n\nA law enforcement official told The Associated Press last week that Crooks had also flown a drone above the rally site before the event in an apparent effort to scope out the scene in advance.\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "heraldcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HeraldCourier.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@heraldcourier.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "manuel_balce_ceneta@heraldcourier.com", "name": "Manuel Balce Ceneta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, the hearing witness, faced bipartisan pressure to resign after her appearance, during which she provided few answers to lawmakers' questions. She announced one day later that she would indeed step down from her position.\n\nAt the House Judiciary Committee hearing, Wray came armed with useful investigative details and explained that his purview was investigating the shooter rather than security incompetencies, which allowed the director to avoid taking heat for the Secret Service's failings.\n\n\"Your ability to come in here and actually give way more than Director Cheatle ever did is somewhat refreshing,\" Rep. Russell Fry (R-SC) told Wray.\n\nLawmakers who typically harp on the FBI's controversies displayed a noticeable lack of hostility toward Wray as they pressed the director for answers about the historic incident, which marked the first assassination attempt on a president or former president in four decades.\n\nWray revealed for the first time that the FBI analyzed a laptop tied to Crooks and found a Google search on July 6 for information about Lee Harvey Oswald's assassination of former President John F. Kennedy. The search was performed on the same day Crooks registered to attend Trump's rally.\n\nCrooks typed into the search bar, \"How far away was Oswald from Kennedy,\" according to Wray.\n\n\"That's a search that's obviously significant in terms of his state of mind,\" Wray said.\n\nWray also debunked prior media reports that alleged Crooks wrote on a gaming platform profile, \"July 13 will be my premiere.\"\n\n\"It turns out it was not the shooter, that it was some other individual as part of some sick joke who, after the shooting, created a profile page pretending to be the shooter,\" Wray said. \"Of course, that person has now admitted to it.\"\n\nCrooks flew a drone in the 3:50 p.m. to 4 p.m. time frame on the day of the rally, Wray said.\n\nFBI agents reverse-engineered the flight path and believe Crooks flew it about 200 yards away from the rally stage, where Trump would speak two hours later, according to Wray.\n\n\"We think, but we do not know, so again, this is one of these things that's qualified because of our ongoing review, that he was live streaming, you know, viewing the footage\" for about 11 minutes, Wray said.\n\nWray said the FBI's evidence response team analyzed fingerprints and footprints around the American Glass Research building, where Crooks crawled onto a roof and fired shots into the rally crowd.\n\nThe FBI believes Crooks accessed the roof using \"some mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping\" on the side of the building, Wray said.\n\n\"In other words, we do not believe he used a ladder to get up there,\" Wray added, countering initial reports that Crooks had used a ladder to climb up to the roof.\n\nWray said the FBI recovered a five-foot ladder that investigators believe Crooks purchased based on a bloodied receipt found with Crooks's body on the roof.\n\nWray said the FBI did not find the ladder at the scene, but he cautioned that the FBI was \"still digging into all that, things related to the ladder and his access to the roof.\"\n\nWray said Crooks purchased the AR-15 rifle that he used in the shooting from his father in October 2023.\n\nCrooks was a \"fairly avid shooting hobbyist,\" Wray said.\n\nWray added that Crooks purchased 50 rounds of ammunition the day of the shooting and had two explosive devices in his vehicle, as well as one in his home. He also said Crooks visited a shooting range the day before the rally and \"probably\" used the same rifle that he would later aim at Trump.\n\nWray characterized Crooks as a \"loner\" but believes, at this stage, he did not have any accomplices in the shooting. But what drove Crooks to carry out the shooting remains a mystery.\n\n\"I think it's fair to say that we do not yet have a clear picture of his motive,\" Wray said.\n\nThe director cautioned that the investigation was \"very much ongoing\" and the FBI was still working through accessing certain encrypted platforms on Crooks's electronic devices.\n\nWray said Crooks's devices revealed he was interested in general with public figures, but he became fixated on Trump around July 6, the same day he made the Kennedy query in Google.\n\nCrooks traveled to the Butler Farm show grounds, where the rally took place, one week before the event, and then he visited it again the morning of the event for about 70 minutes, Wray said. He returned \"for good\" at about 3:50 p.m. when he flew the drone, the director said.\n\nWhile several Democrats also showed interest in details of the shooting, Rep. Hank Johnson (D-GA) was among multiple lawmakers from his party who broached Project 2025, a policy plan crafted by the Heritage Foundation for the next Republican president. Trump has distanced himself from the project, saying he had no role in creating it.\n\n\"It is a game plan for President Trump's first 120 days in office,\" Johnson claimed, saying it would force Wray to report directly to Trump instead of to the attorney general. Wray called that prospect \"unwise.\"\n\nJohnson also made the false claim that Project 2025 would install \"38,000 MAGA loyalists\" at the FBI.\n\n\"That's frightening. That's what Project 2025 proposes,\" Johnson said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nRep.

That is the same day that it appears he registered\" for the Trump rally scheduled for July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania, Mr Wray told the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the shooting, which killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism.\n\nCrooks was killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nThe investigation has thrust the bureau into a political maelstrom months before the presidential election, with lawmakers and the public pressing for details about what may have motivated Crooks in the most serious attempt to assassinate a president or presidential candidate since President Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981.\n\nA detailed timeline of Crooks' movements and online activity has been formed by the FBI, but the precise motive -- or why Mr Trump was singled out -- remains elusive, Mr Wray said.\n\n\"A lot of the usual repositories of information have not yielded anything notable in terms of motive or ideology,\" Mr Wray said.\n\nHe did note that Crooks had grown interested in public officials -- besides Mr Trump, Crooks also had photos on his phone of Democratic President Joe Biden and other prominent figures -- and in the days before the shooting had appeared particularly consumed by Mr Trump.\n\nAbout two hours prior to the shooting, Crooks had allegedly flown a drone about 180 meters from the rally stage where Mr Trump would later stand, Mr Wray said.\n\nHe added that Crooks used the device to livestream and watch footage.\n\nThe use of the drone so close to the rally site just hours before Mr Trump took the stage adds to the questions about the security lapses preceding the event.Mr Wray pledged that the FBI would \"leave no stone unturned\" in its investigation.\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment, and tragically the Butler County assassination attempt is another example -- a particularly heinous and public one -- of what I've been talking about,\" the FBI director said.\n\nThe hearing had been scheduled well before the shooting, as part of the committee's routine oversight of the FBI and the Justice Department, but questions about the shooting dominated the session.\n\nMr Trump's campaign said the presumptive Republican nominee was doing \"fine\" after the shooting, which the former president said pierced the upper part of his right ear.", "source": {"uri": "oxfordmail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oxford Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy when he shot him, the FBI director revealed in stunning testimony to Congress.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray also told lawmakers the 20-year-old gunman flew a drone 200 yards from the stage just two hours before he opened fire in Butler, Pennsylvania, and had three explosives in his car.\n\nThe bombshell revelations from the bureau's chief give more insight into Crooks' preparation before he shot the former president, including his online research on the sniper that took out JFK in 1963.\n\nWray said Crooks had been 'interested in public figures' and 'somewhere around July 6 or so he became very focused on former President Trump and his rally.'\n\nThe director said an analysis of Crooks' laptop revealed he had searched on Google on July 6 'how far away was Oswald from Kennedy.' It was the same day he registered to attend the Butler rally.\n\nLee Harvey Oswald shot and killed former President John F. Kennedy in 1963.\n\nCrooks was flying a drone above the rally site two hours before the shooting and just 200 yards away from the stage, Wray has also revealed.\n\nWray made the bombshell revelation to Congress on Wednesday during a grilling by lawmakers on the investigation into the assassination attempt on the former president and the massive security failures.\n\nCrooks shot Trump in the ear just 400 feet away from the stage in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13 from the roof of a nearby building just outside the security perimeter of the event.\n\nWray revealed that investigators found Crooks had a drone that he used to survey the scene hours before the event started, which was recovered from his car parked nearby.\n\nHe flew the drone around 4 p.m. over the area of the rally close to '200 yards' from the stage to survey the scene. Trump took the stage around 6:03 p.m., over two hours later.\n\nThe FBI has also recovered three 'explosive devices' in possession of Crooks.\n\nThey were 'relatively crude devices' but had the ability 'to be detonated remotely,' Wray said.\n\nThe FBI director also revealed the weapon used had a 'collapsible stock,' which he said 'could explain why it might've been less easy for people to observe.'\n\nWray could not say whether Crooks carried the gun up to the roof with him before he fired the shots or had stashed it there prior. He said the gunman did not use a ladder to get onto the roof but rather some sort of 'vertical piping.'\n\nHe said Crooks and his family owned a combined 14 guns and Crooks had visited a shooting range one day before the rally. Crooks used an AR-style weapon that had been purchased legally by his father and sold to him in October 2023.\n\nWray said eight bullet cartridges had been recovered from the roof where Crooks fired off his shots toward the former president.\n\nAnd he wouldn't rule out that Crooks did not have any accomplices to the crime, saying it's still being looked at by law enforcement.\n\nAs Wray faced questions about why the president was allowed on stage despite the 'threat' being identified 20 minutes before the shots were fired, Wray said, 'we don't know the answer to that.'\n\nBut he insisted his investigation was not focused on the security breach and the Secret Service failures.\n\n'Our investigation is focused on the shooter and all things related to his attack.'\n\nWray was peppered with veiled references to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) measures that some Republicans have taken to blaming the security breach on.\n\nWray insisted the physical fitness standards for getting in to the FBI 'actually exceed' what they've been in years past and insisted his agency does not factor in DEI when making hiring decisions.\n\nHis hearing comes days after the former Director of Secret Service Kimberly Cheatle was forced to resign after evading answering rounds of questioning by punting to the FBI in another congressional hearing earlier this week.\n\nWray promised his agency would leave 'no stone unturned' and emphasized that he wanted to provide all the information he had at this point of the ongoing investigation.\n\n'The shooter may be deceased but the FBI's investigation is very much ongoing.'\n\nHe also made a reference to the warnings he has been giving Congress for years now about the threats of domestic terrorism.\n\nThe shooting is 'another example, particularly heinous and very public one of what I have been talking about.'\n\nWray again warned about 'passion and heated rhetoric turning into actual violence.'\n\n'We've seen it against public officials of all sorts, we've seen it against law enforcements the number of officers shot and killed in the line of duty is alarming.'\n\n'It's almost every five days that a law enforcement officer is killed in the line of duty, that is an example of the kinds of ways passion and heated rhetoric can bubble over into violence.'\n\nThe Judiciary Committee hearing focused on both the shooting at the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally and the 'ongoing politicization' of the FBI.\n\nQuestioning on a separate foiled Iranian plot to assassinate Donald Trump was also a subject of contention.\n\nA bombshell report last week revealed the U.S. received intelligence of an Iranian assassination plot in the weeks before Trump was shot at the Pennsylvania rally.\n\nMeanwhile, House Republicans are expected to set up a bipartisan task force to investigate the shooting in a vote this week.\n\nThe FBI and Secret Service revealed to lawmakers last week they spotted shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks as a person of interest a full 62 minutes before he fired a shot.\n\nTwenty minutes passed between the time Secret Service agents spotted Crooks with a gun on the rooftop and he fired shots at the president.\n\nIn a staggering moment, Cheatle admitted on Monday her agents on the ground were warned between two and five times that there was a 'suspicious person' reported before Trump took the stage.\n\nWhile Trump walked around with little more than a bloody ear, Crooks killed former fire chief Corey Comperatore, 50, and critically injured two other rally goers sitting close to where the former president was speaking last weekend before he was neutralized.\n\nThe security chief had faced mounting questions over why an agent was not stationed on the roof from where gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire on the former president, and why Trump was allowed to take the stage even when a threat was detected.\n\nShe had also been ridiculed for suggesting her agency did not have a presence on the roof because it was 'sloped.'\n\nThe 20-year-old shooter Crooks, was able to get within 160 yards of the stage where the former president was speaking when he opened fire. The building on which he stood was outside the security perimeter, despite clearly being within rifle shooting range.\n\nAnd that was despite the FBI learning of a threat on Trump's life from Iran leading to a bump in security for the former president in the days before the July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nCheatle said she believed she was the 'best person' to lead the Secret Service at this time, but later acquiesced to the bipartisan demands for her resignation.\n\nOn the day of the rally, Trump walked out onto the stage at 6:02 p.m.\n\nThen at around 6:12 p.m. Crooks' first shots rang out.\n\nCheatle could not tell lawmakers how the shooter had gotten onto the roof.\n\nAt the time of the shooting, law enforcement agents were inside the building, 147 yards away from where Trump stood, but not on top of it.\n\n'That building in particular has a sloped roof at its highest point. And so, you know, there's a safety factor that would be considered there that we wouldn't want to put somebody up on a sloped roof,' she told ABC News in an interview Tuesday.\n\n'And so, you know, the decision was made to secure the building, from inside.'\n\nWhat transpired instead was a security nightmare: Thomas Matthew Crooks was able to scale the building and secure his own position, while law enforcement struggled to locate him even amid pressing warnings from members of the Trump crowd. But there wasn't sufficient time to act on the tips, she explained.\n\n'The shooter was actually identified as a potential person of suspicion,' Cheatle said. 'Unfortunately, with the rapid succession of how things unfolded, by the time that individual was eventually located, they were on the rooftop and were able to fire off at the former president.'\n\nShe was referencing claims by witnesses that they alerted law enforcement about the threat, but agents weren't able to eliminate the threat in time. Officials have pointed to the initial responding officer, who lifted himself up on the roof only to lower himself back when the gunman turned his weapon at him.\n\nCheatle has taken blame for the fateful security breach, but has denied calls to step down.\n\n'The buck stops with me,' she said.\n\n'It was unacceptable,' she told ABC. 'And it's something that shouldn't happen again.'\n\n'While we give overwhelming thanks to the individual Secret Service agents who did their jobs under immense pressure, this tragedy was preventable. The Secret Service has a zero fail mission, but it failed on July 13 and in the days leading up to the rally,' Comer is also expected to say, as he will again call for Cheatle's resignation.\n\nAlso coming into question on the call was the possible motive for Crooks to commit such an atrocity.\n\nOfficials did not confirm an operating motive and said that his rationale remains a mystery.\n\nAuthorities said that they have yet to find any ideological material that could shine light on why Crooks decided to shoot the former president.\n\nBut, they did reveal that Crooks operated several accounts on encrypted platforms that they are still working to gain access to.\n\nHere's a timeline of how that fateful July 11 went down:\n\n1PM\n\nThe grounds to the event at Butler Farm Show opened at 1pm.\n\nIt began an hours-long build up that saw MAGA supporters immediately pour into the area to camp out.\n\nSecurity swept the area and set up perimeters, however questions have been raised over how the gunman was able to secure a clear shot just 400ft from the stage.\n\n5PM\n\nAn hour before Trump took the stage at approximately 5pm, former GOP Senate candidate Sean Parnell warmed up the crowd, bringing cheers as he slammed President Biden and his stuttering campaign.\n\nWith the sun still high on a bright day, Trump emerged to 'God Bless the USA' playing over the loudspeakers at 6:03pm, and remained waving and shaking his fist at the crowd for several minutes.\n\n6:11PM\n\nTrump brought out a large graphic with statistics on the migrant crisis at the southern border, and told the crowd at 6:11pm: 'That chart's a couple of months old...'\n\n'If you want to really see something that's sad, take a look at what happened,' Trump continued - before he abruptly grabbed the side of his head as several 'pops' filled the event space.\n\n6:12PM\n\nThe 78-year-old dropped to the floor in an instant as five more shots rang overhead in quick succession, before four Secret Service agents raced to the stage and dove on top of the former president.\n\nStunning images showed Trump cowered on the floor as agents protected him, with blood dripping down his cheek.\n\nSeveral more Secret Service agents continued to flood the stage, while four heavily armed officers lined the perimeter ordering attendees to 'get down.'\n\nThe sniper, sat 400ft across from the rally on an exposed rooftop, fired another shot at the stage a second later while Trump fans streamed out of the bleachers.\n\nSecret Service scrambled to take control of the pandemonium where three attendees were hit, one fatally, within a matter of seconds.\n\n6:13PM\n\nAn emergency room doctor with blood spattered on his shirt later said he sprang into action to perform emergency CPR on one victim.\n\n'The guy had spun around was jammed between the benches and a head shot here. There's lots of blood and he had brain matter,' he told CBS News.\n\n'So I got him together so I got people there really helpful. I did CPR chest compressions as well.'\n\n6:14PM\n\nMicrophones surrounding the stage picked up staggering detail of the urgent response, beginning with one ordering screaming people to 'get down, get down, get down.'\n\nAt the same moment, snipers set up on a roof next to bleachers were seen firing back at the gunman, with Secret Service agents surrounding Trump heard on microphones confirming the moment he was brought down.\n\nDespite the chaos flying around the scene, the rally appeared to hold its breath to see if Trump was hit.\n\nIn a move that sparked iconic images set to define his candidacy, Trump stood up and triumphantly held his fist in the air, pumping it at his supporters to raucous relief.\n\n'USA, USA, USA,' the crowd chanted at the sight, with a blood-spattered Trump appearing to mouth the word 'fight' several times as Secret Service tried to hurry him away.\n\nWhile getting up off the floor, an agent picked up a white cloth and held it to Trump's bleeding ear, telling him to 'hold that on your head, it's bloody.'\n\n'Are we good?' one male agent says, as another responds quickly: 'Shooter down!'\n\n'Shooter's down. Are we good to move?' one says next.

Jim Jordan of Ohio, told Wray: \"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation.\"\n\nThough the FBI has avoided the same level of scrutiny over the shooting directed at the Secret Service over security failures that preceded the shooting, culminating Tuesday in the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle, Wray is likely to be questioned by lawmakers skeptical of the bureau's assessment that Crooks left behind no obvious ideological motive that could explain his actions.\n\nThe FBI has said it is investigating the shooting, which killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism and an attempted assassination. Trump's campaign said the presumptive GOP nominee was doing \"fine\" after the shooting, which Trump said pierced the upper part of his right ear.\n\nWray and other senior officials privately briefed members of Congress last week, telling them that Crooks had photos on his phone of Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden and other officials and had looked up the dates for the Democratic National Convention as well as Trump's appearances.\n\nA law enforcement official told The Associated Press last week that Crooks had also flown a drone above the rally site before the event in an apparent effort to scope out the scene in advance.\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "mcdowellnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "McDowellNews.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Experts call that 'ridiculous' ROBERT YOON Associated Press\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment, and tragically the Butler County assassination attempt is another example -- a particularly heinous and public one -- of what I've been talking about,\" Wray said.\n\nThe hearing had been scheduled well before the July 13 shooting as part of the committee's routine oversight of the FBI and the Justice Department, and though lawmakers may touch on a broad array of topics, questions about the shooting are expected to dominate the session.\n\nDespite being appointed by Trump, Wray typically faces antagonistic questions from the Republican-led panel, a reflection of lingering discontent over the FBI's investigation into potential ties between Russia and the 2016 campaign.\n\nThat sentiment was made clear early in the hearing when the panel's Republican chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, told Wray: \"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation.\"\n\nThough the FBI has avoided the same level of scrutiny over the shooting directed at the Secret Service over security failures that preceded the shooting, culminating Tuesday in the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle, Wray is likely to be questioned by lawmakers skeptical of the bureau's assessment that Crooks left behind no obvious ideological motive that could explain his actions.\n\nThe FBI has said it is investigating the shooting, which killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism and an attempted assassination. Trump's campaign said the presumptive GOP nominee was doing \"fine\" after the shooting, which Trump said pierced the upper part of his right ear.\n\nWray and other senior officials privately briefed members of Congress last week, telling them that Crooks had photos on his phone of Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden and other officials and had looked up the dates for the Democratic National Convention as well as Trump's appearances.\n\nA law enforcement official told The Associated Press last week that Crooks had also flown a drone above the rally site before the event in an apparent effort to scope out the scene in advance.\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "statesville.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Statesville.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@statesville.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

The most incredible thing was that I happened to not only turn, but to turn at the exact right time and in just the right amount,' he added, saying he survived 'by luck or by God'.\n\nTrump tuned into Wray's testimony, which also saw him detail how Crooks had researched the assassination of President John F. Kennedy prior to the shooting.\n\nThe gunman did a Google search one week prior of 'How far away was Oswald from Kennedy?' according to Wray, who said the suspect he said had taken a keen interest in public figures but had otherwise not left behind clear clues of an ideological motive.\n\nThe July 6 online search, recovered from a laptop the FBI says is tied to Crooks, is a reference to Lee Harvey Oswald, the shooter who killed Kennedy from a sniper's perch in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.\n\nWray said his understanding was that a bullet or some shrapnel 'is what grazed his [Trump's] ear' during the attempted assassination in Butler on July 13\n\nTrump pumped a fist at the crowd and appeared to mouth 'fight' before being escorted off the stage by his security detail on July 13, 2024.\n\n'That's a search obviously that is significant in terms of his state of mind.

That is obviously one of the central questions in our investigation, and it's been very frustrating to us that a lot of the usual kind of low-hanging-fruit places that we would find that have not yielded significant clues about his motive,' Wray said.\n\nThe hearing had been scheduled well before the shooting as part of the committee's routine oversight of the FBI and the Justice Department.\n\nQuestions about the shooting dominated the session, but other topics included the FBI's diversity efforts, election interference, the Jan 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol and whether Wray had personally observed any cognitive decline in meetings with Biden prior to his decision to withdraw from the election.\n\nHis answer that he had not witnessed any issues with the president's mental state left Trump unimpressed, with the Republican nominee calling for Wray to resign.\n\n'I watched the Congressional Hearing today as Christopher Wray was asked the question whether or not he noticed any Cognitive Degeneration in his many conversations with Crooked Joe Biden,' Trump wrote on Truth Social Wednesday.\n\nMembers of the crowd in Butler, Pennsylvania rushed to his aid following the shooting\n\nThe presidential hopeful has since given extensive accounts of the moment he was shot and was seen sporting a bandage over his ear\n\n'Wray should resign immediately from the FBI, and stop 'sweet talking' Congress every time he goes up, which he loves to do, because anybody can see that Joe Biden is cognitively and physically challenged.\n\n'And if you can't see that, you sure as hell can't be running the FBI - Unless, that is, you want to illegally lead the Raid on Mar-a-Lago.

Wray said many people have described Crooks as a loner and the list of contacts in his phone was short.\n\nWray also told lawmakers that Crooks flew a drone about 180m from the stage where Trump spoke to the crowd and live-streamed footage for about 11 minutes, some two hours before the event.\n\nHe said the crude explosive devices recovered from Crooks' car and home were designed to be detonated remotely. Crooks had a transmitter with him at the time of the shooting, Wray added. But he said the FBI believes the suspect would not have been successful had he tried to detonate the devices.\n\nThe hearing also focused on the increasingly tense political atmosphere surrounding the presidential campaign.\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated-threat environment. And tragically, the... assassination attempt is another example, particularly heinous,\" Wray testified.\n\nKimberly Cheatle resigned as director of the US Secret Service on July 23, after bipartisan demands to quit over the failure to prevent the attempted assassination.\n\nJudiciary Committee chairman Jim Jordan said he expected Wray to answer questions about what happened before, during and after the incident but expressed doubt about the FBI director's answers even before questioning began.\n\n\"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy scepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation,\" Jordan said.\n\nRepresentative Jerrold Nadler, the panel's top Democrat, condemned the Trump shooting \"unequivocally and unabashedly\", but pointed to years of political threats and violence, and violent rhetoric from Republicans including Trump himself.\n\n\"If you think that this one assassin's bullet was a bolt out of the blue, and not part of a wave of violence that has threatened this nation for years, then you have missed the point,\" the New York Democrat said.\n\nWray has long faced opposition from hardline Republicans, some angered over the arrest of Trump supporters who stormed the US Capitol on Jan 6, 2021, as Congress certified President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.", "source": {"uri": "asiaone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AsiaOne"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Kennedy when he killed him on Nov. 22, 1963, in Dallas. Crooks was 471 feet away from Trump when he opened fire, according to investigators.\n\nAuthorities recovered eight bullet casings from Crooks' perch on a manufacturing building, Wray confirmed on Wednesday.\n\nCrooks visited the rally site at least three times before the shooting, according to Wray. He lived in Bethel Park, about 40 miles south of Butler, on the other side of Pittsburgh. Crooks' first visit was on July 7, one day after his Oswald search, Wray said.\n\nHe also scouted the site twice on the day of the shooting, once in the morning and once in the afternoon with a drone, according to Wray. The drone was used to survey an area about 200 yards away from the stage.\n\nUnlike doomed Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle on Monday, Wray volunteered plenty of information about the assassination attempt. While Cheatle cited ongoing investigations for her silence, such probes did not stop Wray.\n\nHowever, he could not speak to exactly why Crooks targeted Trump.

Kennedy shooting from his laptop and flew a drone in the area near the rally just two hours before the former president took the stage, FBI Director Christopher Wray said Wednesday.\n\nThe stunning revelations are the latest details about the investigation to come to light this week in congressional hearings about the Trump rally on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nAt the wide-ranging House Judiciary Committee hearing, Wray also shared that investigators believe that Thomas Matthew Crooks use a gun with a collapsable stock and that he accessed the roof of the building by climbing, not with a ladder.\n\nThe hearing included a large share of politics, as Republicans repeatedly mentioned Vice President Kamala Harris as they sought to tie the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee to border policy and other actions, and Democrats asked Wray repeatedly about Project 2025.\n\nHere are the key takeaways from Wednesday's hearing:\n\nShooter looked up information on JFK assassination\n\nAccording to the FBI's analysis of Crooks' laptop, Crooks searched how far Lee Harvey Oswald was when he shot and killed Kennedy in 1963.\n\nThe search was on July 6, the same day he registered to attend the rally.\n\n\"On July 6, he did a Google search for: 'how far away was Oswald from Kennedy,'\" Wray told the House Judiciary Committee.\n\n\"That's a search that's obviously significant in terms of his state of mind,\" the FBI director added. \"That is the same day that it appears that he registered for the Butler rally.\"\n\nShooter flew drone just 2 hours before Trump took the stage\n\nWray revealed that \"around 4 p.m.,\" Crooks \"was flying the drone around the area\" of the rally, approximately 200 yards from the stage.\n\nThe drone was in the air for approximately 11 minutes, and investigators believe Crooks watched a live feed from the drone on his phone. CNN previously reported that the drone was found in his car following the shooting.\n\nIn addition, Crooks had two explosives in his car at the time of the shooting and one in his home, but likely did not have the ability to detonate them from the roof where he was killed, Wray testified.\n\n\"It looks like because of the on/off position on the receivers, that if he had tried to detonate those devices from the roof, it would not have worked,\" Wray said.\n\nWray said that investigators have been able to \"reverse-engineer the flight path of the drone from the day of the rally,\" and now think that the drone footage \"would have shown [the shooter] what would have been behind him.\"\n\n\"It was almost like giving him a rear-view mirror of the scene behind him,\" Wray said.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the shooting as both an attempted assassination and as a potential act of domestic terrorism. FBI officials have repeatedly asserted that they believe Crooks acted alone, and Wray reiterated that there is no evidence of any co-conspirators.\n\nGun had a collapsable stock and was purchased from shooter's father\n\nInvestigators say that Crooks fired approximately eight times from an AR-style rifle at the former president before being killed by a US Secret Service counter sniper.\n\nThe rifle Crooks used was purchased from his father, Wray testified.\n\n\"The weapon that he used for the attempted assassination was an AR-style rifle that was purchased legally, that he - as my understanding - acquired, I think bought actually from his father, who was the one who originally bought it,\" Wray said.\n\nPreviously, officials said they believed the firearm belonged to Crooks' father - not the shooter - and they didn't know how Crooks accessed the weapon.\n\n\"I have been saying some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment,\" Wray said. \"The shooter may be deceased but the FBI's investigation is ongoing.\"\n\nInvestigators have gone through the shooter's phone and computer, scoured his search history and bedroom and have interviewed his family and friends, but have struggled to identify what motivated the 20-year-old would be assassin to act.\n\nCrooks also had no prior contacts with the FBI, officials say, and had not been previously on their radar or databases.\n\nClimbed up to the roof\n\nThe FBI thinks Crooks used equipment and piping attached to the building to climb up onto the roof where he shot at Trump.\n\n\"We now believe the subject climbed onto the roof using some mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping on the side of the AGR building,\" Wray said. \"In other words, we do not believe he used a ladder to get up there.\"\n\nThe FBI, according to Wray, confirmed that Crooks had previously purchased a roughly five-foot ladder.\n\nPennsylvania State Police Commissioner Christopher Paris testified Tuesday that Crooks was on the roof for roughly three minutes before he fired at Trump.\n\nRepublicans use hearing to challenge Harris\n\nAs Wray testified, GOP members pushed the FBI director to discuss any meetings he has had with Harris during her tenure as vice president, a notable line of questioning now that she is the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nThe questions ranged from whether Wray has regular briefings with Harris, what her behavior is like in those meetings and what sort of issues she has expressed concerns about.\n\nIn one exchange, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz asked how frequently Harris attends briefings that Wray has with President Joe Biden. Wray declined to answer with any specificity.\n\nWisconsin Rep. Tom Tiffany asked Wray whether Harris \"has met with you in regard to the border, or whether she has \"specifically asked you for a meeting\" about the \"threats that are at the border.\"\n\nWray said that he had \"been in meetings that include the vice president\" in which the border was discussed, but again declined to discuss specific meetings or conversations.\n\nIndiana Rep. Victoria Spartz also asked about Wray's meetings about the border with Harris, asking whether the vice president has \"actually initiated\" meetings on a regular basis \"as the leading border czar.\" Wray did not answer.\n\nShooter was searching for news stories\n\nWray pushed back against reports that Crooks searched for images of specific prominent public officials online, saying that it appears he was actually searching for news articles.\n\n\"The shooter appears to have done a lot of searches of public figures in general, but so far we are seeing kind of news articles and things like that,\" Wray said. He continued, \"so the images that have been reported about, really what we are talking about there are when you do a news search of an article the image appears in a cache as opposed to like a search for that specific individual.\"\n\nThe FBI director cautioned that the effort to uncover Crooks' motive is ongoing, but warned that \"it is, quite frankly, a dangerous time to be a prominent public official.\"\n\nEmployee under internal investigation for post about shooting\n\nWray said Wednesday that an FBI employee is being internally investigated for posting something \"totally inappropriate\" about the Trump assassination attempt.\n\nRepublican Rep. Chip Roy asked the director whether \"any FBI agents texted, emailed or expressed disappointment that Trump survived the assassination attempt or otherwise editorialized about the assassination attempt?\"\n\nWray said he wasn't aware of any agents acting inappropriately but that there had been one instance \"of an individual who posted something that I consider outrageous, totally inappropriate, and unacceptable.\"\n\n\"That individual has been referred to our inspection division, which is our sort of internal affairs investigatory arm that does the disciplinary process,\" Wray said.\n\nWray did not say where the post was made.\n\nWray expects more threats from Iran\n\nWray said on Wednesday that the FBI informed the US Secret Service about an Iranian plot to assassinate former President Donald Trump, saying that it's likely law enforcement agencies are going to see more such \"brazenness\" from Iran in the future.\n\nThe director declined to provide details of \"specific, classified information,\" to the committee but stressed that his agency has been calling out \"efforts by the Iranian government to attempt to retaliate for the killing of (Iranian General) Soleimani by going after current or former prominent US officials.\"\n\n\"I think we need to recognize the brazenness of the Iranian regime, including right here in the United States, and I expect that we're going to see more of it and I expect there will be more coming on that,\" Wray said.\n\nCNN has previously reported that US authorities obtained intelligence from a human source in recent weeks on a plot by Iran to try to assassinate Trump, a development that led to the Secret Service increasing security around the former president, multiple people briefed on the matter told CNN. There's no indication that Thomas Matthew Crooks, the would-be assassin who attempted to kill the former president, was connected to the plot, the sources said.\n\nSchiff, in swipe at Trump's felony conviction, praises FBI's ban on hiring felons\n\nDemocratic Rep. Adam Schiff pressed Wray on the agency's hiring standards in an effort to criticize the Republican Party's decision to make Trump, a convicted felon, its 2024 presidential nominee.\n\n\"Do candidates for the FBI have to go through background checks?\" Schiff asked, to which Wray said yes.\n\n\"Would someone with dozens of felony convictions survive a background check for the bureau?\" Schiff said.\n\n\"No,\" Wray replied.\n\n\"So they would never be hired by the bureau?\"\n\n\"No,\" Wray said again.\n\n\"Clearly, the bureau has higher standards for their hiring than one of America's great political parties,\" Schiff said.\n\nTrump was convicted earlier this year on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records as part of a hush money scheme he orchestrated ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nWray opposes idea to make FBI director report directly to POTUS\n\nWray testified that he opposes the idea of having the head of the law enforcement agency report directly to the president, a proposal pushed by some Trump supporters.\n\nThe restructuring proposal for the FBI is outlined in Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for the next Republican president that was created in part by more than 140 former Trump administration employees. Under the plan, the FBI director would no longer report directly to officials within the Justice Department and instead would answer to the president.\n\n\"I don't think that would be a wise approach,\" Wray told Georgia Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson, when asked about the idea.\n\n\"I was appointed by President Trump - I respect that. I think that's part of our structure,\" Wray said. \"But independence in terms of how we do our work is what matters to me. And we need to be able to do our work in a way that is free from political interference.\"\n\nWray said he has not read or reviewed Project 2025 and did not comment specifically on it.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

CNN previously reported that the drone was found in his car following the shooting.\n\nIn addition, Crooks had two explosives in his car at the time of the shooting and one in his home, but likely did not have the ability to detonate them from the roof where he was killed, Wray testified.\n\n\"It looks like because of the on/off position on the receivers, that if he had tried to detonate those devices from the roof, it would not have worked,\" Wray said.\n\nWray said that investigators have been able to \"reverse-engineer the flight path of the drone from the day of the rally,\" and now think that the drone footage \"would have shown [the shooter] what would have been behind him.\"\n\n\"It was almost like giving him a rear-view mirror of the scene behind him,\" Wray said.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the shooting as both an attempted assassination and as a potential act of domestic terrorism. FBI officials have repeatedly asserted that they believe Crooks acted alone, and Wray reiterated that there is no evidence of any co-conspirators.\n\nGun had a collapsable stock and was purchased from shooter's father\n\nInvestigators say that Crooks fired approximately eight times from an AR-style rifle at the former president before being killed by a US Secret Service counter sniper.\n\nThe rifle Crooks used was purchased from his father, Wray testified.\n\n\"The weapon that he used for the attempted assassination was an AR-style rifle that was purchased legally, that he - as my understanding - acquired, I think bought actually from his father, who was the one who originally bought it,\" Wray said.\n\nPreviously, officials said they believed the firearm belonged to Crooks' father - not the shooter - and they didn't know how Crooks accessed the weapon.\n\n\"I have been saying some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment,\" Wray said. \"The shooter may be deceased but the FBI's investigation is ongoing.\"\n\nInvestigators have gone through the shooter's phone and computer, scoured his search history and bedroom and have interviewed his family and friends, but have struggled to identify what motivated the 20-year-old would be assassin to act.\n\nCrooks also had no prior contacts with the FBI, officials say, and had not been previously on their radar or databases.\n\nClimbed up to the roof\n\nThe FBI thinks Crooks used equipment and piping attached to the building to climb up onto the roof where he shot at Trump.\n\n\"We now believe the subject climbed onto the roof using some mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping on the side of the AGR building,\" Wray said. \"In other words, we do not believe he used a ladder to get up there.\"\n\nThe FBI, according to Wray, confirmed that Crooks had previously purchased a roughly five-foot ladder.\n\nPennsylvania State Police Commissioner Christopher Paris testified Tuesday that Crooks was on the roof for roughly three minutes before he fired at Trump.\n\nRepublicans use hearing to challenge Harris\n\nAs Wray testified, GOP members pushed the FBI director to discuss any meetings he has had with Harris during her tenure as vice president, a notable line of questioning now that she is the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nThe questions ranged from whether Wray has regular briefings with Harris, what her behavior is like in those meetings and what sort of issues she has expressed concerns about.\n\nIn one exchange, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz asked how frequently Harris attends briefings that Wray has with President Joe Biden. Wray declined to answer with any specificity.\n\nWisconsin Rep. Tom Tiffany asked Wray whether Harris \"has met with you in regard to the border, or whether she has \"specifically asked you for a meeting\" about the \"threats that are at the border.\"\n\nWray said that he had \"been in meetings that include the vice president\" in which the border was discussed, but again declined to discuss specific meetings or conversations.\n\nIndiana Rep. Victoria Spartz also asked about Wray's meetings about the border with Harris, asking whether the vice president has \"actually initiated\" meetings on a regular basis \"as the leading border czar.\" Wray did not answer.\n\nShooter was searching for news stories\n\nWray pushed back against reports that Crooks searched for images of specific prominent public officials online, saying that it appears he was actually searching for news articles.\n\n\"The shooter appears to have done a lot of searches of public figures in general, but so far we are seeing kind of news articles and things like that,\" Wray said. He continued, \"so the images that have been reported about, really what we are talking about there are when you do a news search of an article the image appears in a cache as opposed to like a search for that specific individual.\"\n\nThe FBI director cautioned that the effort to uncover Crooks' motive is ongoing, but warned that \"it is, quite frankly, a dangerous time to be a prominent public official.\"\n\nEmployee under internal investigation for post about shooting\n\nWray said Wednesday that an FBI employee is being internally investigated for posting something \"totally inappropriate\" about the Trump assassination attempt.\n\nRepublican Rep. Chip Roy asked the director whether \"any FBI agents texted, emailed or expressed disappointment that Trump survived the assassination attempt or otherwise editorialized about the assassination attempt?\"\n\nWray said he wasn't aware of any agents acting inappropriately but that there had been one instance \"of an individual who posted something that I consider outrageous, totally inappropriate, and unacceptable.\"\n\n\"That individual has been referred to our inspection division, which is our sort of internal affairs investigatory arm that does the disciplinary process,\" Wray said.\n\nWray did not say where the post was made.\n\nWray expects more threats from Iran\n\nWray said on Wednesday that the FBI informed the US Secret Service about an Iranian plot to assassinate former President Donald Trump, saying that it's likely law enforcement agencies are going to see more such \"brazenness\" from Iran in the future.\n\nThe director declined to provide details of \"specific, classified information,\" to the committee but stressed that his agency has been calling out \"efforts by the Iranian government to attempt to retaliate for the killing of (Iranian General) Soleimani by going after current or former prominent US officials.\"\n\n\"I think we need to recognize the brazenness of the Iranian regime, including right here in the United States, and I expect that we're going to see more of it and I expect there will be more coming on that,\" Wray said.\n\nCNN has previously reported that US authorities obtained intelligence from a human source in recent weeks on a plot by Iran to try to assassinate Trump, a development that led to the Secret Service increasing security around the former president, multiple people briefed on the matter told CNN. There's no indication that Thomas Matthew Crooks, the would-be assassin who attempted to kill the former president, was connected to the plot, the sources said.\n\nSchiff, in swipe at Trump's felony conviction, praises FBI's ban on hiring felons\n\nDemocratic Rep. Adam Schiff pressed Wray on the agency's hiring standards in an effort to criticize the Republican Party's decision to make Trump, a convicted felon, its 2024 presidential nominee.\n\n\"Do candidates for the FBI have to go through background checks?\" Schiff asked, to which Wray said yes.\n\n\"Would someone with dozens of felony convictions survive a background check for the bureau?\" Schiff said.\n\n\"No,\" Wray replied.\n\n\"So they would never be hired by the bureau?\"\n\n\"No,\" Wray said again.\n\n\"Clearly, the bureau has higher standards for their hiring than one of America's great political parties,\" Schiff said.\n\nTrump was convicted earlier this year on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records as part of a hush money scheme he orchestrated ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nWray opposes idea to make FBI director report directly to POTUS\n\nWray testified that he opposes the idea of having the head of the law enforcement agency report directly to the president, a proposal pushed by some Trump supporters.\n\nThe restructuring proposal for the FBI is outlined in Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for the next Republican president that was created in part by more than 140 former Trump administration employees. Under the plan, the FBI director would no longer report directly to officials within the Justice Department and instead would answer to the president.\n\n\"I don't think that would be a wise approach,\" Wray told Georgia Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson, when asked about the idea.\n\n\"I was appointed by President Trump - I respect that. I think that's part of our structure,\" Wray said. \"But independence in terms of how we do our work is what matters to me. And we need to be able to do our work in a way that is free from political interference.\"\n\nWray said he has not read or reviewed Project 2025 and did not comment specifically on it.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Wray said many people have described Crooks as a loner and the list of contacts in his phone was short.\n\nWray also told lawmakers that Crooks flew a drone about 200 yards from the stage where Trump spoke to the crowd and live-streamed footage for about 11 minutes, some two hours before the event.\n\nHe said the crude explosive devices recovered from Crooks' car and home were designed to be detonated remotely. Crooks had a transmitter with him at the time of the shooting, Wray added. But he said the FBI believes the suspect would not have been successful had he tried to detonate the devices.\n\nThe hearing also focused on the increasingly tense political atmosphere surrounding the presidential campaign.\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated-threat environment.

Kennedy.\n\n\"How far away was Oswald from Kennedy?\" Crooks searched, referencing Lee Harvey Oswald, the shooter who killed JFK with a sniper rifle in Dallas on November 22, 1963.\n\nThe FBI director said it was a \"significant\" online search in terms of Crooks' \"state of mind\".\n\nMr Wray said the JFK Google search was made \"about July 6\" - the same day Crooks registered to attend the Trump rally scheduled for July 13.\n\nAfter Mr Wray swore in, the FBI director began his introductory statement by offering his condolences to the victims of the \"horrific\" assassination attempt, and honored Corey Comperatore, 50, who died while protecting his family from danger.\n\n\"And of course, of course, to former president Trump, and his family. As I've said from the beginning, the attempted assassination of the former president was an attack on our democracy and our democratic process, and we will not and do not tolerate political violence of any kind, especially a despicable account of this magnitude,\" Mr Wray said.\n\n\"I want to assure you, and the American people, that the men and women of the FBI will continue to work tirelessly to get to the bottom of what happened. We are bringing all the resources of the FBI to bear, both criminal and national security.\n\n\"We're going to leave no stone unturned. The shooter may be deceased, but the FBI's investigation is still ongoing.\"\n\nThe FBI director discussed the shooter's preparation for the event, revealing during the hearing that Crooks travelled to the grounds of the rally the day before the shooting \"for the first time\" which was \"consistent with some kind of planning or reconnaissance\".\n\nMr Wray added Crooks had made a \"certain amount of (Google) searches\" relating to Mr Trump during the days leading up to the attempted assassination.\n\nDespite this, Mr Wray said the shooter's motive was still unknown and it had been \"very frustrating\" that some of the usual kind of \"low hanging-fruit places\" had not yielded any significant clues.\n\nThe FBI director said the images the investigators had recovered from the shooter's device appeared to be \"cached images from searches\" of high-profile individuals.\n\n\"There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of rhyme or reason to it, so far, other than these are all prominent public people, but they cover both parties, they cover both US people and even some foreign public officials,\" Mr Wray said.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie then asked Mr Wray if Crooks had any help to plan the shooting at the Butler rally, with the FBI boss insisting it was a line of inquiry being \"intensely focussed on\".\n\n\"So far we have not found any evidence of any accomplices or co-conspirators, foreign or domestic,\" Mr Wray said.\n\n\"From everything we've seen ... a lot of people describe him (Crooks) as a loner, that does kinda fit with what we're seeing in his devices.\n\n\"His list of contacts, for example, is very short compared to what you would normally see from most people, so it doesn't appear to be much interaction between him, face-to-face or digital, with people.\"\n\nThe \"AR-15 style\" gun was sold to Crooks by his father, Mr Wray revealed, after it was purchased legally, however he did not know for how much or how close to the day of the shooting it was obtained, with the FBI director speculating \"it may have been a year before, give or take\".\n\n\"I do know that on the day of the shooting, at about 1.30pm, he (Crooks) bought about 50 rounds of ammunition,\" Mr Wray said.\n\nMr Wray was also questioned on whether Crooks used a ladder to gain access to the roof where he was ultimately shot dead, with the FBI director confirming investigators know he purchased a 5-foot ladder, but they did not find the ladder at the scene.\n\nRep. Andy Biggs questioned the FBI director on the shooter's use of a drone and heard the bureau had been able to reverse engineer the flight path of the drone in the hours leading up to the shooting.\n\nMr Wray told the committee Crooks used the drone to determine a vantage point, as well as using it as a \"rear view mirror\", however the FBI director could not say with certainty the imagery the would-be assassin obtained from the drone footage.", "source": {"uri": "skynews.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News Australia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy, the FBI director said Wednesday.\n\nTestifying before the House Judiciary Committee, Christopher Wray gave lawmakers an update on the investigation into the July 13 shooting targeting Trump at a rally in Butler, Pa. That includes information pulled from a computer linked to the 20-year-old gunman, Thomas Crooks, that suggests he spent at least a week planning the attack.\n\n\"An analysis of a laptop that the investigation ties to the shooter reveals that on July 6 he did a Google search for 'How far away was Oswald from Kennedy?' \" Wray said. \"That's a search that obviously is significant in terms of his state of mind. That is the same day that it appears that he registered for the Butler rally.\"\n\nLee Harvey Oswald is the gunman who shot former President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, in 1963.\n\nIn his testimony, which comes 11 days after the attempt on Trump's life, Wray filled in some of the details about the gunman and the timeline ahead of the shooting.\n\nThe FBI has gained access to Crooks' digital devices, Wray said, but investigators still have not found anything that points to a motive or political ideology.\n\n\"Having said that, it does appear fairly clear that he was interested in public figures more broadly and, I think this is important, starting somewhere around July 6 or so, he became very focused on former president Trump and this rally,\" he told lawmakers.\n\nInvestigators believe Crooks visited the site of the Butler rally on three occasions, Wray said.\n\nThe first time was a week before the event, when he spent roughly 20 minutes there. The second time was the morning of the Trump rally, when he appears to have been on site for roughly 70 minutes, Wray said. The third time was later that afternoon, a few hours before the event -- and he never left.\n\nDuring that last visit, Wray said, Crooks flew a drone at the rally grounds for 11 minutes around 4 p.m., about 200 yards from the stage.\n\nInvestigators recovered the drone in the gunman's vehicle along with its controller. They have been able to reverse engineer the device's flight path, Wray said, but they don't know exactly what Crooks was able to see or why.\n\nWray also discussed the three explosive devices that investigators recovered: two from Crooks' vehicle and one at his residence. Wray described the devices as \"relatively crude,\" but said they did have the ability to be detonated remotely.\n\nA transmitter was found on Crooks' body, he said, but it appears that the receivers on the explosive devices were not turned on so he wouldn't have been able to detonate them.\n\nInvestigators now believe, Wray said, that Crooks climbed up onto the roof where he fired from by using \"some mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping\" on the side of the building. The bureau still has not determined, however, when the gunman got onto the roof.\n\nWray did say that Crooks' AR-style rifle had a collapsible stock, which Wray said \"could explain why it might have been less easy for people to observe.\"\n\nThe day before the shooting, Crooks went to a shooting range and fired an AR-style rifle, Wray said. The director described Crooks as a \"fairly avid shooting hobbyist.\"\n\nInvestigators have conducted more than 400 interviews so far of a wide range of people, he said, which has helped provide a picture of who Crooks was.\n\n\"From everything we've seen, which is consistent with what we've learned in interviews -- a lot of people describe him as a loner,\" Wray said. \"That does kind of fit with what we're seeing in his devices. His list of contacts, for example, is very short compared to what you would normally see from most people.

Kennedy shooting from his laptop and flew a drone in the area near the rally just two hours before the former president took the stage on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania, FBI Director Christopher Wray said Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the FBI's analysis of Thomas Matthew Crooks' laptop, Crooks searched how far Lee Harvey Oswald was when he shot and killed President John F. Kennedy in 1963.\n\nThe search was on July 6, the same day the Trump rally was announced.\n\n\"On July 6, he did a Google search for: 'how far away was Oswald from Kennedy,'\" Wray told the House Judiciary Committee.\n\n\"That's a search that's obviously significant in terms of his state of mind,\" the FBI director added. \"That is the same day that it appears that he registered for the Butler rally.\"\n\nShooter flew drone just 2 hours before Trump took the stage\n\nSpeaking to the House Judiciary Committee, Wray revealed that \"around 4 p.m.,\" the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, \"was flying the drone around the area\" of the rally, approximately 200 yards from the stage.\n\nThe drone was in the air for approximately 11 minutes, and investigators believe Crooks watched a live feed from the drone on his phone. CNN previously reported that the drone was found in his car following the shooting.\n\nIn addition, Crooks had two explosives in his car at the time of the shooting and one in his home, but likely did not have the ability to detonate them from the roof where he was killed, Wray testified.\n\n\"It looks like because of the on/off position on the receivers, that if he had tried to detonate those devices from the roof, it would not have worked,\" Wray said.\n\nWray said that investigators have been able to \"reverse-engineer the flight path of the drone from the day of the rally,\" and now think that the drone footage \"would have shown [the shooter] what would have been behind him.\"\n\n\"It was almost like giving him a rear-view mirror of the scene behind him,\" Wray said.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the shooting as both an attempted assassination and as a potential act of domestic terrorism. FBI officials have repeatedly asserted that they believe Crooks acted alone, and Wray reiterated that there is no evidence of any co-conspirators.\n\nGun had a collapsable stock and was purchased from shooter's father\n\nInvestigators say that Crooks fired approximately eight times from an AR-style rifle at the former president before being killed by a US Secret Service counter sniper.\n\nThe rifle Crooks used was purchased from his father, Wray testified.\n\n\"The weapon that he used for the attempted assassination was an AR-style rifle that was purchased legally, that he - as my understanding - acquired, I think bought actually from his father, who was the one who originally bought it,\" Wray said.\n\nPreviously, officials said they believed the firearm belonged to Crooks' father - not the shooter - and they didn't know how Crooks accessed the weapon.\n\n\"I have been saying some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment,\" Wray said. \"The shooter may be deceased but the FBI's investigation is ongoing.\"\n\nInvestigators have gone through the shooter's phone and computer, scoured his search history and bedroom and have interviewed his family and friends, but have struggled to identify what motivated the 20-year-old would be assassin to act.\n\nCrooks also had no prior contacts with the FBI, officials say, and had not been previously on their radar or databases.\n\nShooter was searching for news stories\n\nWray pushed back against reports that Crooks searched for images of specific prominent public officials online, saying that it appears he was actually searching for news articles.\n\n\"The shooter appears to have done a lot of searches of public figures in general, but so far we are seeing kind of news articles and things like that,\" Wray said. He continued, \"so the images that have been reported about, really what we are talking about there are when you do a news search of an article the image appears in a cache as opposed to like a search for that specific individual.\"\n\nThe FBI director cautioned that the effort to uncover Crooks' motive is ongoing, but warned that \"it is, quite frankly, a dangerous time to be a prominent public official.\"\n\nWray expects more threats from Iran\n\nWray said on Wednesday that the FBI informed the US Secret Service about an Iranian plot to assassinate former President Donald Trump, saying that it's likely law enforcement agencies are going to see more such \"brazenness\" from Iran in the future.\n\nThe director declined to provide details of \"specific, classified information,\" to the committee but stressed that his agency has been calling out \"efforts by the Iranian government to attempt to retaliate for the killing of (Iranian General) Soleimani by going after current or former prominent US officials.\"\n\n\"I think we need to recognize the brazenness of the Iranian regime, including right here in the United States, and I expect that we're going to see more of it and I expect there will be more coming on that,\" Wray said.\n\nCNN has previously reported that US authorities obtained intelligence from a human source in recent weeks on a plot by Iran to try to assassinate Trump, a development that led to the Secret Service increasing security around the former president, multiple people briefed on the matter told CNN. There's no indication that Thomas Matthew Crooks, the would-be assassin who attempted to kill the former president, was connected to the plot, the sources said.\n\nSchiff, in swipe at Trump's felony conviction, praises FBI's ban on hiring felons\n\nDemocratic Rep. Adam Schiff pressed Wray on the agency's hiring standards in an effort to criticize the Republican Party's decision to make Trump, a convicted felon, its 2024 presidential nominee.\n\n\"Do candidates for the FBI have to go through background checks?\" Schiff asked, to which Wray said yes.\n\n\"Would someone with dozens of felony convictions survive a background check for the bureau?\" Schiff said.\n\n\"No,\" Wray replied.\n\n\"So they would never be hired by the bureau?\"\n\n\"No,\" Wray said again.\n\n\"Clearly, the bureau has higher standards for their hiring than one of America's great political parties,\" Schiff said.\n\nTrump was convicted earlier this year on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records as part of a hush money scheme he orchestrated ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee hearing is ongoing.\n\nThis story is breaking and will be updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

He also emphasized the need for the agency to understand what happened at the July 13 Trump campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where Thomas Crooks, who was killed by authorities, shot at Trump, hitting him in the right ear.\n\nWray promised that the agency will \"leave no stone unturned\" in its investigation.\n\nLawmakers grilled Wray throughout Wednesday morning and into the afternoon about the incident, but a number of lawmakers also brought up related and unrelated topics, such as gun control; Jan. 6; diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts; and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nWray revealed that Crooks, using a laptop computer, had Googled \"How far away was Oswald from Kennedy?\" on July 6, a little more than a week before the July 13 attack on Trump's life. The FBI director said that Crooks became \"very focused\" on Trump around that date, though he stressed that the FBI has not yet uncovered Crooks' motivations for trying to kill the former president.\n\nWray also discussed how Crooks' devices showed that the gunman had looked at other political figures, but he stressed that there is no indication that Crooks had another target. He told lawmakers that federal agents found three \"relatively crude\" explosive devices in Crooks' possession -- two in his car and one in his house.\n\nThe FBI director said that Crooks had been flying a drone about 200 yards from the stage where Trump stood and was livestreaming the video about two hours before the Pennsylvania rally began.\n\nHe did not offer insight into whether Crooks was conspiring with anyone else, citing the ongoing nature of the FBI's investigation into the attempted assassination.\n\n\"We're still in early stages, but we have not seen anything so far that would suggest to us that he acted with others,\" Wray said.\n\nThe FBI director blamed \"an uptick in threats about judges ... including a case we helped investigate involving a threat to a sitting Supreme Court justice\" (apparently meaning Justice Brett Kavanaugh) to \"a reflection of a broader phenomenon that we're seeing in this country.\"\n\nWray expressed understanding for those who are \"again very passionate, I respect that; very angry, I respect that. But there is a right way and wrong way to express yourself when you are angry. And violence and threats of violence just can't be it.\"\n\nThe FBI chief clarified that someone at the Butler rally saw Crooks on the roof a \"handful of minutes\" before he began shooting at Trump at about 6:11 p.m. on July 13. According to Wray, it's unclear whether the person could see that Crooks had a gun.\n\nWray also described how a local police officer saw Crooks in a \"prone, shooting position\" on the roof before the gunman turned and faced the officer with his gun \"seconds before the shooter took his shots.\"\n\nThe FBI chief said that local police had also seen the shooter with a range finder \"in a way that was odd and suspicious\" about an hour before Crooks tried to kill Trump.", "source": {"uri": "dailysignal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Signal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mary_margaret_olohan@dailysignal.com", "name": "Mary Margaret Olohan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Experts call that 'ridiculous' ROBERT YOON Associated Press\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment, and tragically the Butler County assassination attempt is another example -- a particularly heinous and public one -- of what I've been talking about,\" Wray said.\n\nThe hearing had been scheduled well before the July 13 shooting as part of the committee's routine oversight of the FBI and the Justice Department, and though lawmakers may touch on a broad array of topics, questions about the shooting are expected to dominate the session.\n\nDespite being appointed by Trump, Wray typically faces antagonistic questions from the Republican-led panel, a reflection of lingering discontent over the FBI's investigation into potential ties between Russia and the 2016 campaign.\n\nThat sentiment was made clear early in the hearing when the panel's Republican chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, told Wray: \"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation.\"\n\nThough the FBI has avoided the same level of scrutiny over the shooting directed at the Secret Service over security failures that preceded the shooting, culminating Tuesday in the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle, Wray is likely to be questioned by lawmakers skeptical of the bureau's assessment that Crooks left behind no obvious ideological motive that could explain his actions.\n\nThe FBI has said it is investigating the shooting, which killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism and an attempted assassination. Trump's campaign said the presumptive GOP nominee was doing \"fine\" after the shooting, which Trump said pierced the upper part of his right ear.\n\nWray and other senior officials privately briefed members of Congress last week, telling them that Crooks had photos on his phone of Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden and other officials and had looked up the dates for the Democratic National Convention as well as Trump's appearances.\n\nA law enforcement official told The Associated Press last week that Crooks had also flown a drone above the rally site before the event in an apparent effort to scope out the scene in advance.\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "pressofatlanticcity.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Press of Atlantic City"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@pressofatlanticcity.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "manuel_balce_ceneta@pressofatlanticcity.com", "name": "Manuel Balce Ceneta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Kennedy assassination on the day he registered for Trump's rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, FBI Director Christopher Wray said today.\n\n\"Analysis of a laptop that the investigation ties to the shooter reveals that on July 6, he did a Google search for -quote - 'how far away was Oswald from Kennedy,'\" Wray said in testimony before the House Judiciary Committee.\n\n\"That is the same day that it appears that he registered for the Butler rally,\" he said, adding that suspect Thomas Crooks had become \"very focused on President Trump and his rally\" at the time.\n\nFormer President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, on Nov. 22, 1963, by Lee Harvey Oswald.\n\nWray said Crooks, a nursing home aide, fired at least eight rounds from his rooftop position near the July 13 rally, wounding the Republican presidential candidate in the ear, killing one rally attendee and wounding two others.\n\nCrooks used an AR-15 assault-style rifle with a collapsible stock, \"which could explain why it might have been less easy for people to observe,\" Wray said.\n\nThe motive for the shooting remains unclear. Wray said many people have described Crooks as a loner and the list of contacts in his phone was short.\n\nWray also told lawmakers that Crooks flew a drone about 200 yards (180 meters) from the stage where Trump spoke to the crowd and live-streamed footage for about 11 minutes, some two hours before the event.\n\nHe said the crude explosive devices recovered from Crooks' car and home were designed to be detonated remotely. Crooks had a transmitter with him at the time of the shooting, Wray added. But he said the FBI believes the suspect would not have been successful had he tried to detonate the devices.\n\nThe hearing also focused on the increasingly tense political atmosphere surrounding the presidential campaign.\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated-threat environment. And tragically, the ... assassination attempt is another example, particularly heinous,\" Wray testified.\n\nKimberly Cheatle resigned as director of the U.S. Secret Service on Tuesday after bipartisan demands to quit over the failure to prevent the attempted assassination.\n\nJudiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan said he expected Wray to answer questions about what happened before, during and after the incident but expressed doubt about the FBI director's answers even before questioning began.\n\n\"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation,\" Jordan said.\n\nRepresentative Jerrold Nadler, the panel's top Democrat, condemned the Trump shooting \"unequivocally and unabashedly\" but pointed to years of political threats and violence, and violent rhetoric from Republicans including Trump himself.\n\n\"If you think that this one assassin's bullet was a bolt out of the blue, and not part of a wave of violence that has threatened this nation for years, then you have missed the point,\" the New York Democrat said.\n\nWray has long faced opposition from hardline Republicans, some angered over the arrest of Trump supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as Congress certified President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@staradvertiser.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

It was the same day he registered to attend the Butler rally.\n\nLee Harvey Oswald shot and killed former President John F. Kennedy Jr. in 1963.\n\nCrooks was flying a drone above the rally site two hours before the shooting and just 200 yards away from the stage, Wray has also revealed.\n\nWray made the bombshell revelation to Congress on Wednesday during a grilling by lawmakers on the investigation into the assassination attempt on the former president and the massive security failures.\n\nCrooks shot Trump in the ear just 400 feet away from the stage in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13 from the roof of a nearby building just outside the security perimeter of the event.\n\nWray revealed that investigators found Crooks had a drone that he used to survey the scene hours before the event started, which was recovered from his car parked nearby.\n\nHe flew the drone around 4 p.m. over the area of the rally close to '200 yards' from the stage to survey the scene. Trump took the stage around 6:03 p.m., over two hours later.\n\nThe FBI has also recovered three 'explosive devices' in possession of Crooks.\n\nThey were 'relatively crude devices' but had the ability 'to be detonated remotely,' Wray said.\n\nThe FBI director also revealed the weapon used had a 'collapsible stock,' which he said 'could explain why it might've been less easy for people to observe.'\n\nHe said Crooks and his family owned a combined 14 guns. He used an AR-style weapon that had been purchased legally by his father.\n\nDramatic new footage shows law enforcement standing over the dead body of Donald Trump 's attempted assassin moments after he was shot dead\n\nWray also confirmed the FBI had recovered three 'explosive devices' in possession of Crooks\n\nWray said eight bullet cartridges had been recovered from the roof where Crooks fired off his shots toward the former president.\n\nAnd he wouldn't rule out that Crooks did not have any accomplices to the crime, saying it's still being looked at by law enforcement.\n\nAs Wray faced questions about why the president was allowed on stage despite the 'threat' being identified 20 minutes before the shots were fired, Wray said, 'we don't know the answer to that.'\n\nBut he insisted his investigation was not focused on the security breach and the Secret Service failures.\n\n'Our investigation is focused on the shooter and all things related to his attack.'\n\nHis hearing comes days after the former Director of Secret Service Kimberly Cheatle was forced to resign after evading answering rounds of questioning by punting to the FBI in another congressional hearing earlier this week.\n\nWray promised his agency would leave 'no stone unturned' and emphasized that he wanted to provide all the information he had at this point of the ongoing investigation.\n\n'The shooter may be deceased but the FBI's investigation is very much ongoing.'\n\nHe also made a reference to the warnings he has been giving Congress for years now about the threats of domestic terrorism.\n\nThe shooting is 'another example, particularly heinous and very public one of what I have been talking about.'\n\nWray again warned about 'passion and heated rhetoric turning into actual violence.'\n\n'We've seen it against public officials of all sorts, we've seen it against law enforcements the number of officers shot and killed in the line of duty is alarming.'\n\n'It's almost every five days that a law enforcement officer is killed in the line of duty, that is an example of the kinds of ways passion and heated rhetoric can bubble over into violence.'\n\nThe Judiciary Committee hearing is expected to focus on both the shooting at the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally and the 'ongoing politicization' of the FBI.\n\nQuestioning on a separate foiled Iranian plot to assassinate Donald Trump is sure to be a topic of contention.\n\nA bombshell report last week revealed the U.S. received intelligence of an Iranian assassination plot in the weeks before Trump was shot at the Pennsylvania rally.\n\nMeanwhile, House Republicans are expected to set up a bipartisan task force to investigate the shooting in a vote this week.\n\nMembers of Congress are expected to demand answers from FBI Director Chris Wray about the Trump assassination attempt on Wednesday\n\nThe FBI and Secret Service revealed to lawmakers last week they spotted shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks as a person of interest a full 62 minutes before he fired a shot.\n\nTwenty minutes passed between the time Secret Service agents spotted Crooks with a gun on the rooftop and he fired shots at the president.\n\nIn a staggering moment, Cheatle admitted on Monday her agents on the ground were warned between two and five times that there was a 'suspicious person' reported before Trump took the stage.\n\nWhile Trump walked around with little more than a bloody ear, Crooks killed former fire chief Corey Comperatore, 50, and critically injured two other rally goers sitting close to where the former president was speaking last weekend before he was neutralized.\n\nThe security chief had faced mounting questions over why an agent was not stationed on the roof from where gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire on the former president, and why Trump was allowed to take the stage even when a threat was detected.\n\nShe had also been ridiculed for suggesting her agency did not have a presence on the roof because it was 'sloped.'\n\nThe 20-year-old shooter Crooks, was able to get within 160 yards of the stage where the former president was speaking when he opened fire. The building on which he stood was outside the security perimeter, despite clearly being within rifle shooting range.\n\nAnd that was despite the FBI learning of a threat on Trump's life from Iran leading to a bump in security for the former president in the days before the July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nCheatle said she believed she was the 'best person' to lead the Secret Service at this time, but later acquiesced to the bipartisan demands for her resignation.\n\nOn the day of the rally, Trump walked out onto the stage at 6:02 p.m.\n\nThen at around 6:12 p.m. Crooks' first shots rang out.\n\nCheatle could not tell lawmakers how the shooter had gotten onto the roof.\n\nAt the time of the shooting, law enforcement agents were inside the building, 147 yards away from where Trump stood, but not on top of it.\n\nCheatle curiously claimed no officers had been placed on the roof because it was sloped.\n\n'That building in particular has a sloped roof at its highest point. And so, you know, there's a safety factor that would be considered there that we wouldn't want to put somebody up on a sloped roof,' she told ABC News in an interview Tuesday.\n\nComer said on Fox News Sunday the hearing would go on for six hours and Cheatle would face 'hundreds of questions'\n\n'And so, you know, the decision was made to secure the building, from inside.'\n\nWhat transpired instead was a security nightmare: Thomas Matthew Crooks was able to scale the building and secure his own position, while law enforcement struggled to locate him even amid pressing warnings from members of the Trump crowd. But there wasn't sufficient time to act on the tips, she explained.\n\n'The shooter was actually identified as a potential person of suspicion,' Cheatle said. 'Unfortunately, with the rapid succession of how things unfolded, by the time that individual was eventually located, they were on the rooftop and were able to fire off at the former president.'\n\nShe was referencing claims by witnesses that they alerted law enforcement about the threat, but agents weren't able to eliminate the threat in time. Officials have pointed to the initial responding officer, who lifted himself up on the roof only to lower himself back when the gunman turned his weapon at him.\n\nCheatle has take blame for the fateful security breach, but has denied calls to step down.\n\n'The buck stops with me,' she said.\n\n'It was unacceptable,' she told ABC. 'And it's something that shouldn't happen again.'\n\n'While we give overwhelming thanks to the individual Secret Service agents who did their jobs under immense pressure, this tragedy was preventable. The Secret Service has a zero fail mission, but it failed on July 13 and in the days leading up to the rally,' Comer is also expected to say, as he will again call for Cheatle's resignation.\n\nAlso coming into question on the call was the possible motive for Crooks to commit such an atrocity.\n\nOfficials did not confirm an operating motive and said that his rationale remains a mystery.\n\nAuthorities said that they have yet to find any ideological material that could shine light on why Crooks decided to shoot the former president.\n\nBut, they did reveal that Crooks operated several accounts on encrypted platforms that they are still working to gain access to.\n\nHere's a timeline of how that fateful July 11 went down:\n\n1PM\n\nThe grounds to the event at Butler Farm Show opened at 1pm.\n\nIt began an hours-long build up that saw MAGA supporters immediately pour into the area to camp out.\n\nSecurity swept the area and set up perimeters, however questions have been raised over how the gunman was able to secure a clear shot just 400ft from the stage.\n\n5PM\n\nAn hour before Trump took the stage at approximately 5pm, former GOP Senate candidate Sean Parnell warmed up the crowd, bringing cheers as he slammed President Biden and his stuttering campaign.\n\nWith the sun still high on a bright day, Trump emerged to 'God Bless the USA' playing over the loudspeakers at 6:03pm, and remained waving and shaking his fist at the crowd for several minutes.\n\n6:11PM\n\nTrump brought out a large graphic with statistics on the migrant crisis at the southern border, and told the crowd at 6:11pm: 'That chart's a couple of months old...'\n\n'If you want to really see something that's sad, take a look at what happened,' Trump continued - before he abruptly grabbed the side of his head as several 'pops' filled the event space.\n\n6:12PM\n\nThe 78-year-old dropped to the floor in an instant as five more shots rang overhead in quick succession, before four Secret Service agents raced to the stage and dove on top of the former president.\n\nStunning images showed Trump cowered on the floor as agents protected him, with blood dripping down his cheek.\n\nSeveral more Secret Service agents continued to flood the stage, while four heavily armed officers lined the perimeter ordering attendees to 'get down.'\n\nThe sniper, sat 400ft across from the rally on an exposed rooftop, fired another shot at the stage a second later while Trump fans streamed out of the bleachers.\n\nSecret Service scrambled to take control of the pandemonium where three attendees were hit, one fatally, within a matter of seconds.\n\n6:13PM\n\nAn emergency room doctor with blood spattered on his shirt later said he sprang into action to perform emergency CPR on one victim.\n\n'The guy had spun around was jammed between the benches and a head shot here. There's lots of blood and he had brain matter,' he told CBS News.\n\n'So I got him together so I got people there really helpful. I did CPR chest compressions as well.'\n\n6:14PM\n\nMicrophones surrounding the stage picked up staggering detail of the urgent response, beginning with one ordering screaming people to 'get down, get down, get down.'\n\nAt the same moment, snipers set up on a roof next to bleachers were seen firing back at the gunman, with Secret Service agents surrounding Trump heard on microphones confirming the moment he was brought down.\n\nDespite the chaos flying around the scene, the rally appeared to hold its breath to see if Trump was hit.\n\nA blood-spattered Donald Trump pumped his fist after being shot in the ear by a sniper, eight minutes after he took the stage at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania\n\nIn a move that sparked iconic images set to define his candidacy, Trump stood up and triumphantly held his fist in the air, pumping it at his supporters to raucous relief.\n\n'USA, USA, USA,' the crowd chanted at the sight, with a blood-spattered Trump appearing to mouth the word 'fight' several times as Secret Service tried to hurry him away.\n\nWhile getting up off the floor, an agent picked up a white cloth and held it to Trump's bleeding ear, telling him to 'hold that on your head, it's bloody.'\n\n'Are we good?' one male agent says, as another responds quickly: 'Shooter down!'\n\n'Shooter's down. Are we good to move?' one says next. 'We're clear, we're clear, we're clear - let's move.'\n\nTrump repeatedly ordered the agents to 'let me get my shoes', to which one responds: 'I got you sir, I got you.'\n\nThe gunman was killed by agents shortly after opening fire, as footage emerged online showing him appear to be shot in the head while crouched on the roof.\n\nCrooks was seen laying lifeless on the rooftop in a later image, surrounded by law enforcement stood over him.\n\nA number of camouflaged law enforcement officers emerged from the side of the stage, part of a huge law enforcement presence that flooded the area within minutes of the first shot was fired.\n\nAt 6:14pm, Trump was whisked into his motorcade by around dozen Secret Service agents, who formed a protective human shield around him.\n\nBefore he got into his SUV, Trump again raised his fist to signify triumphantly surviving the assassination attempt.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Instead, he climbed onto the roof using some mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping.\n\nWray also said Crooks's AR-style gun had a collapsible stock which may explain why he was not seen by rally-goers or members of law enforcement with the weapon before the shooting.\n\nHe said Crooks visited the rally site on at least three occasions: about a week before the shooting, for about 70 minutes on the morning of the rally and again that afternoon.\n\nHe purchased 50 rounds of ammunition on the day of the attack and visited a shooting range the previous day.\n\ncl/aha", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_lefkow@reformer.com", "name": "Chris Lefkow", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Experts call that 'ridiculous' ROBERT YOON Associated Press\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment, and tragically the Butler County assassination attempt is another example -- a particularly heinous and public one -- of what I've been talking about,\" Wray said.\n\nThe hearing had been scheduled well before the July 13 shooting as part of the committee's routine oversight of the FBI and the Justice Department, and though lawmakers may touch on a broad array of topics, questions about the shooting are expected to dominate the session.\n\nDespite being appointed by Trump, Wray typically faces antagonistic questions from the Republican-led panel, a reflection of lingering discontent over the FBI's investigation into potential ties between Russia and the 2016 campaign.\n\nThat sentiment was made clear early in the hearing when the panel's Republican chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, told Wray: \"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation.\"\n\nThough the FBI has avoided the same level of scrutiny over the shooting directed at the Secret Service over security failures that preceded the shooting, culminating Tuesday in the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle, Wray is likely to be questioned by lawmakers skeptical of the bureau's assessment that Crooks left behind no obvious ideological motive that could explain his actions.\n\nThe FBI has said it is investigating the shooting, which killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism and an attempted assassination. Trump's campaign said the presumptive GOP nominee was doing \"fine\" after the shooting, which Trump said pierced the upper part of his right ear.\n\nWray and other senior officials privately briefed members of Congress last week, telling them that Crooks had photos on his phone of Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden and other officials and had looked up the dates for the Democratic National Convention as well as Trump's appearances.\n\nA law enforcement official told The Associated Press last week that Crooks had also flown a drone above the rally site before the event in an apparent effort to scope out the scene in advance.\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "qctimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Quad-City Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@qctimes.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "manuel_balce_ceneta@qctimes.com", "name": "Manuel Balce Ceneta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NorthPark_Mall_(Iowa)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NorthPark Mall (Iowa)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Instead, he climbed onto the roof using some mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping.\n\nWray also said Crooks's AR-style gun had a collapsible stock which may explain why he was not seen by rally-goers or members of law enforcement with the weapon before the shooting.\n\nHe said Crooks visited the rally site on at least three occasions: about a week before the shooting, for about 70 minutes on the morning of the rally and again that afternoon.\n\nHe purchased 50 rounds of ammunition on the day of the attack and visited a shooting range the previous day.\n\ncl/aha\n\nMore from this section\n\nSalt Lake City celebrates announcement that it will host the 2034 Winter Olympics\n\niMyFone VoxBox TTS Voice AI Launches Video Dubbing Feature\n\nPromoting the Value of Drug-Free Living at the UEFA Championship Games", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy in 1963.\n\nWray said the government's probe was ongoing and that investigators were still assessing the motive of the gunman, who was shot and killed by the Secret Service after he fired eight rounds, wounding the former president in his right ear and killing an attendee. He said Crooks appears to have been \"interested in public figures more broadly.\"\n\n\"So far we have not found any evidence of any accomplices or co-conspirators, foreign or domestic,\" Wray told the House Judiciary Committee. Based on the short list of contacts on Crooks' phone, the description of him as a loner appears to be accurate, Wray added.\n\n\"I want to assure you and the American people that the men and women of the FBI will continue to work tirelessly to get to the bottom of what happened,\" he told the committee.\n\nIntense Hearings\n\nWray's testimony comes two days after Kimberly Cheatle, who was head of the Secret Service at the time of the shooting, appeared before the House Oversight Committee, resigning on Tuesday after an intense grilling about the security failure. In addition to the FBI's investigation, lawmakers have launched probes of their own. Crooks' ability to access a rooftop with a clear line of sight to Trump, the Republican nominee in this year's presidential race, has sparked searing bipartisan criticism but has also become a political talking point in a fiery election campaign.\n\nU.S. officials have said Crooks climbed up on a roof within sight of the outdoor stage in Butler, Pennsylvania, and fired a semi-automatic rifle, injuring Trump, killing firefighter Corey Comperatore as he shielded his family with his body, and gravely wounding two others. A Secret Service sharpshooter then killed Crooks. On Wednesday, Wray testified that Crooks got to the roof using mechanical equipment on the ground and pipes on the building.\n\nThe FBI has said its investigation so far indicates Crooks wasn't known to the bureau before the attack and that technicians had accessed his phone and were analyzing his electronic devices.\n\n\"Starting somewhere around July 6th or so, he became very focused on former President Trump and this rally,\" Wray told the committee. He said analysis of a laptop that the investigation has tied to Crooks revealed that he did the Google search on Oswald and Kennedy on July 6.\n\n\"That was the same day it appears he registered for the Butler rally,\" Wray said.\n\n'Rearview Mirror'\n\nHe said Crooks went to Butler a week before the rally and then on the morning of the event and again in the afternoon.\n\nAuthorities think Crooks flew the drone in the area about two hours before the shooting. Wray said the FBI has reverse-engineered the drone's flight path and found that Crooks might have had a vantage point showing what was behind him, \"almost like giving him a rearview mirror.\"\n\nHe said Crooks had two \"relatively crude\" explosive devices in his car that could be remotely detonated from the roof.

Kennedy by lone gunman Lee Harvey Oswald.\n\n\"On July 6, he did a Google search for - quote - 'how far away was Oswald from Kennedy,' \" Wray said.\n\n\"That's obviously significant in terms of his state of mind,\" Wray added. \"That is the same day that he registered for the Butler rally.\"\n\nSeven days later, on July 13, Crooks climbed onto a roof overlooking the campaign rally in western Pennsylvania and fired at least eight shots from an AR-style assault rifle, leaving Trump with a bloody ear while killing a rallygoer and injuring two others.\n\nCrooks, who was killed by a U.S. Secret Service sniper, also carried a remote detonator for two explosive devices left in his car, though the FBI director said the receivers had not been activated and likely would not have gone off had he tried to activate them.\n\n\"What else he had in mind is something that I think is very much an open question,\" Wray told the House Judiciary Committee. \"We'd love to have a road map that tells us exactly what he was thinking. We haven't found that yet.\"\n\nWhat investigators have found, Wray said, is evidence that the shooter had developed a fascination with high-profile figures, using his mobile phone to get more information.\n\n\"The shooter appears to have done a lot of searches of public figures in general ... news articles and things like that,\" Wray said, adding that images of high-profile officials and politicians found on the shooter's phone were linked to the articles.\n\n\"This does not appear to be some sort of target list,\" he said. \"There doesn't seem to be a lot of rhyme or reason to it so far, other than that these are all prominent public people.\"\n\nBy July 6, however, that fascination had morphed into a fixation.\n\n\"In the period around July 6, leading up to July 13, he does seem to have become very focused on this particular rally and former President Trump,\" Wray said. \"But exactly what his thought process was in doing that, that's something that's still very much under investigation.\"\n\nOther searches of the shooter's mobile phone and electronic devices have so far not provided any additional insight into Crooks' mindset.\n\nWray said the investigation had failed to turn up any evidence of a political ideology or a manifesto, nor have investigators come across any indication that the shooter had help or that he alerted anyone else to his plans.\n\n\"So far, we have not found any evidence of any accomplices or co-conspirators, foreign or domestic,\" Wray said, adding the investigation appeared to confirm accounts that Crooks was a loner.\n\n\"His list of contacts, for example, is very short compared to what you would normally see from most people. It doesn't appear to be a whole lot of interaction between him, face-to-face or digital, with a lot of people,\" he said.\n\nStill, Wray cautioned that the FBI had not been able to access all of the shooter's social media accounts and that investigators might never get past some of the passwords and encryption.\n\nU.S. lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, have repeatedly expressed outrage in the days since the shooting, leading to Tuesday's resignation of the director of the U.S. Secret Service, the agency responsible for providing security to current and former presidents and their families.\n\nThe now former director, Kimberly Cheatle, drew additional ire from lawmakers the day before she resigned, repeatedly refusing to answer questions about the attempted assassination while calling the event the \"most significant operational failure ... in decades.\"\n\nThe FBI's Wray on Wednesday took a different tack, assuring lawmakers that the bureau would \"leave no stone unturned\" in its investigation, while committing to provide as much information as possible.\n\n\"We need to know what happened play by play, moment by moment, second by second,\" said Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan.\n\n\"A significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation,\" the Republican lawmaker said, accusing the law enforcement agency of what he described as multiple failures over the past several years.\n\nDuring the more than three hours of testimony, the FBI's Wray confirmed reports that the shooter had flown a drone at the site of campaign rally about two hours before the event got underway.\n\nHe said the flight path took the drone over an area about 180 meters from the stage where Trump was to speak, and that it appeared the drone livestreamed video.\n\nHowever, the camera appeared to have been pointing away from the podium.\n\n\"We think it would have shown him what would have been behind him [on the roof],\" Wray said. \"Like, it's almost like giving him a rear-view mirror of the scene behind him.\"\n\nWray also said investigators had determined the shooter visited the rally site at least three times.\n\nThe first visit, which came a week before the shooting, lasted 20 minutes. A second visit, which lasted 70 minutes, took place the morning of the shooting. And the final visit was the afternoon of the shooting, when Crooks arrived and waited to carry out the attempted assassination.\n\nYet for all that investigators think they know after digging into the shooter's social media and communications, and after more than 400 interviews, Wray said there were other questions that had yet to be answered.\n\nOne of those questions is how Crooks got up on the roof of the building overlooking the rally.\n\nInvestigators found a receipt showing he had bought a 1.5-meter ladder, but that it was never brought to the scene of the shooting.\n\nWray said there was also still confusion about whether the shooter had placed the rifle on the roof before the shooting or had carried it up with him right before he started firing.\n\n\"The weapon had a collapsible stock, which might explain why it was less easy to observe,\" Wray said, noting that the first sighting by law enforcement officers of the shooter actually holding the gun came just seconds before the first shots rang out.", "source": {"uri": "eurasiareview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eurasia Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

On July 13, Crooks fired at Trump from the roof of a nearby building located just outside the event's security perimeter in Butler, Pennsylvania, hitting Trump in the ear from a distance of only 400 feet. He was shot dead by a Secret Service sniper the very next moment.\n\nShocking Revelations\n\nWray revealed that investigators found Crooks had used a drone to survey the rally site hours before the event, with the drone found in his nearby parked car. The drone was flown around 4 p.m., about 200 yards from the stage, to inspect the area.\n\nTrump appeared on stage around 6:03 p.m., more than two hours later.\n\nThe FBI also recovered three \"explosive devices\" from Crooks.

Kennedy from a sniper's perch in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.\n\nThe revelation to the House Judiciary Committee was part of a collection of new details offered by Wray about the July 13 shooting at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The FBI's investigation has thrust the bureau into a political maelstrom months before the presidential election, with lawmakers and the public pressing for details about what may have motivated Crooks in the most serious attempt to assassinate a president or presidential candidate since President Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981.\n\nCardinals' TV ratings on record-low pace amid continuing distribution problems: Media Views Tammie Holland, longtime St. Louis radio personality, dies at 53 Third bear sighting reported in southern Illinois, sheriff says New St. Louis Public Schools communications chief also lives in Texas St. Louis Public Schools halts hiring over questions on new administrator from Texas Former St. Louis Rams lineman ordered to pay $500,000 to injured worker Kohn's Kosher Deli facing lawsuit of nearly $150,000 O'Fallon, Mo., woman charged with making politically motivated false child sex abuse claim Creve Coeur-based nursing home operator files for bankruptcy Woman from Valley Park drowns in Big River trying to help another canoeist Messenger: A disturbing twist in the case of security guards who tackled BJC patient BenFred: Smart contract stance lets Cardinals be nimble as Goldschmidt tries to salvage season Ankle injury interrupts Tommy Edman's rehab games, delays his return: Cardinals Extra MSD's recently retired CEO was paid more than $100,000 for unused vacation, sick time BenFred: So, you're looking to trade with the Cardinals. Who are you (realistically) targeting?\n\nThe FBI has built out a detailed timeline of Crooks' movements and online activity, but the precise motive -- or why Trump was singled out -- remains elusive, Wray said.\n\n\"A lot of the usual repositories of information have not yielded, anything notable in terms of motive or ideology,\" Wray said. He did note that Crooks had grown interested in public officials -- besides Trump, Crooks also had photos on his phone of Democratic President Joe Biden and other prominent figures -- and in the days before the shooting had appeared particularly consumed by Trump, the Republicans' White House nominee.\n\nWray also said that Crooks, about two hours before the shooting, had flown a drone about 200 yards (180 meters) from the rally stage where Trump would later stand and that Crooks used the device to livestream and watch footage. The use of the drone so close the rally site just hours before Trump took the stage for the rally add to the questions about the security lapses preceding the event.\n\nWray pledged to lawmakers that the FBI would \"leave no stone unturned\" in its investigation.\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment, and tragically the Butler County assassination attempt is another example -- a particularly heinous and public one -- of what I've been talking about,\" Wray said.\n\nThe hearing had been scheduled well before the shooting, as part of the committee's routine oversight of the FBI and the Justice Department. Questions about the shooting dominated the session.\n\nDespite being appointed by Trump, Wray typically faces antagonistic questions from the Republican-led panel, a reflection of lingering discontent over the FBI's investigation into potential ties between Russia and the 2016 campaign, when Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThat sentiment was made clear early in the hearing when the committee chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told Wray: \"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation.\"\n\nThe FBI so far has avoided the same level of scrutiny over the shooting directed at the Secret Service over security failures that preceded the shooting and has led to the the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle,\n\nThe FBI has said it is investigating the shooting, which killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism and an attempted assassination. Trump's campaign said the presumptive GOP nominee was doing \"fine\" after the shooting, which Trump said pierced the upper part of his right ear.\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@stltoday.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "manuel_balce_ceneta@stltoday.com", "name": "Manuel Balce Ceneta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Instead, he climbed onto the roof using some mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping.\n\nWray also said Crooks's AR-style gun had a collapsible stock which may explain why he was not seen by rallygoers or members of law enforcement with the weapon before the shooting.\n\nHe said Crooks visited the rally site on at least three occasions, about a week before the shooting, for about 70 minutes on the morning of the rally and again that afternoon.\n\ncl/sst", "source": {"uri": "wfxg.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFXG FOX54"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Mr Wray said many people have described Crooks as a loner and the list of contacts in his phone was short.\n\nMr Wray also told lawmakers that Crooks flew a drone about 180m from the stage where Trump spoke to the crowd and live-streamed footage for about 11 minutes, some two hours before the event.\n\nHe said the crude explosive devices recovered from Crooks' car and home were designed to be detonated remotely. Crooks had a transmitter with him at the time of the shooting, Mr Wray added. But he said the FBI believes the suspect would not have been successful had he tried to detonate the devices.\n\nThe hearing also focused on the increasingly tense political atmosphere surrounding the presidential campaign.\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated-threat environment. And tragically, the... assassination attempt is another example, particularly heinous,\" Mr Wray testified.\n\nMs Kimberly Cheatle resigned as director of the US Secret Service on July 23, after bipartisan demands to quit over the failure to prevent the attempted assassination.\n\nJudiciary Committee chairman Jim Jordan said he expected Mr Wray to answer questions about what happened before, during and after the incident but expressed doubt about the FBI director's answers even before questioning began.\n\n\"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy scepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation,\" Mr Jordan said.\n\nRepresentative Jerrold Nadler, the panel's top Democrat, condemned the Trump shooting \"unequivocally and unabashedly\", but pointed to years of political threats and violence, and violent rhetoric from Republicans including Trump himself.\n\n\"If you think that this one assassin's bullet was a bolt out of the blue, and not part of a wave of violence that has threatened this nation for years, then you have missed the point,\" the New York Democrat said.\n\nMr Wray has long faced opposition from hardline Republicans, some angered over the arrest of Trump supporters who stormed the US Capitol on Jan 6, 2021, as Congress certified President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.

Two other attendees were critically injured.\n\nMr Wray said Crooks was a \"fairly avid shooting hobbyist\" who had visited a range the day before the assassination attempt.\n\nHe said the gunman had bought a ladder ahead of the shooting, but it was not found at the scene and it is unclear how Crooks got on to the roof.\n\nThe FBI director said there is no evidence \"so far\" that Crooks had any accomplices or co-conspirators.\n\nThe revelation comes the day after the director of the US Secret Service resigned after admitting responsibility for the \"security lapse\" that led to the attempt on Trump's life.\n\nKimberly Cheatle, who led the agency for almost two years, emailed staff on Tuesday to announce she was resigning over the incident.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "susie_coen@aol.co.uk", "name": "Susie Coen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

It doesn't appear to be a whole lot of interaction between him, face-to-face or digital with a lot of people,\" he said.\n\nStill, Wray cautioned that the FBI has not been able to access all of the shooter's social media accounts and that investigators ultimately may never get past some of the passwords and encryption.\n\nU.S. lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, have repeatedly expressed outrage in the days and weeks since the July 13 shooting, leading to Tuesday's resignation of the director of the U.S. Secret Service, the agency responsible for providing security to current and former presidents and their families.\n\nThe now former director, Kimberly Cheatle, drew additional ire from lawmakers the day before she resigned, repeatedly refusing to answer questions about the attempted assassination while calling the event, \"most significant operational failure ... in decades.\"\n\nThe FBI's Wray on Wednesday took a different tact, assuring lawmakers that the bureau will \"leave no stone unturned\" in its investigation, while committing to provide as much information as possible.\n\n\"We need to know what happened play-by-play, moment-by-moment, second-by-second,\" said the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Republican Representative Jim Jordan.\n\n\"A significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation,\" he said, accusing the law enforcement agency of what he described as multiple failures over the past several years.\n\nDuring the more than three hours of testimony, the FBI's Wray confirmed reports that the shooter had flown a drone at the site of campaign rally about two hours before the event got underway.\n\nHe said the flight path took the drone over an area about 180 meters (200 yards) from the stage where former President Trump was to speak, and that it appears the drone livestreamed video.\n\nHowever, the camera appears to have been pointing away from the podium.\n\n\"We think it would have shown him what would have been behind him [on the roof],\" Wray said. \"Like, it's almost like giving him a rearview mirror of the scene behind him.\"\n\nWray also said the investigators have determined the shooter visited the site of the rally at least three times.\n\nThe first visit, which came a week before the shooting, lasted 20 minutes. A second visit, which lasted 70 minutes, took place the morning of the shooting. And the final visit was the afternoon of the shooting, when Crooks arrived and waited to carry out the attempted assassination.\n\nYet for all that investigators think they know after digging into the shooter's social media and communications, and after more than 400 interviews, Wray said there are other questions that have yet to be answered.\n\nOne of those questions is how Crooks got up on the roof of the building overlooking the rally.\n\nInvestigators found a receipt showing he had bought a 1.5-meter-tall (5 feet) ladder, but that it was never brought to the scene of the shooting.\n\nWray said there is also still some confusion over whether the shooter had managed to place the rifle on the roof before the shooting or whether he carried it up with him right before he started firing.\n\n\"The weapon had a collapsible stock which might explain why it was less easy to observe,\" Wray said.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of America"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

It doesn't appear to be a whole lot of interaction between him, face-to-face or digital with a lot of people,\" he said.\n\nStill, Wray cautioned that the FBI has not been able to access all of the shooter's social media accounts and that investigators ultimately may never get past some of the passwords and encryption.\n\nU.S. lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, have repeatedly expressed outrage in the days and weeks since the July 13 shooting, leading to Tuesday's resignation of the director of the U.S. Secret Service, the agency responsible for providing security to current and former presidents and their families.\n\nThe now former director, Kimberly Cheatle, drew additional ire from lawmakers the day before she resigned, repeatedly refusing to answer questions about the attempted assassination while calling the event, \"most significant operational failure ... in decades.\"\n\nThe FBI's Wray on Wednesday took a different tact, assuring lawmakers that the bureau will \"leave no stone unturned\" in its investigation, while committing to provide as much information as possible.\n\n'We need to know what happened play-by-play, moment-by-moment, second-by-second,' said the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Republican Representative Jim Jordan.\n\n'A significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation,' he said, accusing the law enforcement agency of what he described as multiple failures over the past several years.\n\nDuring the more than three hours of testimony, the FBI's Wray confirmed reports that the shooter had flown a drone at the site of campaign rally about two hours before the event got underway.\n\nHe said the flight path took the drone over an area about 180 meters (200 yards) from the stage where former President Trump was to speak, and that it appears the drone livestreamed video.\n\nHowever, the camera appears to have been pointing away from the podium.\n\n'We think it would have shown him what would have been behind him [on the roof],\" Wray said. \"Like, it's almost like giving him a rearview mirror of the scene behind him.\"\n\nWray also said the investigators have determined the shooter visited the site of the rally at least three times.\n\nFILE - The Butler Farm Show, site of a rally for Republican Donald Trump, is seen July 15, 2024 in Butler, Pa. Trump was wounded July 13 at the rally; a shooter reportedly was atop the building farthest to the right in the cluster of buildings at left.\n\nThe first visit, which came a week before the shooting, lasted 20 minutes. A second visit, which lasted 70 minutes, took place the morning of the shooting. And the final visit was the afternoon of the shooting, when Crooks arrived and waited to carry out the attempted assassination.\n\nYet for all that investigators think they know after digging into the shooter's social media and communications, and after more than 400 interviews, Wray said there are other questions that have yet to be answered.\n\nOne of those questions is how Crooks got up on the roof of the building overlooking the rally.\n\nInvestigators found a receipt showing he had bought a 1.5-meter-tall (5 feet) ladder, but that it was never brought to the scene of the shooting.\n\nWray said there is also still some confusion over whether the shooter had managed to place the rifle on the roof before the shooting or whether he carried it up with him right before he started firing.\n\n\"The weapon had a collapsible stock which might explain why it was less easy to observe,' Wray said.", "source": {"uri": "kenyastar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kenya Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy, and used a rifle with a collapsible stock that may have made it easier for him to disguise the weapon before climbing onto a roof, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray said Wednesday.\n\nThe 20-year-old gunman, who was killed by a Secret Service sniper after he opened fire during the July 13 campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, searched for answers to \"how far away was Oswald from Kennedy,\" Wray said - a reference to the assassin who used a rifle to kill President John F. Kennedy in Dallas in 1963.\n\n\"That's a search that's obviously significant in terms of his state of mind,\" Wray said at a House Judiciary Committee hearing where he answered hours of questions about the attack on Trump, the Republican presidential nominee. \"He was interested in public figures and - I think this is important - starting around July 6 or so, he became very focused on former president Trump and this rally.\"\n\nThat same day, Wray said, the gunman also registered to attend the outdoor rally.\n\n\"There's a whole lot of work underway and still a lot of work to do,\" Wray said. \"The shooter may be deceased, but the FBI's investigation is very much ongoing.\"\n\nThe hearing was scheduled before the attempted assassination, but the attack has dominated the discussion as officials worry about political violence in a presidential election year.\n\nThomas Matthew Crooks, who lived about an hour away in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, fired at Trump from a rooftop just outside the rally security perimeter, using an AR-style rifle. One rallygoer was killed, two others were critically injured, and Trump suffered a graze wound to his ear.\n\nThe security lapses that afforded the gunman a sightline to Trump on the rally stage have prompted multiple investigations of the U.S. Secret Service, whose director resigned Tuesday under pressure from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers.\n\nFBI investigators have said so far that the gunman did not appear to have any discernible ideology, suggesting he was not motivated primarily by political animosity.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who chairs the Judiciary Committee, is a longtime Trump ally and critic of Wray, the FBI and the Justice Department. He began the hearing by criticizing what he called \"the Biden-Harris Justice Department\" - an acknowledgment that Vice President Harris is now running for the Democratic nomination after President Biden announced he would not seek a second term.\n\nWray, who was nominated to lead the FBI in 2017 by then-President Trump, avoided discussing the security shortcomings that preceded the attack, saying those issues are under review by an inspector general and an outside group of experts.\n\nThe gunman's weapon was bought legally in 2013 by his father, who later sold it to his son, the FBI director testified.\n\nThe weapon had a collapsible stock, Wray said, meaning the gunman might have been able to hide it from view while carrying it before the attack. Wray noted that witnesses at the rally reported seeing a man with a gun on the rooftop, but not earlier, which might be explained by the collapsible stock.\n\nThe FBI director also confirmed a number of details from the investigation that have been publicly reported already, including that there were eight spent bullet casings found near the gunman's body - indicating that he fired at least that many times.\n\nThe director also described how Crooks apparently used a drone hours before the shooting to examine the area near the rally, but not directly overhead.\n\n\"The drone was recovered in his vehicle,\" Wray testified. \"The shooter was flying the drone around the area, not over the stage. ... We think that he was live-streaming, viewing the footage for about 11 minutes, about 200 yards away.\"\n\nTwo explosive devices were found in the shooter's car, items that Wray called \"relatively crude devices themselves, but they did have the ability to be detonated remotely.\"\n\nBecause the remotely controlled devices attached to the homemade bombs were left in the \"off\" position, Wray said, it appears \"that if he had tried to detonate those devices from the roof, it would not have worked.\"\n\nTechnical experts at the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, were able to crack open the gunman's phone within two days of the attack. While they found some evidence of interest, the device did not provide an explanation for his motive, people familiar with the investigation have said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe the ongoing case.\n\nThe gunman used some encrypted messaging applications, which Wray said have \"unfortunately now become very commonplace\" in FBI investigations, as popular messaging software often includes encryption.\n\nAsked whether the FBI believed there were any accomplices or co-conspirators in the shooting, Wray answered, \"Not at this time, but again the investigation is ongoing.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy shooting from his laptop and flew a drone in the area near the rally just two hours before the former president took the stage on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania, FBI Director Christopher Wray said Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the FBI's analysis of Thomas Matthew Crooks' laptop, Crooks searched how far Lee Harvey Oswald was when he shot and killed President John F. Kennedy in 1963.\n\nThe search was on July 6, the same day the Trump rally was announced.\n\n\"On July 6, he did a Google search for: 'how far away was Oswald from Kennedy,'\" Wray told the House Judiciary Committee.\n\n\"That's a search that's obviously significant in terms of his state of mind,\" the FBI director added. \"That is the same day that it appears that he registered for the Butler rally.\"\n\nShooter flew drone just 2 hours before Trump took the stage\n\nSpeaking to the House Judiciary Committee, Wray revealed that \"around 4 p.m.,\" the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, \"was flying the drone around the area\" of the rally, approximately 200 yards from the stage.\n\nThe drone was in the air for approximately 11 minutes, and investigators believe Crooks watched a live feed from the drone on his phone. CNN previously reported that the drone was found in his car following the shooting.\n\nIn addition, Crooks had two explosives in his car at the time of the shooting and one in his home, but likely did not have the ability to detonate them from the roof where he was killed, Wray testified.\n\n\"It looks like because of the on/off position on the receivers, that if he had tried to detonate those devices from the roof, it would not have worked,\" Wray said.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the shooting as both an attempted assassination and as a potential act of domestic terrorism.\n\nGun had a collapsable stock and was purchased from shooter's father\n\nInvestigators say that Crooks fired approximately eight times from an AR-style rifle at the former president before being killed by a US Secret Service counter sniper.\n\nThe rifle Crooks used was purchased from his father, Wray testified.\n\n\"The weapon that he used for the attempted assassination was an AR-style rifle that was purchased legally, that he - as my understanding - acquired, I think bought actually from his father, who was the one who originally bought it,\" Wray said.\n\nPreviously, officials said they believed the firearm belonged to Crooks' father - not the shooter - and they didn't know how Crooks accessed the weapon.\n\nFBI officials have repeatedly asserted that they believe Crooks acted alone, and Wray reiterated that there is no evidence of any co-conspirators.\n\n\"I have been saying some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment,\" Wray said. \"The shooter may be deceased but the FBI's investigation is ongoing.\"\n\nInvestigators have gone through the shooter's phone and computer, scoured his search history and bedroom and have interviewed his family and friends, but have struggled to identify what motivated the 20-year-old would be assassin to act.\n\nCrooks also had no prior contacts with the FBI, officials say, and had not been previously on their radar or databases.\n\nShooter was searching for news stories\n\nWray pushed back against reports that Crooks searched for images of specific prominent public officials online, saying that it appears he was actually searching for news articles.\n\n\"The shooter appears to have done a lot of searches of public figures in general, but so far we are seeing kind of news articles and things like that,\" Wray said. He continued, \"so the images that have been reported about, really what we are talking about there are when you do a news search of an article the image appears in a cache as opposed to like a search for that specific individual.\"\n\nThe FBI director cautioned that the effort to uncover Crooks' motive is ongoing, but warned that \"it is, quite frankly, a dangerous time to be a prominent public official.\"\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee hearing is ongoing.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Wray also said that based on the evidence that has been gathered, Crooks flew the drone about 200 yards away from the stage roughly two others before Trump took the stage. He also confirmed that Crooks had some \"relatively crude\" explosive devices in his vehicle and home. Wray said that the devices had remote detonation capabilities but added that the transmitters appeared to have been in an off-state. Wray was clear during the opening questions that this is an ongoing investigation and that the context of information can change over time.\n\nWray was also quick to address the scope of the FBI investigation noting that it is focused more on the actions and motivations of the gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks, and not the Secret Service's response and decision-making.\n\n\"Obviously I understand very much the intense interest and focus on the Secret Service's performance, actions, decision-making, etc.,\" said Wray. \"There are two separate after-action reviews.

Lynch\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -The 20-year-old gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump did an online search of the John F. Kennedy assassination around the time he began to focus attention on the Republican presidential candidate, FBI Director Christopher Wray said on Wednesday.\n\nWray told the U.S. House Judiciary Committee that suspect Thomas Crooks visited the Trump rally site in Butler, Pennsylvania, twice before he clambered onto the roof of a nearby building on July 13 and fired off at least eight rounds, wounding Trump in the ear, killing one rally-goer and injuring two others.\n\n\"Analysis of a laptop that the investigation ties to the shooter reveals that on July 6, he did a Google search for -quote - 'how far away was Oswald from Kennedy,'\" Wray said.\n\nHe was referring to Lee Harvey Oswald, who assassinated former President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, on Nov. 22, 1963.\n\n\"That's a search that's obviously significant in terms of his state of mind,\" Wray said.\n\n\"That is the same day that it appears that he registered for the Butler rally,\" he added, saying Crooks became \"very focused on President Trump and his rally\" at that point after showing interest in public figures more generally.\n\nAbout two hours before the shooting, Crooks flew a drone over the area about 200 yards (180 meters) from the stage where Trump spoke to the crowd, and live-streamed footage for about 11 minutes.\n\nLaw enforcement officers did not spot Crooks on the roof with his AR-15-style rifle until \"seconds\" before he opened fire, said Wray, noting that the timeline could change as the investigators' understanding of facts evolves.\n\n\"It's all happening in seconds,\" Wray said. He added that the rifle had a collapsible stock, \"which could explain why it might have been less easy for people to observe.\"\n\nCrude explosive devices later recovered from Crooks' car and home were designed to be detonated remotely. Crooks had a transmitter with him, Wray added. But he said the FBI believes the suspect would not have been successful had he tried to detonate the devices.\n\nThe motive for the shooting remains unclear. Wray said many people have described Crooks as a loner and the list of contacts in his phone was short.\n\nThe hearing also focused on the increasingly tense political atmosphere surrounding the presidential campaign.\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated-threat environment. And tragically, the ... assassination attempt is another example, particularly heinous,\" Wray testified.\n\nA day before Wray's testimony, Kimberly Cheatle resigned as director of the U.S. Secret Service after bipartisan demands to quit over the failure to prevent the attempted assassination.\n\nJudiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan welcomed Wray's willingness to share details about the FBI investigation into the assassination attempt.\n\nBut he also cited skepticism toward the FBI that exists among some Republicans, who are angry about the arrest of Trump supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as Congress certified President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.\n\n\"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation,\" Jordan said.\n\nRepresentative Jerrold Nadler, the panel's top Democrat, condemned the Trump shooting \"unequivocally and unabashedly\" but pointed to years of political threats and violence, and violent rhetoric from Republicans including Trump himself.\n\n\"If you think that this one assassin's bullet was a bolt out of the blue, and not part of a wave of violence that has threatened this nation for years, then you have missed the point,\" Nadler said.\n\n(Reporting by David Morgan and Sarah N.

Kennedy the day he registered to attend the Pennsylvania rally.\n\nMr. Wray, during his appearance before the House Judiciary Committee reported that a week before the assassination attempt against Trump -- which wounded one bystander and critically injured others -- Crooks searched on Google: \"How far away was Oswald from Kennedy?\"\n\nThat same day, Mr. Wray reported, the shooter registered to attend Trump's rally at Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"That's a search that obviously is significant in terms of his state of mind,\" Mr. Wray said.\n\nCrooks's search history suggests he was \"broadly interested\" in various public figures though became \"very focused\" on Trump on around July 6.\n\nMr. Wray also confirmed that there is currently no evidence to suggest that Crooks was working in cahoots with any individual or organization when he attempted to take the 45th President's life.\n\nHe also added that prevailing descriptions of the gunman as a \"loner\" seem to fit with what they've seen on his devices.\n\n\"There doesn't appear to be a whole lot of interactions between him, face-to-face or digital, with a lot of people,\" Mr. Wray noted. \"That doesn't mean there's not any.\"\n\nHe added that Crooks had fewer-than-expected contacts in his devices.\n\nMr. Wray also notes that gaining access to Crooks's phone was a \"significant technical challenge\" and that the gunman was communicating via encrypted messaging apps.\n\nOver the course of the hearing, Mr. Wray also confirmed that they found evidence that the gunman had flown a drone over the site two hours before the rally began. The drone was reportedly in the air for 11 minutes.\n\n\"We're still trying to figure out exactly what he saw,\" he said, adding that FBI experts think he was likely live-streaming the video footage.\n\nWhile they have been able to make out the flight path of the drone while it was in the air, they are still trying to determine what the shooter \"could have seen in these 11 minutes.\"\n\nMr. Wray also reported that the FBI confirmed that Crooks brought a five foot ladder to the rally, though he also said that investigators did not find the ladder at the scene. As a result, it remains unclear how Crooks managed to get on the roof.\n\nCrooks also visited a shooting range a day before his attempted assassination of Trump, and investigators believe he \"probably\" used a weapon similar to the one he fired on July 13.\n\nThroughout the hearing, the FBI chief maintained that they have not found a \"clear motive\" for the shooting, but affirmed that investigators are \"digging hard\" to uncover more information about the shooter.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "novi_zhukovsky@nysun.com", "name": "Novi Zhukovsky", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

The FBI is investigating the shooting as an act of domestic terrorism and an attempted assassination. Wray said Wednesday that they have not uncovered any accomplices in the shooting.\n\nThe FBI is generally secretive around active investigations but the public interest and extraordinary circumstances surrounding the attack has prompted agency officials to be more forthcoming with details and developments as they continue to piece things together.\n\nInvestigators recovered a drone Crooks flew around 200 yards away from the stage roughly two hours before Trump started to speak, which Wray said he was watching footage of on a live feed through a phone.\n\nSnipers killed the suspected gunman, 20-year-old Thomas Crooks, after seeing him on the nearby rooftop. He used an AR 15-style rifle that he purchased legally and eight bullet cartridges were recovered from the roof where he opened fire, Wray told lawmakers.\n\nThe hearing was scheduled before the July 13 shooting as part of routine oversight of the FBI and Justice Department, which have both under the spotlight in the GOP-led House for the criminal cases against the former president that are likely on hold past Election Day after the Supreme Court issued a ruling giving presidents immunity.\n\nWray and Attorney General Merrick Garland have both been the focus of repeated contentious hearings in front of House GOP-led committees amid lingering frustration over its 2016 investigation of Trump's ties to Russia, the prosecution of rioters at the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol and the legal cases against Trump.\n\n\"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation,\" Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said during the hearing.\n\nThe Secret Service has taken the brunt of the congressional criticism for the attempt on Trump's life, leading to the resignation of director Kimberly Cheatle, but Wray is likely to face tough questioning on the lack of details about a potential motive behind the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania. Cheatle faced the House earlier this week and was grilled for hours over the security lapse that allowed Crooks to get access to a rooftop some 150 yards away from where Trump was speaking with a gun, frequently frustrating lawmakers by dodging questions or failing to provide concise details.", "source": {"uri": "turnto10.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WJAR"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

He said experts believe that Crooks was using the drone to view the area with a live stream.\n\nRoughly two hours after the drone is believed to have taken flight on July 13, Crooks began shooting with a rifle from the rooftop of a building roughly 150 yards away from the stage where Trump was speaking to supporters.\n\nA Secret Service sniper shot and killed the gunman while other personnel rushed to protect Trump and escort him off the stage, but not before a bullet ripped through the former president's ear. One rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured.\n\nWray told Jordan the FBI recovered three explosive devices, two from Crooks' vehicle and one from his residence. The devices were \"relatively crude\" but did have the capability to be \"detonated remotely,\" Wray added.\n\nReceivers for two of the explosive devices were found with the devices themselves, Wray said. He added that Crooks had a \"transmitter\" with him when law enforcement killed him.\n\nWray said the devices were also being reviewed by the FBI's lab and noted how \"at the moment\" it appears to investigators that because of the \"on-off position on the receivers,\" if Crooks \"had tried to detonate those devices from the roof, it would not have worked.\"\n\nWray said the FBI \"finally\" got into Crooks' phone in an effort to determine his motives and state of mind. He said Crooks had been using \"some encrypted messaging applications.\"\n\nDuring another exchange, this one with Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC), Wray said investigators recovered \"eight cartridges\" on the roof of the building where Crooks opened fire.\n\nAsked why Crooks was able to get off eight shots, Wray responded, \"Well, that I think is something we're still digging into.\"\n\nUnder questioning from Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), Wray testified that a laptop linked to Crooks revealed a Google search related to Lee Harvey Oswald and the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\n\nIn particular, Wray said, Crooks queried \"how far away was Oswald from Kennedy?\" on July 6, which appears to be the same day the shooter registered for Trump's rally.", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

He said the agency believes the suspect flew the drone about 180 metres (200 yards) from the rally stage before the event began.\n\n\"We're going to leave no stone unturned. The shooter might be deceased, but the FBI's investigation is very much ongoing,\" the director said.\n\nRepublican Congressman Jim Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said at the start of the hearing that multiple questions remained unanswered, including why all the buildings near the rally stage were not secured.\n\n\"We hope to learn more today from Director Wray about the shooter: his use of the drone, the explosives that were in his car, how he got on the roof and a host of other questions,\" Jordan said.\n\n\"It is our hope that Director Wray's testimony can begin to give answers to the American people about all these questions and concerns.\"\n\nRepresentative Jerry Nadler, the panel's top Democrat, condemned the Trump shooting \"unequivocally and unabashedly\" but pointed to years of political threats and violence and violent rhetoric from Republicans, including Trump himself.\n\n\"If you think that this one assassin's bullet was a bolt out of the blue and not part of a wave of violence that has threatened this nation for years, then you have missed the point,\" Nadler said.\n\nThe FBI has largely avoided the same level of scrutiny directed at the Secret Service over security lapses that preceded the Trump rally shooting.\n\nBut some US lawmakers have been sceptical of the bureau's assessment that Crooks left behind no obvious ideological motive that could explain his actions.\n\nThe FBI director has long faced opposition from hardline Republicans, some angered over the arrest of Trump supporters who stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, as Congress certified Biden's 2020 election victory over Trump.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Kennedy shooting from his laptop and flew a drone in the area near the rally just two hours before the former president took the stage on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania, FBI Director Christopher Wray said Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the FBI's analysis of Thomas Matthew Crooks' laptop, Crooks searched how far Lee Harvey Oswald was when he shot and killed President John F. Kennedy in 1963.\n\nThe search was on July 6, the same day the Trump rally was announced.\n\n\"On July 6, he did a Google search for: 'how far away was Oswald from Kennedy,'\" Wray told the House Judiciary Committee.\n\n\"That's a search that's obviously significant in terms of his state of mind,\" the FBI director added. \"That is the same day that it appears that he registered for the Butler rally.\"\n\nShooter flew drone just 2 hours before Trump took the stage\n\nSpeaking to the House Judiciary Committee, Wray revealed that \"around 4 p.m.,\" the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, \"was flying the drone around the area\" of the rally, approximately 200 yards from the stage.\n\nThe drone was in the air for approximately 11 minutes, and investigators believe Crooks watched a live feed from the drone on his phone. CNN previously reported that the drone was found in his car following the shooting.\n\nIn addition, Crooks had two explosives in his car at the time of the shooting and one in his home, but likely did not have the ability to detonate them from the roof where he was killed, Wray testified.\n\n\"It looks like because of the on/off position on the receivers, that if he had tried to detonate those devices from the roof, it would not have worked,\" Wray said.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the shooting as both an attempted assassination and as a potential act of domestic terrorism.\n\nGun had a collapsable stock and was purchased from shooter's father\n\nInvestigators say that Crooks fired approximately eight times from an AR-style rifle at the former president before being killed by a US Secret Service counter sniper.\n\nThe rifle Crooks used was purchased from his father, Wray testified.\n\n\"The weapon that he used for the attempted assassination was an AR-style rifle that was purchased legally, that he - as my understanding - acquired, I think bought actually from his father, who was the one who originally bought it,\" Wray said.\n\nPreviously, officials said they believed the firearm belonged to Crooks' father - not the shooter - and they didn't know how Crooks accessed the weapon.\n\nFBI officials have repeatedly asserted that they believe Crooks acted alone, and Wray reiterated that there is no evidence of any co-conspirators.\n\n\"I have been saying some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment,\" Wray said. \"The shooter may be deceased but the FBI's investigation is ongoing.\"\n\nInvestigators have gone through the shooter's phone and computer, scoured his search history and bedroom and have interviewed his family and friends, but have struggled to identify what motivated the 20-year-old would be assassin to act.\n\nCrooks also had no prior contacts with the FBI, officials say, and had not been previously on their radar or databases.\n\nShooter was searching for news stories\n\nWray pushed back against reports that Crooks searched for images of specific prominent public officials online, saying that it appears he was actually searching for news articles.\n\n\"The shooter appears to have done a lot of searches of public figures in general, but so far we are seeing kind of news articles and things like that,\" Wray said. He continued, \"so the images that have been reported about, really what we are talking about there are when you do a news search of an article the image appears in a cache as opposed to like a search for that specific individual.\"\n\nThe FBI director cautioned that the effort to uncover Crooks' motive is ongoing, but warned that \"it is, quite frankly, a dangerous time to be a prominent public official.\"\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee hearing is ongoing.\n\nThis story is breaking and will be updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The authorities charged with protecting the former president weren't adequately prepared to stop him.\n\nThose twin conclusions emerged this week during a series of congressional oversight hearings into the circumstances of, motivations for, and security failures surrounding the attempt on Trump's life -- the most serious threat to a president or presidential nominee since a gunman shot President Ronald Reagan in 1981.\n\nAnd as lawmakers heard testimony from U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, FBI Director Christopher Wray and Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Christopher Paris in a series of proceedings over the past three days, several new details about the shooting and the investigation emerged.\n\nHere are some of the highlights:\n\nCrooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pa., had searched online for details of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy roughly a week before his attack on Trump, Wray told members of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee during a hearing Wednesday.\n\nThe FBI director said agents scouring Crooks' search history discovered that he'd made queries like \"How far away was [Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey] Oswald from Kennedy\" the same day he registered to attend the Butler rally.\n\n\"That's a search that is significant in terms of his state of mind,\" Wray said, adding that around the same time his search history had become \"very focused on former President Trump and this rally.\"\n\nCrooks had also taken other steps to prepare, including visiting the rally site -- on the grounds of the Butler Farm Show, about an hour away from Crooks' home in Bethel Park -- at least twice before unleashing his attack.\n\nWray testified that Crooks visited the site for roughly 20 minutes about a week before the rally, and then spent roughly 70 minutes there on the morning of July 13. During that later visit, Wray said, Crooks surveilled the grounds with a drone he flew over an area some 200 yards above the rally stage.\n\nThe day before Trump's stop in Western Pennsylvania, Crooks, who Wray described as a \"fairly avid shooting hobbyist,\" went to a shooting range near his home to practice with the AR-15-style rifle investigators believe he used in the attack.\n\nThat weapon, complete with a collapsible scope that Wray said may have helped Crooks hide that he was carrying a firearm on July 13, was originally purchased by his father more than a decade ago. And while investigators initially said that the firearm was still registered to him, Wray told lawmakers Wednesday that the son had legally purchased the gun from his father.\n\nThe morning of the rally Crooks bought 50 rounds of ammunition from a local gun store, then drove to the fairgrounds with two \"relatively crude\" explosive devices found in his car, Wray said.\n\nBoth were capable of being remotely detonated with a switch Crooks was carrying with him as he carried out his attack.\n\nHowever, Wray said, \"because of the on/off position on the receivers, if he had tried to detonate those devices from [the rooftop perch from where he opened fire] it would not have worked.\"\n\nThe FBI director added: \"That doesn't mean the explosives weren't dangerous.\"\n\nNearly two weeks after the shooting, investigators have made little progress in identifying Crooks' motive in attacking Trump. Wray told lawmakers Wednesday that agents have conducted dozens of interviews and spent countless hours examining the gunman's digital footprint both online and on his personal devices.\n\n\"We'd love to have a roadmap that tells us exactly what he was thinking. We haven't found that yet,\" he said. \"Doesn't mean we won't. We're looking all over the place and we're going to leave no stone unturned.\"\n\nCrooks' parents have been cooperative so far in the investigation, Wray said, but from what agents have been able to discern so far, their son largely kept his own counsel.\n\n\"There doesn't appear to [have been] a whole lot of interactions between him, face-to-face or digital, with a lot of people,\" Wray said. \"That doesn't mean there's not any.\"\n\n\" READ MORE: What Thomas Matthew Crooks' ex-classmates and employer have said about the Trump shooting suspect\n\nMeanwhile, members of the House Oversight Committee roasted Cheatle, the U.S. Secret Service director, for hours on Monday over her agency's failure to adequately secure the rally site before Trump's speech.\n\nThe bipartisan criticism she received throughout the most contentious of the week's proceedings culminated in her resignation a day later.\n\nCheatle acknowledged during her testimony that the Secret Service had turned down requests over the two years before the attack to beef up Trump's security detail. But she insisted that on July 13 \"there were not requests that were denied\" for the Butler rally.\n\nCheatle also told lawmakers that her agency had identified the building from which Crooks carried out his attack -- an agricultural toolmakers' warehouse roughly 150 yards from the stage -- as a potential security vulnerability as they reviewed the location before the rally.\n\nAnd yet because it fell outside a security perimeter the Secret Service had established, it had tasked local authorities -- specifically, the Butler County Emergency Services Unit -- with securing the building.\n\nButler County District Attorney Richard Goldinger, whose office oversees the unit, has previously said it informed the Secret Service that local police did not have the manpower to secure that building.\n\nCheatle told lawmakers that the Secret Service received \"two to five\" reports the day of the rally of a suspicious person lingering outside the security perimeter.\n\nInitially, she said, local officers had noticed him using a rangefinder -- used by marksmen to measure distances to remote objects. Wray told lawmakers Wednesday that those reports came about an hour before Crooks opened fire.\n\nAnother local officer positioned outside the venue reported Crooks skulking around the rally site and crawling on the ground, Cheatle said. That officer disseminated his photo to others involved in the security effort.\n\nAbout a half hour before the shooting, yet another officer spotted Crooks again, scoping out the roof of the building from which he would eventually open fire and circulated his photo among other law enforcement.\n\nDuring that period, two local officers -- members of the Butler County Emergency Services Unit -- left their assigned posts in a building with a vantage-point view of the roof from where Crooks would eventually fire to join the search for him on the ground, said Paris, the Pennsylvania State Police commissioner, in testimony before the House Homeland Security Committee on Tuesday. It was not clear, Paris said, whether those officers would have been able to spot Crooks on the roof had they remained at their duty posts.\n\nBut Cheatle and Paris both stressed that no one reported seeing Crooks with a firearm until seconds before he opened fire. And despite the early reports of Crooks' suspicious activity, authorities had no reason to deem him an imminent security threat, they said.\n\nParis told lawmakers that Crooks was one of several individuals in the crowd that day whose behavior authorities had flagged as potentially suspicious.\n\nThe first time anyone reported spotting Crooks with a gun came just seconds before he opened fire, Wray told lawmakers in his testimony Wednesday.\n\nHe, Paris and Cheatle all described how moments before the shooting a local officer, responding to reports from other spectators of an armed man on the roof, tried to hoist himself up on top of the building to confront him.\n\nAs he \"dangled\" from the edge, Crooks pointed his rifle at the officer, prompting him to fall from his position, Paris said. Crooks fired off eight shots in the six seconds that followed -- hitting Trump, killing one rally spectator and injuring two others.\n\nA Secret Service sniper shot and killed him moments later.\n\nThis week's congressional hearings were only the start of what is shaping up to be an exhaustive review by multiple agencies of Crooks' shooting that day and the multiple security failures that allowed it to happen.\n\nIn addition to the ongoing FBI investigation into Crooks' preparation and motivation, the Pennsylvania State Police are conducting a parallel probe into the shooting of the three spectators hit by the gunman as well as the Secret Service sniper's use of force that ultimately killed Crooks.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Secret Service and the Inspector General's Office for the Department of Homeland Security are conducting their own internal reviews. Cheatle told lawmakers her agency's probe would not be complete before September -- a timeline several members of Congress balked at Monday.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R,, La.) and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.) also announced plans to form a bipartisan task force to continue Congress' investigation of the incident.

The FBI's investigation has thrust the bureau into a political maelstrom months before the presidential election, with lawmakers and the public pressing for details about what may have motivated Crooks in the most serious attempt to assassinate a president or presidential candidate since President Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Justine Wadsack clocked at 71 mph on Speedway, police say\n\nThe FBI has built out a detailed timeline of Crooks' movements and online activity, but the precise motive -- or why Trump was singled out -- remains elusive, Wray said.\n\n\"A lot of the usual repositories of information have not yielded, anything notable in terms of motive or ideology,\" Wray said. He did note that Crooks had grown interested in public officials -- besides Trump, Crooks also had photos on his phone of Democratic President Joe Biden and other prominent figures -- and in the days before the shooting had appeared particularly consumed by Trump, the Republicans' White House nominee.\n\nWray also said that Crooks, about two hours before the shooting, had flown a drone about 200 yards (180 meters) from the rally stage where Trump would later stand and that Crooks used the device to livestream and watch footage. The use of the drone so close the rally site just hours before Trump took the stage for the rally add to the questions about the security lapses preceding the event.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWray pledged to lawmakers that the FBI would \"leave no stone unturned\" in its investigation.\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment, and tragically the Butler County assassination attempt is another example -- a particularly heinous and public one -- of what I've been talking about,\" Wray said.\n\nThe hearing had been scheduled well before the shooting, as part of the committee's routine oversight of the FBI and the Justice Department.

Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told Wray: \"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation.\"\n\nThe FBI so far has avoided the same level of scrutiny over the shooting directed at the Secret Service over security failures that preceded the shooting and has led to the the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle,\n\nThe FBI has said it is investigating the shooting, which killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism and an attempted assassination. Trump's campaign said the presumptive GOP nominee was doing \"fine\" after the shooting, which Trump said pierced the upper part of his right ear.\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally\n\nSubscribe to stay connected to Tucson.

Kennedy, the FBI director said Wednesday.\n\nTestifying before the House Judiciary Committee, Christopher Wray gave lawmakers an update on the investigation into the July 13 shooting targeting Trump at a rally in Butler, Pa. That includes information pulled from a computer linked to the 20-year-old gunman, Thomas Crooks, that suggests he spent at least a week planning the attack.\n\n\"An analysis of a laptop that the investigation ties to the shooter reveals that on July 6 he did a Google search for 'How far away was Oswald from Kennedy?'\" Wray said. \"That's a search that obviously is significant in terms of his state of mind. That is the same day that it appears that he registered for the Butler rally.\"\n\nLee Harvey Oswald is the gunman who shot former President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, in 1963.\n\nWray's testimony comes 11 days after the attempt on Trump's life. He said the FBI still has found no indication of a motive or political ideology for Crooks, but he did fill in some of the details about him and the timeline ahead of the shooting.\n\nInvestigators believe Crooks visited the site of the Butler rally on three occasions, Wray said.\n\nThe first time was a week before the event, when he spent roughly 20 minutes there. The second time was the morning of the Trump rally, when he appears to have been on site for roughly 70 minutes, Wray said. The third time was later that afternoon, a few hours before the event -- and he never left.\n\nDuring that last visit, Wray said, Crooks flew a drone at the rally grounds for 11 minutes around 4 p.m., about 200 yards from the stage. Investigators recovered the drone in the gunman's vehicle along with its controller. They have been able to reverse engineer the device's flight path, Wray said, but they don't know exactly what Crooks was able to see or why.\n\nWray also discussed the three explosive devices that investigators recovered: two from Crooks' vehicle and one at his residence.

Kennedy and his assassin when he was shot in 1963.\n\nWray said the shooter at Trump's rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, this month also flew a drone over the area two hours before Trump's campaign speech and had two \"relatively crude\" explosives in his car.\n\nWray revealed to the House Judiciary Committee for the first time that on July 6 the gunman did a Google search for how far assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was from Kennedy. The same day he registered for the Trump rally.\n\n\"That is a search that obviously is significant for his state of mind,\" Wray said.\n\nThe gunman first visited the rally grounds a week before the event for about 20 minutes, Wray said. The shooter then visited the grounds the morning of the rally about 70 minutes and then went back for good in the afternoon, Wray said.\n\nAnother revelation was that the AR-style rifle the shooter used had a collapsible stock, which Wray said may help explain how no one saw the man carrying the gun.\n\n\"We haven't yet found anybody with firsthand observation of him with the weapon walking around beforehand,\" Wray said. \"The collapsible stock could be very significant feature that could be relevant to that.\"\n\nWray said the drone and controller were found in gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks' car. The drone flew about 3:50 p.m. for about 11 minutes, apparently livestreaming over an area about 200 yards from the stage where Trump spoke, Wray said.\n\nThe FBI is studying two explosives in the shooter's car and one in his residence, Wray said. The devices were connected to receivers and Crooks had a receiver with him when he was killed by a Secret Service sniper, but the equipment didn't appear capable of setting off what he called \"relatively crude devices,\" Wray said.\n\nWray said investigators now believe the gunman climbed onto the roof with the help of mechanical equipment on the ground and piping on the side of the building, rather than a ladder.\n\n\"We do not believe he used a ladder to get up there,\" Wray said.\n\nThe FBI recovered eight cartridges where the gunman was slain, Wray said, suggesting he fired that many shots. The gunman sent encrypted messages before the attack, which Wray said had \"unfortunately become very commonplace\" to thwart law enforcement.\n\nThe chair of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said lawmakers want to know more about why Trump's campaign team was denied extra security in the weeks before the rally, why buildings weren't secured at the rally and why Trump was allowed on stage despite the presence of a suspicious person seen by the crowd with a range-finder.\n\nJordan focused on five minutes between 6:09 p.m., when the gunman was identified and 6:14 p.m., when Trump was led wounded from the stage.\n\n\"We need to know what happened play by play, moment by moment, second by second - communications that took place - during that critical five minutes,\" Jordan said.\n\nGunman's pictures of Trump, Biden not necessarily from specific searches: FBI\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., asked whether pictures of political figures such as Trump, President Joe Biden and others were found on the gunman's phone.\n\nWray said investigators haven't found a manifesto or obvious motive for the shooter. He said pictures were saved in the cache of his electronics from news searches, rather than necessarily because of a specific search for a public official.\n\n\"There is a whole lot of work under way and still a lot of work left to do,\" Wray said. \"We're going to leave no stone unturned. The shooter may be deceased but the FBI's investigation is very much ongoing.\"\n\nWray testimony follows resignation of Secret Service chief\n\nWray's testimony came a day after former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned over what she acknowledged was a \"colossal failure\" to protect Trump at a rally July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe House Oversight and Accountability Committee excoriated Cheatle during a hearing Monday for having no explanation for how a gunman was able to climb onto the roof of a building within 150 yards of the former president and fire eight shots, one of which hit Trump in the ear. One rally attendee was killed.\n\nWray, a Trump appointee, has been criticized by some Republicans angered over the arrest of Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as Congress certified President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.", "source": {"uri": "northjersey.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "North Jersey"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

The Secret Service is part of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nWray slammed political violence during his opening statements.\n\n\"We will not and do not tolerate political violence of any kind,\" Wray said. \"Especially a despicable account of this magnitude.\"\n\n\"We are going to leave no stone unturned,\" Wray added when discussing the investigation.\n\n\"The attempted assassination of the former President was an attack on our democracy,\" Wray said.\n\nWray went on to mention the United States being under an environment of \"heightened threat\" at several points during his testimony.\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in a heightened threat environment,\" Wray said.\n\nU.S. Rep.

Wray called the three explosive devices that the FBI recovered in the shooter's car \"relatively crude.\"\n\nWray acknowledged that the shooter had a drone and said that the FBI thinks that he was \"live-streaming\" and \"viewing the footage\" for several minutes before the shooting.\n\nU.S. Rep. Jerry Nadler asked Wray for his response to people calling for the defunding of the FBI.\n\n\"Cutting our funding is incredibly shortsighted,\" Wray said.\n\nThe question of any possible motives from the shooter leading up to the assassination attempt against Trump came up several times during the hearing.\n\n\"I think it's fair to say that we do not yet have a clear picture of his motive,\" Wray said in response.\n\nWray said that the shooter is thought to have visited the surrounding area three separate times leading up to the rally after Jordan asked him about it.\n\nWray revealed that the shooter did a \"Google search for how far away was [Lee Harvey] Oswald from [the late President John F.] Kennedy\" on July 6. Wray added that that was the same day that the shooter registered to attend the Trump campaign rally.\n\nWray said that the shooter seemed interested in images of various public officials and public figures who \"cover both parties\" and added that the FBI is still trying to \"grill into that\" amidst their ongoing investigation.\n\nMany members of the Judiciary Committee denounced acts of political violence at several points throughout the hearing.\n\n\"In America violence has never been the answer,\" Rep.

Kennedy, according to new testimony Wednesday from FBI director Christopher Wray.\n\nThe drone was found in the car Crooks used to get to the Trump rally, and while there aren't any known photos or videos of the drone from that day, according to Wray, the FBI was able to reverse engineer the flight path. Crooks flew the drone for about 10 minutes, from about 3:50 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., Wray said, about 200 yards away from where Trump would ultimately be speaking. Trump ultimately took the stage at 6:03 p.m. and the first shot was fired at 6:11 p.m., according to CBS News.\n\nRep. Andy Biggs, a Republican from Arizona, asked about the FBI's discovery that Crooks had used a drone and what he may have been observing in the lead-up to the shooting. Wray explained that since it wasn't used during the actual shooting, it was more about observing his surroundings before the shooting.\n\n\"It's almost like giving him a rearview mirror of the scene behind him except, again, he wasn't flying it overhead while he was later back for the assassination,\" Wray said.\n\nBut Wray acknowledged that it's taking some work to figure it all out. And they're speculating that perhaps Crooks was even livestreaming the video captured by the drone.\n\n\"We're still trying to figure out exactly what he saw because we're having to, in effect... because there's no recording of what he saw during those 11 minutes, you know, our hypothesis at this point the experts think he would have been livestreaming it,\" Wray said.\n\nWray explained that the FBI has cracked some of the electronic devices used by Crooks, though \"not all of them,\" and that's how they're gleaning information about his internet activity. \"Some of them we're still waiting on, some of them we may never have access to because of the encryption issue,\" Wray said.\n\nCrooks googled \"How far away was Oswald from Kennedy?\", a reference to Lee Harvey Oswald, the only person officially believed to have shot the president, though there are plenty of conspiracy theories about what actually happened that day in Dallas back in 1963. That fact came out while Wray was being questioned by Rep. Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California. The Google search about Oswald and Kennedy was on July 6, which is the same day that he used his own name to register for the Trump rally online, according to Wray's testimony.\n\nWray also noted the collapsible stock that may have allowed Crooks to conceal the weapon he used. The FBI director said that no first-hand account of Crooks walking around with a weapon has surfaced and the only person who saw the shooter with a gun saw him when he was already on the roof of the building where he took the shots.\n\nWray's testimony at the House Judiciary Committee in Washington D.C. is just the latest information the public is learning about the attempt on the former president's life and the various ways Crooks used technology in his plot to assassinate Trump. The shooting set off a range of conspiracy theories about the potential existence of two shooters or some kind of involvement by the FBI, and this new information about both the drone and Crooks's search history is likely to just produce more wild theories.\n\nIncredibly, some of the conspiracy theories are being floated by Trump-loving members of Congress.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation,\" Rep. Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio, told Wray.\n\nRep. Victoria Spartz from Indiana even took the opportunity during Wednesday's hearing to suggest the FBI was involved in a false flag against the U.S. Capitol during Donald Trump's coup attempt on January 6, 2021.\n\nAs the Associated Press notes, the hearing was actually scheduled before the assassination attempt on Trump and is just a routine part of congressional oversight of the FBI. But the internet is still going to have a lot of questions about what exactly happened, some of which are reasonable and others which are completely out there.", "source": {"uri": "gizmodo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gizmodo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_novak@gizmodo.com", "name": "Matt Novak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Crooks pointed his gun at the officer, causing him to fall, and then started shooting in Trump's direction, Wray said.\n\nAuthorities recovered the drone in Crooks' car, where they also found a drone controller and two explosive devices that could be remotely detonated, Wray said.\n\nCrooks had a transmitter on him, the director said, adding that it appears the remote detonation \"would not have worked.\"\n\nEight bullet cartridges were found on the roof with the gunman's body, he said.\n\nWray said Crooks had purchased a ladder, about 5-foot tall, according to a bloodied receipt that he had on him, but the ladder was not found at the scene. The FBI director said it is unclear how Crooks got onto the roof.\n\nCrooks was a \"fairly avid shooting hobbyist,\" who went to a shooting range the day before the assassination attempt, \"probably\" with the same AR-style rifle he used at the rally, Wray said.\n\nLawmakers say key questions surrounding the shooting remain unanswered, particularly by Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned as director of the Secret Service on Tuesday after Republicans accused her of failing to fully cooperate with the House Oversight Committee in testimony the day before.\n\n\"We need to know play-by-play, moment-by-moment, second-by-second,\" Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told Wray on Wednesday at the start of the hearing.\n\nThe congressional committee hearings this week have begun to yield more information on the shooting and how Crooks evaded law enforcement.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pennsylvania State Police Col. Christopher Paris told the House Homeland Security Committee that officers with the Butler County Emergency Services Unit had spotted Crooks from a second-story window and left their post to search for him.\n\nParis said Crooks was identified as suspicious before the shooting because he was hanging around but never attempted to enter the rally. That suspicion was later heightened, Paris said, when Crooks was seen with a rangefinder.\n\nThat day, three other people had been identified as suspicious, the state police commissioner said.\n\nCrooks was not designated as an actual threat until seconds before he opened fire, Paris said.

Instead, he climbed onto the roof using some mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping.\n\nWray also said Crooks's AR-style gun had a collapsible stock which may explain why he was not seen by rallygoers or members of law enforcement with the weapon before the shooting.\n\nHe said Crooks visited the rally site on at least three occasions, about a week before the shooting, for about 70 minutes on the morning of the rally and again that afternoon.\n\ncl/sst\n\nMore from this section\n\niMyFone VoxBox TTS Voice AI Launches Video Dubbing Feature\n\nOptimal Blue Launches New Generative AI Assistant Capabilities\n\nExodus United Global Signs Multi-Year Agreement to Bring Indian Films and TV shows to the U.S.", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Dan Bishop asked about reports of an unmanned aerial surveillance drone at the Trump rally.\n\nWray said that the FBI found a drone and controller in the shooter's vehicle as well as explosive devices. Wray called the three explosive devices that the FBI recovered in the shooter's car \"relatively crude.\"\n\nWray acknowledged that the shooter had a drone and said that the FBI think that he was \"live-streaming\" and \"viewing the footage\" for several minutes before the shooting.\n\nWray went on to denounce political violence in the country, calling it an \"alarming phenomenon.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Jerry Nadler asked Wray for his response to people calling for the defunding of the FBI.\n\n\"Cutting our funding is incredibly shortsighted,\" Wray said.\n\nThe question of any possible motives from the shooter leading up to the assassination attempt against Trump came up several times during the hearing.\n\n\"I think it's fair to say that we do not yet have a clear picture of his motive,\" Wray said in response.\n\nWray said that the shooter is thought to have visited the surrounding area three separate times leading up to the rally when Jordan asked him about how many times the shooter was at the premises of the Trump rally.\n\nWray revealed that the shooter did a \"Google search for how far away was Oswald from Kennedy\" on July 6. Wray added that that was the same day that the shooter registered to attend the Trump campaign rally.\n\nWray said that the shooter seemed interested in images of various public officials and public figures who \"cover both parties\" and added that the FBI are still trying to \"grill into that\" amidst their ongoing investigation.\n\nMany members of the Judiciary Committee denounced acts of political violence at several points throughout the hearing.\n\n\"In America violence has never been the answer,\" Rep.

Wray told lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning that the assassination attempt against former president Donald Trump was \"despicable,\" and he pledged that investigators would leave \"no stone unturned\" in the case.\n\n\"We are living in an elevated threat environment, and, tragically, the Butler County assassination attempt is another example - a particularly heinous and public one - of what I have been talking about,\" Wray said.\n\n\"There's a whole lot of work underway and still a lot of work to do,\" he continued. \"The shooter may be deceased, but the FBI's investigation is very much ongoing.\"\n\nThe hearing before the House Judiciary Committee was scheduled before the July 13 attempted assassination of Trump at an outdoor campaign rally in Butler, Pa., but that attack is taking center stage as officials worry about political violence in a presidential election year.\n\nThe gunman, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, fired at Trump from a rooftop just outside the rally security perimeter, using an AR-style rifle. One rallygoer was killed, two others were critically injured, and Trump, the Republican nominee in this year's presidential election, suffered a graze wound to his ear.\n\nThe security lapses that afforded the gunman a sightline to Trump on the rally stage have prompted multiple investigations of the U.S. Secret Service, whose director resigned Tuesday under pressure from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers.\n\nFBI investigators have said so far that the gunman did not appear to have any discernible ideology, suggesting he was not motivated primarily by political animosity.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who chairs the Judiciary committee, is a longtime Trump ally and critic of Wray, the FBI and the Justice Department. He began the hearing by criticizing what he called \"the Biden-Harris Justice Department\" - an acknowledgment that Vice President Harris is now running for the Democratic nomination after President Biden announced he would not seek a second term.\n\nWray confirmed a number of details from the investigation that have been publicly reported already, including that there were eight spent bullet casings found near the gunman's body - indicating that he fired at least that many times.\n\nThe director also described how Crooks apparently used a drone hours before the shooting to examine the area near the rally, but not directly overhead.\n\n\"The drone was recovered in his vehicle,\" Wray testified. \"The shooter was flying the drone around the area, not over the stage. ... We think that he was live-streaming, viewing the footage for about 11 minutes, about 200 yards away.\"\n\nTwo explosive devices were found in the shooter's car, devices that Wray called \"relatively crude devices themselves, but they did have the ability to be detonated remotely.\"\n\nBecause the remotely controlled devices attached to the homemade bombs were left in the \"off\" position, Wray said, it appears \"that if he had tried to detonate those devices from the roof, it would not have worked.\"\n\nTechnical experts at the FBI lab in Quantico, Va., were able to crack open the gunman's phone within two days of the attack. While they found some evidence of interest, the device did not provide an explanation for his motive, people familiar with the investigation have said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe the ongoing case.\n\nThe gunman used some encrypted messaging applications, which Wray said have \"unfortunately now become very commonplace\" in FBI investigations, as popular messaging software often includes encryption.\n\nAsked whether the FBI believed there were any accomplices or co-conspirators in the shooting, Wray answered, \"Not at this time, but again the investigation is ongoing.\"", "source": {"uri": "matzav.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "matzav.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

He did note that Crooks had grown interested in public officials -- besides Trump, Crooks also had photos on his phone of Democratic President Joe Biden and other prominent figures -- and in the days before the shooting had appeared particularly consumed by Trump, the Republicans' White House nominee.\n\nWray also said that Crooks, about two hours before the shooting, had flown a drone about 200 yards (180 meters) from the rally stage where Trump would later stand and that Crooks used the device to livestream and watch footage. The use of the drone so close the rally site just hours before Trump took the stage for the rally add to the questions about the security lapses preceding the event.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWray pledged to lawmakers that the FBI would \"leave no stone unturned\" in its investigation.\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment, and tragically the Butler County assassination attempt is another example -- a particularly heinous and public one -- of what I've been talking about,\" Wray said.\n\nThe hearing had been scheduled well before the shooting, as part of the committee's routine oversight of the FBI and the Justice Department. Questions about the shooting dominated the session.\n\nElections GOP threatened to sue over November ballot if Biden dropped out.

Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told Wray: \"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation.\"\n\nThe FBI so far has avoided the same level of scrutiny over the shooting directed at the Secret Service over security failures that preceded the shooting and has led to the the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle,\n\nThe FBI has said it is investigating the shooting, which killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism and an attempted assassination.

But it could explain one of the questions yet to be answered: specifically, how Crooks was seen on the ground by some individuals before the shooting in Butler, Pa., but was not viewed in possession of a gun until he climbed his perch on a nearby roof.\n\n\"The weapon had a collapsible stock which might explain why it was less easy to observe,\" he said.\n\nWray said Trump came into particular focus for the shooter on July 6, at which point he also performed a web search for the distance Lee Harvey Oswald was from president John F. Kennedy in the 1963 assassination in Dallas.\n\nHe said Wednesday that initial analysis of a laptop owned by Crooks included some \"foreign public figures,\" without specifying individuals.\n\nThe FBI has said it is investigating the shooting, which killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism and an attempted assassination. Trump's campaign said the presumptive GOP nominee was doing \"fine\" after the shooting, which Trump said pierced the upper part of his right ear.\n\nThe furor over the shooting led to bipartisan calls for the resignation of Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, which occurred on Tuesday.\n\nWhile a five-foot ladder was purchased by the shooter, Wray said, it was recovered not at the shooting perch nor in the shooter's vehicle, he added without specifying its location.\n\nInstead, officials believe Crooks used unspecified \"mechanical equipment\" from the ground and vertical piping on the side of the building to climb atop it.\n\nWray said eight cartridges were found on the roof after a countersniper fatally shot Crooks.\n\n\"He was able to get more rounds off more quickly than he would with other types of weapons,\" said Wray of the AR-15-style weapon used by Crooks. The gun was purchased by the shooter's father, legally, years earlier.\n\nOfficials are still analyzing a drone that Wray said Crooks flew 200 yards (182 metres) away from the stage just a few hours before the early evening shooting. It was recovered from the shooter's vehicle.\n\nThe FBI's director said there's no evidence that Crooks had any co-conspirators at this point.\n\nThree \"relatively crude\" explosive devices were found, he said, two in the shooter's vehicle at Butler and one at the shooter's home in nearby Bethel Park. Wray said Crooks had a transmitter on his person, but that it wasn't clear at this point if they would have resulted in explosions if he had utilized it.\n\nWray and other senior officials privately briefed members of Congress last week, telling them that Crooks had photos on his phone of Trump, Democratic President Joe Biden and other officials and had looked up the dates for the Democratic National Convention as well as Trump's appearances.\n\nBut he stressed that in contrast to other high-profile shooters, Crooks appears to have not left a significant online footprint or engaged extensively in conversations on public forums. He did say that Crooks at times used encrypted messaging apps, without getting into details of those messages.\n\nWray, as he has done at other congressional committee hearings, condemned harmful rhetoric and a heightened environment for threats, which have been directed at politicians, lawyers and judges and volunteer election officials. Wray himself was the subject of alleged threats, with a Georgia man indicted in that case earlier this month.\n\nNew York Democrat Jerry Nadler stressed that dehumanizing and violent rhetoric had often come from Republicans, including Trump himself.\n\n\"If you think that this one assassin's bullet was a bolt out of the blue, and not part of a wave of violence that has threatened this nation for years, then you have missed the point,\" said Nadler.\n\nDespite being appointed by Trump, Wray typically faces antagonistic questions from the Republican-led panel, a reflection of lingering discontent over the FBI's investigation into potential ties between Russia and the 2016 campaign, as well as an FBI search of Trump's Florida estate for classified documents after allegedly defying a subpoena.\n\nWray, in response to questions from Democrats, said he wasn't familiar with the details of Project 2025, the term for the Heritage Foundation's nearly 1,000-page handbook for the next Republican administration. But he expressed disapproval for any FBI reform that would involve the firing of civil servants for political reasons, or any director directly taking their cues on priorities from a president.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

It's being exploited and analyzed by the FBI lab. The drone was recovered in his vehicle. So at the time of the shooting, the drone was in his vehicle with the controller,\" Wray explained.\n\nHe told lawmakers that Crooks \"was flying the drone around the area\" of the rally around 4 p.m., about two hours before Trump took to the stage about 200 yards away.\n\nWray also testified about the weapon that Crooks had used, reportedly firing eight times before being killed by a US Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\n\"The weapon that he used for the attempted assassination was an AR-style rifle that was purchased legally, that he - as my understanding - acquired, I think bought actually from his father, who was the one who originally bought it,\" Wray said.\n\nThe FBI director noted that \"it is, quite frankly, a dangerous time to be a prominent public official.\"\n\nHe addressed reports of Crooks having done some online searches prior to the shooting.\n\n\"The shooter appears to have done a lot of searches of public figures in general, but so far we are seeing kind of news articles and things like that,\" Wray said, adding, \"so the images that have been reported about, really what we are talking about there are when you do a news search of an article the image appears in a cache as opposed to like a search for that specific individual.\"\n\nWray's testimony follows the dramatic grilling of now-former Secret Service Director Kim Cheatle before the House Oversight Committee on Monday. She subsequently resigned as the House Homeland Security Committee held a hearing Tuesday. Cheatle did not make an appearance at that hearing and neither did her boss, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\n\nHowever, the committee did hear testimony from other witnesses, including Colonel Christopher L. Paris, the commissioner of the Pennsylvania State Police, and Patrick Yoes, the National President of the Fraternal Order of Police.\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment,\" Wray said in his opening statement Wednesday. \"The shooter may be deceased but the FBI's investigation is ongoing.\"\n\n(Video Credit: Forbes Breaking News)\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

He added that the rifle had a collapsible stock, \"which could explain why it might have been less easy for people to observe.\"\n\nCrude explosive devices later recovered from Crooks' car and home were designed to be detonated remotely.

The FBI's investigation has thrust the bureau into a political maelstrom months before the presidential election, with lawmakers and the public pressing for details about what may have motivated Crooks in the most serious attempt to assassinate a president or presidential candidate since President Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He did note that Crooks had grown interested in public officials -- besides Trump, Crooks also had photos on his phone of Democratic President Joe Biden and other prominent figures -- and in the days before the shooting had appeared particularly consumed by Trump, the Republicans' White House nominee.\n\nWray also said that Crooks, about two hours before the shooting, had flown a drone about 200 yards (180 meters) from the rally stage where Trump would later stand and that Crooks used the device to livestream and watch footage. The use of the drone so close the rally site just hours before Trump took the stage for the rally add to the questions about the security lapses preceding the event.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWray pledged to lawmakers that the FBI would \"leave no stone unturned\" in its investigation.\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment, and tragically the Butler County assassination attempt is another example -- a particularly heinous and public one -- of what I've been talking about,\" Wray said.\n\nThe hearing had been scheduled well before the shooting, as part of the committee's routine oversight of the FBI and the Justice Department. Questions about the shooting dominated the session.\n\nElections GOP threatened to sue over November ballot if Biden dropped out. Experts call that 'ridiculous' ROBERT YOON Associated Press\n\nDespite being appointed by Trump, Wray typically faces antagonistic questions from the Republican-led panel, a reflection of lingering discontent over the FBI's investigation into potential ties between Russia and the 2016 campaign, when Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nThat sentiment was made clear early in the hearing when the committee chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told Wray: \"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation.\"\n\nThe FBI so far has avoided the same level of scrutiny over the shooting directed at the Secret Service over security failures that preceded the shooting and has led to the the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle,\n\nThe FBI has said it is investigating the shooting, which killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism and an attempted assassination. Trump's campaign said the presumptive GOP nominee was doing \"fine\" after the shooting, which Trump said pierced the upper part of his right ear.\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally 0 Comments Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "missoulian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "missoulian.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@missoulian.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "manuel_balce_ceneta@missoulian.com", "name": "Manuel Balce Ceneta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

CNN previously reported that the drone was found in his car following the shooting.\n\nIn addition, Crooks had two explosives in his car at the time of the shooting and one in his home, but likely did not have the ability to detonate them from the roof where he was killed, Wray testified.\n\n\"It looks like because of the on/off position on the receivers, that if he had tried to detonate those devices from the roof, it would not have worked,\" Wray said.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the shooting as both an attempted assassination and as a potential act of domestic terrorism.\n\nInvestigators say that Crooks fired approximately eight times from an AR-style rifle at the former president before being killed by a US Secret Service counter sniper.\n\nThe rifle Crooks used was purchased from his father, Wray testified.\n\n\"The weapon that he used for the attempted assassination was an AR-style rifle that was purchased legally, that he - as my understanding - acquired, I think bought actually from his father, who was the one who originally bought it,\" Wray said.\n\nPreviously, officials said they believed the firearm belonged to Crooks' father - not the shooter - and they didn't know how Crooks accessed the weapon.\n\nFBI officials have repeatedly asserted that they believe Crooks acted alone, and used a rifle purchased legally by his father. On Wednesday, Wray reiterated that there is no evidence of any co-conspirators.\n\n\"I have been saying some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment,\" Wray said. \"The shooter may be deceased but the FBI's investigation is ongoing.\"\n\nInvestigators have gone through the shooter's phone and computer, scoured his search history and bedroom and have interviewed his family and friends, but have struggled to identify what motivated the 20-year-old would be assassin to act.\n\nCrooks also had no prior contacts with the FBI, officials say, and had not been previously on their radar or databases.\n\nShooter was searching for news stories\n\nWray pushed back against reports that Crooks searched for images of specific prominent public officials online, saying that it appears he was actually searching for news articles.\n\n\"The shooter appears to have done a lot of searches of public figures in general, but so far we are seeing kind of news articles and things like that,\" Wray said. He continued, \"so the images that have been reported about, really what we are talking about there are when you do a news search of an article the image appears in a cache as opposed to like a search for that specific individual.\"\n\nThe FBI director cautioned that the effort to uncover Crooks' motive is ongoing, but warned that \"it is, quite frankly, a dangerous time to be a prominent public official.\"\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee hearing is ongoing.\n\nThis story is breaking and will be updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

What we've learned  --  and still don't know  --  about the assassination attempt.", "body": "FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers on Wednesday that the gunman who opened fire at former President Donald Trump's campaign rally looked up \"how far away\" John F. Kennedy's assassin was located on the day the former president was fatally shot.\n\nWray testified before the House Judiciary Committee about the FBI's investigation into the attempted assassination against Trump on July 13. He called the shooting \"an attack on our democracy and our democratic process and we will not and do not tolerate political violence of any kind.\"\n\n\"We're going to leave no stone unturned. The shooter may be deceased but the FBI's investigation is very much ongoing,\" Wray said, adding that the bureau is using all of its criminal and national security resources in the investigation.\n\nWray's testimony revealed new details about the gunman, identified by authorities as 20-year-old Thomas Crooks, who killed one person and wounded two others. He also fired a bullet that grazed Trump's ear, leaving him bleeding.\n\nGunman searched JFK assassination: Investigators found that on July 6, Crooks searched \"how far away was Oswald from Kennedy\" on Google. The search was referring to Lee Harvey Oswald, who assassinated Kennedy from the sixth floor of a building in 1963. \"That search is obviously significant in terms of his state of mind. That is the same day that it appears that he registered for the Butler rally,\" Wray said.\n\nThe \"collapsible stock\": When asked how the gunman was able to get a weapon to the nearby roof where he opened fire from, Wray said he didn't yet have an answer to that specific question. He testified that the gunman's weapon \"had a collapsible stock, which could explain why it might have been less easy for people to observe.\"\n\nHow the gunman got on the roof: Wray said investigators believe Crooks was able to get onto the roof by climbing up \"using some mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping on the side of the\" building. \"In other words, we do not believe he used a ladder to get up there.\"\n\nBullets on the roof: Wray said investigators \"have recovered eight cartridges on the roof.\"\n\nAccomplices? Wray was asked if there were any known co-conspirators, accomplices or cooperators who also took part in the rally shooting. \"Not at this time,\" Wray said. \"But again the investigation is ongoing.\"\n\nThe drone: Wray confirmed that Crooks flew a drone on July 13 over an area \"about 200 yards, give or take,\" from the rally hours before the shooting. He added that there was no recording of the roughly 11-minute drone flight, but believed the gunman was watching video streamed from the device to scout the area.\n\nCrooks's phone: Wray said gaining access to Crooks's phone was a \"significant technical challenge\" and that the gunman used encrypted messaging apps on his phone.\n\nExplosive devices: Wray said that two explosive devices were found in the gunman's car and one was found at his residence, classifying them as \"relatively crude,\" though they did have the capability of being \"detonated remotely.\" A transmitter was found on Crooks after he was killed. \"At a moment, it looks like because of the on/off position on the receivers, that if he had tried to detonate those devices from the roof, it would not have worked, but that doesn't mean the explosives weren't dangerous,\" Wray said.\n\nImages of political figures found on gunman's devices: Wray testified that the images of various political leaders found on the gunman's devices were \"cached images from searches of news articles.\" Wray explained that if someone reads a digital news article, the photos on said article will automatically get stored in the cache, as opposed to images specifically searched. This suggests the shooter was reading news articles on these political figures.\n\nThe gunman's motive: \"Many of us are interested in the motive of the shooter here, when it's an assault on a political figure, you immediately assume there's a political motive, and that may be the case here, we don't know yet,\" said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat. \"Can you enlighten us about that?\" Wray replied, \"I think it's fair to say that we do not yet have a clear picture of his motive.\" Typically there are motive answers through social media searches, messages or a manifesto, he explained. But Wray added: \"We're not seeing that, but we're digging in hard because this is one of the central questions for us.\"\n\nHow the gunman was able to fire eight shots: Wray was asked how the gunman was allowed to get eight shots out before he was neutralized by the Secret Service counter-sniper. \"That I think is something we're still digging into,\" Wray replied.\n\nWhy Trump was allowed to go on stage: The Secret Service knew that local law enforcement was looking for a suspicious person before Trump took the stage, one lawmaker said. Wray was asked why Trump was allowed to go on stage. \"We don't know the answer to that,\" he said, adding that the FBI's investigation is focused on the shooter, but acknowledged the intense interest in that key question.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images .\n\n. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nThe gunman who tried to assassinate former President Donald Trump searched online a week before the shooting about the killing of former President John F. Kennedy, the FBI director said Wednesday.\n\nIn testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, Christopher Wray provided an update on the investigation into the July 13 shooting of Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. That includes information extracted from a computer linked to 20-year-old shooter Thomas Crooks that suggests he spent at least a week planning the attack.\n\nAnalysis of a laptop computer that the investigation links to the shooter reveals that on July 6, he did a Google search for \"How far was Oswald from Kennedy?\" Wray said. That's a search that's obviously significant in terms of his state of mind. That's the same day he appears to have registered for the Butler rally.\n\nLee Harvey Oswald was the man who shot former President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas in 1963.\n\nIn his testimony, which comes 11 days after the attempted assassination of Trump, Wray provided few details about the shooter and the timeline leading up to the shooting.\n\nThe FBI has had access to Crooks' digital devices, Wray said, but investigators have yet to find anything that indicates a political motive or ideology.\n\n\"That said, it seems pretty clear that he was interested in public figures more generally and, I think importantly, starting around July 6, he was very focused on former President Trump and this rally,\" he told lawmakers.\n\nInvestigators believe Crooks visited the Butler rally site three times, Wray said.\n\nThe first time was a week before the event, and he was there for about 20 minutes. The second time was the morning of the Trump rally, and he appears to have been there for about 70 minutes, Wray said. The third time was later that afternoon, a few hours before the event, and he never left.\n\nDuring that last visit, Wray said, Crooks flew a drone over the rally grounds for 11 minutes around 4 p.m., about 200 yards from the scene.\n\nInvestigators found the drone in the shooter's vehicle, along with its controller. They were able to reconstruct the aircraft's flight path, Wray said, but they don't know exactly what Crooks saw or why.\n\nExplosive devices deactivated\n\nWray also discussed the three explosive devices recovered by investigators: two in Crooks' vehicle and one at his home. Wray described the devices as relatively crude, but said they could be detonated remotely.\n\nA transmitter was found on Crooks' body, he said, but it appears the receivers on the explosive devices were not turned on, so he could not have detonated them.\n\nInvestigators now believe, Wray said, that Crooks climbed to the roof from where he fired using \"mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping\" on the side of the building. The FBI has not yet determined when the shooter climbed to the roof.\n\nWray said Crooks' AR-style rifle had a collapsible stock, which Wray said \"might explain why it would have been less easy for people to observe.\"\n\nThe day before the shooting, Crooks went to a shooting range and fired an AR-style rifle, Wray said. The director described Crooks as a \"pretty avid shooting enthusiast.\"\n\nDescribed as solitary, few contacts\n\nInvestigators have conducted more than 400 interviews with a wide range of people so far, he said, which has helped form a picture of Crooks' identity.\n\n\"From everything we've seen, which is consistent with what we've learned in interviews, a lot of people describe him as a loner,\" Wray said. \"That's kind of consistent with what we see on his devices. His contact list, for example, is very short compared to what you would normally see for most people. There doesn't seem to be a lot of interaction between him face-to-face or digitally with a lot of people.\"\n\nNPR and other outlets have previously reported that investigators found images of President Biden, former President Trump, the attorney general and the FBI director on Crooks' phone.\n\nWray said the photos found were automatically stored from online searches and reading news articles.\n\n\"It doesn't appear to be any kind of target list,\" he said.\n\n\"These are cached images from ongoing searches, so from news articles. And again, there's nothing, no pattern, in this particular piece of information that's particularly remarkable so far.\"\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 24, 2020, / Compare-autoinsurance.Org has launched a new blog post that presents the main benefits of comparing multiple car insurance quotes.

Jim Jordan of Ohio, told Wray: \"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation.\"\n\nThough the FBI has avoided the same level of scrutiny over the shooting directed at the Secret Service over security failures that preceded the shooting, culminating Tuesday in the resignation of Director Kimberly Cheatle, Wray is likely to be questioned by lawmakers skeptical of the bureau's assessment that Crooks left behind no obvious ideological motive that could explain his actions.\n\nThe FBI has said it is investigating the shooting, which killed one rallygoer and seriously injured two others, as an act of domestic terrorism and an attempted assassination. Trump's campaign said the presumptive GOP nominee was doing \"fine\" after the shooting, which Trump said pierced the upper part of his right ear.\n\nWray and other senior officials privately briefed members of Congress last week, telling them that Crooks had photos on his phone of Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden and other officials and had looked up the dates for the Democratic National Convention as well as Trump's appearances.\n\nA law enforcement official told The Associated Press last week that Crooks had also flown a drone above the rally site before the event in an apparent effort to scope out the scene in advance.\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "lacrossetribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "La Crosse Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@lacrossetribune.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "manuel_balce_ceneta@lacrossetribune.com", "name": "Manuel Balce Ceneta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

FBI Director briefs Ohio's Jim Jordan on probe of Trump assassination attempt", "body": "WASHINGTON, D. C. - The day he registered to attend Donald Trump's July 13 campaign rally, the Pennsylvania man who tried to kill the former president searched Google for how far assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was from President John F. Kennedy when he shot him in 1963, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's director told the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.\n\n\"The attempted assassination of the former president was an attack on our democracy and our democratic process,\" FBI Director Christopher Wray told the committee chaired by Ohio's Jim Jordan. \"The men and women of the FBI will continue to work tirelessly to get to the bottom of what happened. We're bringing all the resources of the FBI to bear ... We're going to leave no stone unturned. The shooter may be deceased, but the FBI investigation is very much ongoing.\"\n\nWray told the committee that his agency's investigation is focusing on would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks, the 20-year-old who wounded Trump's right ear, killed firefighter Corey Comperatore, and injured two other rally attendees before a Secret Service sniper killed him.\n\nJordan told Wray he has \"a lot of unanswered questions\" about the security failures at the rally, that include failure to secure all the buildings and why Trump's security detail was denied requests for extra resources beforehand.\n\n\"We need to know what happened, play by play, moment by moment, second by second, the communications that took place\" during a roughly five minute period between when Crooks was spotted on the roof and when he took shots at Trump, Jordan said.\n\nWray told Jordan other investigations are examining why the Secret Service let Trump take the stage at the rally when witnesses spotted Crooks on a nearby roof before the shooting but said they don't yet know the answer to that.\n\nWray said his investigators have already interviewed around 400 people, gone through Crooks' home and his bedroom, and interviewed his parents. So far, they haven't found that Crooks had any accomplices or that he subscribed to any particular political ideology.\n\nSearches of Crooks' electronic devices indicated that he was broadly interested in public figures. Around July 6, the date he registered to attend the rally and searched for information on Lee Harvey Oswald, Wray said Crooks' became \"very focused\" on Trump and the rally.\n\nHe said the description of Crooks as a \"loner\" seems apt, as he had a shorter list of contacts than you'd see with most people. He said Crooks was a firearms enthusiast who went to a shooting range the day before the assassination attempt and shot an AR-style rifle of the sort used in the crime, though Wray was not sure it was the exact weapon.\n\nAlthough Crooks bought a 5-foot ladder shortly before the assassination attempt and its bloodied receipt was found on his body, Wray said the ladder wasn't found near the roof Crooks climbed to shoot at Trump. He said law enforcement believes he used mechanical equipment on the ground and vertical piping on the side of the building to get on the roof. Investigators found 8 shell casings there.\n\nWray said investigators recovered a drone in Crooks' vehicle, which Crooks used to surveil the fairgrounds for 11 minutes several hours before the rally. He said the drone flew around 200 yards away from the fairgrounds.\n\nLaw enforcement recovered two explosive devices from his vehicle, and one from his residence, which Wray described as \"relatively crude\" with the ability to be detonated remotely. He said Crooks had a transmitter with him when he was killed by law enforcement. He said the receivers on the bombs were turned off, so they probably would not have detonated if Crooks tried to do so from the roof.\n\nWhen Jordan asked him to provide a timeline of when law enforcement became aware of Crooks, Wray said local police spotted him with a range finder less than an hour before the attack and found it suspicious. He said a member of the public spotted Crooks on the roof within a \"handful of minutes\" of the attack, though he wasn't sure if a weapon was observed.

Viral Video Captures Chinese Immigrant's Disturbing Attack in NYC\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray disclosed new details about an attempted assassination plot against former President Donald Trump. The would-be assassin, Thomas Matthew Crooks, had meticulously planned the attack, including researching the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and flying a drone near the rally venue in Butler, Pennsylvania, just hours before Trump took the stage on July 13.\n\nThe FBI's investigation into Crooks' activities revealed a disturbing level of preparation. On July 6, the day the Trump rally was announced, Crooks conducted an internet search on his laptop, looking up \"how far away was Oswald from Kennedy.\" Director Wray highlighted this search during his testimony to the House Judiciary Committee, emphasizing its significance in understanding Crooks' state of mind. \"That's a search that's obviously significant in terms of his state of mind,\" Wray noted. \"That is the same day that it appears that he registered for the Butler rally.\"\n\nCrooks' activities on the day of the rally included flying a drone around the rally area at approximately 4 p.m., just two hours before Trump's appearance. The drone, airborne for about 11 minutes, provided Crooks with a live feed on his phone. After the incident, investigators found the drone in Crooks' car, along with two explosives and another at his home. However, Wray stated that Crooks likely could not have detonated the explosives from the roof where he was ultimately killed by a US Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nCrooks used an AR-style rifle with a collapsible stock, which he had purchased from his father, to fire approximately eight times at the former president. Initially, officials believed the firearm belonged to Crooks' father, but it was later confirmed that Crooks had bought it legally from him.\n\nDirector Wray pointed out the elevated threat environment in which prominent public officials currently operate, indicating that the FBI's investigation into the incident is ongoing. Despite thorough searches of Crooks' phone, computer, and personal history, investigators have yet to determine his exact motivation. Crooks had no prior contacts with the FBI and was not previously on their radar.\n\nAddressing reports that Crooks had searched for images of specific public officials, Wray clarified that these searches were actually for news articles. \"The shooter appears to have done a lot of searches of public figures in general, but so far we are seeing kind of news articles and things like that,\" Wray explained, emphasizing the difference between searching for news versus targeting individuals specifically.\n\nWray also mentioned a broader security threat posed by Iran, revealing that the FBI had informed the US Secret Service about an Iranian plot to assassinate Trump. While declining to provide specific classified details, Wray stressed the increased brazenness of the Iranian regime and anticipated more such threats in the future.\n\nThe hearing also included a pointed exchange between Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff and Director Wray, where Schiff criticized the Republican Party's decision to nominate Trump, a convicted felon, for the 2024 presidential election.", "source": {"uri": "newsx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsX"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Crooks was killed by law enforcement. The motive for the shooting remains unclear.\n\nCheatle resigned on Tuesday in the face of bipartisan demands to quit for the agency's failure to prevent the attempted assassination.\n\nBut while Wray is likely to hear demands for details of the incident on Wednesday, the shooting probe could be overshadowed by partisan divisions within the committee.\n\nThe FBI director has long faced opposition from hardline Republicans, some angered over the arrest of Trump supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as Congress certified President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.\n\n\"I would like to hear the truth. But I doubt it that's what we will hear,\" said Republican Representative Harriet Hageman, a Judiciary Committee member who said she would like to see Wray resign as FBI chief.\n\n\"They have circled the wagons and they're going to try to prevent us from getting the information that we need,\" she said.\n\nJudiciary Committee Democrats predicted that the hearing was unlikely to be productive.\n\n\"I'm expecting him to talk about how he's doing his best to keep our country safe.

This feature likely facilitated the weapon's concealment.\n\nDuring his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, Director Wray provided an overview of the incident. He reported that the weapon fired at Trump resulted in a bullet grazing his right ear, with additional consequences including the death of one spectator and injuries to two others.\n\nIn the days leading up to the attack, the assailant conducted research on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy from 1963. In his opening remarks, Wray described the event as \"an attack on our democracy and our democratic process\" and underscored that \"we will not and do not tolerate political violence of any kind, especially a despicable account of this magnitude.\"\n\nWray disclosed that the gunman, identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, was stationed on a rooftop during the incident. The authorities found eight shell casings at that location. The shooting was halted when a counter sniper neutralized Crooks.\n\nFurthermore, the weapon employed, resembling an AR-style rifle, possessed features that made it more portable. Witnesses first spotted the assailant with the rifle only after he had already climbed to the roof from which he fired.\n\nWray confirmed that the gunman had used a drone to survey the rally approximately two hours before opening fire. Investigators also recovered three homemade explosive devices from different locations including Crooks' home and vehicle. These devices were designed to be activated remotely, and Crooks was found to have a transmitter, although he was unable to detonate them while on the roof.\n\nWhile no clear motive has emerged from the investigation, it appears that Crooks became increasingly focused on Trump starting on July 6. This date marked the point when he searched for \"how far was Oswald from Kennedy\" and subsequently registered for the rally, according to Wray's statements to the committee.\n\nFollowing thorough inquiries, the FBI found no evidence suggesting that Crooks had collaborated with anyone else in planning the attack. Wray assured lawmakers that the FBI would \"leave no stone unturned\" in their investigation, highlighting the agency's commitment to resolving the case.\n\nIn conjunction with the fallout from the assassination attempt, Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle announced her resignation on the same day that Wray provided his testimony. This decision followed her appearance before a different congressional committee addressing security failures related to the incident.", "source": {"uri": "theglobalherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Global Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

He also alluded to distrust in the bureau, which has mainly come from Republicans in recent years who have argued that the FBI has sometimes targeted people with conservative viewpoints.\n\n\"The Committee has several unanswered questions about the failures that led to the attempted assassination of a president -- the first in over forty years -- as well as the FBI's ability to conduct a rapid, transparent, and thorough investigation in the wake of its recent scandals,\" Jordan wrote to Wray.\n\nWray is also expected to face questions about the massive security failures that led to the shooting, which left one dead and two in critical condition. The shooter, whom authorities identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, was able to fire multiple shots into the crowd from a nearby rooftop and came within inches of killing Trump. The former president was instead grazed by a bullet and suffered a minor injury to his ear.\n\nThe Secret Service is primarily responsible for Trump's security, and the historic failure led Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle to resign from her position Tuesday. However, Jordan has signaled that he will question Wray on some of the failings as well.\n\nJordan wrote to the FBI director that whistleblowers informed him that the FBI was part of the security planning process when a Secret Service special agent in charge revealed that resources were \"limited\" the week of the rally because of the NATO summit in Washington, D.C.\n\nWray is also expected to be questioned about the mystery surrounding Crooks's motive, which the FBI has not yet established.\n\nWray assured lawmakers last week in a briefing about the shooting that the bureau would leave \"no stone unturned,\" according to a source familiar with the briefing.\n\nFBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate said in the briefing that agents had conducted more than 220 interviews and searched Crooks's phone, home, and vehicle. He said evidence seized around Crooks's body, including the rifle he used in the shooting, a remote transmitter, and his cellphone, were all being examined at FBI labs in Quantico, Virginia.\n\nA 20-year-old with no clear ideology climbing atop a roof about 400 feet from Trump and firing directly at the former president and GOP presidential nominee has left lawmakers across the political spectrum in a state of bafflement, and they are expected to press for more details from Wray when they confront him at the hearing.\n\nDespite the hearing's anticipated focus on the assassination attempt, other issues could also surface. A top focus for the GOP-led committee has been what they say is the FBI's weaponization of its authority.\n\nRepublican lawmakers could raise questions on that front about FBI whistleblowers who have come forward in recent years about their concerns that the bureau was retaliating against them, particularly for their views on the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe FBI revealed last month in a letter that it had reinstated the security clearance of one of the whistleblowers, Marcus Allen. Allen, who received 27 months of back pay, had come forward to the committee with allegations that the bureau's move to revoke his security clearance indefinitely was retaliation, and lawmakers may now want to question Wray on what happened that led the FBI to reverse its position on Allen after more than two years.\n\nOther topics the committee has focused on that lawmakers could broach at the hearing include FBI agents meeting with social media companies about their censorship practices and the roughly 375 migrants on the terrorist watchlist who have crossed into the United States illegally during the Biden administration.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashley_oliver@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Ashley Oliver", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Examiner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Examiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

In the first, he spent about 20 minutes at the scene. He returned twice on the day of the shooting, July 13, for about 70 minutes in the morning and then later that afternoon, when he appeared to fly a drone in the vicinity for about 11 minutes.\n\n\"It appears that around 3:50 p.m., 4, in that window, on the day of the shooting, that the shooter was flying the drone around the area,\" Wray said, noting that it was \"not over the stage but about 200 yards, give or take, away from that.\"\n\nThe shooting left Trump's ear bloodied, killed a rallygoer who had been sitting in the stands, and seriously injured two others.\n\nSecret Service snipers killed the gunman, Thomas Crooks, 20, after locating him on a nearby roof. Crooks was armed with an AR-15-style rifle and had magazines for the rifle and a bulletproof vest in his car along with the drone. The FBI managed to reconstruct the flight path of the drone, though it did not recover any video or pictures from it.\n\nThe gunman's father had purchased the gun more than a decade ago, but Wray said Wednesday that the son bought the rifle from his father and that the family had 14 firearms in the house. Wray described Crooks as \"a fairly avid shooting hobbyist.\"\n\n\"We believe based on what we've seen that his father, after purchasing the gun, legally sold the gun to his son,\" Wray told lawmakers, saying he did not have the amount of transfer. The father purchased the weapon in 2013, selling it to his son in October 2023, he later added.\n\nThe day of the shooting, about 1:30 p.m., Crooks bought 50 rounds of ammunition, Wray said.\n\nThe rifle had a collapsible stock, Wray added, suggesting that perhaps that made the gunman less noticeable, and he confirmed that eight bullet cartridges were recovered from the roof where the gunman opened fire.\n\nSo far, Wray said, the FBI has not found a motive for the shooting, though the gunman appears to be a loner with a small number of contacts in his phone. Still, the bureau continues to examine the gunman's electronic devices for additional clues about Crooks's mindset and movements beforehand.\n\n\"It's fair to say we do not yet have a clear picture of his motive,\" Wray said, adding that the bureau's behavioral analysis unit was assembling a profile of the shooter.\n\nHe noted that the gunman used encrypted messaging applications and described explosive devices found in the gunman's car as \"crude\" but said they were able to be detonated remotely.\n\nAgents had recovered a ladder that Crooks had bought the morning of the shooting, Wray said, adding that it was not at the scene of the shooting. Investigators found a bloody Home Depot receipt for the ladder in Crooks's pocket. Wray said that Crooks did not use the ladder but instead climbed on some equipment and piping on the side of the building to reach the top.\n\nOfficials investigating the matter, including lawmakers in hearings this week, have questioned why the Secret Service's security perimeter did not include the building from which the gunman eventually fired and why no law enforcement officer was stationed there during the rally. They have also asked why Trump was allowed to take the stage when law enforcement, including the Secret Service and the local police, was searching for a suspicious person.\n\nDuring testimony before Congress on Monday, Kimberly A. Cheatle, then the head of the Secret Service, faced withering questions from both sides of the political aisle, repeatedly declining to answer questions about the security lapses that led to the assassination attempt.\n\nIn the face of mounting calls that she step down, Cheatle resigned a day later.\n\nOn Tuesday, Colonel Christopher L. Paris, the top Pennsylvania police official, told lawmakers that two snipers from a Butler County tactical unit had first noticed Crooks acting suspiciously about 15 minutes before Trump began speaking.\n\nThat unit had been responsible for monitoring the roof of a nearby warehouse, where Crooks ultimately began firing his gun, Paris testified. He said that the two snipers, who were stationed by the second-story windows of an adjacent building, left their post to go look for Crooks shortly before the shooting began.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Butler County district attorney, Richard Goldinger, who oversees that tactical team, released a statement saying that some of this had been \"misstated.\" One of the snipers had left the building to track down Crooks, Goldinger wrote, but returned before the shooting began, while the other stayed inside the whole time. He added that neither of them could see Crooks on the roof from where they were stationed.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AR-15\u2013style_rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AR-15\u2013style rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletproof_vest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bulletproof vest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartridge_(firearms)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cartridge (firearms)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Encryption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colonel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warehouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_County,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Butler County, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler County, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Reloading", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Reloading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/2y8vi32Ed41OPghHTHu8FzMZctQ=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/AUXWC5ETFBGAIYX4CDWHUQRSCA.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758656", "eventUri": "eng-9758656", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-07", "textStart": 401, "textEnd": 407}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 544, "textEnd": 551}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

On Wednesday, Wray reiterated that there is no evidence of any co-conspirators.\n\n\"I have been saying some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment,\" Wray said. \"The shooter may be deceased but the FBI's investigation is ongoing.\"\n\nInvestigators have gone through the shooter's phone and computer, scoured his search history and bedroom and have interviewed his family and friends, but have struggled to identify what motivated the 20-year-old would be assassin to act.\n\nCrooks also had no prior contacts with the FBI, officials say, and had not been previously on their radar or databases.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee hearing is ongoing.\n\nThis story is breaking and will be updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Crooks also likely tested the weapon at a shooting range the day before the attack.\n\nThe previously unreported details were disclosed to members of Congress as lawmakers press for answers about apparent security lapses and what fueled the attempted assassination of the former president.\n\n\"The attempted assassination of the former president was an attack on our democracy,\" Wray said in his testimony. \"I recognize the congressional and public interest in this case.\"\n\nThe gunman -- who fired several rounds during the rally on July 13, striking Trump's right ear and killing one attendee and critically injuring at least two others -- visited the rally site a week before the event and spent roughly 20 minutes at the scene.\n\nHe visited again, twice, on the day of the shooting, spending about 70 minutes at the fairgrounds in the morning and then returning in the afternoon to fly a drone for roughly 20 minutes approximately 200 yards from the staging area, Wray testified.\n\nLaw enforcement officials believe he flew a drone around 3:50pm and 4pm, roughly two hours before the shooting.\n\nBefore Trump took the stage, Crooks climbed to a nearby roof outside of the security perimeter. Secret Service snipers fatally shot Crooks after he fired several rounds moments into Trump's remarks.\n\nThe rifle had a collapsible stock, which Wray said could have made it easier to conceal from anyone in the crowd.\n\nFBI agents also recovered eight bullet cartridges from the roof, along with a \"transmitter\" for an explosive device. There were magazines and a bulletproof vest in his car, along with the drone and at least two explosive devices.\n\nThe explosive devices \"are relatively -- again, key word, relatively -- crude devices ... but they did have the ability to be detonated remotely,\" Wray said.\n\n\"At the moment, it looks to us -- again, ongoing review, and I can't say that too many times -- it looks like because of the on-off position on the receivers, that if he had tried to detonate those devices from the roof, it would not have worked. But that doesn't mean it wasn't dangerous,\" he said.\n\nLaw enforcement officials have conducted more than 400 interviews as part of the investigation, including interviews with Crooks's parents. Wray said they were cooperative with agents.\n\n\"We have not identified any accomplices, co-conspirators or anything along those lines,\" Wray said. \"We have not seen anything so far that he acted with others.\"\n\nWray testified to the committee two days after lawmakers grilled now-former Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle, who took \"full responsibility for any security lapse\" surrounding the shooting, which she called \"the most significant operational failure at the Secret Service in decades.\"\n\nAfter widespread calls from members of both parties for her resignation, Cheatle stepped down the next morning.\n\nSecret Service deputy director Ronald L Rowe Jr has stepped in as acting director.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Carter", "body": "FBI Director Christopher Wray disclosed several new details about the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump during a Wednesday hearing before the House Judiciary Committee. Among the details revealed was that the would-be assassin, Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, conducted extensive research on the Oswald-Kennedy assassination before his attempt on Trump's life.\n\nThe assassination attempt occurred during a Trump campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Crooks managed to position himself on a rooftop outside the rally and fired into the crowd, wounding Trump and killing former fire chief Corey Comperatore. Two others were critically injured before a Secret Service counter-sniper neutralized Crooks.\n\nA search of Crooks's laptop revealed that he began researching the Trump rally roughly one week before the event. His browsing history indicated he was reading news articles about various public figures, though Wray stated there was no clear pattern to these readings. The FBI has not uncovered any manifesto or other evidence explaining why Crooks targeted Trump.\n\nOn July 6, Crooks searched \"how far away was Oswald from Kennedy,\" referencing the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald, who fired from a sixth-floor window in the Texas School Book Depository. Kennedy was approximately 180 feet away when Oswald fired, according to the Warren Commission. Crooks was roughly 450 feet away when he fired eight rounds in Trump's direction, one of which struck the former president in the ear.\n\nWray testified that the FBI is still investigating why Trump was not prevented from taking the stage after law enforcement became aware of Crooks's presence. The FBI found no evidence that Crooks had co-conspirators and considers him a \"loner\" based on interviews and his limited contacts.\n\nThe FBI is leading the investigation into the security failures at the rally, working with federal, state, and local partners. Crooks was identified as the shooter hours after the attack, and the investigation was promptly initiated. Wray emphasized that the FBI has been \"unusually\" transparent about the details of the ongoing investigation, which continues to evolve.\n\nThe FBI recovered eight casings from the rooftop but is still determining how Crooks managed to fire those shots. Crooks had two explosives in his car and one at his residence, but the FBI believes he could not have detonated them from the rooftop. FBI technicians are analyzing the explosives.\n\nTwo hours before the shooting, Crooks flew a drone over an area approximately 200 yards from the stage. The FBI believes he was live-streaming drone footage to get a view of the stage. Crooks visited the premises three times: a 20-minute visit a week before the rally, a 70-minute visit the morning of the rally, and his final return in the afternoon.\n\nCrooks used an \"AR-style\" rifle purchased legally from his father, who bought it from a gun store. The rifle had a collapsible stock, possibly allowing Crooks to conceal it upon entering the rally area. How Crooks accessed the rooftop remains unclear, though the FBI discovered he purchased a five-foot ladder, which was not found at the scene.\n\nPrior to the shooting, Crooks was not on the FBI's radar, and Wray stated no FBI informants or agents were at the rally. Wray described the FBI's \"complex threat environment\" and acknowledged the public's interest in understanding the events at the rally.\n\nDisgraced former Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle testified Monday, deferring to the FBI's investigation and failing to explain significant security lapses. Cheatle's inadequate responses and lack of detail led to bipartisan calls for her resignation, which she submitted on Tuesday.\n\nIn contrast, Wray provided detailed answers about Crooks's activities, maintaining caution due to the ongoing investigation. The FBI continues to scrutinize the incident, focusing on understanding Crooks's preparations, motives, and the broader implications for security at high-profile events.", "source": {"uri": "saraacarter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sara A.

(Julia Nikhinson/Getty Images/file)\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray testified Wednesday at a hearing on the investigation into the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, revealing that the shooter was not on the FBI's radar prior to the attack.\n\nMembers of the House panel grilled Mr. Wray about the agency's probe into the shooting at former President Trump's campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. His testimony was held after Secret Service Kimberly Cheatle testified on Capitol Hill. She resigned shortly after.\n\nThe FBI chief, who has served as the agency's director since 2017, testified that the agency did not have any information about 20-year-old Thomas Crooks ahead of the July 13 shooting.\n\nMr. Wray testified that around July 6, the shooter became focused on former President Trump and his rally in Butler. The bureau recovered and recently analyzed the shooter's laptop which revealed that he did a Google search that day on \"how far away was Oswald from Kennedy,\" referring to Lee Harvey Oswald and the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963.\n\nMr. Wray also revealed the shooter visited the site a week before the attack.\n\n\"We believe that the first time he traveled to the grounds was a week before. He spent roughly 20 minutes there. Then he went to the grounds again on the morning of the event, it appears, for about 70 minutes ... and then he came back in the afternoon, for good,\" Mr. Wray testified.\n\nThe FBI recovered eight shell casings on the roof where the shooter was stationed. Mr. Wray also revealed for the first time details about the AR-15-style weapon used in the shooting.\n\n\"The weapon had a collapsible stock which could explain why it may have been less easy for people to observe,\" he stated.\n\nHe also testified that the shooter flew a drone \"around the area\" of the venue about two hours prior to the rally. The FBI believes that he watched video streamed from the drone to scout the area. That drone was found in his vehicle and continues to be examined and analyzed by the FBI lab, Mr. Wray said.\n\nAdditionally, two \"relatively crude\" explosive devices were found in his vehicle and another one in his residence. The devices \"could be detonated remotely,\" according to the FBI director. The agency found the transmitter to those devices on the shooter himself but the receivers on the bombs in his vehicle were turned off.\n\nMr. Wray also testified that investigators recovered the shooter's cell phone, which presented a \"significant technical challenge\" because the shooter used encrypted messaging apps to communicate.\n\nHe also noted that the agency has possession of a five-foot ladder that the shooter purchased. Mr. Wray did not release details where the ladder was found but confirmed it was not at the scene or in his car.\n\nRep. Dan Bishop (R-N.C.) asked Mr. Wray why former President Trump was not kept off stage. Mr. Wray then emphasized that the FBI's investigation is focused on the shooter, the motives behind his attack, and whether he had any co-conspirators or accomplices. He referred any other questions beyond that to the Secret Service and its probe.\n\n\"There are a lot of unanswered questions about security failures that day,\" Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) stated in his opening remarks.\n\nIn addition to the FBI's criminal probe, several inquiries have been launched into the attempted assassination of the 45th president. The Secret Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security's internal watchdog are examining the security failures that allowed the shooting to happen. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries have announced they will create a bipartisan task force to probe the shooting. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has also appointed an independent panel to examine the attack.\n\n\"This is not just an attack on a man, but an attack on our democracy,\" Ranking Member Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) stated.\n\nMr. Wray told lawmakers the FBI will \"continue to work tirelessly\" to investigate the attempted assassination and pledged to leave \"no stone unturned,\" adding that Americans are currently living in an \"elevated threat environment.\"\n\nFormer President Trump and two others were wounded in the shooting while another attendee was killed.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.mr", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": ".mr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

The FBI chief is currently testifying at a hearing on the investigation into the incident.\n\nIn testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, Mr Wray revealed new details about what happened before the July 13 shooting in Pennsylvania, where Trump was hit in the ear by a bullet fired by Thomas Matthew Crooks.

Kennedy assassination\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers Wednesday the agency would leave no stone unturned in its investigation of the gunman behind the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe director, testifying before the House Judiciary Committee as part of an oversight hearing for the agency, detailed information that authorities have discovered about the July 13 shooting at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania that injured the former president, left one spectator dead and another two critically injured.\n\nWray testified that they do not yet have a clear picture of the gunman's motive. He said the gunman was interested in public figures, and around July 6 or so became focused on Trump and the rally.\n\nThe shooter on July 6 did a Google search for, \"How far away was Oswald from Kennedy,\" Wray said, citing an analysis of a laptop that the investigation tied to the shooter.\n\n\"That is the same day that it appears that he registered for the Butler rally,\" Wray said.\n\nWray said authorities have recovered three explosive devices -- two in the shooter's vehicle and one from his residence. He also told lawmakers the gunman flew a drone at around 3:50 p.m. or 4 p.m. on the day of the shooting, about 200 yards away from the stage. Trump took the stage about two hours later, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe director also sought to balance expectations of what he could share with lawmakers, while acknowledging the interest in the case from Congress and the public.\n\nWary said he wanted to provide information but also sought to respect the ongoing investigative process and make sure he did not prematurely provide information that turns out to be different later on.\n\n\"We have tried to be transparent with both Congress and the American people as we're going along in the investigation -- frankly unusually so for an ongoing investigation -- given the sheer nature of it,\" Wray said. \"We have provided a lot of information. I expect to continue to provide information.\"\n\nMembers of Congress are searching for answers about the security failures at the rally and have launched multiple inquiries into the assassination attempt. The House is expected to adopt a resolution this week to establish a task force on the shooting.\n\nLawmakers say they are looking for transparency in the wake of the incident, a topic that was on full display earlier this week when then-Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle sidestepped or gave limited answers to a string of lawmaker questions at a House Oversight and Accountability Committee hearing. She has since resigned, a move that came after a wave of criticism about her agency's failure to protect Trump.\n\nAt Wednesday's hearing, Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said a portion of the country has a \"healthy skepticism\" regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a \"fair, honest, open and transparent investigation.\"\n\n\"They can't tell us who planted the pipe bombs on January 6,\" said Jordan, a frequent critic of the FBI.\n\nWray said the agency is investigating the gunman to find out his motive and his preparations before the shooting, along with whether there were any co-conspirators or accomplices.\n\nUnder questioning from Rep. Dan Bishop, R-N.C., Wray testified they have not developed any evidence at this time to suggest there were any accomplices, cooperators or assisters.\n\n\"But again, the investigation's ongoing,\" Wray said.\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, used his opening statement to condemn the assassination attempt, saying the incident was \"not just an attack on a man, but an attack on our democracy.\"\n\n\"Political violence erodes the very foundations of our nation, the concepts of freedom of speech, of peaceful transitions of power, of a democratic government at its core,\" he said. \"These cannot exist if political violence is allowed to fester and to go unchecked.\"", "source": {"uri": "rollcall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Roll Call"}, "authors": [{"uri": "todd_ruger@rollcall.com", "name": "Todd Ruger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

The FBI is investigating the shooting as an act of domestic terrorism and an attempted assassination.\n\nThe hearing was scheduled before the July 13 shooting as part of routine oversight of the FBI and Justice Department, which have both under the spotlight in the GOP-led House for the criminal cases against the former president that are likely on hold past Election Day after the Supreme Court issued a ruling giving presidents immunity.\n\nWray and Attorney General Merrick Garland have both been the focus of repeated contentious hearings in front of House GOP-led committees amid lingering frustration over its 2016 investigation of Trump's ties to Russia, the prosecution of rioters at the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol and the legal cases against Trump.\n\nThe Secret Service has taken the brunt of the congressional criticism for the attempt on Trump's life, leading to the resignation of director Kimberly Cheatle, but Wray is likely to face tough questioning on the lack of details about a potential motive behind the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania. Cheatle faced the House earlier this week and was grilled for hours over the security lapse that allowed Crooks to get access to a rooftop some 150 yards away from where Trump was speaking with a gun, frequently frustrating lawmakers by dodging questions or failing to provide concise details.", "source": {"uri": "abc45.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WXLV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Lynch\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - FBI Director Christopher Wray told a congressional panel on the attempted assassination of Donald Trump on Wednesday that his agency will leave \"no stone unturned\" to discover how officials failed to stop the shooting.\n\nWray appeared before the House Judiciary Committee to answer questions about the shooting and the FBI's investigation of suspected shooter, 20-year-old nursing home aide Thomas Crooks, who got close enough to a July 13 campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, to wound the Republican presidential candidate.\n\n\"I have been saying for some time now that we are living in an elevated threat environment. And tragically, the ... assassination attempt is another example, particularly heinous,\" Wray testified. \"We're going to leave no stone unturned. The shooter may be deceased, but the FBI investigation is very much ongoing.\"\n\nTrump was shot in the ear, one rally attendee was killed and two others were wounded. Crooks was killed by law enforcement. The motive for the shooting remains unclear.\n\nKimberly Cheatle resigned as director of the U.S. Secret Service on Tuesday in the face of bipartisan demands to quit over the failure to prevent the attempted assassination.\n\nWhile Wray is likely to hear demands for details of the incident on Wednesday, the shooting probe appeared to be overshadowed from the start by partisan divisions within the committee.\n\nJudiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan said he expected Wray to answer questions about happened before, during and after the incident but expressed doubt about the FBI director's answers even before the questioning began.\n\n\"I'm sure you understand that a significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation,\" Jordan said.\n\nRepresentative Jerrold Nadler, the panel's top Democrat, condemned the Trump shooting \"unequivocally and unabashedly\" but pointed to years of political threats and violence, and violent rhetoric from Republicans including Trump himself.\n\n\"If you think that this one assassin's bullet was a bolt out of the blue, and not part of a wave of violence that has threatened this nation for years, then you have missed the point,\" the New York Democrat said.\n\nWray has long faced opposition from hardline Republicans, some angered over the arrest of Trump supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as Congress certified President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.\n\n(Reporting by David Morgan and Sarah N.

Officials have not announced how Crooks obtained the gun, however, it is not legally required for gun owners to store their weapons in a locked safe in the state of Pennsylvania.\n\nAdditionally, Crooks was found to have two remote detonation explosive devices in his vehicle during the shooting, as well as another explosive found in his home.\n\nWray went into further detail about the findings, explaining:\n\n\"It looks like because of the on/off position on the receivers, that if he had tried to detonate those devices from the roof, it would not have worked.\"\n\nHowever, Wray's comments still give little insight into the motive of Crooks.\n\nInvestigators also claim that they have still not been able to find \"conclusive evidence\" as to why Crooks attempted to assassinate former President Donald Trump. Nonetheless, in 2021, Crooks had donated to ActBlue, a donation platform for Democrat candidates and progressive causes.\n\n\"That's a search that's obviously significant in terms of his state of mind,\" said the FBI director.\n\nDuring the House Judiciary hearing, The FBI director also noted that at around 4 p.m., Crooks flew a drone around 200 yards away from the main stage for roughly 11 minutes, which happened to be two hours before Trump took the stage.\n\n\"He was live streaming the footage\" Wray continued.\n\nThe FBI director also confirmed that Crooks visited the site of the rally three times prior to the shooting in order to prepare. He visited the site one time during the week before the shooting, and two separate times the day of as well.\n\nCrooks did not have any formal military training, however, he was a \"fairly avid shooting hobbyist,\" Wray claimed. Yet, this statement contradicts what fellow high school students who knew Crooks said of him. He had previously wanted to join his school's rifle team, but he was \"so comically bad\" at shooting during try-outs that it prompted mockery from the other students.\n\nThe 20-year-old was not on any official watch list or database pertaining to security concerns, officials added.\n\n\"We did not have any information about the shooter,\" stated the FBI director.\n\nStay informed!

Adam Schiff of California, Wray revealed that on July 6, would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks both registered for the July 13 Trump rally and sought a chilling piece of information dating back more than six decades.\n\nThe FBI director began by acknowledging that the FBI had yet to discover why Crooks decided to shoot the former president.\n\n\"A lot of the usual repositories of information have not yielded anything notable in terms of motive,\" Wray said.\n\nCrooks, it seems, simply had an unusual fixation on famous people. In fact, the director very generically described the shooter as \"interested in public figures.\"\n\nThen came a revelation that Wray hyped as \"important.\"\n\n\"Starting somewhere around July 6 or so, he became very focused on former President Trump and this rally,\" he said of Crooks.\n\n\"And, so, one of the things that I can share here today that has not been shared yet is that we just in the last couple days found that, from our review -- to your point about devices -- analysis of a laptop that the investigation ties to the shooter reveals that on July 6 he did a Google search for, quote, how far away was Oswald from Kennedy,\" the director said.\n\nLee Harvey Oswald assassinated then-President John F.

Wray made the bombshell revelation to Congress on Wednesday during a grilling by lawmakers on the investigation into the assassination attempt on the former president and the massive security failures. Crooks shot Trump in the ear just 400 feet away from the stage in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13 from the roof of a nearby building just outside the security perimeter of the event. Wray revealed that investigators found Crooks had a drone that he used to survey the scene hours before the event started, which was recovered from his car parked nearby. He flew the drone around 4 p.m. over the area of the rally close to '200 yards' from the stage to survey the scene. Trump took the stage around 6:03 p.m., over two hours later.\n\nThe FBI has also recovered three 'explosive devices' in possession of Crooks. They were 'relatively crude devices' but had the ability 'to be detonated remotely,' Wray said. The FBI director said eight bullet cartridges had been recovered from the roof where Crooks fired off his shots toward the former president. And he wouldn't rule out that Crooks did not have any accomplices to the crime, saying it's still being looked at by law enforcement. As Wray faced questions about why the president was allowed on stage despite the 'threat' being identified 20 minutes before the shots were fired, Wray said, 'we don't know the answer to that.' But he insisted his investigation was not focused on the security breach and the Secret Service failures.\n\n'Our investigation is focused on the shooter and all things related to his attack.' His hearing comes days after the former Director of Secret Service Kimberly Cheatle was forced to resign after evading answering rounds of questioning by punting to the FBI in another congressional hearing earlier this week. Wray promised his agency would leave 'no stone unturned' and emphasized that he wanted to provide all the information he had at this point of the ongoing investigation. 'The shooter may be deceased but the FBI's investigation is very much ongoing.' He also made a reference to the warnings he has been giving Congress for years now about the threats of domestic terrorism. The shooting is 'another example, particularly heinous and very public one of what I have been talking about.'\n\nWray again warned about 'passion and heated rhetoric turning into actual violence.' 'We've seen it against public officials of all sorts, we've seen it against law enforcement the number of officers shot and killed in the line of duty is alarming.' 'It's almost every five days that a law enforcement officer is killed in the line of duty, that is an example of the kinds of ways passion and heated rhetoric can bubble over into violence.' The Judiciary Committee hearing is expected to focus on both the shooting at the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally and the 'ongoing politicization' of the FBI. Questioning on a separate foiled Iranian plot to assassinate Donald Trump is sure to be a topic of contention. A bombshell report last week revealed the U.S. received intelligence of an Iranian assassination plot in the weeks before Trump was shot at the Pennsylvania rally.\n\nMeanwhile, House Republicans are expected to set up a bipartisan task force to investigate the shooting in a vote this week. The FBI and Secret Service revealed to lawmakers last week they spotted shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks as a person of interest a full 62 minutes before he fired a shot. Twenty minutes passed between the time Secret Service agents spotted Crooks with a gun on the rooftop and he fired shots at the president. In a staggering moment, Cheatle admitted on Monday her agents on the ground were warned between two and five times that there was a 'suspicious person' reported before Trump took the stage. While Trump walked around with little more than a bloody ear, Crooks killed former fire chief Corey Comperatore, 50, and critically injured two other rally goers sitting close to where the former president was speaking last weekend before he was neutralized.\n\nThe security chief had faced mounting questions over why an agent was not stationed on the roof from where gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire on the former president, and why Trump was allowed to take the stage even when a threat was detected. She had also been ridiculed for suggesting her agency did not have a presence on the roof because it was 'sloped.' The 20-year-old shooter Crooks, was able to get within 160 yards of the stage where the former president was speaking when he opened fire. The building on which he stood was outside the security perimeter, despite clearly being within rifle shooting range. And that was despite the FBI learning of a threat on Trump's life from Iran leading to a bump in security for the former president in the days before the July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nCheatle said she believed she was the 'best person' to lead the Secret Service at this time, but later acquiesced to the bipartisan demands for her resignation. On the day of the rally, Trump walked out onto the stage at 6:02 p.m. Then at around 6:12 p.m. Crooks' first shots rang out. Cheatle could not tell lawmakers how the shooter had gotten onto the roof. At the time of the shooting, law enforcement agents were inside the building, 147 yards away from where Trump stood, but not on top of it. Cheatle curiously claimed no officers had been placed on the roof because it was sloped. 'That building in particular has a sloped roof at its highest point. And so, you know, there's a safety factor that would be considered there that we wouldn't want to put somebody up on a sloped roof,' she told ABC News in an interview Tuesday.\n\n'And so, you know, the decision was made to secure the building, from inside.' What transpired instead was a security nightmare: Thomas Matthew Crooks was able to scale the building and secure his own position, while law enforcement struggled to locate him even amid pressing warnings from members of the Trump crowd. But there wasn't sufficient time to act on the tips, she explained. 'The shooter was actually identified as a potential person of suspicion,' Cheatle said. 'Unfortunately, with the rapid succession of how things unfolded, by the time that individual was eventually located, they were on the rooftop and were able to fire off at the former president.' She was referencing claims by witnesses that they alerted law enforcement about the threat, but agents weren't able to eliminate the threat in time. Officials have pointed to the initial responding officer, who lifted himself up on the roof only to lower himself back when the gunman turned his weapon at him.\n\nCheatle has taken the blame for the fateful security breach, but has denied calls to step down. 'The buck stops with me,' she said. 'It was unacceptable,' she told ABC. 'And it's something that shouldn't happen again.' 'While we give overwhelming thanks to the individual Secret Service agents who did their jobs under immense pressure, this tragedy was preventable. The Secret Service has a zero fail mission, but it failed on July 13 and in the days leading up to the rally,' Comer is also expected to say, as he will again call for Cheatle's resignation. Also coming into question on the call was the possible motive for Crooks to commit such an atrocity. Officials did not confirm an operating motive and said that his rationale remains a mystery. Authorities said that they have yet to find any ideological material that could shine light on why Crooks decided to shoot the former president. But, they did reveal that Crooks operated several accounts on encrypted platforms that they are still working to gain access to.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

This revelation came to light today during a congressional hearing where FBI Director Christopher Wray provided new details about the assassination attempt.\n\nWray revealed that the shooter, Thomas Crooks, had early access to the rally site before Trump took the stage. Newly released video shows the rooftop where Thomas Crooks attempted to assassinate Trump\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nAn unidentified agent can be heard on body camera video \"I believe the sniper that was seen in pictures was inside that building there, so that's the sniper who sent the original pictures, he's the guy who saw him near the bike.\" Said an unidentified federal agent In the video, law enforcement discusses spotting Crooks before losing sight of him.: \"Detain those guys, find out what they know. I'm trying to get good information.\"\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray testified before a congressional committee today that Crooks fired 8 shots within 5 seconds from his father's AR-15 rifle.\n\nHe also said that two hours before the rally, Crooks launched a drone to conduct surveillance of the rally site, approximately 200 yards from the stage.\n\nWray said \"We have discovered a drone that the shooter used, and it's being analyzed by the FBI lab.\" \"We think he was livestreaming the event, two hours before the event, yes.\"\n\nInvestigators noted the drone was in the air for approximately 11 minutes, with Crooks watching the live stream on his phone.\n\nWray also revealed that Crooks was prepared for more damage with explosive devices. \"We've discovered three devices (explosive), two in his vehicle and one at his residence.\" Said wray\n\nA search of Crooks' digital devices showed he researched news stories and images of several prominent political figures, including Trump and President Joe Biden.\n\nWray cautioned that the motive behind the attempted assassination is still not fully understood.\n\nNews4Jax also spoke with Scott Erickson who is the Director of the Center for Law and Justice at the America First Policy Institute.

He said the gunman was interested in public figures, and around July 6 or so became focused on Trump and the rally.\n\nThe shooter on July 6 did a Google search for, \"How far away was Oswald from Kennedy,\" Wray said, citing an analysis of a laptop that the investigation tied to the shooter.\n\n\"That is the same day that it appears that he registered for the Butler rally,\" Wray said.\n\nWray said authorities have recovered three explosive devices -- two in the shooter's vehicle and one from his residence. He also told lawmakers the gunman flew a drone at around 3:50 p.m. or 4 p.m. on the day of the shooting, about 200 yards away from the stage. Trump took the stage about two hours later, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe director also sought to balance expectations of what he could share with lawmakers, while acknowledging the interest in the case from Congress and the public.\n\nWary said he wanted to provide information but also sought to respect the ongoing investigative process and make sure he did not prematurely provide information that turns out to be different later on.\n\n\"We have tried to be transparent with both Congress and the American people as we're going along in the investigation -- frankly unusually so for an ongoing investigation -- given the sheer nature of it,\" Wray said. \"We have provided a lot of information. I expect to continue to provide information.\"\n\nMembers of Congress are searching for answers about the security failures at the rally and have launched multiple inquiries into the assassination attempt. The House is expected to adopt a resolution this week to establish a task force on the shooting.\n\nLawmakers say they are looking for transparency in the wake of the incident, a topic that was on full display earlier this week when then-Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle sidestepped or gave limited answers to a string of lawmaker questions at a House Oversight and Accountability Committee hearing. She has since resigned, a move that came after a wave of criticism about her agency's failure to protect Trump.\n\nAt Wednesday's hearing, Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said a portion of the country has a \"healthy skepticism\" regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a \"fair, honest, open and transparent investigation.\"\n\n\"They can't tell us who planted the pipe bombs on January 6,\" said Jordan, a frequent critic of the FBI.\n\nWray said the agency is investigating the gunman to find out his motive and his preparations before the shooting, along with whether there were any co-conspirators or accomplices.\n\nUnder questioning from Rep. Dan Bishop, R-N.C., Wray testified they have not developed any evidence at this time to suggest there were any accomplices, cooperators or assisters.\n\n\"But again, the investigation's ongoing,\" Wray said.\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, used his opening statement to condemn the assassination attempt, saying the incident was \"not just an attack on a man, but an attack on our democracy.\"\n\n\"Political violence erodes the very foundations of our nation, the concepts of freedom of speech, of peaceful transitions of power, of a democratic government at its core,\" he said. \"These cannot exist if political violence is allowed to fester and to go unchecked.\"", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "m.arcamax.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arcamax_publishing@m.arcamax.com", "name": "ArcaMax Publishing", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

flew drone 200 yards from rally stage", "body": "By Morgan Phillips, Congress Reporter On Capitol Hill For Dailymail.Com\n\nFBI Director Chris Wray stunning revealed bombshell details about former President Donald Trump's assassination attempt, including what devices shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks used.\n\nCrooks, who shot Trump in the ear just 400 feet away from the stage in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13 from the roof of a nearby building just outside the security perimeter of the event.\n\nWray revealed that investigators found Crooks had a drone that he used to survey the scene, which was recovered from his car parked nearby.\n\nHe flew the drone around 4 p.m. over the area of the rally close to '200 yards' from the stage to survey the scene.\n\nThe FBI has also recovered three 'explosive devices' in possession of Crooks.\n\nThey were 'relatively crude devices' but had the ability 'to be detonated remotely,' Wray said.\n\nDramatic new footage shows law enforcement standing over the dead body of Donald Trump 's attempted assassin moments after he was shot dead\n\nWray also confirmed the FBI had recovered three 'explosive devices' in possession of Crooks\n\nThe FBI director said eight bullet cartridges had been recovered from the roof where Crooks fired off his shots toward the former president.\n\nAnd he wouldn't rule out that Crooks did not have any accomplices to the crime, saying it's still being looked at by law enforcement.\n\nAs Wray faced questions about why the president was allowed on stage despite the 'threat' being identified 20 minutes before the shots were fired, Wray said, 'we don't know the answer to that.'\n\nRead More Wray to face grilling on Trump shooting after hearing that led Secret Service director to resign\n\nBut he insisted his investigation was not focused on the security breach and the Secret Service failures.\n\n'Our investigation is focused on the shooter and all things related to his attack.'\n\nHis hearing comes days after the former Director of Secret Service Kimberly Cheatle was forced to resign after evading answering rounds of questioning by punting to the FBI in another congressional hearing earlier this week.\n\nWray promised his agency would leave 'no stone unturned' and emphasized that he wanted to provide all the information he had at this point of the ongoing investigation.\n\n'The shooter may be deceased but the FBI's investigation is very much ongoing.'\n\nHe also made a reference to the warnings he has been giving Congress for years now about the threats of domestic terrorism.\n\nThe shooting is 'another example, particularly heinous and very public one of what I have been talking about.'\n\nWray again warned about 'passion and heated rhetoric turning into actual violence.'\n\n'We've seen it against public officials of all sorts, we've seen it against law enforcements the number of officers shot and killed in the line of duty is alarming.'\n\n'It's almost every five days that a law enforcement officer is killed in the line of duty, that is an example of the kinds of ways passion and heated rhetoric can bubble over into violence.'\n\nThe Judiciary Committee hearing is expected to focus on both the shooting at the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally and the 'ongoing politicization' of the FBI.\n\nQuestioning on a separate foiled Iranian plot to assassinate Donald Trump is sure to be a topic of contention.\n\nA bombshell report last week revealed the U.S. received intelligence of an Iranian assassination plot in the weeks before Trump was shot at the Pennsylvania rally.\n\nMeanwhile, House Republicans are expected to set up a bipartisan task force to investigate the shooting in a vote this week.\n\nMembers of Congress are expected to demand answers from FBI Director Chris Wray about the Trump assassination attempt on Wednesday\n\nThe FBI and Secret Service revealed to lawmakers last week they spotted shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks as a person of interest a full 62 minutes before he fired a shot.\n\nTwenty minutes passed between the time Secret Service agents spotted Crooks with a gun on the rooftop and he fired shots at the president.\n\nIn a staggering moment, Cheatle admitted on Monday her agents on the ground were warned between two and five times that there was a 'suspicious person' reported before Trump took the stage.\n\nWhile Trump walked around with little more than a bloody ear, Crooks killed former fire chief Corey Comperatore, 50, and critically injured two other rally goers sitting close to where the former president was speaking last weekend before he was neutralized.\n\nThe security chief had faced mounting questions over why an agent was not stationed on the roof from where gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire on the former president, and why Trump was allowed to take the stage even when a threat was detected.\n\nShe had also been ridiculed for suggesting her agency did not have a presence on the roof because it was 'sloped.'\n\nThe 20-year-old shooter Crooks, was able to get within 160 yards of the stage where the former president was speaking when he opened fire. The building on which he stood was outside the security perimeter, despite clearly being within rifle shooting range.\n\nAnd that was despite the FBI learning of a threat on Trump's life from Iran leading to a bump in security for the former president in the days before the July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nCheatle said she believed she was the 'best person' to lead the Secret Service at this time, but later acquiesced to the bipartisan demands for her resignation.\n\nOn the day of the rally, Trump walked out onto the stage at 6:02 p.m.\n\nThen at around 6:12 p.m. Crooks' first shots rang out.\n\nCheatle could not tell lawmakers how the shooter had gotten onto the roof.\n\nAt the time of the shooting, law enforcement agents were inside the building, 147 yards away from where Trump stood, but not on top of it.\n\nCheatle curiously claimed no officers had been placed on the roof because it was sloped.\n\n'That building in particular has a sloped roof at its highest point. And so, you know, there's a safety factor that would be considered there that we wouldn't want to put somebody up on a sloped roof,' she told ABC News in an interview Tuesday.\n\nComer said on Fox News Sunday the hearing would go on for six hours and Cheatle would face 'hundreds of questions'\n\n'And so, you know, the decision was made to secure the building, from inside.'\n\nWhat transpired instead was a security nightmare: Thomas Matthew Crooks was able to scale the building and secure his own position, while law enforcement struggled to locate him even amid pressing warnings from members of the Trump crowd. But there wasn't sufficient time to act on the tips, she explained.\n\n'The shooter was actually identified as a potential person of suspicion,' Cheatle said. 'Unfortunately, with the rapid succession of how things unfolded, by the time that individual was eventually located, they were on the rooftop and were able to fire off at the former president.'\n\nShe was referencing claims by witnesses that they alerted law enforcement about the threat, but agents weren't able to eliminate the threat in time. Officials have pointed to the initial responding officer, who lifted himself up on the roof only to lower himself back when the gunman turned his weapon at him.\n\nCheatle has take blame for the fateful security breach, but has denied calls to step down.\n\n'The buck stops with me,' she said.\n\n'It was unacceptable,' she told ABC. 'And it's something that shouldn't happen again.'\n\n'While we give overwhelming thanks to the individual Secret Service agents who did their jobs under immense pressure, this tragedy was preventable. The Secret Service has a zero fail mission, but it failed on July 13 and in the days leading up to the rally,' Comer is also expected to say, as he will again call for Cheatle's resignation.\n\nAlso coming into question on the call was the possible motive for Crooks to commit such an atrocity.\n\nOfficials did not confirm an operating motive and said that his rationale remains a mystery.\n\nAuthorities said that they have yet to find any ideological material that could shine light on why Crooks decided to shoot the former president.\n\nRead More Secret Service Director branded a 'DEI horror show' by Republican as she responds grilling about the agents in Trump's protective detail when he was shot\n\nBut, they did reveal that Crooks operated several accounts on encrypted platforms that they are still working to gain access to.\n\nHere's a timeline of how that fateful July 11 went down:\n\n1PM\n\nThe grounds to the event at Butler Farm Show opened at 1pm.\n\nIt began an hours-long build up that saw MAGA supporters immediately pour into the area to camp out.\n\nSecurity swept the area and set up perimeters, however questions have been raised over how the gunman was able to secure a clear shot just 400ft from the stage.\n\n5PM\n\nAn hour before Trump took the stage at approximately 5pm, former GOP Senate candidate Sean Parnell warmed up the crowd, bringing cheers as he slammed President Biden and his stuttering campaign.\n\nWith the sun still high on a bright day, Trump emerged to 'God Bless the USA' playing over the loudspeakers at 6:03pm, and remained waving and shaking his fist at the crowd for several minutes.\n\n6:11PM\n\nTrump brought out a large graphic with statistics on the migrant crisis at the southern border, and told the crowd at 6:11pm: 'That chart's a couple of months old...'\n\n'If you want to really see something that's sad, take a look at what happened,' Trump continued - before he abruptly grabbed the side of his head as several 'pops' filled the event space.\n\n6:12PM\n\nThe 78-year-old dropped to the floor in an instant as five more shots rang overhead in quick succession, before four Secret Service agents raced to the stage and dove on top of the former president.\n\nStunning images showed Trump cowered on the floor as agents protected him, with blood dripping down his cheek.\n\nSeveral more Secret Service agents continued to flood the stage, while four heavily armed officers lined the perimeter ordering attendees to 'get down.'\n\nThe sniper, sat 400ft across from the rally on an exposed rooftop, fired another shot at the stage a second later while Trump fans streamed out of the bleachers.\n\nSecret Service scrambled to take control of the pandemonium where three attendees were hit, one fatally, within a matter of seconds.\n\n6:13PM\n\nAn emergency room doctor with blood spattered on his shirt later said he sprang into action to perform emergency CPR on one victim.\n\n'The guy had spun around was jammed between the benches and a head shot here. There's lots of blood and he had brain matter,' he told CBS News.\n\n'So I got him together so I got people there really helpful. I did CPR chest compressions as well.'\n\n6:14PM\n\nMicrophones surrounding the stage picked up staggering detail of the urgent response, beginning with one ordering screaming people to 'get down, get down, get down.'\n\nAt the same moment, snipers set up on a roof next to bleachers were seen firing back at the gunman, with Secret Service agents surrounding Trump heard on microphones confirming the moment he was brought down.\n\nDespite the chaos flying around the scene, the rally appeared to hold its breath to see if Trump was hit.\n\nA blood-spattered Donald Trump pumped his fist after being shot in the ear by a sniper, eight minutes after he took the stage at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania\n\nIn a move that sparked iconic images set to define his candidacy, Trump stood up and triumphantly held his fist in the air, pumping it at his supporters to raucous relief.\n\n'USA, USA, USA,' the crowd chanted at the sight, with a blood-spattered Trump appearing to mouth the word 'fight' several times as Secret Service tried to hurry him away.\n\nWhile getting up off the floor, an agent picked up a white cloth and held it to Trump's bleeding ear, telling him to 'hold that on your head, it's bloody.'\n\n'Are we good?' one male agent says, as another responds quickly: 'Shooter down!'\n\n'Shooter's down. Are we good to move?' one says next. 'We're clear, we're clear, we're clear - let's move.'\n\nTrump repeatedly ordered the agents to 'let me get my shoes', to which one responds: 'I got you sir, I got you.'\n\nThe gunman was killed by agents shortly after opening fire, as footage emerged online showing him appear to be shot in the head while crouched on the roof.\n\nCrooks was seen laying lifeless on the rooftop in a later image, surrounded by law enforcement stood over him.\n\nA number of camouflaged law enforcement officers emerged from the side of the stage, part of a huge law enforcement presence that flooded the area within minutes of the first shot was fired.\n\nAt 6:14pm, Trump was whisked into his motorcade by around dozen Secret Service agents, who formed a protective human shield around him.\n\nBefore he got into his SUV, Trump again raised his fist to signify triumphantly surviving the assassination attempt.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Law enforcement also recovered three explosive devices, Wray said -- two from the gunman's vehicle and one from his residence.\n\nWray indicated the bureau is not investigating the Secret Service's failures, instead stressing that the FBI's investigation is focused on Crooks and his motive. Wray went on to add, without elaborating, that the FBI has no evidence that points to Crooks having an accomplice.\n\n\"That kid should not -- could not -- have been on that roof, much less stayed there as long as he did with the knowledge of Trump's security coverage before blasting away at the former president at his leisure.

Nobody is this incompetent.\"\n\n\"The assassination failed, so they took out Biden,\" Tucker Carlson noted in an extensive interview with Human Events Editor Jack Posobiec (see below).\n\nPosobiec said he picked up on the Internet how the point of a system is what it does.\n\nIf your social contagion leaves 40 percent of its adherents trying to commit suicide, maybe that's what the social contagion was designed to do, the point goes.\n\nIf your mass migrant invasion leads to more than 100,000 Americans dead from fentanyl poisoning while wages are depressed and social mobility in the black and Hispanic communities stops cold, perhaps that was the point.\n\nIf your unworkable economic and governmental philosophy results in 100 million corpses, maybe that's the intent.\n\nAnd if your DEI-laden, incommunicado Secret Service which staffs a Jill Biden garden party in Pittsburgh with 12 agents and leaves just four for a Donald Trump outdoor rally with 50,000 people coming, and that results in Trump taking a bullet off his ear rather than through his temple solely through the grace of God, well, maybe this is what was intended.\n\nBut for the part where Trump's brains neglected to splash the crowd, that is.\n\nBack to Wednesday's Judiciary Committee hearing, while Wray stated the FBI \"does not yet have a clear picture\" of Crooks's motive, the gunman \"appears to have done a lot of searches of public figures in general,\" before eventually zeroing in on Trump.

The drone did not fly above the stage where the Republican presidential nominee would later stand, but about 200 yards away, the FBI director testified.\n\nOn July 13, Crooks fired several shots at Trump while perched on nearby warehouse rooftop, striking the former president in the right ear.

Kennedy just days before the incident.\n\nWray detailed that analysis of a laptop linked to Crooks showed a Google search on July 6 for \"How far away was Oswald from Kennedy,\" referencing Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassin of President Kennedy in 1963.\n\nThe shooting occurred during a campaign event in Butler, Pennsylvania, where Crooks fired shots from a nearby building towards Trump, causing panic and leading to a swift response from Secret Service agents.\n\nAlthough Trump sustained a minor injury to his ear, he was safely evacuated from the venue. Tragically, one person in the audience was killed, and two others were seriously injured in the attack.\n\nAccording to Wray's testimony, Crooks registered to attend the rally on the same day he conducted the search about the Kennedy assassination. Additionally, investigators found a drone in Crooks' vehicle, which he had reportedly flown near the venue approximately two hours before the shooting.\n\nThe FBI director also addressed concerns about explosive devices discovered in Crooks' vehicle and residence. Wray confirmed that these devices were capable of remote detonation, although based on the positioning of their receivers, any attempt to trigger them from the roof during the rally would likely have failed.\n\nWhile Crooks graduated from Bethel Park High School in 2022, located approximately 50 miles from Butler, details surrounding his motives and actions leading up to the attack continue to unfold as part of the ongoing investigation.\n\nThe incident has sparked renewed discussions on security measures at political events and the broader implications of online radicalization and violence.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pop_culture@tribune.com.pk", "name": "Pop Culture", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John F.

He was shot and killed immediately after opening fire on the rally, killing one rally-goer, injuring two others, and striking former President Trump in the right ear.\n\n\"We have recovered a drone that the shooter used,\" he said at a House Judiciary hearing, adding that it was taken from his vehicle. Three explosive devices were also recovered, he said, describing them as \"relatively crude\" and capable of being detonated remotely.\n\nHours before the rally shooting, Mr. Crooks was flying the drone \"about 200 yards away\" from the rally stage area, the FBI director said.\n\nBoth the FBI and the Pennsylvania State Police have interviewed more than 100 people since the incident, Pennsylvania State Police Col. Christopher Paris told the House Homeland Security Committee on Tuesday.\n\nBoth Col. Paris and Mr. Wray in the separate hearings said that a detonator of sorts was found on the shooter after he was shot and killed by a Secret Service sniper. The police official did not have any knowledge of a possible motive.\n\nDetails about the 20-year-old shooter have remained unclear, including whether he was motivated by a particular political animus or something else. Several former classmates recalled him being quiet, and some claimed he was bullied, although the bullying assertions were refuted by the school he had attended. The school also refuted claims that he was on the high school's rifle team.\n\nMultiple security lapses at the rally, including officials reporting the would-be assassin as a suspicious person before he climbed onto a roof that had a direct line of sight to the former president, have triggered intense scrutiny of the Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned on Tuesday.\n\nDuring hours of questioning, Ms. Cheatle provided little to no insight into why a suspicious person was allowed to climb the roof or why an agent was not stationed on the building from which the gunman fired. In an interview last week, Ms. Cheatle said that no agent was positioned on the roof because it was sloped.\n\nWhen asked about the Secret Service's preparations, Mr. Wray said that the FBI is only focused on the shooter and why he carried out the assassination attempt. He did not make any comments about the protective agency's actions during the incident.\n\nAlso during the hearing, Mr. Wray repeated his warning that the United States is currently in the midst of an \"elevated threat environment,\" saying that the \"particularly heinous\" rally shooting underscores previous warnings he's delivered before Congress.\n\n\"The men and women of the FBI will continue to work tirelessly\" to determine what happened, Mr. Wray told the House Judiciary panel. The FBI investigation is \"very much ongoing,\" he said, adding that there are \"a lot of open questions\" and that the bureau's \"assessment of the shooter and his actions continue to evolve.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Wray said investigators have gained access to some of Crooks' electronic devices, including his cellphone, but the \"usual repositories of information have not yielded anything notable in terms of motive or ideology.\"\n\nOne search found on a laptop tied to Crooks stood out, however. On July 6, one week before the Trump rally in Butler County, Pennsylvania, Crooks searched \"how far away was Oswald from Kennedy?\"\n\nThe search was a reference to Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassin who shot and killed Kennedy from a perch on the sixth floor of the Texas Schoolbook Depository in Dallas in 1963. The Warren Commission determined that Oswald was 265.3 feet from Kennedy when he fired the fatal shot.\n\n\"That's a search that's obviously significant in terms of his state of mind,\" Wray said. \"That is the same day that it appears that he registered for the Butler rally.\"\n\nWray said Crooks seemed to become \"very focused on\" Trump and the Butler rally around that time.\n\nCrooks was a roof roughly 400 feet from Trump when he fired the shots that struck Trump in the ear and hit the rally attendees.

The FBI director said it is unclear how Crooks got on the roof.\n\nLawmakers have demanded answers to key questions surrounding the shooting that they say remain unanswered, particularly by former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned Tuesday after apparently failing to fully cooperate with the House Oversight Committee the day before.\n\n\"We need to know play-by-play, moment-by-moment, second-by-second,\" Rep.

Christopher Paris told the House Homeland Security Committee that officers with the Butler County Emergency Services Unit spotted Crooks from a second-story window and left their post to search for him.\n\nParis said Crooks was identified as suspicious before the shooting because he was hanging around but never attempted to enter the rally. That suspicion was later heightened, Paris said, when Crooks was seen with a rangefinder.\n\nThat day, three other people had been identified as suspicious, the state police commissioner said.\n\nCrooks was not designated as an actual threat until seconds before he opened fire, Paris said.

After gaining access to his cellphone, the FBI discovered how Crooks \"became very focused on President Trump and his rally\" beginning in early July, according to Wray.\n\nGoogle searches on Crooks' phone revealed that he researched Lee Harvey Oswald's assassination of former President John F. Kennedy, Wray told lawmakers, including a search for \"how far away was Oswald from Kennedy?\"\n\nThe FBI faced challenges \"from an encryption perspective\" when accessing Crooks' phone, according to Wray. The bureau's Pittsburgh field office reportedly tried - and failed - to initially unlock Crooks' Samsung device using a tool developed by the Israeli-based mobile forensics firm Cellebrite.\n\nWhen that didn't work, federal officials at the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, called Cellebrite, which shared an unreleased tool that unlocked the device in less than an hour, according to The Washington Post. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWray told lawmakers that after gaining access to his phone, the FBI discovered Crooks was using an encrypted messaging application. The bureau is now in the legal process of requesting and gaining further access to his devices, social media accounts and other digital platforms, Wray said.\n\nThe FBI and Secret Service have not yet indicated a potential motive for Crooks, a 20-year-old with a limited digital footprint who was killed by the Secret Service shortly after the assassination attempt. President Joe Biden has urged the public not to make assumptions about Crooks or his affiliations, and there are conflicting reports about his potential political views.\n\nA debate has been brewing for more than a decade over the ability of law enforcement to access encrypted data from suspected criminals. Law enforcement sharply decried moves in 2014 by Apple and Google to enable encryption by default. End-to-end communication apps have become increasingly the norm since then, despite law enforcement decrying them as posing obstacles.

Kennedy a week before his own attack, the FBI revealed Wednesday.\n\nThomas Matthew Crooks, 20, used his laptop on July 6 to Google about Kennedy's slaying, the same day Trump's rally in western Pennsylvania was announced, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified in front of the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nWray added that Crooks specifically sought details on how far away Kennedy's assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, was from the former president when he shot him dead.\n\n\"On July 6, he did a Google search for: 'How far away was Oswald from Kennedy,'\" Wray said. \"That's a search that's obviously significant in terms of his state of mind.\"\n\nWray said Crooks registered for the Pennsylvania rally that same day.\n\nOswald landed his fatal shot on Kennedy's motorcade on Nov. 22, 1963, from about 264 feet away. Crooks was a bit further in his assassination attempt, perching himself on a rooftop just under 400 feet from Trump.\n\nThe feds are yet to release a definitive motive for Crooks' attack, but his internet searches have suggested he was depressed and wanted to kill someone prominent. Wray said Crooks was not on the FBI's radar prior to his attack. -\n\n\"We did not have any information about the shooter,\" he said. \"He was not in our holdings before the shooting.\"\n\nWray also revealed Wednesday that Crooks had deployed a drone two hours before the rally started to survey the site. The drone was in the air for about 11 minutes, with the 20-year-old viewing a stream of the aerial view on his phone.\n\nIt was previously reported that a drone was found in Crooks' car after the shooting, along with a pair of explosives that were never detonated.\n\nThose who went to high school with Crooks in Bethel Park, a middle class suburb of Pittsburgh, described him as a recluse with conservative leanings. He was registered as a Republican in voting records.\n\nCrooks' parents have kept a low profile since the July 13 shooting, but his dad, Matthew Crooks, was approached outside a grocery store on Monday by a pair of Fox News reporters. They asked questions about Crooks' motive, but were largely rebuffed.\n\nThe elder Crooks suggested his family would eventually make a statement on the matter, but didn't say when that may happen.\n\n\"We're going to release a statement when our legal counsel advises us to do so -- until then, we have no comment,\" he said. \"We just want to try to take care of ourselves right now.

Crooks was killed by law enforcement. The motive for the shooting remains unclear.\n\nCheatle resigned on Tuesday in the face of bipartisan demands to quit for the agency's failure to prevent the attempted assassination.\n\nBut while Wray is likely to hear demands for details of the incident on Wednesday, the shooting probe could be overshadowed by partisan divisions within the committee.\n\nThe FBI director has long faced opposition from hardline Republicans, some angered over the arrest of Trump supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as Congress certified President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.\n\n\"I would like to hear the truth. But I doubt it that's what we will hear,\" said Republican Representative Harriet Hageman, a Judiciary Committee member who said she would like to see Wray resign as FBI chief.\n\n\"They have circled the wagons and they're going to try to prevent us from getting the information that we need,\" she said.\n\nJudiciary Committee Democrats predicted that the hearing was unlikely to be productive.\n\n\"I'm expecting him to talk about how he's doing his best to keep our country safe.

Agents have been examining all the devices and social media accounts used by the shooter, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks.\n\n\"Once we got on the phone, it turned out he was using some encrypted messaging applications,\" Wray said today.\n\nWray didn't identify the messaging apps, but he said encrypted apps are commonplace and can prevent investigators from accessing a user's personal messages. Two of the most popular encrypted messaging apps, WhatsApp and Signal, can be configured to require the account holder's fingerprint or passcode to unlock access.\n\nThe FBI is \"still exploiting a number of the digital devices\" that belonged to Crooks, including a laptop, Wray said. But federal investigators have yet to access all devices and accounts.\n\n\"Within his various [online] accounts, we've been able to get access to some of them, but some of them we're still waiting on, some of them we may never get access to because of the encryption issue that presents an increasingly vexing barrier for law enforcement,\" he added.\n\nIt's a familiar refrain. The FBI has long pushed US companies, such as Apple, to introduce a backdoor capable of helping them access locked phones and encrypted communications. However, the tech industry has resisted such pleas, saying this access risks the privacy of all users, not just criminal suspects.\n\nIn the Crooks case, the FBI used an Israeli digital forensics firm called Cellebrite to help them unlock the shooter's Samsung phone. The agency has also subpoenaed tech companies for legal access to Crooks' online accounts when end-to-end encryption isn't used.\n\n\"I think it is fair to say that we do not yet have a clear picture of his motive,\" Wray said during the hearing, later adding: \"What I can say is that the shooter appears to have done a lot of searches of public figures in general. But so far, we're seeing news articles and things like that.\"\n\nWray also noted that Crooks conducted a Google search on July 6 related to the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy, who was killed by Lee Harvey Oswald in 1963.

Agents have been examining all the devices and social media accounts used by the shooter, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks.\n\n\"Once we got on the phone, it turned out he was using some encrypted messaging applications,\" Wray said today.\n\nWray didn't identify the messaging apps, but he said encrypted apps are commonplace and can prevent investigators from accessing a user's personal messages. Two of the most popular encrypted messaging apps, WhatsApp and Signal, can be configured to require the account holder's fingerprint or passcode to unlock access.\n\nThe FBI is \"still exploiting a number of the digital devices\" that belonged to Crooks, including a laptop, Wray said. But federal investigators have yet to access all devices and accounts.\n\n\"Within his various [online] accounts, we've been able to get access to some of them, but some of them we're still waiting on, some of them we may never get access to because of the encryption issue that presents an increasingly vexing barrier for law enforcement,\" he added.\n\nIt's a familiar refrain. The FBI has long pushed US companies, such as Apple, to introduce a backdoor capable of helping them access locked phones and encrypted communications. However, the tech industry has resisted such pleas, saying this access risks the privacy of all users, not just criminal suspects.\n\nIn the Crooks case, the FBI used an Israeli digital forensics firm called Cellebrite to help them unlock the shooter's Samsung phone. The agency has also subpoenaed tech companies for legal access to Crooks' online accounts when end-to-end encryption isn't used.\n\n\"I think it is fair to say that we do not yet have a clear picture of his motive,\" Wray said during the hearing, later adding: \"What I can say is that the shooter appears to have done a lot of searches of public figures in general. But so far, we're seeing news articles and things like that.\"\n\nWray also noted that Crooks conducted a Google search on July 6 related to the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy, who was killed by Lee Harvey Oswald in 1963.

If you still have even a skosh of faith, what is the matter with you? When FBI Director Christopher Wray testified, it wasn't going to put hope in your heart. The Wray Hearing before the Congressional Judiciary Committee into the Trump Assassination Attempt was full of hacks and harpies. There was no chance that those people wouldn't embarrass us. For shear idiocy, this hearing was a target rich environment.\n\nThe Congressweenies on Judiciary who spoke at the Wray hearing were only interested in scoring and taking names. Un petite peu was learned which made it a better hearing than the one with now-resigned Director Kimberly Cheatle. According to NBC News:\n\nThe gunman who tried to assassinate former President Donald Trump may have had a firearm with a collapsible stock, making it easier for him to carry and conceal the weapon, the director of the FBI testified Wednesday.\n\nThe gunman also had researched President John F. Kennedy's assassination, FBI Director Christopher Wray said.\n\nOn July 6, Thomas Crooks, 20, searched \"how far away was Oswald from Kennedy,\" Wray told a House Judiciary Committee hearing, referring to the 1963 assassination.\n\nThe collapsible stock, Wray said, would explain why witnesses did not see Crooks walking around with a weapon beforehand and why the firearm was not spotted until Crooks was already on the roof.\n\nCrooks fired at least eight shots and also flew a drone about 200 yards away from the campaign rally's main stage area in Butler, Pennsylvania, about two hours before it began on July 13, Wray said.\n\nHe began to shoot seconds after he noticed a local law enforcement officer on the ground had spotted him, Wray said.\n\nWell, was it eight rounds? Don't know:\n\nJerry (Poopy Pants) Nadler was a particularly partisan hack who went after Donald Trump for saying the word \"bloodbath\" in regards to union jobs leaving the country.\n\nNadler makes the roots of my teeth hurt. Nadler used the Wray Hearing to settle scores and incite hatred rather than keep all protectees of the Secret Service safe. Does he think other countries will trust us to keep their heads of state safe. Nadler is a fool.\n\nEric Swalwell has still got chiggers in his pants about Russia, Russia Russia:\n\nSwalwell has a Russia problem.

That search took place on July 6, the same day the shooter registered to attend Mr. Trump's rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nIt's also around the time the shooter made his first visit to scout out the rally site, staying for about 20 minutes.\n\nThe day before the shooting, the man went to a gun range where he practiced with an AR-15-style rifle. On July 13, he made a morning visit to the rally site, staying for about 70 minutes, then left and returned in the afternoon.\n\nHe flew a drone around part of the site at 4 p.m., then two hours later climbed up a pipe on the outside of the AGR building, where he made his sniper's perch and fired at least eight shots at Mr. Trump.\n\nSEE ALSO: Trump shooter searched for distance of Kennedy assassination\n\nThe former president was bloodied in the ear by one round. One rally-goer was killed and two others were critically wounded.\n\nMr. Wray said the shooter's social media and other usual avenues haven't revealed much about motives, other than the fact that his internet searches spanned both political parties and even foreign officials.\n\n\"It does appear fairly clear that he was interested in public figures kind of more broadly and, I think this is important, starting somewhere around July 6 or so he became very focused on former President Trump and this rally,\" Mr. Wray said.\n\nThat's also when he did his search for the distance -- about 180 feet -- at which Oswald took the shot that killed Kennedy. He then registered to attend the rally.\n\nMr. Wray said agents see that search as important to unraveling the shooter's state of mind.\n\nMr. Wray said agents now believe the shooter got to the roof of the building by using \"some mechanical equipment\" and a vertical pipe to climb the side of the building.\n\nSEE ALSO: Trump shooter flew drone just two hours before assassination attempt, says FBI chief\n\n\"In other words, we do not believe he used a ladder to get up there,\" the FBI chief said.\n\nAt some point, law enforcement became suspicious and then alarmed over the man's behavior. Just before the 6:11 p.m. shooting, a local law enforcement officer tried to climb to the roof. The shooter turned his weapon on the officer, who retreated, then opened fire toward Mr. Trump, according to Mr. Wray's preliminary timeline.\n\nThe director said the Secret Service counter-snipers were alerted to the gunman just before the first shot.\n\nHe confirmed reports that the shooter flew a drone at the rally site about two hours before Mr. Trump took the stage. The FBI has the drone.\n\nAgents also recovered three explosives -- two from the shooter's vehicle and one from his residence. Mr. Wray described them as relatively crude, though he said they were set up to be remotely detonated, and he had a detonating transmitter with him on the rooftop. But because of the on-off switch, it does not appear that he could actually have detonated the devices from the rooftop.\n\nMr. Wray said agents found eight shell casings at the scene of the shooting, suggesting a total of eight rounds fired on the president.\n\nThe director described the shooter, who was killed by a Secret Service sniper, as a \"fairly avid shooting hobbyist\" and his gun as an AR-15 style rifle that he bought from his father. All told, some 14 guns were in the home where the shooter lived with his parents.\n\nMr. Wray, in response to a question about whether the parents knew anything, said they have been cooperating in the investigation. Indeed, Mr. Wray said there are no indications that the shooter was working with accomplices at all.\n\nQuestions have swirled over the Secret Service's handling of Mr. Trump's security and the fact that a gunman was able to get a line of sight to the former president from an undefended rooftop. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned this week after calls from lawmakers in both parties to quit.\n\nSen. Charles E. Grassley, Iowa Republican, revealed Tuesday that a counter-drone operative was listed on the Secret Service's personnel list for the Butler event. Mr. Grassley prodded Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who oversees the Secret Service, on whether the agency detected the shooter's drone flight and what steps were taken.\n\nOther Republicans have complained that it took too much time between authorities identifying the shooter as a suspicious person and neutralizing him -- only after he had fired at least eight shots.\n\nMr. Wray said those are generally issues for the Secret Service, and his agency is involved in the investigation into the shooter. But he did shoot down suggestions that Secret Service counter-snipers were aware of the man as a threat for some minutes before they took him out.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_dinan@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Stephen Dinan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John F.

One rally attendee was killed.\n\nAuthorities are searching for a motive for the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, who was killed by a Secret Service sniper.\n\nWray, a Trump appointee, has been criticized by some Republicans angered over the arrest of Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as Congress certified President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.\n\nDemocrats on the committee predicted that the hearing was unlikely to be productive.\n\n\"I'm expecting him to talk about how he's doing his best to keep our country safe,\" said Rep. Deborah Ross, D-N.C. \"It's never a productive exercise in Judiciary. It's always a 'gotcha' game.\"", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Kennedy's assassination, the head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation testified Wednesday.\n\nOn July 6, Thomas Crooks, 20, searched \"how far away was Oswald from Kennedy,\" referring to the 1963 presidential assassination, FBI Director Christopher Wray said during a House Judiciary Committee hearing.\n\nThe collapsible stock, Wray said, would explain why witnesses did not see Crooks walking around with a weapon beforehand and why the firearm was not spotted until Crooks was already on the roof.\n\nThe new details reveal how Crooks was able to evade law enforcement.\n\nCrooks fired at least eight shots and also flew a drone about 200 yards away from the event's main stage area in Butler, Pennsylvania, campaign rally site about two hours before it began on July 13, Wray said.\n\nAuthorities recovered the drone in Crooks' vehicle, where they also found a drone controller and two explosive devices that had the ability to be remotely detonated, Wray said.\n\nCrooks had a transmitter on him, the director said, adding that it appears the remote detonation \"would not have worked.\"\n\nEight bullet cartridges were found on the roof with the gunman's body, he said.\n\nWray said Crooks had purchased a ladder that was about 5-ft. tall, according to a bloodied receipt that Crooks had on him, but that the ladder was not found at the scene. The FBI director said it is unclear how Crooks got on the roof.\n\nLawmakers have demanded answers to key questions surrounding the shooting that they say remain unanswered, particularly by former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned Tuesday after apparently failing to fully cooperate with the House Oversight Committee the day before.\n\n\"We need to know play-by-play, moment-by-moment, second-by-second,\" Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told Wray at the start of the Wednesday morning hearing.\n\nThe Congressional committee hearings this week have since begun to yield more information.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pennsylvania State Police Col. Christopher Paris told the House Homeland Security Committee that officers with the Butler County Emergency Services Unit spotted Crooks from a second-story window and left their post to search for him.\n\nParis said Crooks was identified as suspicious before the shooting because he was hanging around but never attempted to enter the rally. That suspicion was later heightened, Paris said, when Crooks was seen with a rangefinder.\n\nThat day, three other people had been identified as suspicious, the state police commissioner said.\n\nCrooks was not designated as an actual threat until seconds before he opened fire, Paris said. The gunfire struck Trump in the ear, killed one rallygoer and wounded another.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

The assailant, identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, allegedly fired a shot that grazed Trump's ear from a rooftop position with a clear line of sight to the stage. The FBI swiftly labelled the incident as an act of domestic terrorism and an attempted assassination, although the motive behind Crooks's actions remained unclear, Al Jazeera.\n\nDuring his testimony, Wray disclosed significant details uncovered by the FBI's ongoing investigation. He revealed that a drone had been recovered from Crooks's vehicle, which was flown approximately 200 yards from the rally stage prior to the event.\n\n\"We're going to leave no stone unturned. The shooter might be deceased, but the FBI's investigation is very much ongoing,\" the director said.\n\nThe FBI's findings so far included unsettling discoveries on Crooks's phone, where investigators found photos of Trump, President Joe Biden, and other officials. Additionally, Crooks had reportedly researched the dates of the Democratic National Convention and Trump's scheduled appearances.\n\nHowever, despite piecing together a detailed timeline of Crooks's activities and online searches, the exact motive for targeting Trump remained elusive, Al Jazeera reported.\n\n\"A lot of the usual repositories of information have not yielded anything notable in terms of motive or ideology,\" Wray said.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee, chaired by Republican Congressman Jim Jordan, pressed Wray on various aspects of the investigation, including security lapses at the rally site and the presence of explosives found in Crooks's vehicle.\n\n\"We hope to learn more today from Director Wray about the shooter: his use of the drone, the explosives that were in his car, how he got on the roof and a host of other questions,\" Jordan said, adding, \"It is our hope that Director Wray's testimony can begin to give answers to the American people about all these questions and concerns.\"\n\nRepresentative Jerry Nadler, the committee's ranking Democrat, \"unequivocally and unabashedly\" condemned the assassination attempt while contextualizing it within a broader narrative of political violence in America.\n\n\"If you think that this one assassin's bullet was a bolt out of the blue and not part of a wave of violence that has threatened this nation for years, then you have missed the point,\" Nadler said.\n\nWray's appearance before lawmakers came just a day after the resignation of US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, who faced significant criticism over security protocols at the Trump rally. The scrutiny extended to the FBI's handling of the investigation, with some lawmakers expressing skepticism over the bureau's assertion that Crooks acted without a clear ideological motive.\n\nDespite challenges and criticism, Wray affirmed the FBI's dedication to uncovering the truth, citing parallels to historical incidents of political violence in American history, Al Jazeera reported.

The motive remains unclear.\n\nIn a chilling development, Thomas Crooks, a 20-year-old nursing home aide, is suspected of attempting to assassinate former President Donald Trump during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. FBI Director Christopher Wray detailed Crooks' online searches about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on the same day he registered for the rally.\n\nWray testified that Crooks had fired at least eight rounds from a rooftop near the July 13 event, wounding Trump in the ear, killing one attendee, and injuring two others. The suspect used an AR-15 assault-style rifle, making it difficult for the crowd to notice.

Before Trump Shooting", "body": "Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, disclosed on Wednesday that a gunman who tried to assassinate former President Donald J. Trump searched on Google a week before the shooting for \"How far away was Oswald from Kennedy?\"\n\nMr. Wray added that the revelation appeared to be a possible first indication that the shooter began to contemplate an assassination. That same day, he registered to attend the rally in Butler, Pa., where Mr. Trump was set to speak.\n\n\"That's a search that obviously is significant in terms of his state of mind,\" Mr. Wray said.\n\nIn addition, Mr. Wray said the gunman had visited the area a week before the rally, spending about 20 minutes at the scene. He returned twice on the day of the shooting, for about 70 minutes in the morning and then later that afternoon, when he appeared to fly a drone in the vicinity for about 11 minutes.\n\n\"It appears that around 3:50 p.m., 4:00, in that window, on the day of the shooting, that the shooter was flying the drone around the area,\" Mr. Wray said during his testimony, noting that it was \"not over the stage, but about 200 yards, give or take, away from that.\"\n\nThe shooting left Mr. Trump's ear bloodied, killed a rallygoer who had been sitting in the stands and seriously injured two others.\n\nSecret Service snipers killed the gunman, Thomas Crooks, 20, after locating him on a nearby roof. Mr. Crooks was armed with an AR-15-style rifle and had magazines for the rifle and a bulletproof vest in his car along with the drone. The F.B.I. managed to reconstruct the drone's flight's path, though it did not recover any video or pictures from the drone.\n\nThe gunman's father had purchased the gun more than a decade ago, but Mr. Wray also disclosed on Wednesday that the son bought the rifle from his father and that the family had 14 firearms in the house.\n\nMr. Wray said the rifle used had a collapsible stock, perhaps making the gunman less noticeable, and he confirmed that the F.B.I. recovered eight bullet cartridges from the roof where the gunman opened fire.\n\nSo far, Mr. Wray said, the F.B.I. has not found a motive for the shooting even as the investigation evolves. But the bureau continues to examine the gunman's electronic devices for additional clues about Mr. Crooks's mind-set and movements beforehand.\n\n\"We're hoping to learn more,\" Mr. Wray said. \"It's fair to say we do not yet have a clear picture of his motive.\"\n\nThe shooter, Mr. Wray said, reviewed news stories that mentioned public figures, but the director did not draw any conclusions from his search history.\n\nWhile the F.B.I. typically does not discuss continuing investigations, the extraordinary circumstances and public interest in the failed assassination attempt allow the bureau to inform the public.\n\n\"The attempted assassination of the former president was an attack on our democracy,\" Mr. Wray said. \"I recognize the congressional and public interest in this case.\"\n\nIndeed, Mr. Wray seemed eager to provide new information at the outset but sat through dueling opening statements rife with partisan pronouncements. Only about 30 minutes into the hearing did he have an opening to disclose more details about the drone found in the gunman's car.\n\nHe added that the investigation was evolving and that the gunman used encrypted messaging applications. He described explosive devices found in the gunman's car as \"crude\" but said they were able to be detonated remotely.\n\nLingering questions remain about the gunman's violent trajectory and when he actually started to plan the shooting. Mr. Wray said he appeared to be a loner with a small number of contacts in his phone.\n\nThe F.B.I. has conducted more than 400 interviews, and scores of bureau personnel are involved in the investigation.\n\nDuring testimony before Congress on Monday, Kimberly A. Cheatle, then the head of the Secret Service, faced withering questions from both sides of the political aisle, repeatedly declining to answer questions about the security lapses that led to the assassination attempt.\n\nOfficials investigating the matter, including lawmakers in hearings this week, have repeatedly questioned why the Secret Service's security perimeter did not include the building from which the gunman eventually fired and why no law enforcement officer was stationed there during the rally. They have also asked why Mr. Trump was allowed to take the stage when law enforcement, including the Secret Service and the local police, was searching for a suspicious person.\n\nOn Tuesday, in the face of mounting calls that she step down, Ms. Cheatle resigned.\n\nMr. Wray has not faced the same criticism, since the F.B.I. was not directly involved in protecting the president on July 13.\n\nStill, Mr. Wray was drawn into the political fray when asked about Project 2025, a set of conservative policy proposals for a future Republican administration that has angered Democrats.\n\nAsked about possible changes to the F.B.I. under Project 2025, Mr. Wray said the bureau needs to retain its independence. He also said that answering directly to the president would not be a \"wise reporting structure.\"\n\nIn the hearing on Monday with Ms. Cheatle, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Michael R. Turner of Ohio, said that Mr. Wray was shocked that information about an Iranian plot to kill Mr. Trump was not included in the Secret Service threat assessment for Mr. Trump's rally in Butler.\n\nMr. Wray declined to discuss specific details about the Iranian threat or other national security threats.\n\n\"We need to recognize the brazenness of the Iranian regime,\" he said, adding that there was a process for sharing such information to the Secret Service in a timely way.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.mr", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": ".mr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garth_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Garth Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AR-15\u2013style_rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AR-15\u2013style rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

It will be composed of seven Republicans and six Democrats chosen by Johnson and Jeffries, who have not yet announced their selections.\n\nThe House Freedom Caucus, a group of far-right members, urged House leadership to keep at least one Democrat, Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, off the task force.\n\nJohnson, a Louisiana Republican, and Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said the task force will seek to understand what went wrong on July 13, the day of the shooting; ensure accountability; and prevent such a failure by law enforcement from happening again. At the conclusion of its probe, the panel will make recommendations to relevant government agencies and suggest necessary legislation to enact reforms.\n\nThe resolution establishing the task force was introduced by Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania, whose district includes Butler County, where the rally was held.\n\nSeveral federal agencies have launched their own investigations into the assassination attempt, including the FBI and Secret Service. At the Department of Homeland Security, its internal watchdog is looking into the security lapses that allowed the gunman to gain access to a roof close to where Trump was speaking. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has also named an independent panel to investigate the shooting, which came at the direction of President Biden.\n\nThe Secret Service has come under significant criticism in the wake of the attack, and its director, Kimberly Cheatle, resigned Tuesday after a bruising day of testimony before the House Oversight and Accountability Committee.\n\nCheatle frustrated Republicans and Democrats alike with her unwillingness to provide details about the event and frequently referred to the FBI's ongoing investigation, prompting the number of lawmakers from both parties calling for her resignation to grow.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray appeared before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday and shared new details with lawmakers about the gunman, identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, and his actions before he opened fire at the rally.\n\nWray revealed that on July 6, one week before the rally, the gunman conducted an online search for \"how far away was Oswald from Kennedy,\" a reference to Lee Harvey Oswald, who assassinated President John F. Kennedy in 1963.\n\nThe FBI chief said he registered for Trump's rally in Butler the same day he searched for information about Kennedy's assassination, and had become \"very focused\" on Trump and the campaign event around that time.\n\nWray also told Judiciary Committee members that Crooks flew a drone near the rally site roughly two hours before he opened fire. The drone and two explosive devices were recovered from his vehicle. A third explosive device was found at Crooks' house.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

According to Wray, Crooks searched Google about the assassination of President Kennedy on the same day he registered for the Trump rally.\n\nWray's testimony before the House Judiciary Committee shed light on Crooks' state of mind leading up to the attempted assassination. The analysis of a laptop connected to Crooks revealed that on July 6, he made a Google search asking, \"how far away was Oswald from Kennedy?\" This search was significant in understanding Crooks' mindset.\n\nIt was on July 6 that Crooks registered for the Butler rally, as confirmed by Wray. This revelation has raised concerns about the motivations behind Crooks' actions and whether there were any warning signs that could have been detected earlier.\n\nThe investigation into the attempted assassination has sparked multiple hearings in Congress, with former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle testifying before the House Oversight Committee and subsequently resigning. The House Homeland Security Committee also heard from Pennsylvania State Police before Wray's testimony.\n\nLawmakers, including Rep. Carlos Gimenez, have visited Butler to inspect the scene of the crime. Gimenez expressed disbelief that the Secret Service had not secured the roof from where Crooks fired at Trump. He climbed onto the roof himself to demonstrate that it was feasible for agents to be stationed there.\n\nCheatle had previously cited the \"sloped roof\" as a hindrance to having agents on the building. However, Gimenez's actions called this explanation into question, highlighting potential lapses in security measures that could have prevented the assassination attempt.\n\nThe investigation into Crooks' motives continues, with profilers suggesting that he may not have been politically motivated but rather an organized thinker.

The assailant, identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, allegedly fired a shot that grazed Trump's ear from a rooftop position with a clear line of sight to the stage. The FBI swiftly labelled the incident as an act of domestic terrorism and an attempted assassination, although the motive behind Crooks's actions remained unclear, Al Jazeera.\n\nAlso Read | Salman Rushdie's Attacker Charged With Supporting Terrorist Group: Hadi Matar, Who Brutally Attacked Novelist in New York, Provided Material Support to Hezbollah, Says US Court.\n\nDuring his testimony, Wray disclosed significant details uncovered by the FBI's ongoing investigation. He revealed that a drone had been recovered from Crooks's vehicle, which was flown approximately 200 yards from the rally stage prior to the event.\n\n\"We're going to leave no stone unturned. The shooter might be deceased, but the FBI's investigation is very much ongoing,\" the director said.\n\nThe FBI's findings so far included unsettling discoveries on Crooks's phone, where investigators found photos of Trump, President Joe Biden, and other officials. Additionally, Crooks had reportedly researched the dates of the Democratic National Convention and Trump's scheduled appearances.\n\nHowever, despite piecing together a detailed timeline of Crooks's activities and online searches, the exact motive for targeting Trump remained elusive, Al Jazeera reported.\n\n\"A lot of the usual repositories of information have not yielded anything notable in terms of motive or ideology,\" Wray said.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee, chaired by Republican Congressman Jim Jordan, pressed Wray on various aspects of the investigation, including security lapses at the rally site and the presence of explosives found in Crooks's vehicle.\n\n\"We hope to learn more today from Director Wray about the shooter: his use of the drone, the explosives that were in his car, how he got on the roof and a host of other questions,\" Jordan said, adding, \"It is our hope that Director Wray's testimony can begin to give answers to the American people about all these questions and concerns.\"\n\nRepresentative Jerry Nadler, the committee's ranking Democrat, \"unequivocally and unabashedly\" condemned the assassination attempt while contextualizing it within a broader narrative of political violence in America.\n\n\"If you think that this one assassin's bullet was a bolt out of the blue and not part of a wave of violence that has threatened this nation for years, then you have missed the point,\" Nadler said.\n\nWray's appearance before lawmakers came just a day after the resignation of US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, who faced significant criticism over security protocols at the Trump rally.

The assailant, identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, allegedly fired a shot that grazed Trump's ear from a rooftop position with a clear line of sight to the stage. The FBI swiftly labelled the incident as an act of domestic terrorism and an attempted assassination, although the motive behind Crooks's actions remained unclear, Al Jazeera.\n\nDuring his testimony, Wray disclosed significant details uncovered by the FBI's ongoing investigation. He revealed that a drone had been recovered from Crooks's vehicle, which was flown approximately 200 yards from the rally stage prior to the event.\n\n\"We're going to leave no stone unturned. The shooter might be deceased, but the FBI's investigation is very much ongoing,\" the director said.\n\nThe FBI's findings so far included unsettling discoveries on Crooks's phone, where investigators found photos of Trump, President Joe Biden, and other officials. Additionally, Crooks had reportedly researched the dates of the Democratic National Convention and Trump's scheduled appearances.\n\nHowever, despite piecing together a detailed timeline of Crooks's activities and online searches, the exact motive for targeting Trump remained elusive, Al Jazeera reported.\n\n\"A lot of the usual repositories of information have not yielded anything notable in terms of motive or ideology,\" Wray said.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee, chaired by Republican Congressman Jim Jordan, pressed Wray on various aspects of the investigation, including security lapses at the rally site and the presence of explosives found in Crooks's vehicle.\n\n\"We hope to learn more today from Director Wray about the shooter: his use of the drone, the explosives that were in his car, how he got on the roof and a host of other questions,\" Jordan said, adding, \"It is our hope that Director Wray's testimony can begin to give answers to the American people about all these questions and concerns.\"\n\nRepresentative Jerry Nadler, the committee's ranking Democrat, \"unequivocally and unabashedly\" condemned the assassination attempt while contextualizing it within a broader narrative of political violence in America.\n\n\"If you think that this one assassin's bullet was a bolt out of the blue and not part of a wave of violence that has threatened this nation for years, then you have missed the point,\" Nadler said.\n\nWray's appearance before lawmakers came just a day after the resignation of US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, who faced significant criticism over security protocols at the Trump rally. The scrutiny extended to the FBI's handling of the investigation, with some lawmakers expressing skepticism over the bureau's assertion that Crooks acted without a clear ideological motive.\n\nDespite challenges and criticism, Wray affirmed the FBI's dedication to uncovering the truth, citing parallels to historical incidents of political violence in American history, Al Jazeera reported.

Maansi Srivastava for The New York Times\n\nBy Adam Goldman\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nJuly 24, 2024\n\nUpdated 1:06 p.m. ET\n\nThe gunman who tried to kill former President Donald J. Trump searched online for details of John F.

Wray, to the House Judiciary Committee, appeared to be a possible first indication that the shooter began to contemplate an assassination. That same day, July 6, he appears to have registered to attend the rally in Butler, Pa., where Mr. Trump was set to speak, Mr. Wray added. ... \"That's a search that obviously is significant in terms of his state of mind,\" Mr. Wray said, noting that the gunman's searches around that time \"became very focused on former President Trump and this rally.\"\n\nThe information about the gunman's search history was just one of several new details about the shooting that Mr. Wray disclosed to lawmakers during a lengthy hearing. ... The gunman visited the site of the rally the next day, one of three visits Mr. Wray detailed. In the first, he spent about 20 minutes at the scene. He returned twice on the day of the shooting, for about 70 minutes in the morning, and then later that afternoon, when he appeared to fly a drone in the vicinity for about 11 minutes.\n\n\"It appears that around 3:50 p.m., 4:00, in that window, on the day of the shooting, that the shooter was flying the drone around the area,\" Mr. Wray said, noting that it was \"not over the stage, but about 200 yards, give or take, away from that.\" ... The shooting left Mr. Trump's ear bloodied, killed a rallygoer who had been sitting in the stands and seriously injured two others.\n\n{snip}\n\nAdam Goldman writes about the F.B.I. and national security.

Kennedy Assassination A Week Before Rally, FBI Says", "body": "Despite gaining access to Crooks' electronic devices, including his cellphone, investigators have yet to uncover any significant information regarding his motive or ideology.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray revealed during a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday that the gunman who attempted to assassinate former President Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally on July 13 had conducted a disturbing Google search about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy just one week prior to the shooting.\n\nThe FBI said it was still working to determine the motive behind 20-year-old Thomas Crooks' actions, which resulted in the death of one attendee and injuries to Trump and two others, CBS News reports.\n\nDespite gaining access to Crooks' electronic devices, including his cellphone, investigators have yet to uncover any significant information regarding his motive or ideology.\n\nWray's testimony highlighted the complexity of the case, as authorities strive to understand the reasoning behind Crooks' violent actions. The investigation remains ongoing, with the FBI exploring all possible leads to shed light on this disturbing incident.\n\nA chilling discovery was made on a laptop linked to Crooks. A search history revealed a disturbing query made on July 6, exactly one week before the Pennsylvania rally: \"how far away was Oswald from Kennedy?\"\n\nThis eerie search suggests Crooks may have been drawing inspiration from the infamous assassination of President John F. Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald in 1963.\n\nOswald fatally shot Kennedy from a sixth-floor perch at the Texas Schoolbook Depository in Dallas, with the Warren Commission later determining the distance between the two to be approximately 265.3 feet at the time of the deadly shot.\n\nThis striking search term stands out as a significant finding in the investigation, potentially offering a glimpse into Crooks' motivations or mindset leading up to the attack. As authorities continue to probe the circumstances surrounding the shooting, this haunting query raises more questions about the influences and intentions behind Crooks' actions.\n\nCrooks fired shots from a rooftop approximately 400 feet away from the target.\n\nThe gunfire struck Trump in the ear and injured rally attendees.\n\nAccording to FBI Director Christopher Wray's testimony at Wednesday's hearing, Crooks wielded an AR-style rifle and left behind a trail of evidence, including eight spent bullet cartridges found on the roof.", "source": {"uri": "saharareporters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sahara Reporters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Director Shares New Details in Attempted Assassination of Trump", "body": "Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, disclosed on Wednesday that the gunman who tried to assassinate former President Donald J. Trump appeared to have used a drone to survey the site of the shooting for about 11 minutes in the hours before Mr. Trump took the stage.\n\n\"It appears that around 3:50 p.m., 4:00, on the day of the shooting, that the shooter was flying the drone around the area,\" Mr. Wray said during his testimony, noting that it was \"not over the stage, but about 200 yards, give or take, away from that.\"\n\nThe gunfire on July 13 at a campaign rally in Butler, Pa., left Mr. Trump's ear bloodied, killed a rallygoer who had been sitting in the stands and seriously injured two others.\n\nMr. Wray said the would-be assassin operated the drone about two hours before Mr. Trump spoke at the rally.\n\nSecret Service snipers killed the gunman, Thomas Crooks, 20, after locating him on a nearby roof. Mr. Crooks was armed with an AR-15-style rifle and had magazines for the rifle and a bulletproof vest in his car. Mr. Wray confirmed that the F.B.I. recovered eight bullet cartridges from the roof where the gunman opened fire.\n\nSo far, Mr. Wray said, the F.B.I. has not found a motive for the shooting even as the investigation evolves. But the bureau continues to examine the gunman's electronic devices for additional clues about Mr. Crooks's mind-set and movements beforehand.\n\nIt is not clear what other information the F.B.I. might release during the hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, but the bureau has been forthcoming with details about the shooting since Mr. Crooks is dead. While the F.B.I. typically does not discuss continuing investigations, the extraordinary circumstances and public interest in the failed assassination attempt allow the bureau to inform the public.\n\n\"The attempted assassination of the former president was an attack on our democracy,\" Mr. Wray said. \"I recognize the congressional and public interest in this case.\"\n\nHe added that the investigation was evolving and that the gunman used encrypted messaging applications.

They have also asked why Mr. Trump was allowed to take the event stage when law enforcement, including the Secret Service and the local police, was searching for a suspicious person.\n\nOn Tuesday, in the face of mounting calls that she step down, Ms. Cheatle resigned.\n\nbut he could have other details about an Iranian plot to kill Mr. Trump or other national security threats.\n\nIn the hearing on Monday with Ms. Cheatle, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Michael Turner of Ohio, said that Mr. Wray was shocked that information about the Iranian threat was not included in the Secret Service threat assessment for Mr. Trump's rally in Butler.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garth_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Garth Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AR-15\u2013style_rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AR-15\u2013style rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Wray has to resign, and NOW, for LYING TO CONGRESS!\" he added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP\n\nBiden announced on Sunday that he was ending his campaign after weeks of pressure from Democrats and the media to step aside following a debate against Trump where the president appeared physically and mentally exhausted. Concerns about Biden's cognitive state also dominated headlines earlier this year when special counsel Robert Hur released his report on the investigation into Biden's handling of classified documents.\n\nIn his February report, Hur said he would not recommend charges against the president, writing at one point, \"We have also considered that, at trial, Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.

In the past, and under Comey certainly, the FBI dealt with the Russian collusion theory, then spying on General Flynn, and the Hunter Biden laptop issue. I represent about 800,000 people, and our job [in Congress] is to restore trust.\n\nIn many of the hearings we've had this week, the answer has been 'the FBI is investigating that' [regarding the Trump assassination attempt]. This landed in your lap and I appreciate you being here, but how do you work to restore trust? And how does a 20-year-old end up on a ladder within shooting distance of a former President?\"\n\nDirector Wray: \"The adequacy of the performance of Secret Service will be the subject of the Inspector General investigation with an outside independent panel. What I can tell you, and I'm glad you asked the question, is that the first time law enforcement saw the subject on the roof was a few minutes before the shooting. Local law enforcement saw the suspect on the roof, not with a weapon, a few minutes before the shooting, and started radioing.\"\n\nRep.

Wray, the F.B.I. director, appeared on Wednesday before Congress, where he is expected to face a barrage of questions about the attempted assassination of former President Donald J.

The shooting left Mr. Trump's ear bloodied, killed a rallygoer who had been sitting in the stands and seriously injured two others.\n\nSecret Service snipers killed the gunman, Thomas Crooks, 20, after locating him on a nearby roof. Mr. Crooks was armed with an AR-15-style rifle and had magazines for the rifle and a bulletproof vest in his car.\n\nSo far, the F.B.I. has not a found a motive for the shooting. But the bureau continues to examine the gunman's electronic devices looking for additional clues about Mr. Crooks's mind-set and movements beforehand.\n\nIt is not clear what other information the F.B.I. might release during the hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, but the bureau has been forthcoming with details about the shooting since Mr. Crooks is dead. While the F.B.I. typically does not discuss continuing investigations, the extraordinary circumstances and public interest in the failed assassination attempt allow the bureau to inform the public.\n\nLingering questions remain about the gunman's violent trajectory and when he actually started to plan the shooting.\n\nThe F.B.I. has conducted more than 100 interviews, and scores of bureau personnel are involved in the investigation.\n\nDuring testimony before Congress on Monday, Kimberly Cheatle, the head of the Secret Service, faced withering questions from both sides of the political aisle, repeatedly declining to answer questions about the security lapses that led to the assassination attempt.\n\nOfficials investigating the matter, including lawmakers in hearings this week, have repeatedly questioned why the Secret Service's security perimeter did not include the building from which the gunman eventually fired and why no law enforcement officer was stationed there during the rally. They have also asked why Mr. Trump was allowed to take the event stage when law enforcement, including the Secret Service and the local police, was searching for a suspicious person.\n\nOn Tuesday, in the face of mounting calls that she step down, Ms. Cheatle resigned.\n\nMr. Wray is not expected to face the same level of criticism since the F.B.I. was not directly involved in protecting the president on July 13, but he could have other details about an Iranian plot to kill Mr. Trump or other national security threats.\n\nIn the hearing on Monday with Ms. Cheatle, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Michael Turner of Ohio, said that Mr. Wray was shocked that information about the Iranian threat was not included in the Secret Service threat assessment for Mr. Trump's rally in Butler.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_goldman@nytimes.com", "name": "Adam Goldman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garth_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Garth Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_F.B.I._(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The F.B.I.

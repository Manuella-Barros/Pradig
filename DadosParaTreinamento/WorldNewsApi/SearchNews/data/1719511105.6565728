{"id": 223737464, "title": "Hurricane season 2024: What to know about watches and warnings", "text": "The approach and arrival of a tropical storm or hurricane will bring with it different levels of advisories from the National Hurricane Center and the National Weather Service in Melbourne. Here are some of types of watches or warnings that could occur with a tropical system and what those advisories mean: Tropical Storm Watch: Tropical storm conditions (sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph) are possible within the specified area within 48 hours. Tropical Storm Warning: Tropical storm conditions (sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph) are expected within your area within 36 hours. Hurricane Watch: Hurricane conditions (sustained winds of 74 mph or greater) are possible within your area. Because it may not be safe to prepare for a hurricane once winds reach tropical storm force, The NHC issues hurricane watches 48 hours before it anticipates tropical storm-force winds. Hurricane Warning: Hurricane conditions (sustained winds of 74 mph or greater) are expected somewhere within the specified area. NHC issues a hurricane warning 36 hours in advance of tropical storm-force winds to give you time to complete your preparations. All preparations should be complete. Evacuate immediately if so ordered. Extreme Wind Warning: Extreme sustained winds of a major hurricane (115 mph or greater), usually associated with the eyewall, are expected to begin within an hour. Take immediate shelter in the interior portion of a well-built structure. Tornado Warning: Hurricanes and tropical storms can also produce tornadoes. These tornadoes most often occur in thunderstorms embedded in rain bands well away from the center of the hurricane; however, they can also occur near the eyewall. Usually, tornadoes produced by tropical cyclones are relatively weak and short-lived, but they still pose a significant threat. For those along the coast, there are two additional advisories that could be issued: Storm Surge Watch: There is a possibility of life-threatening inundation from rising water moving inland from the shoreline somewhere within the specified area, generally within 48 hours. Storm Surge Warning: There is a danger of life-threatening inundation from rising water moving inland from the shoreline somewhere within the specified area, generally within 36 hours. If you are under a storm surge warning, check for evacuation orders from your local officials.", "summary": "The approach and arrival of a tropical storm or hurricane will bring with it different levels of advisories from the National Hurricane Center and the National Weather Service in Melbourne.", "url": "https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2024/05/26/hurricane-season-2024-what-to-know-about-watches-and-warnings/", "image": "https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hurricane-center.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:11:13", "author": "Orlando Sentinel Staff", "authors": ["Orlando Sentinel Staff"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.076}

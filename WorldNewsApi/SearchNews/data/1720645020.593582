The BBC Sort Your Life Out star said a \"childhood dream\" had come true as she finally gave in to \"years\" of nagging from her sons. Taking to Instagram, the former X Factor contestant shared a video of the family zooming along a zipline in their huge garden, describing it as \"50ft of happiness from tree to tree\". Stacey said the boys had been asking for one for \"years\" and she'd finally found a small business that installed them. The mum-of-five told fans it was a present for \"all of the kids birthdays combined\" as she revealed the zipline, saying: \"Here she is.\" Stacey continued: \"So grateful to have space to be able to do this.\" READ MORE: Corrie star says 'everything makes sense now' as she shares health diagnosis She also gave a shout out to the \"incredible\" small business mr.treehouse.co.uk, saying she was grateful to have discovered the service as: \"Until I realised how much maths and physics you needed to calculate to put one of these in, it was going to be a DIY, which would have 100 per cent ended in disaster.

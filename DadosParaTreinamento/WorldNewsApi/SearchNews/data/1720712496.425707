{"id": 232041930, "title": "How Carlton curbed Essendon\u2019s star captain", "text": "At the end of it, Carlton claimed a 26-point victory over a wasteful Essendon \u2013 who had four more scoring shots and 19 extra inside 50s \u2013 while Merrett had an equal-season-low 21 disposals, including not touching the Sherrin in the opening 20-odd minutes. Cincotta had only 10 disposals himself, but kicked two goals in the decisive last quarter, including the first to kickstart a four-goal Blues binge in barely 10 minutes that effectively killed the match as a contest. Hollands was terrific as well, finishing with a game-high three goals to go with 19 disposals, seven marks, eight score involvements and four clearances. Voss was coy afterwards about Operation: Curb Merrett. \u201cWe don\u2019t disclose that too much. We\u2019ll keep you looking behind [the] goals and work that one out, but [Cincotta\u2019s] done a great job,\u201d Voss said.", "summary": "The obvious choice for Blues coach Michael Voss was to give Alex Cincotta another tagging job, and that is what he did \u2013 but there was a twist.", "url": "https://www.smh.com.au/sport/afl/how-carlton-curbed-essendon-s-star-captain-20240609-p5jkdl.html", "image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.40032285096876946%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_262%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/59bd059778dc15a5ec28a200329bbeebdde4eda8", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:58:33", "author": "Marc McGowan", "authors": ["Marc McGowan"], "language": "en", "source_country": "au", "sentiment": 0.083}

He also filed paperwork seeking an annulment on the grounds of fraud.\n\nIn her response, Firerose denied being guilty of inappropriate marital conduct, and instead accused Cyrus of acting inappropriately, so much so that she felt \"unsafe\" living with him.\n\nOn June 13, Cyrus filed an emergency motion seeking a temporary restraining order that would keep Firerose from accessing his personal and business credit cards and accounts, as he claimed she spent nearly $100,000 of his money on \"unauthorized\" purchases after their split.\n\nIn response, Firerose said there was \"no emergency,\" and that she's had access to his credit card for the past two years.\n\n\"To claim Wife has made 37 unauthorized charges is untrue,\" her attorneys wrote in the response filing, which was obtained by PEOPLE. \"Throughout the divorce proceedings, the parties are to live as per the status quo during the marriage.

He cited 'irreconcilable differences' and 'inappropriate marital conduct' for what led to her split.\n\nIn Firerose's complaint, she denied being guilty of inappropriate marital conduct and claimed it was Cyrus who made living together 'unsafe.'\n\nShe claimed in the weeks leading up to her preventative double mastectomy and reconstruction surgery, recommended by her doctor in March, were 'chaos.'\n\nThe performer, who is a carrier of the BRCA1 gene mutation, also alleged that her spouse 'continuously launched verbal assaults' at her and placed her 'into an emotional and psychological prison.'\n\n'When Wife would attempt to voice certain concerns, Husband would often call her a 'selfish f**king b**ch' and continually alleged that she was using him,' the complaint read.\n\nFirerose claims that less than 24 hours before she was supposed to undergo surgery, he filed for divorce, and that 'Cyrus's brother and sister-in-law banged on her bedroom door for three-and-a-half hours that day demanding she leave their shared home.'\n\nShe said she did and made the decision to postponed her surgery 'indefinitely' as she no longer has a permanent residence and 'was allegedly relying on Cyrus' health insurance and previous promises to pay for her surgery.'\n\nFirerose, who is requesting alimony from Cyrus, proceeded to accuse Cyrus of intentionally trying to sabotage her career 'in retaliation.'\n\n'The accumulation of years of verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse, combined with the fact that Husband has had a direct hand in restricting Wife's access to income and future opportunities, Wife has developed severe emotional distress from Husband's actions,' the complaint read. 'Wife has had to seek psychological treatment from her therapist for emergency sessions on more than one occasion.'\n\nCyrus's attorneys denied Firerose's claims to DailyMail.com.\n\n'We regret that Ms. Hodges has chosen to litigate this 7-month marriage in the press and has left Mr. Cyrus with no recourse but to set the record straight,' his lawyers said in a statement. 'The allegations that Ms. Hodges states in her answer and counter-complaint are especially confusing and suspicious in its veracity since she begged Mr. Cyrus to forgive her and take her back only 2 days after he filed his pleadings to dissolve his marriage.'\n\nCyrus's represenatives went on to claim that when 'Mr. Cyrus returned to his home 2 days after Ms. Hodges was required, by Court Order, to vacate his residence of over 25 years and allowed him to return, he discovered a handwritten note from Ms. Hodges professing her love and need to be with Mr. Cyrus.'\n\nCyrus' attorneys concluded: 'If Mr. Cyrus was truly guilty of the allegations that Ms. Hodges alleges in her pleadings, then it is mindboggling to try and explain why she would want to return to live with him. Furthermore, she was pleading with him to give her a chance to explain everything to him.'\n\nLast week, the Hannah Montana alum, who is seeking an annulment, accused Firerose of overcharging his credit card after he filed for divorce.\n\nIn new court documents obtained by TMZ on Friday, Cyrus claimed that Firerose made 37 unauthorized charges on his American Express card totaling a whopping $96,986.05 between May 23 and June 7.\n\nBilly also requested a temporary restraining order to prevent the Australian-born singer from having anymore access to his bank accounts and credit cards.\n\nHe further claimed that his estranged wife - who has denied the allegations - made the charges without his consent, and added he never permitted her to have access to his cards.\n\nIn the court documents, Cyrus added that both he and Firerose did not file joint tax returns to further back up his side.\n\nThe star has requested that a judge approve an 'emergency motion' to halt Firerose from having access to his accounts and cards, while asking for reimbursement on the 37 unauthorized charges.\n\nHowever, Billy's estranged wife has also filed her own court documents and denied the allegations.\n\nThe singer claimed she always had access to his credit cards - which began when she moved in with the performer in 2022. Firerose also added that she was never given a limit in regards to what she could charge.\n\nAccording to TMZ, she has also claimed she should be allowed to have continuous access to Billy's money 'for her personal and household expenses' and 'attorney fees' while the two are still married.\n\nCyrus also claimed that one of the charges included $50,000 on his credit card statement.\n\nBut the law firm representing Firerose claimed that it has already returned $45,000 - adding that $5,000 was only meant to be charged instead of $50,000 at the time of the transaction.\n\nAlso on Friday, a source told Us Weekly in another update following the pair's shock divorce that Cyrus had accused his estranged wife of cheating before filing for an annulment of their marriage.\n\n'Billy and Firerose were always fighting and the relationship was intense and toxic at times,' the insider expressed to the outlet. 'Billy accused Firerose of cheating and it was the final straw for him.'\n\nAccording to the source, his daughters Miley and Noah, as well as 'their siblings never understood the relationship and why Billy married her so abruptly. No one approved of the marriage.'\n\nThe Flowers songstress 'is hopeful this will give some peace to the family and she thinks this is a good step in the right direction for him.'\n\nEarlier this week on Tuesday, new details surrounding the divorce filing came to light. TMZ reported that the singer claimed both irreconcilable differences and 'inappropriate marital conduct' were the reasons behind their split.\n\nAdditionally, Cyrus is requesting an annulment, alleging the marriage was entered into fraudulently.\n\nHe said their date of separation was on May 22, 2024 in the divorce documents, which were filed last month.\n\nIn court documents obtained by E!, Cyrus said he is seeking an annulment as 'he gave consent to marriage based on Fraud by the Wife, that had he known he would not have entered into the bonds of matrimony.'\n\nTMZ also reported that it appears Billy wanted Firerose, 34, out of their home by May 24. He is willing to pay as much as $500 a night over the course of 10 days for her lodging costs.\n\nOnce the 10 day period has lapsed, he is willing to pay $5,000 a month for her to acquire a suitable new home in Tennessee.\n\nBilly is prepared to make the payments over the course of 90 days or once their divorce is officially finalized, whichever happens first. The payments must be made on the first of the month.\n\nDailyMail.com has requested comment from Billy's representative.\n\nThe singer wed his Australian wife back in October 2023 but filed for divorce in late May - per TMZ. She was his third wife - he was married to Cindy Smith from 1986 until 1991 and Miley Cyrus' mom Tish from 1993-2022.\n\nThe divorce case notes there are no minor children between them.\n\nBilly and Firerose had previously gushed about their romance and the unexpected way they met and eventually got married.\n\nOn an episode of The Kelly Clarkson Show last year, Clarkson asked the couple about the story of how they met, with Firerose saying: 'It's actually a funny story because I was walking out of an audition on Sunset Gala in Hollywood.'\n\nThe couple met each other on a Los Angeles street while Billy was with his dog and Firerose was coming out of an audition.\n\n'[He] was the most beautiful German shepherd you've ever seen,' said Firerose. 'He was tapped into some divine purpose because we were, at the time, just friends and all these years later...that was 14 years ago. All these years later, we just got married.'\n\nTheir wedding took place over a year after they initially announced their engagement, and almost two years after Billy Ray's divorce from Tish Cyrus.\n\nThe two notably collaborated on the track called, New Day, which was released in 2021 and the pair also performed the song together on a number of talk shows.\n\nCyrus and Firerose also worked on the song, Plans, which they sang together on Good Morning America in September.\n\nIn August 2022, Billy proposed to Firerose, however, he didn't confirm their engagement until later that same year in November. He is now embroiled in a family feud with his daughter Miley.\n\nThe Grammy winner shared a throwback photo of himself with daughter Miley along with a poem he wrote for her earlier last week amid a reported rift.\n\n'One of my best memories ever: @cma Fest, back when it was Fan Fair,' Billy Ray started in the caption. 'That's @mileycyrus and me, surrounded by thousands of incredible fans at the fairgrounds.'\n\nHe held Miley, now 31, as a baby in the photo, which was framed along with two hand-written pages of poetry.\n\n'The next day, someone handed me this picture, and I wrote that poem right then on the bus,' he recounted.\n\nTish tied the knot with Dominic Purcell in an intimate Malibu ceremony last August, with Miley as her maid of honor. Noah, 24, and son Braison Cyrus, 29, were notably absent from the nuptials, fueling further speculation of a feud at the time.\n\nIn February, reports surfaced that Noah was dating Purcell, 54, when Tish 'started pursuing him,' and she 'was aware' he was with her daughter.\n\n'The turmoil between Noah and Tish goes far beyond [what people think],' a source told Us Weekly. 'Noah is very distraught over Tish stealing Dominic from her.'\n\nAnother source has since told DailyMail.com that Noah fabricated the story about dating Purcell.\n\n'Noah never dated Dominic and they were not together,' said the insider. 'She is delusional to think otherwise and is trying to create a narrative that will paint her as a victim.'\n\nBilly Ray and Tish also share daughter Brandi, 37, and son Trace, 35, her children from a previous relationship that he adopted. Additionally, he's father to son Christopher Cody, 32.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In the filing, Firerose (real name Johanna Rose Hodges) claimed that Cyrus, 62, was \"unpredictable and volatile\" during their marriage, which was allegedly caused by substance abuse issues.\n\n\"Wife was the victim of extreme verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse,\" Firerose's attorneys wrote in the complaint, per the outlet. \"Wife was subjected to Husband's persistent drug use accompanied with the consumption of marijuana which made Husband unpredictable and volatile towards Wife.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Us confirmed that Cyrus filed for annulment from Firerose after seven months of marriage, claiming their union was fraudulent. He cited irreconcilable differences and \"inappropriate marital conduct\" as the reason for the split.\n\nA source exclusively told Us earlier this month that Cyrus accused Firerose of infidelity. \"Billy and Firerose were always fighting and the relationship was intense and toxic at times,\" the insider explained. \"Billy accused Firerose of cheating and it was the final straw for him.\"\n\nAccording to documents obtained by TMZ at the time, Cyrus listed the twosome's date of separation as May 22, 2024, two days after which he required Firerose to move out of their shared home. Cyrus reportedly paid Firerose $500 a night for 10 days for temporary housing and he will continue to pay his ex $5,000 a month for sustainable housing in Tennessee for 90 days or until their divorce is finalized.\n\nDays after news broke of their split, Us confirmed that Cyrus was also seeking a temporary restraining order from Firerose and claimed that she made unauthorized purchases using his credit cards. The country singer requested that she stop using his cards and reimburse him the money she spent.\n\nAccording to documents obtained by In Touch Weekly, there were \"37 unauthorized charges [that] are being disputed as fraudulent charges.\" The purchases made via American Express from May 23 to June 7 include Venmo payments, flights, $10,000 paid to the United States Treasury and $50,000 to a law firm.

In the court documents, obtained by People magazine, Firerose called Cyrus \"unpredictable and volatile\" and alleged the Achy Breaky Heart singer has substance abuse issues.\n\nHer lawyers wrote in the complaint that Cyrus' \"persistent drug use accompanied with the consumption of marijuana\" made her feel unsafe in the Tennessee home where they lived together.\n\nShe said in the weeks leading up to Cyrus' divorce filing, he trapped her \"into an emotional and psychological prison\" and \"continuously launched verbal assaults.\"\n\nIn a statement, Cyrus' lawyers said Firerose's allegations \"left Mr. Cyrus with no recourse but to set the record straight.\"\n\nCyrus' lawyers said he was \"defrauded in his inducement to marry Ms. Hodges,\" a claim he already made in his initial divorce filing.\n\nThe lawyers said Firerose's counter-complaint is \"especially confusing and suspicious in its veracity since she begged Mr. Cyrus to forgive her and take her back only 2 days after he filed his pleadings to dissolve his marriage.\"\n\nThey provided entertainment publication US Weekly with a handwritten note, allegedly penned by Firerose, asking Cyrus to \"work it out\" together. The lawyers also shared a text they claim was sent by Firerose to Cyrus that insisted she did not want to \"live without\" him and was \"praying with my entire soul that we find each other again.\"\n\n\"If Mr. Cyrus was truly guilty of the allegations that Ms. Hodges alleges in her pleadings, then it is mind-boggling to try and explain why she would want to return to live with him,\" the lawyers wrote in their statement. \"Furthermore, she was pleading with him to give her a chance to explain everything to him.\"\n\nIn her counter-complaint, Firerose also accused Cyrus of filing for divorce only two days before she was scheduled to undergo a preventative double mastectomy on May 24. Firerose was diagnosed as a carrier of the BRCA1 gene mutation in 2020, which has increased risks of several cancers, according to the complaint.\n\nFirerose has since postponed the surgery. She told the court Cyrus paid for her health insurance and that he said he would cover any additional costs, though he \"has now repudiated that promise.\"\n\nThe court filing also alleges Cyrus' brother and sister-in-law entered the home where he lived with Firerose and tried to force her to move out. The document claims they banged at her bedroom door for three-and-a-half hours in an attempt to get her to vacate.\n\nFirerose, who has requested alimony, has since moved out of the residence.\n\nShe said Cyrus had a \"direct hand\" in restricting her \"access to income and future opportunities.\"\n\nCyrus filed an amendment to his initial divorce complaint on June 17, in which he alleges Firerose was \"conducting a campaign to isolate\" him from at least one of his daughters.\n\nHe said the isolation began in May, after Cyrus filed for divorce, as reported by People.\n\nThe country singer has three daughters, Miley and Noah Cyrus, who he shares with his ex-wife Tish Cyrus, as well as his oldest daughter Brandi Cyrus, who is Tish's daughter from a previous relationship and was adopted by Cyrus.\n\nCyrus told the court Firerose \"blocked\" communication from at least one of his daughters, who had been trying to reach him through phone calls or on his electronic devices.\n\n(It is not clear which daughter, or daughters, Cyrus is referring to.)\n\nSome fans of the Cyrus family have speculated there is an ongoing rift between Cyrus and his daughter Miley, who noticeably did not mention him in her Grammy acceptance speech in February. Though the father and daughter have never publicly confirmed the state of their relationship, Miley told David Letterman this month that she inherited \"narcissism\" from her father.\n\nCyrus is seeking a temporary restraining order against Firerose.\n\nHe claimed that after he submitted the divorce filing, Firerose used his business credit card to make 37 unauthorized purchases totalling about US$97,000 (about C$133,000). Cyrus' temporary restraining order would make it so that Firerose cannot access his cards. He requested to be reimbursed for the 37 charges.\n\nFirerose's lawyer submitted a court response to Cyrus' amendment and said the allegations about unauthorized charges are \"untrue.\"\n\n\"Throughout the divorce proceedings, the parties are to live as per the status quo during the marriage,\" the response reads. \"Wife was simply living as she has since October 10, 2023, and Husband has no right to cut her off.\"\n\nCyrus' amendment also accused Firerose of lying about being married twice before and of lying about her surname. He told the court Firerose was using the Cyrus last name to further her own music and entertainment career.\n\nFirerose herself has not commented publicly on the new allegations made in the ongoing divorce proceedings.\n\nThe couple married in October 2023. Their divorce came seven months after tying the knot, with Cyrus citing irreconcilable differences and inappropriate marital conduct as reason for the separation.\n\nIn her counter-complaint, Firerose denied any inappropriate marital conduct.\n\nCyrus told the court he is also seeking to annul the marriage on the grounds of fraud, the exact details of which are unclear.\n\nCyrus was previously married to Tish Cyrus, though the couple divorced in April 2022 after 28 years of marriage. Together, they share five children: Miley, Noah and Brandi, and sons Trace (who, like Brandi, was also adopted by Cyrus) and Braison.\n\nCyrus also has one other child with his ex-girlfriend Kristen Luckey, son Christopher Cody. He was earlier married to Cindy Smith from 1986 until 1991, making Firerose his third wife.", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achy_Breaky_Heart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Achy Breaky Heart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Ray_Cyrus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billy Ray Cyrus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychological abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soul music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alimony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alimony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastectomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mastectomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandi_Cyrus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandi Cyrus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tish_Cyrus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tish Cyrus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Cyrus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Noah Cyrus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreconcilable_differences", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Irreconcilable differences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Status quo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Letterman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Letterman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian dollar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File Management", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1634728410.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&crop=0px%2C2px%2C2437px%2C1289px&resize=720%2C379", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663485", "eventUri": "eng-9663485", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-22", "textStart": 195, "textEnd": 201}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 358, "textEnd": 365}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-24", "textStart": 2200, "textEnd": 2206}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-17", "textStart": 3050, "textEnd": 3057}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-10-", "textStart": 4784, "textEnd": 4794}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 228, "relevance": 1}

He cited 'irreconcilable differences' and 'inappropriate marital conduct' for what led to her split.\n\nIn Firerose's complaint, she denied being guilty of inappropriate marital conduct and claimed it was Cyrus who made living together 'unsafe.'\n\nShe claimed in the weeks leading up to her preventative double mastectomy and reconstruction surgery, recommended by her doctor in March, were 'chaos.'\n\nThe performer, who is a carrier of the BRCA1 gene mutation, also alleged that her spouse 'continuously launched verbal assaults' at her and placed her 'into an emotional and psychological prison.'\n\n'When Wife would attempt to voice certain concerns, Husband would often call her a 'selfish f**king b**ch' and continually alleged that she was using him,' the complaint read.\n\nFirerose claims that less than 24 hours before she was supposed to undergo surgery, he filed for divorce, and that 'Cyrus's brother and sister-in-law banged on her bedroom door for three-and-a-half hours that day demanding she leave their shared home.'\n\nShe said she did and made the decision to postponed her surgery 'indefinitely' as she no longer has a permanent residence and 'was allegedly relying on Cyrus' health insurance and previous promises to pay for her surgery.'\n\nFirerose, who is requesting alimony from Cyrus, proceeded to accuse Cyrus of intentionally trying to sabotage her career 'in retaliation.'\n\n'The accumulation of years of verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse, combined with the fact that Husband has had a direct hand in restricting Wife's access to income and future opportunities, Wife has developed severe emotional distress from Husband's actions,' the complaint read. 'Wife has had to seek psychological treatment from her therapist for emergency sessions on more than one occasion.'\n\nCyrus's attorneys denied Firerose's claims to DailyMail.com.\n\n'We regret that Ms. Hodges has chosen to litigate this 7-month marriage in the press and has left Mr. Cyrus with no recourse but to set the record straight,' his lawyers said in a statement. 'The allegations that Ms. Hodges states in her answer and counter-complaint are especially confusing and suspicious in its veracity since she begged Mr. Cyrus to forgive her and take her back only 2 days after he filed his pleadings to dissolve his marriage.'\n\nCyrus's representatives went on to claim that when 'Mr. Cyrus returned to his home 2 days after Ms. Hodges was required, by Court Order, to vacate his residence of over 25 years and allowed him to return, he discovered a handwritten note from Ms. Hodges professing her love and need to be with Mr. Cyrus.'\n\nCyrus' attorneys concluded: 'If Mr. Cyrus was truly guilty of the allegations that Ms. Hodges alleges in her pleadings, then it is mindboggling to try and explain why she would want to return to live with him. Furthermore, she was pleading with him to give her a chance to explain everything to him.'\n\nDailyMail.com has obtained a copy of a legal filing Cyrus' lawyers submit to the court Williamson County, Tennessee on Monday.\n\nExcerpts from the court filing include a screenshot of a text message and a picture of a handwritten note Firerose, 35, wrote to Cyrus, 62, days after he filed for divorce May 23 after around seven months of marriage.\n\nIn both the text and note, Firerose, whose real name is Johanna Rose Hodges, appears to be trying to salvage the relationship amid difficult circumstances she did not provide specific examples of.\n\nThe note read, 'I miss you more than I can possibly explain in words Baby. Please lets work this out and not become anything but closer out of this hellish experience. I need you. I love you. I am so sorry.'\n\nAs for the text, it reads: 'I am listening to you baby,' she said. 'I love you. I don't want us to be on different sides fighting the war that nobody wins.'\n\n'I am going to do what you're telling me because you promised me we can talk as soon as I've left and I trust you. I'm praying with my entire soul that we can find each other again today.'\n\nFirerose continued: 'I feel completely lost and miss you more than I can explain. And you will know I'm listening to you and showing you with my actions. We need to be kind and loving to each other no matter what happens.\n\n'You have been my best friend in the world every day for over 4 years. 24/7. I miss you terribly. My heart is shattered & I need the best friend right now more than ever.'\n\nFirerose said that she had lost her appetite amid the relationship woes: 'I lost 5 pounds since Wednesday. I just can't eat no matter how much I tried. I don't wanna live without you.\n\n'Please give me a chance to make this right. I can explain everything but I need you on my side. I need my hero back.'\n\nLast week, the Hannah Montana alum, who is seeking an annulment, accused Firerose of overcharging his credit card after he filed for divorce.\n\nIn new court documents obtained by TMZ on Friday, Cyrus claimed that Firerose made 37 unauthorized charges on his American Express card totaling a whopping $96,986.05 between May 23 and June 7.\n\nBilly also requested a temporary restraining order to prevent the Australian-born singer from having anymore access to his bank accounts and credit cards.\n\nHe further claimed that his estranged wife - who has denied the allegations - made the charges without his consent, and added he never permitted her to have access to his cards.\n\nIn the court documents, Cyrus added that both he and Firerose did not file joint tax returns to further back up his side.\n\nThe star has requested that a judge approve an 'emergency motion' to halt Firerose from having access to his accounts and cards, while asking for reimbursement on the 37 unauthorized charges.\n\nHowever, Billy's estranged wife has also filed her own court documents and denied the allegations.\n\nThe singer claimed she always had access to his credit cards - which began when she moved in with the performer in 2022. Firerose also added that she was never given a limit in regards to what she could charge.\n\nAccording to TMZ, she has also claimed she should be allowed to have continuous access to Billy's money 'for her personal and household expenses' and 'attorney fees' while the two are still married.\n\nCyrus also claimed that one of the charges included $50,000 on his credit card statement.\n\nBut the law firm representing Firerose claimed that it has already returned $45,000 - adding that $5,000 was only meant to be charged instead of $50,000 at the time of the transaction.\n\nAlso on Friday, a source told Us Weekly in another update following the pair's shock divorce that Cyrus had accused his estranged wife of cheating before filing for an annulment of their marriage.\n\n'Billy and Firerose were always fighting and the relationship was intense and toxic at times,' the insider expressed to the outlet. 'Billy accused Firerose of cheating and it was the final straw for him.'\n\nAccording to the source, his daughters Miley and Noah, as well as 'their siblings never understood the relationship and why Billy married her so abruptly. No one approved of the marriage.'\n\nThe Flowers songstress 'is hopeful this will give some peace to the family and she thinks this is a good step in the right direction for him.'\n\nEarlier this week on Tuesday, new details surrounding the divorce filing came to light. TMZ reported that the singer claimed both irreconcilable differences and 'inappropriate marital conduct' were the reasons behind their split.\n\nAdditionally, Cyrus is requesting an annulment, alleging the marriage was entered into fraudulently.\n\nHe said their date of separation was on May 22, 2024 in the divorce documents, which were filed last month.\n\nIn court documents obtained by E!, Cyrus said he is seeking an annulment as 'he gave consent to marriage based on Fraud by the Wife, that had he known he would not have entered into the bonds of matrimony.'\n\nTMZ also reported that it appears Billy wanted Firerose, 34, out of their home by May 24. He is willing to pay as much as $500 a night over the course of 10 days for her lodging costs.\n\nOnce the 10 day period has lapsed, he is willing to pay $5,000 a month for her to acquire a suitable new home in Tennessee.\n\nBilly is prepared to make the payments over the course of 90 days or once their divorce is officially finalized, whichever happens first. The payments must be made on the first of the month.\n\nDailyMail.com has requested comment from Billy's representative.\n\nThe singer wed his Australian wife back in October 2023 but filed for divorce in late May - per TMZ. She was his third wife - he was married to Cindy Smith from 1986 until 1991 and Miley Cyrus' mom Tish from 1993-2022.\n\nThe divorce case notes there are no minor children between them.\n\nBilly and Firerose had previously gushed about their romance and the unexpected way they met and eventually got married.\n\nOn an episode of The Kelly Clarkson Show last year, Clarkson asked the couple about the story of how they met, with Firerose saying: 'It's actually a funny story because I was walking out of an audition on Sunset Gala in Hollywood.'\n\nThe couple met each other on a Los Angeles street while Billy was with his dog and Firerose was coming out of an audition.\n\n'[He] was the most beautiful German shepherd you've ever seen,' said Firerose. 'He was tapped into some divine purpose because we were, at the time, just friends and all these years later...that was 14 years ago. All these years later, we just got married.'\n\nTheir wedding took place over a year after they initially announced their engagement, and almost two years after Billy Ray's divorce from Tish Cyrus.\n\nThe two notably collaborated on the track called, New Day, which was released in 2021 and the pair also performed the song together on a number of talk shows.\n\nCyrus and Firerose also worked on the song, Plans, which they sang together on Good Morning America in September.\n\nIn August 2022, Billy proposed to Firerose, however, he didn't confirm their engagement until later that same year in November. He is now embroiled in a family feud with his daughter Miley.\n\nThe Grammy winner shared a throwback photo of himself with daughter Miley along with a poem he wrote for her earlier last week amid a reported rift.\n\n'One of my best memories ever: @cma Fest, back when it was Fan Fair,' Billy Ray started in the caption. 'That's @mileycyrus and me, surrounded by thousands of incredible fans at the fairgrounds.'\n\nHe held Miley, now 31, as a baby in the photo, which was framed along with two hand-written pages of poetry.\n\n'The next day, someone handed me this picture, and I wrote that poem right then on the bus,' he recounted.\n\nTish tied the knot with Dominic Purcell in an intimate Malibu ceremony last August, with Miley as her maid of honor. Noah, 24, and son Braison Cyrus, 29, were notably absent from the nuptials, fueling further speculation of a feud at the time.\n\nIn February, reports surfaced that Noah was dating Purcell, 54, when Tish 'started pursuing him,' and she 'was aware' he was with her daughter.\n\n'The turmoil between Noah and Tish goes far beyond [what people think],' a source told Us Weekly. 'Noah is very distraught over Tish stealing Dominic from her.'\n\nAnother source has since told DailyMail.com that Noah fabricated the story about dating Purcell.\n\n'Noah never dated Dominic and they were not together,' said the insider. 'She is delusional to think otherwise and is trying to create a narrative that will paint her as a victim.'\n\nBilly Ray and Tish also share daughter Brandi, 37, and son Trace, 35, her children from a previous relationship that he adopted. Additionally, he's father to son Christopher Cody, 32.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He believes she only married him for financial and other reasons. He's convinced that she didn't marry him for love.\"\n\nWith all the back-and-forth between the couple regarding the divorce and the accusations that Firerose has now made, the source explained to the news outlet that Cyrus has now seen his estranged wife's \"true colors.\"\n\nThey added that the musician \"feels beyond deceived and is ready to move on alone.\"\n\nFirerose responded to Cyrus's filing in a counter-complaint filed on June 14, in which she made her own allegations.\n\nShe claimed that the \"Old Town Road\" singer filed for divorce a day before her scheduled double mastectomy and that he inflicted \"extreme verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse.\"\n\nIn the complaint, Firerose claimed that Cyrus \"continuously launched verbal assaults\" at her and that his marijuana and other drug use made him \"unpredictable and volatile\" towards her.\n\nThe singer said she was forced to \"walk on eggshells\" around him and that Cyrus put her \"into an emotional and psychological prison.\"\n\nFirerose also claimed that Cyrus had promised to support her surgery and even paid for her medical insurance shortly after their marriage. The filings say that Cyrus was ready to cover any expenses that weren't already covered by insurance but that he has now \"repudiated\" the promise.\n\nThe 62-year-old has responded to Firerose's accusations by filing a supplemental complaint to his initial filings for an annulment on the grounds of \"fraud.\"\n\nHis additional complaint includes claims that Firerose had a \"campaign to isolate\" Cyrus from his family, especially regarding contact with his daughters.\n\nCyrus also accused Firerose of spending over $96k across 37 unauthorized charges on his credit cards.\n\n\"As a result of these fraudulent charges... I am concerned that Ms. Hodges is in possession of other information that she may use to make fraudulent, unauthorized charges to my business and personal credit cards and accounts,\" Cyrus wrote, per People.\n\nHe requested that his wife refund or return whatever she bought using his business credit card.\n\nCyrus' legal team shared a handwritten love note that Firerose allegedly wrote to Cyrus, begging them to work out their relationship.\n\nAccording to Page Six, it read, \"I miss you more than I can possibly explain in words Baby. Please let's work this out and not become anything but closer out of this hellish experience. I need you. I love you. I am so sorry.\"\n\nCyrus allegedly found the note when he returned home two days after Firerose was ordered by a court to vacate their home.\n\nThe country singer's lawyers also claimed that Firerose sent another message, this time through text, begging her estranged husband for another chance.\n\nIt read, \"I'm praying with my entire soul that we can find each other again today. I feel completely lost & miss you more than I can explain. You have been my best friend in the world every day for over 4 years. 24/7. I miss you terribly.

He cited 'irreconcilable differences' and 'inappropriate marital conduct' for what led to her split.\n\nBilly claims that Firerose tried to use his name to further her own musical career.\n\nShe had alleged that he submitted her to verbal and emotional abuse after she told him she had to get the double mastectomy and that he changed his behavior toward her, per TMZ.\n\nFirerose claimed that Billy said he would pay for it and she had to scramble after he filed for divorce.\n\nShe claimed in the weeks leading up to her preventative double mastectomy and reconstruction surgery, recommended by her doctor in March, were 'chaos.'\n\nThe performer, who is a carrier of the BRCA1 gene mutation, also alleged that her spouse 'continuously launched verbal assaults' at her and placed her 'into an emotional and psychological prison.'\n\n'When Wife would attempt to voice certain concerns, Husband would often call her a 'selfish f**king b**ch' and continually alleged that she was using him,' the complaint read.\n\nFirerose claims that less than 24 hours before she was supposed to undergo surgery, he filed for divorce, and that 'Cyrus's brother and sister-in-law banged on her bedroom door for three-and-a-half hours that day demanding she leave their shared home.'\n\nShe said she did and made the decision to postponed her surgery 'indefinitely' as she no longer has a permanent residence and 'was allegedly relying on Cyrus' health insurance and previous promises to pay for her surgery.'\n\nFirerose, who is requesting alimony from Cyrus, proceeded to accuse Cyrus of intentionally trying to sabotage her career 'in retaliation.'\n\n'The accumulation of years of verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse, combined with the fact that Husband has had a direct hand in restricting Wife's access to income and future opportunities, Wife has developed severe emotional distress from Husband's actions,' the complaint read. 'Wife has had to seek psychological treatment from her therapist for emergency sessions on more than one occasion.'\n\nCyrus's attorneys denied Firerose's claims to DailyMail.com.\n\n'We regret that Ms. Hodges has chosen to litigate this 7-month marriage in the press and has left Mr. Cyrus with no recourse but to set the record straight,' his lawyers said in a statement. 'The allegations that Ms. Hodges states in her answer and counter-complaint are especially confusing and suspicious in its veracity since she begged Mr. Cyrus to forgive her and take her back only 2 days after he filed his pleadings to dissolve his marriage.'\n\nCyrus's representatives went on to claim that when 'Mr. Cyrus returned to his home 2 days after Ms. Hodges was required, by Court Order, to vacate his residence of over 25 years and allowed him to return, he discovered a handwritten note from Ms. Hodges professing her love and need to be with Mr. Cyrus.'\n\nCyrus' attorneys concluded: 'If Mr. Cyrus was truly guilty of the allegations that Ms. Hodges alleges in her pleadings, then it is mindboggling to try and explain why she would want to return to live with him. Furthermore, she was pleading with him to give her a chance to explain everything to him.'\n\nFirerose's claims 'are especially confusing and suspicious in its veracity since she begged Cyrus to forgive her and take her back only two days after he filed his pleadings to dissolve his marriage,' reps for Billy Ray Cyrus said in a statement to DailyMail.com Tuesday.\n\nDailyMail.com has obtained a copy of a legal filing Cyrus' lawyers submit to the court Williamson County, Tennessee on Monday.\n\nExcerpts from the court filing include a screenshot of a text message and a picture of a handwritten note Firerose wrote to Cyrus days after he filed for divorce May 23 after around seven months of marriage.\n\nIn both the text and note, Firerose, whose real name is Johanna Rose Hodges, appears to be trying to salvage the relationship amid difficult circumstances she did not provide specific examples of.\n\nCyrus's reps said that the handwritten note - 'professing her love and need to be with' the Achy Breaky Heart vocalist - was penned by Firerose and left for Cyrus after she vacated their one-time home under court order.\n\nThe note read, 'I miss you more than I can possibly explain in words Baby.

Moreover, he also filed documents which alleged that Firerose had made fraudulent transactions on his cards.\n\nHowever, Firerose, whose real name is Johanna Rosie Hodges, further alleged in her filing that Cyrus had filed for divorce less than 24 hours before she was set to undergo a preventative double mastectomy and reconstruction surgery.\n\nShe stated that Cyrus' brother and sister-in-law banged on her bedroom door for three-and-a-half hours that day demanding she leave their shared home. Furthermore, she has postponed her surgery \"indefinitely,\" as she had nowhere to live and was allegedly relying on Cyrus's health insurance and previous \"promises to pay for her surgery.\"\n\nSince then, Cyrus has responded to the claims of his estranged wife. Cyrus' attorneys told Us Weekly that Firerose's claims are \"confusing and suspicious in its veracity since she begged Mr Cyrus to forgive her and take her back only 2 days after he filed his pleadings to dissolve his marriage.\"\n\nThe lawyers also provided a handwritten note, which was allegedly sent by Firerose, to \"work it out.\" They also shared a text message in which Firerose stated that she didn't want to \"live without\" Cyrus and was \"praying with my entire soul that we find each other again.\"\n\nCyrus' lawyers concluded the statement claiming that if their client was truly guilty of the allegations then it is \"mindboggling to try and explain why she would want to return to live with him.\"", "source": {"uri": "thenews.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News International"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Ray_Cyrus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Billy Ray Cyrus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychological abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreconcilable_differences", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Irreconcilable differences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastectomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mastectomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File Management", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/Viewers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/Viewers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Psychological_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Psychological Abuse", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2024-06-19/l_1201455_093811_updates.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663485", "eventUri": "eng-9663485", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 344, "textEnd": 351}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-23", "textStart": 762, "textEnd": 768}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

He cited 'irreconcilable differences' and 'inappropriate marital conduct' for what led to her split.\n\nSinger Firerose is accusing her estranged husband Billy Ray Cyrus of 'extreme verbal, emotional and psychological abuse'\n\nIn Firerose's complaint, she denied being guilty of inappropriate marital conduct and claimed it was Cyrus who made living together 'unsafe.'\n\nShe claimed in the weeks leading up to her preventative double mastectomy and reconstruction surgery, recommended by her doctor in March, were 'chaos.'\n\nThe performer, who is a carrier of the BRCA1 gene mutation, also alleged that her spouse 'continuously launched verbal assaults' at her and placed her 'into an emotional and psychological prison.'\n\n'When Wife would attempt to voice certain concerns, Husband would often call her a 'selfish f**king b**ch' and continually alleged that she was using him,' the complaint read.\n\nFirerose claims that less than 24 hours before she was supposed to undergo surgery, he filed for divorce, and that 'Cyrus's brother and sister-in-law banged on her bedroom door for three-and-a-half hours that day demanding she leave their shared home.'\n\nShe said she did and made the decision to postponed her surgery 'indefinitely' as she no longer has a permanent residence and 'was allegedly relying on Cyrus' health insurance and previous promises to pay for her surgery.'\n\nFirerose, who is requesting alimony from Cyrus, proceeded to accuse Cyrus of intentionally trying to sabotage her career 'in retaliation.'\n\nOne day after the country star, 62, requested a temporary restraining order against her in a Tennessee court, the singer (born Johanna Rose Hodges) filed a counter complaint detailing his alleged substance abuse issues that she claims made him 'unpredictable and volatile'\n\n'The accumulation of years of verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse, combined with the fact that Husband has had a direct hand in restricting Wife's access to income and future opportunities, Wife has developed severe emotional distress from Husband's actions,' the complaint read. 'Wife has had to seek psychological treatment from her therapist for emergency sessions on more than one occasion.'\n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to both Cyrus and Firerose's representatives, but has not heard back, at this time.\n\nLast week, the Hannah Montana alum, who is seeking an annulment, accused Firerose of overcharging his credit card after he filed for divorce.\n\nIn new court documents obtained by TMZ on Friday, Cyrus claimed that Firerose made 37 unauthorized charges on his American Express card totaling a whopping $96,986.05 between May 23 and June 7.\n\nBilly also requested a temporary restraining order to prevent the Australian-born singer from having anymore access to his bank accounts and credit cards.\n\nHe further claimed that his estranged wife - who has denied the allegations - made the charges without his consent, and added he never permitted her to have access to his cards.\n\nThe Sydney native, 37, also revealed that the Achy Breaky Heart hitmaker filed for divorce just 24 hours before she was reportedly scheduled to undergo a preventative double mastectomy\n\nIn the complaint, obtained by People , her attorneys claimed Firerose 'was subjected to' Cyrus' 'persistent drug use accompanied with the consumption of marijuana'\n\nIn the court documents, Cyrus added that both he and Firerose did not file joint tax returns to further back up his side.\n\nThe star has requested that a judge approve an 'emergency motion' to halt Firerose from having access to his accounts and cards, while asking for reimbursement on the 37 unauthorized charges.\n\nHowever, Billy's estranged wife has also filed her own court documents and denied the allegations.\n\nThe singer claimed she always had access to his credit cards - which began when she moved in with the performer in 2022. Firerose also added that she was never given a limit in regards to what she could charge.\n\nAccording to TMZ, she has also claimed she should be allowed to have continuous access to Billy's money 'for her personal and household expenses' and 'attorney fees' while the two are still married.\n\nCyrus also claimed that one of the charges included $50,000 on his credit card statement.\n\nBut the law firm representing Firerose claimed that it has already returned $45,000 - adding that $5,000 was only meant to be charged instead of $50,000 at the time of the transaction.\n\nAlso on Friday, a source told Us Weekly in another update following the pair's shock divorce that Cyrus had accused his estranged wife of cheating before filing for an annulment of their marriage.\n\nBilly recently requested a temporary restraining order to prevent the Australian-born singer, 35, from having anymore access to his bank accounts and credit cards; seen in August 2023 in Nashville\n\nHe further claimed that his estranged wife - who has since denied the allegations - made the charges without his consent, and added he never permitted her to have access to his cards\n\n'Billy and Firerose were always fighting and the relationship was intense and toxic at times,' the insider expressed to the outlet. 'Billy accused Firerose of cheating and it was the final straw for him.'\n\nAccording to the source, his daughters Miley and Noah, as well as 'their siblings never understood the relationship and why Billy married her so abruptly. No one approved of the marriage.'\n\nThe Flowers songstress 'is hopeful this will give some peace to the family and she thinks this is a good step in the right direction for him.'\n\nEarlier this week on Tuesday, new details surrounding the divorce filing came to light. TMZ reported that the singer claimed both irreconcilable differences and 'inappropriate marital conduct' were the reasons behind their split.\n\nAdditionally, Cyrus is requesting an annulment, alleging the marriage was entered into fraudulently.\n\nHe said their date of separation was on May 22, 2024 in the divorce documents, which were filed last month.\n\nIn court documents obtained by E!, Cyrus said he is seeking an annulment as 'he gave consent to marriage based on Fraud by the Wife, that had he known he would not have entered into the bonds of matrimony.'\n\nTMZ also reported that it appears Billy wanted Firerose, 34, out of their home by May 24. He is willing to pay as much as $500 a night over the course of 10 days for her lodging costs.\n\nOnce the 10 day period has lapsed, he is willing to pay $5,000 a month for her to acquire a suitable new home in Tennessee.\n\nThe singer claimed she always had access to his credit cards - which began when she moved in with the Hannah Montana star in 2022. Firerose also added that she was never given a limit in regards to what she could charge\n\nAlso on Friday, a source told Us Weekly in another update following the pair's shock divorce that Cyrus had accused his estranged wife of cheating before filing for an annulment of their marriage\n\nBilly is prepared to make the payments over the course of 90 days or once their divorce is officially finalized, whichever happens first. The payments must be made on the first of the month.\n\nDailyMail.com has requested comment from Billy's representative.\n\nThe singer wed his Australian wife back in October 2023 but filed for divorce in late May - per TMZ. She was his third wife - he was married to Cindy Smith from 1986 until 1991 and Miley Cyrus' mom Tish from 1993-2022.\n\nThe divorce case notes there are no minor children between them.\n\nBilly and Firerose had previously gushed about their romance and the unexpected way they met and eventually got married.\n\nOn an episode of The Kelly Clarkson Show last year, Clarkson asked the couple about the story of how they met, with Firerose saying: 'It's actually a funny story because I was walking out of an audition on Sunset Gala in Hollywood.'\n\nThe couple met each other on a Los Angeles street while Billy was with his dog and Firerose was coming out of an audition.\n\n'[He] was the most beautiful German shepherd you've ever seen,' said Firerose. 'He was tapped into some divine purpose because we were, at the time, just friends and all these years later...that was 14 years ago. All these years later, we just got married.'\n\nTheir wedding took place over a year after they initially announced their engagement, and almost two years after Billy Ray's divorce from Tish Cyrus.\n\n'Billy and Firerose were always fighting and the relationship was intense and toxic at times,' the insider expressed to the outlet. 'Billy accused Firerose of cheating and it was the final straw for him'; seen in 2020 in Las Vegas\n\nThe Flowers songstress 'is hopeful this will give some peace to the family and she thinks this is a good step in the right direction for him; seen with Miley (far left) and ex-wife Tish Cyrus in 2019 in L.A.\n\nThe two notably collaborated on the track called, New Day, which was released in 2021 and the pair also performed the song together on a number of talk shows.\n\nCyrus and Firerose also worked on the song, Plans, which they sang together on Good Morning America in September.\n\nIn August 2022, Billy proposed to Firerose, however, he didn't confirm their engagement until later that same year in November. He is now embroiled in a family feud with his daughter Miley.\n\nThe Grammy winner shared a throwback photo of himself with daughter Miley along with a poem he wrote for her earlier last week amid a reported rift.\n\n'One of my best memories ever: @cma Fest, back when it was Fan Fair,' Billy Ray started in the caption. 'That's @mileycyrus and me, surrounded by thousands of incredible fans at the fairgrounds.'\n\nHe held Miley, now 31, as a baby in the photo, which was framed along with two hand-written pages of poetry.\n\n'The next day, someone handed me this picture, and I wrote that poem right then on the bus,' he recounted.\n\nTish tied the knot with Dominic Purcell in an intimate Malibu ceremony last August, with Miley as her maid of honor. Noah, 24, and son Braison Cyrus, 29, were notably absent from the nuptials, fueling further speculation of a feud at the time.\n\nIn February, reports surfaced that Noah was dating Purcell, 54, when Tish 'started pursuing him,' and she 'was aware' he was with her daughter.\n\nIn court documents obtained by E! , Cyrus said he is seeking an annulment as 'he gave consent to marriage based on Fraud by the Wife, that had he known he would not have entered into the bonds of matrimony'\n\nThe Grammy winner shared a throwback photo of himself with daughter Miley along with a poem he wrote for her earlier last week amid a reported rift\n\n'The turmoil between Noah and Tish goes far beyond [what people think],' a source told Us Weekly. 'Noah is very distraught over Tish stealing Dominic from her.'\n\nAnother source has since told DailyMail.com that Noah fabricated the story about dating Purcell.\n\n'Noah never dated Dominic and they were not together,' said the insider. 'She is delusional to think otherwise and is trying to create a narrative that will paint her as a victim.'\n\nBilly Ray and Tish also share daughter Brandi, 37, and son Trace, 35, her children from a previous relationship that he adopted. Additionally, he's father to son Christopher Cody, 32.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The couple had been married for seven months.\n\n\"His instincts have been correct all along,\" the source disclosed. \"He believes she only married him for financial and other reasons. He's convinced that she didn't marry him for love.\"\n\nIn his divorce filing, Cyrus cited irreconcilable differences and inappropriate marital conduct as the reasons for the split.\n\nOn June 14, Firerose responded with a counter-complaint, accusing Cyrus of \"extreme verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse\" and claiming that he filed for divorce just one day before she was scheduled to undergo a preventative double mastectomy.\n\nHer attorneys wrote in the complaint, \"Wife was subjected to Husband's persistent drug use accompanied with the consumption of marijuana which made Husband unpredictable and volatile towards Wife.\"\n\nCyrus, in response, filed a supplemental complaint on June 17, alleging that Firerose conducted a \"campaign to isolate\" him from his family and \"blocked at least one of his daughters\" from contacting him through his electronic devices.\n\nHe also claimed that Firerose made 37 unauthorized charges totaling $96,986 on his credit cards.\n\nFurthermore, Cyrus' lawyers, Rose Palermo and Jason Talley, provided a handwritten note from Firerose professing her love to Cyrus.\n\nThe note, allegedly found when Cyrus returned home two days after Firerose was required to vacate his residence, read, \"I miss you more than I can possibly explain in words Baby.\n\nPlease let's work this out and not become anything but closer out of this hellish experience. I need you. I love you.

She claims that she \"relied on [Cyrus'] promises to pay for her surgery, and [he] has now repudiated that promise.\"\n\n\"On the day [Firerose] was set to get her surgery, she was instead searching for a place to live and under a significant amount of emotional distress,\" the docs claim, while further alleging that Cyrus allowed \"his family members to harass her into leaving the marital home the day before her scheduled double mastectomy, and causing the rift in [her] relationships with her professional agents and representatives.\"\n\nCyrus' lawyers, Rose Palermo and Jason Talley of Cheatham Palermo and Garrett, released a statement to ET Tuesday afternoon, expressing, \"We regret that Ms. Hodges has chosen to litigate this 7-month marriage in the press and has left Mr. Cyrus with no recourse but to set the record straight.\"\n\n\"The allegations that Ms. Hodges states in her answer and counter-complaint are especially confusing and suspicious in its veracity since she begged Mr. Cyrus to forgive her and take her back only 2 days after he filed his pleadings to dissolve his marriage,\" Cyrus' lawyers claim in their statement. \"When Mr. Cyrus returned to his home 2 days after Ms. Hodges was required, by Court Order, to vacate his residence of over 25 years and allowed him to return, he discovered a handwritten note from Ms. Hodges professing her love and need to be with Mr. Cyrus.\"\n\n\"If Mr. Cyrus was truly guilty of the allegations that Ms. Hodges alleges in her pleadings, then it is mindboggling to try and explain why she would want to return to live with him. Furthermore, she was pleading with him to give her a chance to explain everything to him,\" the statement concluded.\n\nCyrus' legal reps additionally provided documentation of the letter and a text message allegedly written by Firerose to Cyrus.\n\nThe abuse claims surfaced one day after ET obtained court documents filed by Cyrus seeking a temporary restraining order against Firerose.\n\nCyrus claimed that Firerose has spent $96,986 across 37 unauthorized charges using Cyrus' business credit card in recent weeks. According to the docs, the charges in question began on May 23, the same day that Cyrus filed for divorce.\n\n\"As a result of these fraudulent charges... I am concerned that Ms. Hodges is in possession of other information that she may use to make fraudulent, unauthorized charges to my business and personal credit cards and accounts,\" Cyrus wrote in an affidavit.\n\nIn response, Firerose stated that there was \"no emergency\" and that she has had access to his credit card for years.\n\n\"To claim Wife has made 37 unauthorized charges is untrue,\" her attorneys wrote in the response filing. \"Throughout the divorce proceedings, the parties are to live as per the status quo during the marriage. Wife was simply living as she has since Oct. 10, 2023, and Husband has no right to cut her off.\"\n\nCyrus claims that the former couple does not share any joint bank accounts, credit cards or real estate. Additionally, he alleges that neither party has ever been an authorized user of each other's cards or accounts. Regarding Firerose's assets, Cyrus reportedly said that she owns real estate worth more than seven figures in Los Angeles and has more than $500,000 in \"liquid and investment assets at her disposal.\"\n\nHe is requesting that Firerose refund or return anything purchased with his business card.\n\nAccording to divorce docs obtained by ET last week, the Hannah Montana actor filed paperwork to formalize their split on May 23 in Williamson County. He lists the date of separation as May 22 and cited the reason for the dissolution of the marriage as \"irreconcilable differences\" and \"inappropriate marital conduct.\" Under \"Grounds for Annulment,\" Cyrus noted \"consent to marriage was obtained by fraud.\"\n\nThe duo -- who first met on the set of Hannah Montana, before becoming musical collaborators -- got engaged in August 2022. They tied the knot on Oct. 10, 2023 in Franklin, Tennessee.\n\nThis will mark Cyrus' third divorce. He was previously married to Cindy Smith (1986-1991) and then Tish Cyrus (1993-2022). They tied the knot in December 1993 and divorced in April 2022 after nearly three decades of marriage.\n\nBilly Ray and Tish share three children -- Miley, 31, Braison, 30, and Noah, 24. Billy Ray also adopted Tish's children, Brandi, 37, and Trace, 35. Tish is now married to actor Dominic Purcell.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nBilly Ray Cyrus Files for Temporary Restraining Order Against Firerose\n\nWhat Billy Ray Cyrus, Firerose Said About Their Romance

He also asked for annulment on the grounds of fraud. Firerose denied the claim of inappropriate marital conduct in her own filing.\n\nCyrus - father of pop star Miley Cyrus - previously accused Firerose of charging to $97,000 his credit card without permission and applied for a temporary restraining order to bar her from accessing his personal and business credit cards and accounts and requested for her to be forced to pay back the money.\n\nIn her papers, Firerose insisted she wasn't in the wrong to be using her estranged husband's credit card.

The complaint says that \"Wife was subjected to Husband's persistent drug use accompanied with the consumption of marijuana which made Husband unpredictable and volatile towards Wife.\"\n\nThe complaint claims that when Cyrus submitted his original divorce filing in May, she was a day away from a preventative double mastectomy. It also states that Firerose, whose real name is Johanna Rosie Hodges, felt \"unsafe\" living with Cyrus, and in the weeks leading up to her surgery, he allegedly subjected her to \"chaos\" when he \"continuously launched verbal assaults,\" forcing her \"into an emotional and psychological prison.\"\n\n\"We regret that Ms. Hodges has chosen to litigate this 7-month marriage in the press and has left Mr. Cyrus with no recourse but to set the record straight,\" Cyrus' attorneys, Rose Palermo and Jason Talley, said in a statement, which included an attached document wherein Cyrus requested to submit \"an amended and supplemental request for annulment and divorce.\" \"This pleading sets forth the specifics of the Mr. Cyrus' fraud allegations and proof of Mr. Cyrus' allegations that he was defrauded in his inducement to marry Ms. Hodges.

Please let's work this out and not become anything but closer out of this hellish experience.\" If Mr. Cyrus was truly guilty of the allegations that Ms. Hodges alleges in her pleadings, then it is mindboggling to try and explain why she would want to return to live with him,\" the statement also says, with an attached screenshot of a text message in which Firerose allegedly said, \"I don't want to live without you. Please give me a chance to make this right.

For her part, Firerose, 35, has claimed that she was set to undergo a preventative double mastectomy the day before Cyrus filed for divorce on May 22, and has accused him of verbal and psychological abuse during their relationship.\n\nIn the new court documents, obtained by The Independent, Billy Ray alleged that his estranged wife, whose real name is Johanna Rosie Hodges, tried to alienate him from his family members, including at least one of his daughters. The \"Words by Heart\" singer and his ex Tish Cyrus share three daughters -- Brandi, 37, Miley, 31, and Noah, 24 -- and two sons, Trace, 35, and Braison, 30.\n\n\"Since the Plaintiff filed his initial complaint, he discovered that the Defendant had been conducting a campaign to isolate the Plaintiff from his family,\" his complaint reads. The document also claimed that Firerose took his phone and blocked one of his daughter's numbers.\n\n\"He has discovered that the Defendant, unknowingly to Plaintiff, blocked at least one of his daughters from being able to contact him on his phone(s) or electronic devices,\" the complaint continues.\n\nIn the new filing, Billy Ray Cyrus also alleged that Firerose lied about her identity. He claimed that she falsely said that \"Hodges\" was her maiden name and that she'd never been married before they tied the knot.\n\n\"During this time the Defendant repeatedly asserted that the Plaintiff was her soulmate,\" the motion reads. \"And that the Defendant wanted Plaintiff to be her one and only Husband.\"\n\nCyrus said that in May 2024 he found out the truth when he overheard her refering to herself \"with a last name that he did not know\" while she was speaking to the IRS.\n\nBilly Ray's legal team later obtained a copy of her 2014 California divorce judgment, which allegedly revealed Firerose's past marriage and that the name \"Hodges\" belonged to her ex-husband.\n\nThe Independent has contacted representatives for Billy Ray and Firerose for comment.\n\nThe singer's claim about his ex isolating him from his family comes weeks after Cyrus appeared to attempt to reconnect with his pop star daughter Miley amid rumors of a feud. Earlier this month, he took to Instagram to share a sweet throwback photo of him and Miley from when she was a baby, alongside a poem titled \"The Moment\" that he had written.\n\n\"I'm incredibly proud of her. She's a survivor and a true artist. She learned early on to love and appreciate the fans who make everything possible,\" he continued.\n\nWhen he first filed for divorce, Cyrus cited irreconcilable differences and \"inappropriate marital conduct\" as the reasons for the split. He also listed their date of separation as May 22, 2024. In the legal documents, Cyrus requested an immediate annulment, with \"claims his marriage was obtained by fraud.\"\n\nHe later filed a temporary restraining order from his ex, which would keep Firerose from any \"unauthorized\" purchases through his personal and professional credit cards and accounts. The singer alleged that his estranged wife spent $96,986 through 37 unauthorized charges on his business account, with one of the charges being a $70,665 payment to her lawyers.\n\nFirerose later responded to the divorce filing with claims that she \"was the victim of extreme verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse\" throughout their relationship, according to court documents obtained by People.\n\nShe also alleged that Cyrus filed for divorce only one day before she was set to undergo a preventative double mastectomy. The procedure was recommended by her doctors after she was found to be a carrier of the BRCA1 gene mutation, meaning she was more likely to develop breast cancer, court documents say.\n\nFirerose claimed that as the date of the surgery approached, her estranged husband \"continuously launched verbal assaults\" at her.\n\n\"With Wife's major surgery date looming, she was reasonably afraid to leave or seek any type of help because she feared that Husband would interfere with her surgery or her lengthy recovery at home,\" the complaint reads. The document also alleged that while Cyrus went back on a \"promise\" to pay for her surgery.\n\nIn a statement to The Independent, Billy Ray's legal team responded to Firerose's allegations, claiming her remarks \"are especially confusing and suspicious in its veracity since she begged [Billy Ray] to forgive her and take her back only two days after he filed his pleadings to dissolve his marriage.\"\n\n\"When Mr. Cyrus returned to his home two days after Ms. Hodges was required, by Court Order, to vacate his residence of over 25 years and allowed him to return, he discovered a handwritten note from Ms. Hodges professing her love and need to be with Mr. Cyrus,\" the statement continues.\n\nIn the alleged handwritten note from Firerose, shared with The Independent, she expressed how much she missed her Billy Ray and wanted to work things out between them. Billy Ray's legal team also shared a lengthy text message he received from her, \"shortly after she was required to vacate his premarital residence.\"\n\nIn the text, she wrote: \"I don't want us to be on different sides fighting a war that nobody wins. I am going to do what you're telling me because you promise me we can talk as soon as I've left and I trust you.

He claimed that she falsely said that \"Hodges\" was her maiden name and that she'd never been married before they tied the knot.\n\n\"During this time the Defendant repeatedly asserted that the Plaintiff was her soulmate,\" the motion reads. \"And that the Defendant wanted Plaintiff to be her one and only Husband.\"\n\nCyrus said that in May 2024 he found out the truth when he overheard her refering to herself \"with a last name that he did not know\" while she was speaking to the IRS.\n\nBilly Ray's legal team later obtained a copy of her 2014 California divorce judgment, which allegedly revealed Firerose's past marriage and that the name \"Hodges\" belonged to her ex-husband.\n\nThe Independent has contacted representatives for Billy Ray and Firerose for comment.\n\nThe singer's claim about his ex isolating him from his family comes weeks after Cyrus appeared to attempt to reconnect with his pop star daughter Miley amid rumors of a feud. Earlier this month, he took to Instagram to share a sweet throwback photo of him and Miley from when she was a baby, alongside a poem titled \"The Moment\" that he had written.\n\n\"I'm incredibly proud of her. She's a survivor and a true artist. She learned early on to love and appreciate the fans who make everything possible,\" he continued.\n\nWhen he first filed for divorce, Cyrus cited irreconcilable differences and \"inappropriate marital conduct\" as the reasons for the split. He also listed their date of separation as May 22, 2024. In the legal documents, Cyrus requested an immediate annulment, with \"claims his marriage was obtained by fraud.\"\n\nHe later filed a temporary restraining order from his ex, which would keep Firerose from any \"unauthorized\" purchases through his personal and professional credit cards and accounts. The singer alleged that his estranged wife spent $96,986 through 37 unauthorized charges on his business account, with one of the charges being a $70,665 payment to her lawyers.\n\nFirerose later responded to the divorce filing with claims that she \"was the victim of extreme verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse\" throughout their relationship, according to court documents obtained by People.\n\nShe also alleged that Cyrus filed for divorce only one day before she was set to undergo a preventative double mastectomy. The procedure was recommended by her doctors after she was found to be a carrier of the BRCA1 gene mutation, meaning she was more likely to develop breast cancer, court documents say.\n\nFirerose claimed that as the date of the surgery approached, her estranged husband \"continuously launched verbal assaults\" at her.\n\n\"With Wife's major surgery date looming, she was reasonably afraid to leave or seek any type of help because she feared that Husband would interfere with her surgery or her lengthy recovery at home,\" the complaint reads. The document also alleged that while Cyrus went back on a \"promise\" to pay for her surgery.\n\nIn a statement to The Independent, Billy Ray's legal team responded to Firerose's allegations, claiming her remarks \"are especially confusing and suspicious in its veracity since she begged [Billy Ray] to forgive her and take her back only two days after he filed his pleadings to dissolve his marriage.\"\n\n\"When Mr. Cyrus returned to his home two days after Ms. Hodges was required, by Court Order, to vacate his residence of over 25 years and allowed him to return, he discovered a handwritten note from Ms. Hodges professing her love and need to be with Mr. Cyrus,\" the statement continues.\n\nIn the alleged handwritten note from Firerose, shared with The Independent, she expressed how much she missed her Billy Ray and wanted to work things out between them. Billy Ray's legal team also shared a lengthy text message he received from her, \"shortly after she was required to vacate his premarital residence.\"\n\nIn the text, she wrote: \"I don't want us to be on different sides fighting a war that nobody wins. I am going to do what you're telling me because you promise me we can talk as soon as I've left and I trust you. I'm praying with my entire soul that we can find each other again today.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Ray_Cyrus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Billy Ray Cyrus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychological abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastectomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mastectomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maiden_and_married_names", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maiden and married names"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreconcilable_differences", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Irreconcilable differences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA1", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BRCA1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleading", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pleading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soul music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breast cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annulment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Annulment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File Management", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance Abuse", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/17/21/newFile.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663485", "eventUri": "eng-9663485", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-22", "textStart": 666, "textEnd": 672}], "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

DailyMail.com has obtained a copy of a legal filing Cyrus' lawyers submit to the court Williamson County, Tennessee on Monday.\n\nExcerpts from the court filing include a screenshot of a text message and a picture of a handwritten note Firerose, 35, wrote to Cyrus, 62, days after he filed for divorce May 23 after around seven months of marriage. In both the text and note, Firerose, whose real name is Johanna Rose Hodges, appears to be trying to salvage the relationship amid difficult circumstances she did not provide specific examples of.\n\nCyrus's reps said that the handwritten note - 'professing her love and need to be with' the Achy Breaky Heart vocalist - was penned by Firerose and left for Cyrus after she vacated their one-time home under court order. Cyrus's reps said Firerose penned a long text message which 'clearly speaks for itself' - as she said she wanted to make peace with him, and had been very upset about their relationship issues.\n\n'If Cyrus was truly guilty of the allegations that [Firerose ] alleges in her pleadings, then it is mindboggling to try and explain why she would want to return to live with him,' the reps said. 'Furthermore, she was pleading with him to give her a chance to explain everything to him.'\n\nCyrus's reps said in the aforementioned statement that Firerose's decision 'to litigate this 7-month marriage in the press ... has left Mr. Cyrus with no recourse but to set the record straight.' The reps cited the court filing Cyrus entered in an effort 'to file an amended and supplemental complaint for annulment and divorce' which 'sets forth the specifics of [his] fraud allegations and proof of [his] allegations that he was defrauded in his inducement to marry' Firerose.\n\nIn the legal filing from Cyrus on Monday, he said that Firerose sought to deceive him in an effort to marry into the famed family to boost her career. Cyrus' legal team said in the court filing that Cyrus trusted Firerose and 'falsely believed she was an honest person.' Cyrus' team said that Firerose has used his American Express card 37 times since he filed for divorce less than a month ago, racking up more than $96,000 in unauthorized charges.\n\nThe charges included multiple cross-country flights, legal fees, her outstanding tax obligations and Venmo payments. Cyrus' team said that Firerose had misled him into believing she hadn't been married before, and made the claim on a joint appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show last October.\n\nCyrus' team said in court docs that Firerose had conducted 'a campaign' to isolate him from his family, and blocked at least one of his daughters from being able to contact him. Firerose in a legal complaint June 14 in Tennessee that Cyrus would conduct himself in an 'unpredictable and volatile' manner and that she 'was the victim of extreme verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse.'\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Firerose, whose real name is Johanna Rose Hodges, alleged that Cyrus had an 'unpredictable and volatile' behavior during their marriage.\n\nThe development comes just days after Cyrus claimed that his estranged wife married him for his money, and accused her of being a fraud. The 62-year-old singer's attorneys have now responded to Firerore's complaint, alleging that she wanted to get back with their client after he filed for divorce in May.\n\nIn the court documents filed on June 14, Fireroe accused Billy Ray Cyrus of 'extreme verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse.' The 36-year-old singer claimed Cyrus' volatile behavior arose out of drug consumption. \"Wife was the victim of extreme verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse,\" read the court documents.\n\n\"Wife was subjected to Husband's persistent drug use accompanied with the consumption of marijuana which made Husband unpredictable and volatile towards Wife,\" the filing read further. Cyrus had filed for divorce from Firerose after seven months of marriage on May 23 citing irreconcilable differences and 'inappropriate marital conduct.' Last week, the 'Could've Been Me' singer asked for a restraining order against his wife after she spent over $96k from his credit card.\n\nBilly Ray Cyrus has denied the domestic abuse allegations through his attorneys Rose Palermo and Jason Talley. In their official statement to the press, the lawyers said that Firerose's claims were confusing, as she 'begged' Cyrus to take her back after he filed for divorce.\n\n\"The allegations that Ms. Hodges states in her answer and counter-complaint are especially confusing and suspicious in its veracity since she begged Mr. Cyrus to forgive her and take her back only 2 days after he filed his pleadings to dissolve his marriage,\" read the statement.\n\nPalermo and Talley also shared a handwritten note and a text message, allegedly written by Firerose, in which she asked Cyrus to 'work out' their marriage and told him that she was 'praying with her entire soul that they find each other again.'\n\n\"If Mr. Cyrus was truly guilty of the allegations that Ms. Hodges alleges in her pleadings, then it is mind-boggling to try and explain why she would want to return to live with him. Furthermore, she was pleading with him to give her a chance to explain everything to him,\" the attorneys' response concluded.\n\nMust Read: Harry Potter Star Imelda Staunton Shares The Secret To Her 40-Year Marriage With Husband Jim Carter, Know HERE", "source": {"uri": "koimoi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Koimoi"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jashandeep_singh@koimoi.com", "name": "Jashandeep Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Ray_Cyrus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Billy Ray Cyrus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achy_Breaky_Heart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Achy Breaky Heart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychological abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Could've_Been_Me", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Could've Been Me"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restraining_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Restraining order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palermo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palermo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palermo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Carter_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Carter (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imelda_Staunton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imelda Staunton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soul music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Potter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File Management", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Psychological_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Psychological Abuse", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Abuse", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://static-koimoi.akamaized.net/wp-content/new-galleries/2024/06/billy-ray-cyrus-estranged-wife-firerose-accuses-him-of-domestic-abuse-the-achy-breaky-heart-singer-responds.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663485", "eventUri": "eng-9663485", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 779, "textEnd": 786}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-23", "textStart": 1329, "textEnd": 1335}], "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

The papers added: \"On the day Wife was set to get her surgery, she was instead searching for a place to live and under a significant amount of emotional distress ...\n\n\"Wife relied on Husband's promises to pay for her surgery, and Husband has now repudiated that promise. On the day Wife was set to get her surgery, she was instead searching for a place to live and under a significant amount of emotional distress.\"\n\nCyrus' divorce papers cite citing irreconcilable differences and inappropriate marital conduct as the reason behind the split. He also asked for annulment on the grounds of fraud. Firerose denied the claim of inappropriate marital conduct in her own filing.\n\nCyrus - father of pop star Miley Cyrus - previously accused Firerose of charging to $97,000 his credit card without permission and applied for a temporary restraining order to bar her from accessing his personal and business credit cards and accounts and requested for her to be forced to pay back the money.\n\nIn her papers, Firerose insisted she wasn't in the wrong to be using her estranged husband's credit card. The papers added: \"To claim Wife has made 37 unauthorised charges is untrue.\n\n\"Throughout the divorce proceedings, the parties are to live as per the status quo during the marriage. Wife was simply living as she has since October 10, 2023, and Husband has no right to cut her off.\"\n\nAt the time they married, Cyrus and Firerose said in a joint post on Instagram their wedding was the \"most perfect, ethereal celebration of love\".\n\nCyrus split from his ex-Tish Cyrus for a third time in April 2022 after 28 years of marriage.

Cyrus officially filed to be separated only a couple of days ago,and he's asking the court for an annulment on a claim that the marriage was \"obtained by fraud.\"\n\nThe couple's official date of separation was listed as May 22, 2024, and Cyrus gave his soon-to-be ex-wife a deadline of May 24th to leave their home while giving her a $500-a-night stipend over ten days for temporary housing. As for why Cyrus filed for divorce, the country music singer cited \"inappropriate marital conduct\" and \"irreconcilable differences.\" And an alleged credit card spending spree didn't help the rocky marriage either...\n\nNeedless to say, it has been quite the messy divorce so far. I don't know if there's ever been a \"clean divorce,\" but Billy Ray Cyrus and Firerose are putting on a masterclass of \"going down in flames,\" so to speak. Perhaps the craziest and most cringeworthy portion of the proceedings is the fact (?) that Firerose claims Cyrus wanted out of the marriage one day after he discovered that she was planning on getting a double mastectomy.\n\nBig, if true.\n\nBut this appears to be a big case of he-said, she-said as both parties throw claims and allegations out at one another in court. The double mastectomy thing (which Firerose says was preventative) is definitely shady, if Firerose is being trustworthy. She also alleges that he verbally and emotionally abused her once he found out about it. That's the million dollar question, because Cyrus continues to insist that she's been dishonest their entire marriage, even filing that Firerose lied about who she really was and alleging marital misconduct.\n\nAccording to new documents obtained by TMZ, there's a chance that Firerose presented herself as having the maiden name \"Hodges\" when she actually had a different legal surname from a previous marriage. Billy Ray Cyrus apparently picked up clues that she was lying about her name, and once her lies were confirmed by attorneys, the country music artist was ready to call off the marriage.\n\nIt's hard to tell who is in the right and who is in the wrong here, but Billy Ray Cyrus only made these latest filings when Firerose made the potential \"double mastectomy\" public. She also alleged that Cyrus got very abusive, both verbally and emotionally, when she told him that the procedure was ordered by doctors.\n\nHe says she begged him to take her back, and offered up a hand-written note and text message as evidence.

Firerose also alleged in the complaint that Cyrus filed for divorce the day before she was scheduled to have a double mastectomy as a preventative measure, per PageSix. \"Wife was the victim of extreme verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse,\" Firerose's attorneys wrote in the complaint. \"Wife was subjected to Husband's persistent drug use accompanied with the consumption of marijuana which made Husband unpredictable and volatile towards Wife.\"\n\nIt was Cyrus who filed for divorce on May 23, almost seven months after they had gotten married, citing irreconcilable differences and inappropriate marital behavior. He also submitted documentation asking for the annulment on the grounds of 'fraud.' Firerose responded by denying any wrongdoing on her part as a married couple and blaming Cyrus for acting in a way that made their cohabitation 'unsafe.' According to the complaint, Firerose was identified in 2020 as a carrier of the BRCA1 gene mutation. In March of last year, she was told that a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery were necessary as a preventive measure.\n\nThe Australian musician said in her complaint that the weeks preceding her May 24, 2024, operation were 'chaotic,' with Cyrus 'continuously launching verbal assaults' at her and 'pushing her into an emotional and psychological prison.' Firerose, 36, said she had to 'walk on eggshells' in her own home in the days counting down to the surgery. \"With Wife's major surgery date looming, she was reasonably afraid to leave or seek any type of help because she feared that Husband would interfere with her surgery or her lengthy recovery at home,\" her filing read.\n\n\"When Wife would attempt to voice certain concerns, Husband would often call her a 'selfish f---ing bitch' and continually alleged that she was using him,\" the complaint said. In the complaint, Firerose claims that for three and a half hours on May 23, hours before she was scheduled for surgery, Cyrus' brother and sister-in-law repeatedly knocked on her bedroom door, asking that she leave their shared residence. She did, however, delay her operation 'indefinitely' because she was supposedly depending on Cyrus' health insurance and prior 'promises to pay for her surgery' and didn't have anywhere to live.\n\nCyrus, however, through his representative, denied such allegations and stated that Firerose was still utterly in love with him in a statement to Page Six. \"We regret that Ms. Hodges has chosen to litigate this 7-month marriage in the press and has left Mr. Cyrus with no recourse but to set the record straight,\" the statement began. \"The allegations that Ms. Hodges states in her answer and counter-complaint are especially confusing and suspicious in their veracity since she begged Mr. Cyrus to forgive her and take her back only 2 days after he filed his pleadings to dissolve his marriage.\"", "source": {"uri": "inquisitr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Inquisitr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastectomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mastectomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychological abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA1", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BRCA1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohabitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cohabitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Australian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annulment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Annulment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Surgery", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Surgery", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File Management", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Transition", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Transition", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Psychological_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Psychological Abuse", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/700397/uploads/603ee450-2e3a-11ef-ae69-7d5324b22dd8_800_420.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663485", "eventUri": "eng-9663485", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-23", "textStart": 644, "textEnd": 650, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

What does Billy mean by \"inappropriate marital conduct?\" Well, we soon got more insight into their lives together post-nuptials.\n\nAccording to Us Weekly, the estranged couple fought all the time, and their relationship was \"toxic at times.\" A source told the outlet that everything reached a breaking point when Billy Ray later accused Firerose \"of cheating.\"\n\nAnd it's not just the infidelity the Hannah Montana alum has an issue with! On top of everything else, he asked for a temporary restraining order! Why? He claimed in court docs that Firerose stole A LOT of money from him following their separation on May 22. We're talking almost $100,000 in credit card charges! Damn!\n\nRelated: Miley Cyrus Feels 'Vindicated' After Billy Ray Claims 'Fraud' In Divorce Filing -- She Warned Him!\n\nNow, Firerose has responded to the divorce filing with her own disturbing allegations! According to People on Tuesday, the 36-year-old musician accused Billy Ray of \"extreme verbal, emotional and psychological abuse\" in a counter-complaint filed in Tennessee on June 14. She claimed the actor's struggles with substance abuse make him \"unpredictable and volatile\" towards her:\n\n\"Wife was the victim of extreme verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse. Wife was subjected to Husband's persistent drug use accompanied with the consumption of marijuana which made Husband unpredictable and volatile towards Wife.\"\n\nMarijuana made him volatile? Hmm. Firerose denied ever engaging in inappropriate marital conduct at any point. Instead, she claimed HE was the one who acted inappropriately during their marriage. Things were so bad behind closed doors that living together became \"unsafe.\"\n\nWhoa...\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the divorce filing, she claimed, their relationship got really bad. The complaint states that Firerose was diagnosed as a carrier of the BRCA1 gene mutation back in 2020. After having an MRI in March of this year, her doctors \"highly recommended\" she undergo a preventative double mastectomy and reconstruction surgery. Firerose scheduled the first procedure for May 24.\n\nHowever, the weeks before her surgery were complete \"chaos\" as Billy Ray allegedly \"continuously launched verbal assaults\" and threatened to kick her out of their home and file for divorce. Firerose alleged she \"walked on eggshells\" around him, and that he placed her \"into an emotional and psychological prison.\" The complaint continued:\n\n\"When Wife would attempt to voice certain concerns, Husband would often call her a 'selfish f**king bitch' and continually alleged that she was using him. With Wife's major surgery date looming, she was reasonably afraid to leave or seek any type of help because she feared that Husband would interfere with her surgery or her lengthy recovery at home.\"\n\nWell, Billy Ray followed through with the threat -- less than 24 hours before her mastectomy, apparently! Firerose said she was \"ambushed\" with divorce papers on May 23 and forced to leave their home. For three-and-a-half hours that day, she claimed her estranged husband's brother and sister-in-law banged on her bedroom door demanding she leave, even though they previously offered to take her to the surgery the next day and help her recover!\n\nComplicating the situation further, the documents stated Billy Ray paid for her health insurance and \"was prepared\" to pay for surgery expenses that weren't covered -- and he's now walked back on that promise:\n\n\"Wife relied on Husband's promises to pay for her surgery, and Husband has now repudiated that promise. On the day Wife was set to get her surgery, she was instead searching for a place to live and under a significant amount of emotional distress.\"\n\nFirerose eventually left their marital home. She also was forced to postpone her surgery \"indefinitely\" since she had nowhere to live and now no way of covering the operation. Oof. How awful of him -- if this is true!\n\nAnd there are more accusations against Billy Ray! Firerose also accused the Achy Breaky Heart singer of attempting to sabotage her career \"in retaliation.\" The pair apparently hired the same manager and booking agent in August 2023. However, she claimed they \"terminated their services\" with her within three hours of each other at Billy's command. Due to his \"interference\" with her career, she allegedly lost $415,000 and now requests alimony from him. The complaint concluded:\n\n\"The accumulation of years of verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse, combined with the fact that Husband has had a direct hand in restricting Wife's access to income and future opportunities, Wife has developed severe emotional distress from Husband's actions. Wife has had to seek psychological treatment from her therapist for emergency sessions on more than one occasion.\"\n\n\"Severe emotional distress\"? Whoa. Billy Ray has not addressed the accusations yet. Reactions to the latest in their nasty divorce, Perezcious readers?

We regret that Ms. Hodges has chosen to litigate this 7-month marriage in the press and has left Mr. Cyrus with no recourse but to set the record straight,\" wrote Rose Palermo and Jason Talley of Cheatham Palermo and Garrett, who are representing Cyrus' case.\n\nThe statement continues, \"The allegations that Ms. Hodges states in her answer and counter-complaint are especially confusing and suspicious in its veracity since she begged Mr. Cyrus to forgive her and take her back only 2 days after he filed his pleadings to dissolve his marriage. When Mr. Cyrus returned to his home 2 days after Ms. Hodges was required, by Court Order, to vacate his residence of over 25 years and allowed him to return, he discovered a handwritten note from Ms. Hodges professing her love and need to be with Mr. Cyrus.\"\n\nBILLY RAY CYRUS FILES FOR ANNULMENT ALLEGING INAPPROPRIATE MARITAL CONDUCT AFTER 7-MONTH MARRIAGE\n\nA photo of the handwritten note provided by Cyrus' legal team reads, \"I miss you more than I can possibly explain in words Baby.

Their marriage only lasted about eight months and Billy Ray now wants the whole thing annulled because of what he claims is \"inappropriate marital conduct\" on Firerose's behalf. He's also accusing her of running up his credit cards and only being with him in the first place because of his money. Well, Firerose has now filed her own divorce papers and her side of the story is pretty bad. Apparently, she carries the BRCA1 gene mutation so she sought a double mastectomy. She claims that Billy Ray and his family made her life hellish before the surgery.\n\nFirerose claims her estranged husband Billy Ray Cyrus filed for divorce last month just one day before she scheduled to undergo a preventative double mastectomy. The Australian musician, 36, offered new insight into the final days of her marriage to Cyrus, 62, in court documents filed in Tennessee on June 14 and obtained by PEOPLE.\n\nFirerose was diagnosed as a carrier of the BRCA1 gene mutation in early 2020, which means she has an increased likelihood of developing breast cancer, according to the complaint. After having an MRI in March, the singer's doctors \"highly recommended\" she undergo a double mastectomy and reconstruction, the first surgery for which she scheduled for May 24. But as the date approached, things at home became \"chaos,\" and Firerose claimed that Cyrus \"continuously launched verbal assaults\" at her while threatening to kick her out of their home and file for divorce, according to the complaint.\n\nShe alleged in the complaint that she \"walked on eggshells\" around her country singer husband, and that he placed her \"into an emotional and psychological prison.\"\n\n\"When Wife would attempt to voice certain concerns, Husband would often call her a 'selfish f -- ing bitch' and continually alleged that she was using him,\" the complaint said. \"With Wife's major surgery date looming, she was reasonably afraid to leave or seek any type of help because she feared that Husband would interfere with her surgery or her lengthy recovery at home.\"\n\nFirerose said she was eventually \"ambushed\" with divorce papers on May 23, less than 24 hours before she was set to undergo her surgery. She also accused Cyrus's brother and sister-in-law of banging on her bedroom door for three-and-a-half hours in an attempt to get her to leave the house she shared with Cyrus, even though they were the ones who allegedly volunteered to take her to her surgery and help her recover.\n\nFollowing the couple's October 2023 wedding, Cyrus paid for Firerose's health insurance, and \"was prepared\" to pay for any surgery expenses that weren't covered, according to the complaint. \"Wife relied on Husband's promises to pay for her surgery, and Husband has now repudiated that promise,\" the documents read. \"On the day Wife was set to get her surgery, she was instead searching for a place to live and under a significant amount of emotional distress.\"\n\nElsewhere in the filing, Firerose accused Cyrus of \"extreme verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse, and said he allegedly has substance abuse issues that make him \"unpredictable and volatile.\"\n\n[From People]\n\nYiiikes. I believe Firerose's side, honestly. I believe that Billy Ray probably had a huge meltdown specifically because of her health issues and preventative mastectomy. Many, many men can't handle it when their wives or partners are ill or need major surgery. I also totally believe that Billy Ray probably has some substance abuse issues. That's been the undercurrent of gossip about the Cyrus family for a while, even before Firerose came around. Deep sigh... filing for divorce the day before your wife goes in for a double mastectomy is really, really bad.\n\nBilly Ray also gave some new information to the court, claiming that he recently learned that Firerose was \"conducting a campaign to isolate\" him from his family and that Firerose blocked at least one of his daughters from contacting his phone. I sort of believe that too? Am I being gullible or what? It's perfectly possible that Billy Ray mistreated Firerose AND that she was working an angle.", "source": {"uri": "celebitchy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebitchy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Ray_Cyrus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Billy Ray Cyrus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastectomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mastectomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRCA1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BRCA1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Australian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breast cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic resonance imaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychological abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Surgery", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Surgery", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File Management", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Transition", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Transition", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Psychological_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Psychological Abuse", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 69}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663485", "eventUri": "eng-9663485", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 1101, "textEnd": 1108}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-24", "textStart": 1483, "textEnd": 1489}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-23", "textStart": 2338, "textEnd": 2344}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

The documents stated,\n\n\"Wife was the victim of extreme verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse.\"\n\nThis accusation adds another layer of intensity to their ongoing legal dispute, highlighting the serious allegations surrounding their relationship.\n\n\"Wife was subjected to Husband's persistent drug use accompanied with the consumption of marijuana which made Husband unpredictable and volatile towards Wife,\" the filing read further.\n\nBilly Ray Cyrus filed for divorce from Firerose after seven months of marriage on May 23, citing irreconcilable differences and 'inappropriate marital conduct.'\n\nRecently, the singer sought a restraining order against Firerose after alleging that she had spent over $96,000 from his credit card.\n\nThis legal maneuver underscores the escalating tensions between the former couple, adding financial disputes to their already contentious divorce proceedings.\n\nBilly Ray Cyrus has denied the domestic abuse allegations made by Firerose through his attorneys Rose Palermo and Jason Talley.\n\nIn an official statement to the press, Cyrus's lawyers asserted that Firerose's claims were contradictory, highlighting that she had reportedly 'begged' Cyrus to reconcile after he initiated the divorce proceedings.\n\nThis denial from Cyrus's legal team positions their client's stance against Firerose's accusations of domestic abuse within the context of their tumultuous relationship and ongoing legal disputes.\n\n\"The allegations that Ms. Hodges states in her answer and counter-complaint are especially confusing and suspicious in its veracity since she begged Mr. Cyrus to forgive her and take her back only 2 days after he filed his pleadings to dissolve his marriage,\" read the statement.\n\nPalermo and Talley, attorneys representing Billy Ray Cyrus, have presented a handwritten note and a text message purportedly written by Firerose.\n\nIn these communications, Firerose reportedly asked Cyrus to 'work out' their marriage and expressed her strong desire for reconciliation, stating that she was 'praying with her entire soul that they find each other again.'\n\nThese documents are part of Cyrus's defense against Firerose's allegations of domestic abuse, suggesting a contrasting narrative where Firerose sought to salvage their relationship despite their marital challenges.", "source": {"uri": "otakukart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OtakuKart"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Ray_Cyrus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Billy Ray Cyrus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Psychological abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreconcilable_differences", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Irreconcilable differences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restraining_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Restraining order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palermo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palermo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palermo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File Management", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Psychological_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Psychological Abuse", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Abuse", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://otakukart.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Billy-and-Firerose1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663485", "eventUri": "eng-9663485", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 792, "textEnd": 799}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-23", "textStart": 1528, "textEnd": 1534}], "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Billy Ray, 62, said that Firerose blocked \"at least one\" of his daughters from being able to contact him.\n\nThough which daughter wasn't mentioned, it has remained clear that Noah, 24, has been supporting her father since he and Tish Cyrus divorced. Miley, 31, noticeably didn't mention him during her Grammy acceptance speech. As we recently reported, the Hannah Montana alum touched on her complex family dynamic with Billy Ray.

He additionally overheard her refer to herself \"with a last name that he did not know\" while on the phone with the IRS.\n\nApparently, when he confronted her about the last name, Firerose allegedly \"became angry and stated that it was personal\" and none of his business. Despite her answer, Billy Ray's legal team eventually obtained a 2014 California Divorce Judgment that allegedly revealed Firerose's past marriage and that Hodges was actually her ex-husband's last name -- a revelation that had Billy Ray in \"such disbelief.\"\n\nNow, he is seeking an annulment of the marriage, accusing Firerose of \"knowingly, willfully and intentionally\" committing fraud \"with the sole intention of inducing\" him into marriage to obtain the Cyrus name as a way to market for a successful music career.\n\nAs we recently reported, the couple was married for just seven months. The divorce marks the end of Billy Ray's third marriage. He and Firerose wed in October 2023 after a little over a year of engagement. The two met while on the set of Hannah Montana, stayed in touch, and Firerose asked Billy Ray to hear some of her music.

I am going to do what you're telling me because you promise me we can talk as soon as I've left and I trust you.\n\n\"I'm praying with my entire soul that we can find each other again today.\n\n\"I feel completely lost + miss you more than I can explain.

Please give me a chance to make this right. I can explain everything but I need you by my side. I need my Hero back.

The complaint, obtained by PEOPLE, alleges that the country musician had discovered his wife \"had been conducting a campaign to isolate\" him from his family since the May filing.\n\nHe \"discovered that the Defendant [Firerose], unknowingly to Plaintiff [Cyrus], blocked at least one (1) of his daughters from being able to contact him on his phone(s) or electronic devices.\"\n\nWhile the document did not specify which daughter Firerose had allegedly isolated him from, the singer shares three daughters with his ex-wife Tish: Miley Cyrus, 31, and Noah Cyrus, 24, and his adopted daughter Brandi, 37, from Tish's previous relationship.\n\nBilly Ray's allegations against Firerose come as fans speculated a rift between him and Miley as she notably excluded her father from her Grammy's acceptance speech, saying: \"I don't think I forgot anyone\", after thanking her mom and sister Brandi.\n\nMiley finally addressed the so-called rift while speaking to David Letterman, explaining: \"Without my dad... who I am as a person, it wouldn't exist. Because my dad, as a creative and as an artist in the way that his brain works, has always made me feel safer in my own mind because we're very similar in our ideas.\"\n\nBilly Ray also seemed to dispel speculation as he shared a throwback with his daughter on June 7, and said of her: \"I'm incredibly proud of her. She's a survivor and a true artist. She learned early on to love and appreciate the fans who make everything possible.\"\n\nHis amendment also claimed that Firerose lied about being married twice before, her last name, and was trying to use Cyrus' surname to further her own career. He then alleged that after filing for divorce, she made 37 unauthorized charges to his business credit card which totaled nearly $97,000.\n\nFirerose's attorney hit back that his claim of the 37 unauthorized charges was \"untrue\", adding: \"Throughout the divorce proceedings, the parties are to live as per the status quo during the marriage.

Less than a month after they split, the country music singer, 62, filed new court documents on Monday, June 17, in which he accused his estranged wife, 36, of blocking one of his daughters on his phone. Billy Ray shares children Miley, Noah, Brandi, Trace and Braison Cyrus with his ex-wife, Tish Cyrus.\n\nPer court documents obtained by E! News, Billy Ray \"discovered that [Firerose] had been conducting a campaign to isolate the Plaintiff from his family. He has discovered that the Defendant, unknowingly to Plaintiff, blocked at least one (1) of his daughters from being able to contact him on his phone(s) or electronic devices.\"\n\nIt's unclear which one of Billy Ray's daughters Firerose allegedly blocked on his phone.\n\nFurthermore, in his complaint, the \"She's Not Cryin' Anymore\" singer alleged that Firerose claimed her maiden name was Hodges, but it was actually her ex-husband's last name. In May, Firerose's doctor was allegedly \"having a hard time understanding\" what her legal last name was, and she was allegedly overheard on the phone with the IRS identifying herself \"with a last name that he did not know.\"\n\n\"When [Billy Ray] inquired why the Doctor and the IRS were confused about what her last name was, [Firerose] became angry and stated that it was personal and none of [Billy Ray's] business,\" the court documents read, according to the outlet. Additionally, Billy Ray alleged that Firerose \"repeatedly asserted\" that he \"was her soulmate and that [she] wanted [him] to be her one and only husband.\"\n\nThe court documents also read that Billy Ray, \"is aware that the Defendant has been attempting to obtain her U.S. Citizenship for several years and Plaintiff was concerned how it would impact her application for citizenship since she may have provided false information to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\"\n\nBilly Ray accused Firerose of \"intentionally\" committing fraud \"with the sole intention of inducing Plaintiff into a marriage to obtain the name 'Cyrus' under the belief that it would help her fledgling music career.\"\n\nFor her part, Firerose fired back in her own complaint, obtained by PEOPLE. According to the outlet, the Australia native revealed that she visited a doctor to schedule a double mastectomy because she carries the \"BRCA1 gene mutation,\" which puts her at risk of breast cancer. Her surgery was set for May 24. She alleged that her estranged husband locked her into an \"emotional and psychological prison\" in the days leading up to their split and \"would often call her a 'selfish f**king bitch' and continually alleged that she was using him.\"\n\n\"With Wife's major surgery date looming, she was reasonably afraid to leave or seek any type of help because she feared that Husband would interfere with her surgery or her lengthy recovery at home,\" Firerose's complaint read, per the outlet. The filing also noted that Billy Ray had allegedly agreed to pay for her health insurance and any potential surgeries after they got married in October 2023.\n\nNeither Billy Ray nor Firerose has publicly addressed their ongoing divorce.

He did not specify which daughter he was referring to in his divorce amendment.\n\nOn May 23, Billy Ray filed to annul his marriage to Firerose, 34, whom he married in October 2023. He said the marriage was \"obtained by fraud\" and later sought a temporary restraining order against Firerose amid claims that she made unauthorized purchases with his credit cards, according to Us Weekly.\n\nMeanwhile, Firerose - whose real name is Johanna Rose Hodges - filed her own documents on June 14, accusing her estranged husband of \"extreme verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse,\" according to People.\n\nIn response to the allegations, Billy Ray's attorneys told Us Weekly, \"The allegations that Ms. Hodges states in her answer and counter-complaint are especially confusing and suspicious in its veracity since she begged Mr. Cyrus to forgive her and take her back only 2 days after he filed his pleadings to dissolve his marriage.\"\n\nThey also included a handwritten letter that Firerose allegedly sent the \"Achy Breaky Heart\" singer after he filed for divorce. \"I miss you more than I can possibly explain in words Baby,\" the letter said. \"Please let's work this out and not become anything but closer out of his hellish experience.\"\n\nFans have suspected that Billy Ray's relationship with Miley, 31, has been strained since his divorce from Tish, 57, which was finalized in 2022. The pop star has publicly shown support for her mom's relationship with Dominic Purcell and even served as maid of honor at their wedding in 2023. However, she has not done the same when it comes to her father, and noticeably failed to mention him while accepting two awards at the Grammys in February.\n\nStill, she threw some praise Billy Ray's way while appearing on the June 12 episode of David Letterman'sMy Next Guest Needs No Introduction. \"Honestly, my mom is my hero,\" she said. \"My father - I'm grateful for being able to watch him ahead of me. He's almost given me this map. There is a map of what to do and what not to do. And he's guided me on both.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Noah, 24, did not go to Tish and Dominic's wedding, and was photographed wearing a Billy Ray Cyrus T-shirt while out and about on the same day as the nuptials. Earlier this year, it was reported by Us Weekly that Noah was \"seeing\" Dominic, 54, before he started dating her mother in 2022.", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alyssa_norwin@myrtlebeachonline.com", "name": "Alyssa Norwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Ray_Cyrus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Billy Ray Cyrus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tish_Cyrus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tish Cyrus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electronic music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miley_Cyrus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miley Cyrus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Cyrus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noah Cyrus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychological abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achy_Breaky_Heart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Achy Breaky Heart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Purcell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Purcell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridesmaid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bridesmaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File Management", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/j0uq3x/picture289388952/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/db1151e4-5b0d-4863-9d0a-f0c8a1204cd2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663485", "eventUri": "eng-9663485", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-23", "textStart": 624, "textEnd": 630}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 1016, "textEnd": 1023}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 2286, "textEnd": 2293}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Billy Ray said Firerose agreed to vacate his home in exchange for $5,000 per month to help her with housing for three months.\n\nOn top of asking for the annulment, Billy Ray pleaded for a restraining order against Firerose. He claimed to have recently learned about 37 unauthorized charges he believes Firerose made on his American Express card from May 23 to June 7. He said the card was used to make payments to the law firm representing Firerose in the divorce and $10k to the United States Treasury.\n\nBill Ray said he notified his credit card company that the charges were fraudulent. He demanded the court grant him a restraining order prohibiting Firerose from using his credit cards. In response, Firerose denied Billy Ray was unaware she had the credit card.\n\nHer lawyer said, \"Wife has had access, which Husband was aware of, to the American Express Credit Card before and during the marriage.\" He added, \"Wife was permitted access to Husband's American Express credit card in June of 2022 shortly after Wife moved in with Husband.\"\n\nHer lawyer said, \"Wife should be able to continue to use the American Express credit card to maintain the status quo of the marriage and should be able to use the American Express credit card for her personal expenses, household expenses, and attorney's fees without depleting her separate assets.\"\n\nFirerose argued Billy Ray had no \"right to cut her off.\" The Australian singer demanded Billy Ray's motion be denied. The judge will make a ruling on the credit card next month. In a newly filed petition, Billy Ray slammed Firerose. He accused her of failing to inform him of her previous marriage. He said she stated on their marriage license that it was her first marriage.\n\nIn addition, he pointed out that on The Kelly Clarkson Show, Firerose told the host that it was her first marriage. Billy Ray said he became aware Firerose had a different name when he walked in on a phone call she was having with the IRS. He said he confronted her about it and she became \"angry and stated that it was personal and none of [Billy Ray's] business.\"\n\nIn the filing, he claimed that Firerose \"knowingly, willfully and intentionally committed Fraud against\" him \"with the sole intention of inducing\" him \"into a marriage to obtain the name 'Cyrus' under the belief that it would help her fledgling music career.\"\n\nBilly Ray said he would have never married her had he \"known [Firerose] had lied to him from the start of their dating relationship.\" In her response to Billy Ray's petition, Firerose accused him of \"domestic abuse.\" She said he was guilty of \"intentional infliction of emotional distress for his financial abuse perpetrated against\" her. In addition, she accused him of interfering with her career. Firerose said her doctors told her she needed a double mastectomy and reconstruction surgery in March.\n\nShe said this caused a planned tour with Billy Ray to be postponed.\n\nThe filing read, \"While Wife anxiously waited for her surgery date, her time spent with Husband was chaos. Even with the weight of a life-altering surgery on her shoulders, Husband continuously launched verbal assaults at Wife and routinely threatened to kick her out of the marital residence and file for divorce. Wife walked on eggshells when she was around Husband and even had to worry if she was allowed to speak in his presence. At times, when Wife attempted to speak to Husband, on almost any topic, Husband would respond with 'shut your f-king mouth.'\"\n\nHer response added, \"In the weeks leading up to her surgery, Husband placed Wife into an emotional and psychological prison. When Wife would attempt to voice certain concerns, Husband would often call her a 'selfish fucking bitch' and continually alleged that she was using him. With Wife's major surgery date looming, she was reasonably afraid to leave or seek any type of help because she feared that Husband would interfere with her surgery or her lengthy recovery at home.\"\n\nFirerose said Billy Ray filed for divorce less than 24 hours before her scheduled surgery -- which caused it to be delayed.\n\nAccording to Firerose, during the marriage, they were represented by Scott Adkins and Adkins Entertainment as their manager, Nick Meinema and Action Entertainment Collaborative as their booking agent, and Scott Kaufman and Buchwald for all literary, TV, and film booking purposes.\n\nShe said 11 days after Billy Ray served her with divorce papers, her representatives all terminated their services within 3 hours of each other but they retained Billy Ray. Her lawyer said, \"Wife submits that Husband interfered with the contractual relationship between Wife and her representatives. Husband acted maliciously in retaliation in an attempt to ruin Wife's career.\"\n\nFirerose claimed to have lost out on four scheduled concerts with guaranteed payments to the marital estate of $415,000. She said she lost out on a Hallmark movie and any future income.\n\n\"Wife developed three film productions over the course of several years with Husband and was negotiating their production at the time of being served in this case. Additionally, Wife was also cast as a lead role in a Hallmark movie through Buchwald, and this opportunity has apparently also been lost due her the loss of her representation,\" the filing read.\n\n\"Wife does not possess several avenues of income like Husband. Wife relied on these performances and film projects for her income but has lost all such potential income with nary a word from her Husband or her, now former, representatives.\"\n\nIt read, \"The allegations that [Firerose] states in her answer and counter-complaint are especially confusing and suspicious in its veracity since she begged Mr. Cyrus to forgive her and take her back only 2 days after he filed his pleadings to dissolve his marriage. When Mr. Cyrus returned to his home 2 days after [Firerose] was required, by Court Order, to vacate his residence of over 25 years and allowed him to return, he discovered a handwritten note from [Firerose] professing her love and need to be with Mr. Cyrus.\" They added, \"If Mr. Cyrus was truly guilty of the allegations that [Firerose] alleges in her pleadings, then it is mindboggling to try and explain why she would want to return to live with him.\"", "source": {"uri": "intouchweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "In Touch Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_naumann@intouchweekly.com", "name": "Ryan Naumann", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Touch_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In Touch Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Ray_(screenwriter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Billy Ray (screenwriter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Express", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annulment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Annulment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restraining_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Restraining order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreconcilable_differences", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Irreconcilable differences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Ray_Cyrus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billy Ray Cyrus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kelly_Clarkson_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Kelly Clarkson Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Adkins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scott Adkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_infliction_of_emotional_distress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intentional infliction of emotional distress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney's_fee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attorney's fee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Australian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastectomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mastectomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Talent agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallmark_Channel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hallmark Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleading", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pleading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Stationery", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Stationery", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Sports", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Trading_Cards", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Trading Cards", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/billy-ray-firerose-divorce-fight-interfered-with-career-dropped-by-agents-manager-hallmark-movie-1.jpg?crop=143px%2C114px%2C2239px%2C1175px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663485", "eventUri": "eng-9663485", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-23", "dateEnd": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 1013, "textEnd": 1029}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

However, she has not done the same when it comes to her father, and noticeably failed to mention him while accepting two awards at the Grammys in February.\n\nStill, she threw some praise Billy Ray's way while appearing on the June 12 episode of David Letterman's My Next Guest Needs No Introduction. \"Honestly, my mom is my hero,\" she said. \"My father -- I'm grateful for being able to watch him ahead of me. He's almost given me this map. There is a map of what to do and what not to do. And he's guided me on both.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Noah, 24, did not go to Tish and Dominic's wedding, and was photographed wearing a Billy Ray Cyrus T-shirt while out and about on the same day as the nuptials. Earlier this year, it was reported by Us Weekly that Noah was \"seeing\" Dominic, 54, before he started dating her mother in 2022.", "source": {"uri": "lifeandstylemag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Life & Style"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alyssa_norwin@lifeandstylemag.com", "name": "Alyssa Norwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Ray_Cyrus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Billy Ray Cyrus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electronic music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achy_Breaky_Heart", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Achy Breaky Heart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychological abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Purcell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Purcell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridesmaid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bridesmaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Letterman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Letterman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T-shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File Management", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/E-zines", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/E-zines", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Billy-Ray-Cyrus-Says-Firerose-Isolated-Him-From-Family-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C273px%2C1080px%2C567px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663485", "eventUri": "eng-9663485", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-17", "textStart": 174, "textEnd": 181}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-23", "textStart": 560, "textEnd": 566}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 952, "textEnd": 959}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 2222, "textEnd": 2229}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

He cited \"irreconcilable differences\" and \"inappropriate marital conduct,\" ultimately alleging that she cheated on him. He asked the court for an annulment after claiming their marriage was obtained fraudulently. He even requested a restraining order since she allegedly racked up nearly $100k in credit card charges AFTER he initially filed!\n\nOn Tuesday, Firerose responded to all of Billy Ray's filings with a bombshell of her own accusing him of \"extreme verbal, emotional and psychological abuse.\" Furthermore, she claimed that he abused substances and filed for divorce the DAY before she was scheduled to undergo a double mastectomy, which she claims he promised to pay for. She subsequently left their marital home and had to cancel the procedure indefinitely since she no longer has a solid place to live and recover... Or a secure way to cover the expenses! She alleged a ton of more disturbing details in her filings, which you can catch up HERE.\n\nRelated: Is THIS Britney Spears's Response To J.T.'s DWI Arrest?!\n\nThat's some REALLY messed up stuff... But is it all true??\n\nWell, on the same day, Billy Ray revealed a love letter and a lengthy text Firerose allegedly sent him AFTER he filed for divorce in which she seemingly begs for him to take her back. The handwritten note, obtained by Page Six, reads:\n\n\"I miss you more than I can possibly explain in words baby. Please lets work this out and not become anything but closer out of this hellish experience. I need you. I love you. I am so sorry.\"\n\nIt's not clear what exactly she's apologizing for, but this certainly is a stark contrast to her view of him in her latest legal filings.\n\nThe outlet also obtained a text message the Achy Breaky Heart crooner allegedly received from Firerose, which reads:\n\n\"I am listening to you baby. I love you. I don't want us to be on different sides fighting a war that nobody wins. I am going to do what you're telling me because you promise me we can talk as soon as I've left and I trust you. I'm praying with my entire soul that we can find each other again today. I feel completely lost & miss you more than I can explain. And you will know I'm listening to and showing you with my actions. We need to be kind and loving to each other no matter what happens. You have been my best friend in the world every day for over 4 years. 24/7. I miss you terribly. My heart is shattered & I need my best friend right now more than ever. I lost 5lbs since Wednesday. I just can't eat no matter how much I try. I don't want to live without you. Please give me a chance to make this right, I can explain everything but I need you on my side. Need my hero back.\"\n\nAgain, it's not clear what all she's exactly talking about, but it probably has something to do with that \"inappropriate marital conduct\" Billy Ray accused her of. And that's not even everything...\n\nIn an amendment to his original divorce filing also obtained by the news org, the Hannah Montana star revealed more details regarding why he believes their marriage was fraudulent. He claimed the Australian singer, whose real name is Johanna Rosie Hodges, lied about never having been married before him, claiming that the \"Hodges\" last name is actually that of her ex-husband -- not her own family! Because of that, Billy Ray claimed she \"knowingly, willfully and intentionally committed fraud\" in order to obtain and use his famous last name, which she goes by on Instagram. His legal docs added:\n\n\"He would not have entered the bonds of matrimony ... because he did not actually know the true person that she was.\"\n\nOof.\n\nThis whole thing is really intense. Of course, we know Miley Cyrus and her dad have been at odds for a while now and that she didn't even attend his wedding. Seems like we're just scratching the surface here. Jeez! This is a LOT!

The filing was in response to the previous domestic abuse accusation made by her wife Firerose.\n\nAn insider told People magazine the reason behind their divorce. The insider said. \"He believes that she married for other reasons but love,\" the insider said. \"He believes she married him so he can take care of her financially.

We've heard bombshell accusations come out of both camps -- fraudulence, domestic abuse, substance abuse, theft, and a TON more. But one thing that's been consistent since the estranged couple's early days?? Miley Cyrus has NOT been a fan. And it sounds like the feeling may have been mutual!\n\nRelated: Joe Alwyn 'Depressed & Emotionally Drained' After Questions About Taylor Swift Split\n\nOn Monday, Billy Ray made an amendment to his May divorce filing. In it, he claimed that Firerose brazenly BLOCKED one of his daughters on his personal phone in an effort to axe communication!! WHOA! In court docs obtained by multiple outlets, Billy Ray's legal camp asserted:\n\n\"Since the Plaintiff filed his initial complaint, he discovered that the defendant had been conducting a campaign to isolate the Plaintiff from his family.

He's also the adoptive father of her eldest daughter Brandi, 37. It wasn't made clear which of these three Firerose allegedly blocked... But we wouldn't be surprised if it was Miley. Like we noted, she's never been the biggest supporter of her dad and Firerose.\n\nThis is truly wild stuff! And it all comes alongside a handwritten note and text, both allegedly from Firerose, in which she pleads to be taken back. The Hannah Montana star seemingly released them in an effort to dismiss her domestic abuse claims.\n\nWhat are your thoughts here, Perezcious readers??

He asked for an annulment, claiming their marriage was obtained fraudulently -- revealing in an amendment to his filings on Monday that she lied about never having been married before.\n\nRelated: J.Lo On Vacay In Italy WITHOUT Ben Affleck! She Looks Happy & Free!\n\nThe 36-year-old hit back with filings of her own claiming Billy Ray abused substances and subjected her to \"extreme verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse.\" He responded to that by dropping an alleged love note she sent him begging to be taken back, which you can read about HERE.\n\nBetween all that and the Achy Breaky Heart singer recently discovering his ex BLOCKED \"at least one\" of his daughters from contacting him, it's been a rocky road. And he's thrilled to be off of it!! On Thursday, an insider told People the 62-year-old is \"more relieved every day that he's done with his marriage,\" which lasted seven months. That source explained how the refreshing feelings have come about for Billy Ray:\n\n\"His instincts have been correct all along. He believes she only married him for financial and other reasons. He's convinced that she didn't marry him for love.\"\n\nHis instincts were right all along?? Didn't Miley try to warn him about her from the beginning?!\n\nLast week, a source told the same outlet \"they've had drama and trust issues about money,\" and that \"he believes she married him so he can take care of her financially.\" Of course, it was also revealed that he filed for divorce just one day before Firerose was scheduled to undergo a double mastectomy which he apparently told her he'd cover... but she's since had to cancel it indefinitely.\n\nThe insider added on Thursday:\n\n\"[Billy Ray] feels the back-and-forth now, very much also shows [Firerose's] true colors.\"\n\nThey added that he \"feels beyond deceived and is ready to move on alone.\" So, that last part is good, we suppose. But damn. What a wild ride...\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the latest update in their messy split?

However, as of 2024, his net worth plummeted to $10 million.\n\nHow Does Billy Ray Cyrus Make Money?\n\nRising to fame with his chart-topping 1992 hit \"Achy Breaky Heart,\" the Grammy-winning artist solidified his presence in the country music scene with other popular tracks like \"Could've Been Me\" and \"Some Gave All.\" Throughout his career, he has released a total of 16 studio albums and 53 singles, earning him a dedicated fan base and a lasting legacy in the industry.\n\nLater on, he starred in the Disney Channel series Hannah Montana alongside Miley Cyrus from 2006 to 2011. While Billy Ray hasn't publicly disclosed how much he made while working on the show, other supporting actors were reportedly paid $15,000 per episode, according to The Things.\n\nHowever, he later admitted that he regretted doing the show, blaming it for negatively affecting Miley.\n\n\"The damn show destroyed my family,\" Billy Ray told GQ in 2011. \"I'd take it back in a second. For my family to be here and just everybody be okay, safe and sound and happy and normal would have been fantastic. Heck, yeah. I'd erase it all in a second if I could.\"\n\nLater, he revisited acting when he was in the 2016 CMT sitcom Still the King.\n\n\"I've reinvented a couple times in my career, at least,\" he told The New York Times at the time. \"But how do you reinvent out of Hannah Montana?\" he continued. \"And then it hit me: A dysfunctional Elvis impersonator who lies his way into the church. That made sense.\"\n\nBilly Ray found success yet again in 2019 when his remix of Lil Nas X's \"Old Town Road\" was released. It became the longest-running No.\u20091 single in Billboard Hot 100 history. Reports have said the song made $15 million but it's not clear how much Billy made off the collaboration.\n\nHis acting career is still alive and well, as Billy Ray starred in the 2022 Hulu film Christmas in Paradise. That same year Billy Ray appeared as himself in Dolly Parton's NBC TV movie Dolly Parton's Mountain Magic Christmas. He's also done voice work, playing Donner in the 2023 animated film Glisten and the Merry Mission.\n\nBilly Ray Cyrus Owns Property\n\nWhen Billy Ray was married to ex-wife Tish, the pair lived on a 500-acre farm outside of Nashville in a beautiful home they had renovated. The home has been estimated to be worth $5 million. The pair wed in 1993 and divorced in April 2022, and Tish did not request spousal support. The former couple share five adult children together.\n\nAfter the divorce from Tish, Firerose later moved into the home with Billy Ray after their October 10, 2023, wedding.\n\nThe \"Some Gave All\" singer filed for divorce in late May 2024 after seven months of marriage. Billy Ray cited \"irreconcilable differences\" and \"inappropriate marital conduct,\" also alleging that the marriage was obtained by fraud.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Ray_Cyrus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Billy Ray Cyrus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Could've_Been_Me", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Could've Been Me"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tish_Cyrus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tish Cyrus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achy_Breaky_Heart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Achy Breaky Heart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Montana", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hannah Montana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miley_Cyrus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miley Cyrus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Country music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Still_the_King", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Still the King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMT_(American_TV_channel)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CMT (American TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Channel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disney Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GQ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GQ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sitcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Town_Road", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Old Town Road"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil_Nas_X", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lil Nas X"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_Parton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dolly Parton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_impersonator", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elvis impersonator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Television film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Remix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billboard Hot 100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise,_Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paradise, Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paradise, Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Crystallography", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Crystallography", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Billy-Ray-Cyrus-Net-Worth-How-the-Singer-Makes-Money.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663485", "eventUri": "eng-9663485", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-10-", "textStart": 2925, "textEnd": 2935}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

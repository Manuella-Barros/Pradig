{"id": 223813378, "title": "Refugee braves racist abuse to become Northern Ireland\u2019s first black mayor", "text": "Lilian Seenoi-Barr will make history on 3 June when she receives the chain of office at Derry\u2019s guildhall and becomes Northern Ireland\u2019s first black mayor. It will be the culmination of a personal and political journey that began in 2010 when she arrived as a refugee from Kenya and became part of the region\u2019s growing multi-ethnic identity. The milestone has prompted pride in Northern Ireland and Kenya that a woman with Maasai roots will represent the city of John Hume and Derry Girls, but it has also raised concern about Seenoi-Barr\u2019s safety. Because not everyone is cheering. Far-right activists including the US conspiracy theorist Alex Jones have used her elevation to peddle the notion that Ireland, north and south, is being \u201cinvaded\u201d. She has received death threats and racist abuse. \u201cTo have your life threatened is not a good feeling when you genuinely just want to serve the people of your city,\u201d the incoming mayor said in an interview. \u201cPeople are absorbing populist information that is quite loud. It\u2019s kind of like every single problem that exists in the north of Ireland or across Ireland has been caused by immigrants.\u201d Seenoi-Barr\u2019s symbolic breakthrough at Derry and Strabane district council has coincided with a backlash against immigrants and refugees on both sides of the border and a row between London and Dublin over asylum seekers entering the republic via Northern Ireland. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have ever been elected in Derry if people were hostile but if you look at reports of hate crimes [across Northern Ireland] we do have racism,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you talk about housing pressures, the scapegoat is immigrants. The collapsing NHS, the scapegoat is immigrants. Lack of school infrastructure, the scapegoat is immigrants.\u201d Over the past year, police recorded 1,353 racist incidents and 839 racist crimes, the highest figure since records began in 2004-05. The Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) councillor said she felt safe in Derry but had become more security-conscious since doing a six-week \u201cself-defence\u201d course that included running, weight-lifting and threat assessment. \u201cI hated it at first, but then I began to feel strong and enjoyed it,\u201d she said. Seenoi-Barr, 42, did the course earlier this year at the request of relatives in Kenya who became alarmed after an anti-immigrant riot in Dublin last November. She happened to be in the Irish capital at the time and received death threats after calling the chaos xenophobic terror. Threats resumed in April after the SDLP chose her to become mayor under a rotating system with other parties in Northern Ireland\u2019s second city. Jones tweeted to his 2.3 million followers that the World Economic Forum \u2013 a bogeyman for the far-right \u2013 was installing \u201cinvaders\u201d as mayors in Ireland, just as it had in London. Many abusive posts on X appeared to come from accounts in the Republic of Ireland. Police in Derry arrested a 30-year-old man on suspicion of harassment and threats to kill. Immigration and diversity in Northern Ireland have increased since the 1998 Good Friday agreement, albeit from a tiny base. The 2001 census recorded 14,300 people, or 0.8% of the population, as belonging to an ethnic minority. By 2021, it was 65,600 people, or 3.4%. Intimidation was deterring some \u201cgood politicians\u201d from challenging hate-mongers, said Seenoi-Barr. \u201cIt is the fear.\u201d But threats from \u201ckeyboard warriors\u201d would not stop her leading the council, she said. \u201cThis city has given me so much, it has given me a family, it has given me a safe environment, it\u2019s given me friends and it\u2019s given me a home, so all you really want to do is give back.\u201d Far-right animosity reflected a longstanding UK government policy to create a \u201chostile environment\u201d for illegal migration, with Rishi Sunak\u2019s Rwanda deportation plan its latest incarnation, said the new mayor. The result is that refugees who are fleeing persecution and migrants such as doctors and nurses who sustain the NHS are lumped together and demonised, she said. \u201cThe message is \u2018we don\u2019t want people who are different to be coming here\u2019.\u201d Seenoi-Barr grew up in Narok in southern Kenya. Her father was a doctor and her mother ran a business. Seenoi-Barr attended university and is proud of her \u201cbeautiful, vibrant\u201d Maasai heritage, but not the traditions of early marriage and female genital mutilation, which she campaigned against, and superstitions about disability. To shield her son, who is autistic, she moved to Northern Ireland in 2010, she said. In 2012, she founded an advocacy network, North West Migrants Forum, that now has six staff and 50 volunteers. She married a local man and joined the moderate nationalist SDLP in 2015. Its leader, Colum Eastwood, persuaded her to run for council in 2018. She lost the 2019 election, was co-opted in 2021 and held the seat in a 2023 election. When she was selected as mayor, two SDLP councillors, Jason Barr and Shauna Cusack, quit the party in protest, saying the process was undemocratic. The SDLP defended the appointment but apologised for poor communication. Seenoi-Barr said she favoured constitutional change in Northern Ireland, but only after careful planning and engaging with unionists. \u201cI\u2019m all for a united Ireland but I do believe we need to unite our people first.\u201d Relatives from Kenya will be at the guildhall for what she hopes will be a joyous ceremony. \u201cI have 14 siblings. We always said that we were a Catholic family, even though we are not.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Lilian Seenoi-Barr, who arrived from Kenya in 2010, will make history when she receives chain of office in Derry</p><p>Lilian Seenoi-Barr will make history on 3 June when she receives the chain of office at Derry\u2019s guildhall and becomes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a>\u2019s first black mayor.</p><p>It will be the culmination of a personal and political journey that began in 2010 when she arrived as a refugee from Kenya and became part of the region\u2019s growing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/09/northern-ireland-immigration-ethnic-minorities\">multi-ethnic identity</a>.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/may/26/refugee-lilian-seenoi-barr-braves-racist-abuse-northern-ireland-first-black-mayor-derry\">Continue reading...</a>", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/may/26/refugee-lilian-seenoi-barr-braves-racist-abuse-northern-ireland-first-black-mayor-derry", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62ca1a0244b491981b176297febf39a931ebcb62/0_293_2016_1209/master/2016.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGV", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:00:54", "author": "Rory Carroll", "authors": ["Rory Carroll"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.462}

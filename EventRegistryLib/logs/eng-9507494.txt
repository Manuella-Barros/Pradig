Despite being an \"outsider,\" the BJP candidate drew a large crowd. The race is considered one-sided, with Hema Malini heavily favored. The Congress, led by Mukesh Dhangar, and the BSP, with Chaudhary Suresh Singh as its candidate, are vying for second place. The Jat community, with around 5 lakh votes, holds significant sway in the Mathura constituency.\n\nAmid chants of 'Radhe, Radhe' and sweltering heat, actor-turned-politician Hema Malini, seeking a third successive term as Lok Sabha MP from Mathura, on Wednesday held a roadshow that wound its way through the narrow bylanes of the temple town.\n\nDressed in a green saree, she used a yellow peacock feather motif dupatta to shield herself from the afternoon sun as she stood in an SUV and greeted voters with an elegant namaste.\n\nHema Malini waved a cutout of the lotus, the BJP's poll symbol, and reminded voters to exercise their franchise on April 26, when Mathura goes to polls.\n\nAn accomplished Bharatanatyam exponent, Hema Malini often showcased the 'flower mudra', gently opening her closed fingers to depict a flowering bud. People gathered in balconies and on rooftops showered rose petals on her carcade which snaked its way through the Chowk Bazaar area, considered the business hub of the old town.\n\n''It (the roadshow) felt like it was a post-victory celebration. The roadshow was very beautifully organised by our party. Everybody, including our alliance partners, participated in it,'' Hema Malini told reporters after the roadshow.\n\nHema Malini is pitted against OBC leader Mukesh Dhangar of the Congress, the nominee of the opposition INDIA bloc, and Chaudhary Suresh Singh of the BSP.\n\n''This is a one-sided election. The Congress and the BSP are vying for the second spot,'' Dinesh Kumar Agrawal, a businessman in the local jewellery market, told PTI as Hema Malini's roadshow crossed the Chowk Bazaar.\n\nWhile the BJP is banking on the performance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the star power of Hema Malini, the Congress is seeking votes in the name of change. BSP's Singh, a veteran Jat leader who was earlier with the BJP, is hoping to cash in on the sizeable population of his community in Mathura and his party's committed supporters.\n\nRLD chief Jayant Chaudhary's last-minute decision to align with the BJP has not gone down well with his supporters here and Singh is eyeing this section.\n\n''The Jat community in this region holds RLD founder Chaudhary Charan Singh in high regard. The BJP may benefit from bestowing the Bharat Ratna on him, but local leaders of the RLD are unhappy with Jayant's decision to align with the BJP,'' said Hemant Chaudhary, a local hotelier.\n\nAmong the 19.30 lakh voters in Mathura, the birthplace of Lord Krishna, the Jat community is the most influential with around 5 lakh votes, followed by Rajputs and Brahmins (approximately 3 lakh each), Jatavs (2 lakh), Muslims (1.6 lakh) and OBCs.\n\nA large section of the locals still view Hema Malini as an ''outsider'' but BJP supporters turned out in large numbers for her roadshow on Wednesday, the last day of campaigning for the second phase of the Lok Sabha polls.\n\n''Vote toh Modi aur Yogi baba ke naam par padna hai, Hema ji toh bahar ki hai (people will vote in the name of Modi and Yogi baba, Hema is an outsider),'' local BJP leader Sanjay Bhardwaj said.\n\nVinod Kumar Gola, who belongs to the Prajapati community of potters, said he will vote for the BJP and listed central government initiatives that have benefited his community.\n\nThe Jatav community, considered a staunch supporter of former chief minister and BSP president Mayawati, appears to be firmly backing her party.\n\n''Behen ji ko vote nahi diya toh vote bekar hai (my vote will go waste if I don't vote for behen ji),'' said daily labourer Phool Chand Jatav, dismissing concerns over a Jat candidate fielded by the BSP.\n\nBJP corporator Kunjvihari Bhardwaj claimed that the real fight in Mathura was for the second rank as Hema Malini's victory was a ''foregone conclusion''.\n\n''In 2019, she won by a margin of nearly 3 lakh votes. If the voter turnout is good on the election day, Hema ji can win by even a margin of 5 lakh votes. The Congress and the BSP are in the race for the second spot,'' he said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri":

Amroha, Meerut, Baghpat, Ghaziabad, Gautam Buddha Nagar, Bulandshahr, Aligarh, and Mathura are the constituencies that will vote on Friday.\n\nThe end of the campaigning marks the commencement of a 48-hour silence period. The second phase which is scheduled for April 26, will witness polling in 89 constituencies across 12 states and Union Territories, along with the remaining part of the Outer Manipur Lok Sabha constituency.\n\n1206 candidates from 12 States and UTs along with 4 candidates from the Outer Manipur Parliamentary constituency will contest elections in phase 2 of the Lok Sabha Elections, the Election Commission of India said. With political dynamics shifting in the state, the BJP is spearheading a robust alliance, encompassing parties like RLD, SBSP, Apna Dal (S), and Nishad party bolstering its position.\n\nOn the other hand, while Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav aligns with the opposition bloc, Mayawati embarks on the electoral journey solo. The election, which is poised for a three-cornered contest with the NDA, the INDIA bloc and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) fielding their candidates, witnessed senior leaders of all the political parties crisscrossing the state.\n\nProminent among the total of 91 candidates whose future will be decided in the second phase of polling are actor Hema Malini, who is seeking a third term from Mathura, and Arun Govil, who played the role of Lord Rama in the famed TV serial Ramayan. In Mathura, Mukesh Ghangar, an INDIA bloc candidate has been pitted against Hema. Meanwhile, BSP has also named Suresh Singh as its candidate for Mathura, making the poll battle a three-cornered fight.\n\nIn the 2019 Lok Sabha Elections, Hema Malini from BJP won the seat with a margin of 293,471 votes. A total of 671,293 votes were polled in favour of Malini with a vote share of 61.00 per cent who defeated Kunwar Narendra Singh from RLD who got 377,822 votes (34.21 per cent). In the 2014 Lok Sabha Elections, Hema Malini from BJP won the seat and was polled 574,633 votes with a vote share of 53.29 per cent. RLD candidate Jayant Chaudhary got 243,890 votes (22.62 per cent) and was the runner-up. Hema Malini defeated Jayant Chaudhary by a margin of 330,743 votes. Now Jayant Choudhary Party RLD is an alliance partner of BJP in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nOn the last day of campaigning for the second phase, Hema Malini held a roadshow in Mathura. A large number of people gathered in the roadshow to support. While speaking to ANI, Hema Malini appealed people of Mathura to vote for her in the elections.\n\nArun Govil, who essayed the role of Lord Ram in Ramanand Sagar's mythological drama Ramayan has been given the BJP's ticket from Uttar Pradesh's Meerut Lok Sabha seat for the general polls. The BJP is eying Western UP with optimism to achieve its ambitious target of 370 seats on its own, despite facing setbacks in the last elections. In 2014, the BJP secured 24 out of 27 seats in the region, which dwindled to 19 in 2019, with all eight seats going to the SP-BSP combined.\n\nIn 2019, BJP candidate Rajendra Agarwal had then managed to clinch the Meerut seat by defeating SP-backed BSP candidate Haji Yakub Qureshi by a thin margin of less than 5,000 votes. On the Gautam Buddha Nagar seat, the BJP has fielded incumbent sitting MP, Mahesh Sharma for the third time in a row from the seat. He will be in the electoral fray against INDIA bloc candidate Mahendra Singh Nagar on the SP ticket while the BSP, who is fighting alone has fielded Rajendra Singh Solanki.\n\nGautam Buddha Nagar seat can be considered the stronghold of the Bharatiya Janata Party as it has won in both the 2014 and 2019 elections. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath campaigned for the ruling NDA.\n\nSamajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, BSP president Mayawati, and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief Jayant Singh were on a hectic campaign trail of these constituencies during the past couple of days.

Amid chants of 'Radhe, Radhe' and sweltering heat, actor-turned-politician Hema Malini, seeking a third successive term as Lok Sabha MP from Mathura, on Wednesday held a roadshow that wound its way through the narrow bylanes of the temple town.\n\nMathura, Apr 24 (PTI) Amid chants of 'Radhe, Radhe' and sweltering heat, actor-turned-politician Hema Malini, seeking a third successive term as Lok Sabha MP from Mathura, on Wednesday held a roadshow that wound its way through the narrow bylanes of the temple town.\n\nDressed in a green saree, she used a yellow peacock feather motif dupatta to shield herself from the afternoon sun as she stood in an SUV and greeted voters with an elegant namaste.\n\nAlso Read | Delhi: Boy Dies of Electrocution After Coming in Contact With Electric Pole During Thunderstorm in Chhawla, Family Demands Action Against BSES.\n\nHema Malini waved a cutout of the lotus, the BJP's poll symbol, and reminded voters to exercise their franchise on April 26, when Mathura goes to polls.\n\nAn accomplished Bharatanatyam exponent, Hema Malini often showcased the 'flower mudra', gently opening her closed fingers to depict a flowering bud. People gathered in balconies and on rooftops showered rose petals on her carcade which snaked its way through the Chowk Bazaar area, considered the business hub of the old town.\n\nAlso Read | Mumbai: Two Killed, One Injured While Cleaning Sewerage Pipeline at Raheja Tower in Malad West.\n\n\"It (the roadshow) felt like it was a post-victory celebration. The roadshow was very beautifully organised by our party. Everybody, including our alliance partners, participated in it,\" Hema Malini told reporters after the roadshow.\n\nHema Malini is pitted against OBC leader Mukesh Dhangar of the Congress, the nominee of the opposition INDIA bloc, and Chaudhary Suresh Singh of the BSP.\n\n\"This is a one-sided election. The Congress and the BSP are vying for the second spot,\" Dinesh Kumar Agrawal, a businessman in the local jewellery market, told PTI as Hema Malini's roadshow crossed the Chowk Bazaar.\n\nWhile the BJP is banking on the performance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the star power of Hema Malini, the Congress is seeking votes in the name of change. BSP's Singh, a veteran Jat leader who was earlier with the BJP, is hoping to cash in on the sizeable population of his community in Mathura and his party's committed supporters.\n\nRLD chief Jayant Chaudhary's last-minute decision to align with the BJP has not gone down well with his supporters here and Singh is eyeing this section.\n\n\"The Jat community in this region holds RLD founder Chaudhary Charan Singh in high regard. The BJP may benefit from bestowing the Bharat Ratna on him, but local leaders of the RLD are unhappy with Jayant's decision to align with the BJP,\" said Hemant Chaudhary, a local hotelier.\n\nAmong the 19.30 lakh voters in Mathura, the birthplace of Lord Krishna, the Jat community is the most influential with around 5 lakh votes, followed by Rajputs and Brahmins (approximately 3 lakh each), Jatavs (2 lakh), Muslims (1.6 lakh) and OBCs.\n\nA large section of the locals still view Hema Malini as an \"outsider\" but BJP supporters turned out in large numbers for her roadshow on Wednesday, the last day of campaigning for the second phase of the Lok Sabha polls.\n\n\"Vote toh Modi aur Yogi baba ke naam par padna hai, Hema ji toh bahar ki hai (people will vote in the name of Modi and Yogi baba, Hema is an outsider),\" local BJP leader Sanjay Bhardwaj said.\n\nVinod Kumar Gola, who belongs to the Prajapati community of potters, said he will vote for the BJP and listed central government initiatives that have benefited his community.\n\nThe Jatav community, considered a staunch supporter of former chief minister and BSP president Mayawati, appears to be firmly backing her party.\n\n\"Behen ji ko vote nahi diya toh vote bekar hai (my vote will go waste if I don't vote for behen ji),\" said daily labourer Phool Chand Jatav, dismissing concerns over a Jat candidate fielded by the BSP.\n\nBJP corporator Kunjvihari Bhardwaj claimed that the real fight in Mathura was for the second rank as Hema Malini's victory was a \"foregone conclusion\".\n\n\"In 2019, she won by a margin of nearly 3 lakh votes. If the voter turnout is good on the election day, Hema ji can win by even a margin of 5 lakh votes. The Congress and the BSP are in the race for the second spot,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Meanwhile, BSP has also named Suresh Singh as its candidate for Mathura, making the poll battle a three-cornered fight.\n\nIn the 2019 Lok Sabha Elections, Hema Malini from BJP won the seat with a margin of 293,471 votes. A total of 671,293 votes were polled in favour of Malini with a vote share of 61.00 per cent who defeated Kunwar Narendra Singh from RLD who got 377,822 votes (34.21 per cent).\n\nIn the 2014 Lok Sabha Elections, Hema Malini from BJP won the seat and was polled 574,633 votes with a vote share of 53.29 per cent. RLD candidate Jayant Chaudhary got 243,890 votes (22.62 per cent) and was the runner-up. Hema Malini defeated Jayant Chaudhary by a margin of 330,743 votes. Now Jayant Choudhary Party RLD is an alliance partner of BJP in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nOn the last day of campaigning for the second phase, Hema Malini held a roadshow in Mathura.\n\nA large number of people gathered in the roadshow to support. While speaking to ANI, Hema Malini appealed people of Mathura to vote for her in the elections.\n\nArun Govil, who essayed the role of Lord Ram in Ramanand Sagar's mythological drama Ramayan has been given the BJP's ticket from Uttar Pradesh's Meerut Lok Sabha seat for the general polls.\n\nThe BJP is eying Western UP with optimism to achieve its ambitious target of 370 seats on its own, despite facing setbacks in the last elections. In 2014, the BJP secured 24 out of 27 seats in the region, which dwindled to 19 in 2019, with all eight seats going to the SP-BSP combined.\n\nIn 2019, BJP candidate Rajendra Agarwal had then managed to clinch the Meerut seat by defeating SP-backed BSP candidate Haji Yakub Qureshi by a thin margin of less than 5,000 votes.\n\nOn the Gautam Buddha Nagar seat, the BJP has fielded incumbent sitting MP, Mahesh Sharma for the third time in a row from the seat. He will be in the electoral fray against INDIA bloc candidate Mahendra Singh Nagar on the SP ticket while the BSP, who is fighting alone has fielded Rajendra Singh Solanki.\n\nGautam Buddha Nagar seat can be considered the stronghold of the Bharatiya Janata Party as it has won in both the 2014 and 2019 elections.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath campaigned for the ruling NDA.\n\nSamajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, BSP president Mayawati, and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief Jayant Singh were on a hectic campaign trail of these constituencies during the past couple of days.

Today, the 48 'ghats' of Vrindavan built by Raja Himmat Bahadur 600 years ago in the classical Braj-Rajasthan tradition along the river front are all but destroyed through governmental indifference and by a group of builders determined to take over this prime property.\n\nBollywood actress-turnedpolitician Hema Malini, instead of getting herself photographed wearing an expensive Kanjeevaram sari with ripe wheat stalks in her hand as she did in 2014 and then again in 2024, could have used these ten precious years she has represented the Mathura Lok Sabha constituency to restore and preserve this unique heritage.\n\nShe describes herself as a Krishna devotee whose dream for her constituency of Mathura, which includes Vrindavan, remains incomplete. She is seeking re-election citing divine intervention, as Krishna wants her to complete the tasks' set into motion ten years ago.\n\nOne day before filing her nomination, Hema Malini performed Yamuna puja at Vishram Ghat. The Yamuna she paid homage to is a dark, stinking body of water, just as it was ten years ago when she performed similar pujas in 2014 and 2019, insisting even then that her top priority would be have the Yamuna cleaned. Those in Vrindavan and Mathura believe Krishna's legacy would have been much better served if she had worked to have the waters of the Yamuna cleaned.\n\nAs someone who claims to visit Mathura every fortnight, she must be aware that Vrindavan's Sewage Treatment Plants aren't working.\n\nLocal activist Madhu Mangal Shukla asks, \"Our leaders should not forget that the Yamuna is the main source of drinking water for lakhs of people. If we destroy the river, what are we left with?\" Residents under the banner of the Yamuna Muktikaran Abhiyan were to hold a threeday fast from March 22 - World Water Day - but called it off under pressure from the local administration.\n\nBrijvasis got together some years ago and formed a larger umbrella organisation called Braj Vrindavan Heritage Alliance (BVHA) to oppose the wanton destruction of their heritage but so powerful is the builder nexus that they have gone ahead and filed 250 affidavits against the BVHA in the Allahabad High Court. 'Why has Hema Malini not stood by us? asked a member on condition of anonymity.\n\nWomen farmers are busy harvesting wheat in the villages around the town of Kosi Kalan. They scoff when asked about Hema Malini's contribution. \"She has brought no development. This is such a historic region being the birth place of Radha Rani in Barsanna and the place where Krishna grew up in Nandagaon but see the condition of both these villages. They are pathetic.\"\n\nIn a recent video clip that has gone viral, Hema Malini was asked what she had done for her constituency. To this query, she replied, \"I have done so much; I do not remember all that I have done.\" A Mathura resident remembers \"when in 2016, violent riots ripped through the city, Hema Malini was busy at a film shoot at Madh island in Mumbai and when asked about her absence she remarked that it was for the Akhilesh Yadav government to handle the situation.\"\n\nA local political analyst, who is close to her, pointed out, \"Hema Malini enjoys a good equation with both PM Modi and Amit Shah and has direct access to them. Also, she does not interfere with the local power equations and is seen to be less corrupt than the other politicians in this region.''\n\nEnvironmentalists point to her failure to take any initiative to stop the drying up of the 1000 or so water bodies or kunds considered sacred by Hindus and which provided water for irrigation, cattle and domestic use along the entire Brajbhoomi belt. This area covers Barsana, Nandgaon, Goverdhan, Gokul and Mathura. Rapid urbanisation and negligence has seen these being converted largely into garbage dumps.\n\nVineet Narain, anti corruption activist and heritage conservator had founded the Braj Foundation focused on reviving these kunds. Unfortunately, Narain crossed swords with the chief minister Yogi Adityanath over inflated bills being given to him (over the revival of these kunds) by some of his appointees. This saw his Foundation being eased out despite having personally supervised the revival of over 50 kunds in the last two decades. Worse is Hema Malini's failure to intervene in the growing pressure Muslim and Hindu families are feeling for acquisition of the land around the Krishna Janambhoomi to build a grand temple. Muslims in Mathura now face a plethora of problems from the ban on the sale of meat to abrupt demolition of Muslim homes to now their place of worship falling prey to Hindu Rashtra politics. Doing away with the Shahi Idgah Masjid has become the next project of the Sangh Parivaar.\n\nHema Malini has refused to concern herself with these undercurrents. For Hema Malini's critics in Mathura, her absence is reminiscent of the lines in her famous song 'Dream girl': 'Kabhi toh milegi, kahin toh milegi, aaj nahin toh kal...'", "source": {"uri":

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had said that it would be Mathura's turn soon. \"This should be done in the next few years. If it doesn't happen, we will wait and see,\" said Hema Malini.\n\nAt a meeting in Chhatarpur on 22 April, Madhya Pradesh CM Mohan Yadav also referred to the BJP's plans for Mathura after Ayodhya's Ram Mandir and Ujjain's Mahakal Lok, and said that in order for this to happen, the people have to vote for the BJP.\n\nOn 14 December 2023, the Allahabad High Court had allowed a court-monitored survey of the Shahi Idgah mosque complex located next to the Janmabhoomi temple, but on 16 January, the Supreme Court had stayed the order. The stay was extended last week by the apex court.\n\nHema Malini's top priority, however, is the Banke Bihari Temple Corridor. The Allahabad High Court gave the nod for the construction of the project last year. \"It should be done soon. A lot of devotees visit the temple. But there are problems due to lack of space,\" she said.\n\nThe two-time MP is confident of her victory. \"My fans and supporters asked me to contest elections for the third time. The projects that I started in the last 10 years can be completed in the next term, which is why I decided to contest,\" she told ThePrint. She added that BJP gave her another chance because of her work in the constituency.\n\nMathura is set to go to polls on 26 April in the second phase. Hema Malini is being challenged by INDIA bloc candidate Mukesh Dhangar.\n\nAlso Read: 'Voter fatigue', eye on Hindi heartland -- what's behind Modi's renewed focus on Muslims & mangalsutras\n\nMathura has been a BJP stronghold for years. The BJP and the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) have locked horns for this seat on multiple occasions, but this time, RLD is a member of the NDA, which makes things easier for the BJP candidate. \"With RLD, the vote share will be higher. We were always face-to-face with Jayant Chaudhary's party, but now we expect better results,\" she said.\n\nIn 2014, Hema Malini had defeated RLD's Jayant Chaudhary in Mathura by more than 4 lakh votes. In 2019, her vote share was over 60 percent.\n\nBefore that, in 2009, Chaudhary was elected the MP there. Back then, she had, in fact, campaigned for him. \"I promise that I will never contest elections against her in future,\" Chaudhary told a meeting in Mathura on 21 April.\n\nBut the BJP and Hema Malini are worried due to the low voter turnout in the first phase of the Lok Sabha polls. On Monday, in several of her meetings in Mathura's Mant assembly constituency, the veteran actor appealed to the people, especially women, to vote. The April 19 voter turnout recorded a dip compared to 2019, especially in the seats, where the NDA had won five years ago.\n\n\"We insist that the voters cast their vote. Everyone knows that we [BJP] will win, but the margin will depend on the public. It is important for them to go and vote,\" Hema Malini told ThePrint. \"The problem is that after saying that the BJP will win, they remain in their houses. But at the time of elections, every person's vote is necessary and important. My vote share will increase only if people go to vote.\"\n\nSeveral Mathura residents have often complained that their MP is not connected with the public. She believes, on the contrary, that the job of an MP is not to make door-to-door visits.\n\n\"An MP is not supposed to go and sit in people's homes. That is not my job. Can the prime minister go to every person's house? MPs go to public meetings. Apart from that, our MLAs are always with them. When people are in need, it is my responsibility to be among them, but when they aren't, why should I?\" she told ThePrint. \"My work is in the office. I work on implementing the plans for public welfare. That is more important. If I sit among people, they will only take photos with me.\"\n\nHema Malini said that she is currently working on the 84 Kosi Parikrama project. \"I have taken up big tasks. Naali-kharanja (drains) and cleanliness are the responsibility of the MLAs and other local representatives. We have MLAs everywhere,\" she added.", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "krishan_murari@theprint.in", "name": "Krishan Murari", "type":

People gathered in balconies and on rooftops showered rose petals on her carcade which snaked its way through the Chowk Bazaar area, considered the business hub of the old town.\n\n\"It (the roadshow) felt like it was a post-victory celebration. The roadshow was very beautifully organised by our party. Everybody, including our alliance partners, participated in it,\" Hema Malini told reporters after the roadshow.\n\nHema Malini is pitted against OBC leader Mukesh Dhangar of the Congress, the nominee of the opposition INDIA bloc, and Chaudhary Suresh Singh of the BSP.\n\n\"This is a one-sided election. The Congress and the BSP are vying for the second spot,\" Dinesh Kumar Agrawal, a businessman in the local jewellery market, told PTI as Hema Malini's roadshow crossed the Chowk Bazaar.\n\nWhile the BJP is banking on the performance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the star power of Hema Malini, the Congress is seeking votes in the name of change. BSP's Singh, a veteran Jat leader who was earlier with the BJP, is hoping to cash in on the sizeable population of his community in Mathura and his party's committed supporters.\n\nRLD chief Jayant Chaudhary's last-minute decision to align with the BJP has not gone down well with his supporters here and Singh is eyeing this section.\n\n\"The Jat community in this region holds RLD founder Chaudhary Charan Singh in high regard. The BJP may benefit from bestowing the Bharat Ratna on him, but local leaders of the RLD are unhappy with Jayant's decision to align with the BJP,\" said Hemant Chaudhary, a local hotelier.\n\nAmong the 19.30 lakh voters in Mathura, the birthplace of Lord Krishna, the Jat community is the most influential with around 5 lakh votes, followed by Rajputs and Brahmins (approximately 3 lakh each), Jatavs (2 lakh), Muslims (1.6 lakh) and OBCs.\n\nA large section of the locals still view Hema Malini as an \"outsider\" but BJP supporters turned out in large numbers for her roadshow on Wednesday, the last day of campaigning for the second phase of the Lok Sabha polls.\n\n\"Vote toh Modi aur Yogi baba ke naam par padna hai, Hema ji toh bahar ki hai (people will vote in the name of Modi and Yogi baba, Hema is an outsider),\" local BJP leader Sanjay Bhardwaj said.\n\nVinod Kumar Gola, who belongs to the Prajapati community of potters, said he will vote for the BJP and listed central government initiatives that have benefited his community.\n\nThe Jatav community, considered a staunch supporter of former chief minister and BSP president Mayawati, appears to be firmly backing her party.\n\n\"Behen ji ko vote nahi diya toh vote bekar hai (my vote will go waste if I don't vote for behen ji),\" said daily labourer Phool Chand Jatav, dismissing concerns over a Jat candidate fielded by the BSP.\n\nBJP corporator Kunjvihari Bhardwaj claimed that the real fight in Mathura was for the second rank as Hema Malini's victory was a \"foregone conclusion\".\n\n\"In 2019, she won by a margin of nearly 3 lakh votes. If the voter turnout is good on the election day, Hema ji can win by even a margin of 5 lakh votes. The Congress and the BSP are in the race for the second spot,\" he said.

Seeking a third consecutive term under the BJP banner, Malini faces accusations of being a 'Missing MP' and an outsider in her own constituency.\n\nThe opposition, led by Congress-SP alliance candidate Mukesh Dhangar, has spearheaded the narrative of 'Brajwasi versus Pravasi,' portraying Malini as detached from local concerns. Despite her two-term tenure since 2014, murmurs persist regarding her absence during critical moments, such as the 2016 Mathura riots, when she was reportedly shooting in Mumbai.\n\n\"Mathura needed her the most during the 2016 riots, but she was nowhere to be found. When contacted, she cited law and order as a state subject, shifting responsibility to Akhilesh Yadav,\" said Manish Sharma, an activist with a local NGO.\n\nHe even recounts the famous line of a song from her film Dream Girl. \"You must have heard that song 'Kahin to milegi, kabhi to milegi, aaj nahi to kal. We are just waiting for that 'kal' when she can stand with us at the time of crisis,\" Sharma said\n\nCritics point out several areas where Malini's performance has allegedly fallen short of expectations, notably in addressing environmental issues such as the cleaning of the Yamuna river. Despite symbolic gestures like performing Yamuna puja, the river remains polluted, drawing ire from locals who rely on it for drinking water\n\nOne day before filing her nomination, Hema Malini performed Yamuna puja at Vishram Ghat. The Yamuna she paid homage to is a dark, stinking body of water, just as it was ten years ago when she performed similar pujas in 2014 and 2019. Despite her previous pledges to prioritize cleaning the river, the Yamuna remains polluted and stagnant.\n\n\"Our leaders should not forget that the Yamuna is the main source of drinking water for lakhs of people. If we destroy the river, what are we left with?\" remarked local activist Madhu Mangal Shukla.\n\nAdditionally, Malini's recent photo-op while cutting wheat has drawn sharp rebuke, with critics accusing her of prioritizing optics over genuine engagement with local issues.\n\n\"Instead of engaging in photo-ops, she should have focused on preserving Mathura's unique heritage,\" lamented Anil Yadav, general secretary of the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee.\n\nThe upcoming election has become a battleground over contrasting visions for Mathura's representation. While the opposition emphasizes the importance of local roots and accountability, Malini's camp banks on her celebrity status and alliance with prominent political figures like Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah.\n\n\"Aapne BJP ko vote nahin diya to desh mein andhkar ho jayega, andhere se kya fayda?\" warned Malini, highlighting the Modi government's achievements in her campaign speeches.\n\nDespite the opposition's efforts to frame the election as 'Brajwasi versus Pravasi,' BJP leaders remain confident in Malini's prospects.\n\n\"Congress is nowhere in the race and was unable to find a suitable candidate and was trying to import one,\" asserted Shyam Bhadoria, BJP's election in-charge for the Mathura seat.\n\nWith the polling scheduled for April 26, the contest in Mathura intensifies, fueled by debates over local representation, environmental stewardship, and the role of celebrity in politics. As voters weigh their options, the outcome of this election will not only shape the future of Mathura but also reflect broader trends in Indian politics.\n\nHema Malini (BJP) is pitted against Mukesh Dhangar (Congress) and Suresh Singh (BSP).", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"}, "authors": [{"uri": "biswajeet_banerjee@moneycontrol.com", "name": "Biswajeet Banerjee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hema_Malini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hema Malini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamuna", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yamuna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathura", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mathura"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mathura"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhangar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dhangar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puja_(Hinduism)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Puja (Hinduism)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishram_Ghat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vishram Ghat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahujan_Samaj_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bahujan Samaj Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhilesh_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Akhilesh Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diya_(lamp)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diya (lamp)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pradesh_Congress_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pradesh Congress Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Shah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amit Shah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yadav", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yadav"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Home_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Home Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wheat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2019/05/AP5_3_2019_000009B-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507494", "eventUri": "eng-9507494", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-26", "textStart": 3371, "textEnd": 3379}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Five years later, in February 2004, she joined the party officially. A year earlier, in 2003, she was nominated by President Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam to serve as a Rajya Sabha MP, which she did until 2009. In 2014, she was given a ticket by the party to fight Mathura, which she won by a huge margin. In 2019, Hema's husband, Dharmendra, campaigned for her second term. Malini is seeking a hatrick at Mathura with the 2024 Lok Sabha. In her recent interview, Hema Malini cites her well-wishers, proclaiming a win by a margin of 5-7 lakh votes.\n\nReacting to the actor-politician's earlier gaffe of not recollecting the welfare work done in her constituency, the internet erupted in hilarious reactions and meme including the 'Kent purifier' meme. \"Happens when you sell water purification than work on constituency rest of the year,\" jibed one user. Another user suggested that If they were her PR manager, they would have advised her to state that \"our work speaks for ourselves under the leadership of Modi.\" \"Kaam itna karo ki yaad hi na rahe,\" another user quipped. Someone dropped the \"Koi sense hai iss baat ka\" meme. One user remarked that the MP visited twice in her tenure and the next she visited was for photoshoot. \"Jab tak canema hai log xutiye bante rahenge,\" wrote another X user. \"Went you forget the answer during engineering viva,\" more users took potshots at her babbling during the interview.\n\nMeanwhile, here's a Know Your Neta trivia. Hema Malini is one among the wealthiest candidates this election with a staggering declared wealth of Rs 278 crore, only lagging behind Congress leader DK Durgesh with Rs 593 cr assets), and Venkatramana Gowda with Rs 622 crore assets.\n\nSee Also: Hema Malini Calls Herself 'Gopi Of Krishna'; 'I Joined Politics Neither For Name Nor For Fame'\n\nSee Also: BJP's Kangana Ranaut Says We Should Not Have Our Own Identity As 'We All Are Narendra Modi'\n\nSee Also: Watch: Hema Malini Takes A Metro And Then An Auto And We Get It Cause Mumbai Traffic!", "source": {"uri": "in.mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hema_Malini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hema Malini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindi cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinod_Khanna", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vinod Khanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tamil language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurdaspur_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gurdaspur district"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gurdaspur district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathura", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mathura"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mathura"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament,_Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._P._J._Abdul_Kalam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.

Here are a few excerpts from the interview.\n\nIANS: What are the issues in the Lok Sabha polls this time?\n\nHema Malini: Tasks that remained unaccomplished during the previous terms will be finished during the third term. New projects will also be undertaken as development cannot be paused. It goes on and on. The MP here will have to be dynamic so that they can continue with development work.\n\nIANS: The Opposition is cornering the Centre over the issue of unemployment. What is the BJP's strategy to tackle it?\n\nHema Malini: The Opposition's accusations are baseless, especially concerning unemployment. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has done a lot of developmental work. The Opposition will not get anything by raking up baseless issues. Youths should meet BJP workers. All information is available on government websites. They should use it.\n\nIANS: Last time the RLD had pitted a candidate against you. This time the RLD is contesting as an ally of the BJP. What impact will this have on the polls?\n\nHema Malini: The RLD stitching up an alliance with the BJP is a positive development. Jayant is doing good work. I am happy with him as an ally and it is a plus point for us.\n\nIANS: What is your opinion about the Krishna Janmabhoomi issue?\n\nHema Malini: The matter is in court. What can I say? Let the court take a decision, then we will talk about the issue.\n\nIANS: Many Bollywood stars entered politics and failed, but you got success...\n\nHema Malini: If you become an MP, you have to have a vision of what you want to achieve. I was offered many areas like Noida, Ghaziabad etc, but I chose Mathura because it has ample opportunities for doing development work. If one becomes the MP of Ayodhya, it would be a matter of pride. There are ample opportunities to do work over there. Anyone who becomes an MP there should do good work that will be remembered forever.\n\nIANS: What are your plans for your constituency if you get elected for the third term?\n\nHema Malini: Development of Parikrama Marg, cleaning of Yamuna River, work in the field of education and honing traditional skills in Mathura are a priority.

Faced with an 'outsider tag', opponents are trying to make this contest as one between 'Brajvasi or Bhari/ Pravasi'. The region where Mathura lies is called Braj.\n\nMalini's main challenger, Congress candidate Mukesh Dhangar, has put up hoardings across the constituency with the slogan \"Nahi chahiye pravasi, abki baar Brajwasi (don't want an outsider, want a local from Braj now).\" Even during their door-door canvassing, Congress workers are pitching the contest as one between Brajwasi vs Pravasi, not a BJP vs Congress fight.\n\nBSP candidate Suresh Singh has also put up posters taking a dig at Hema Malini calling her 'Bambai Wali Sansad' (MP belonging to Mumbai).\n\nBJP workers are urging voters to elect Prime Minister Narendra Modi and seeking votes in the names of Modi and Yogi.\n\nAt a sweet shop near Vrinadavan bus stand, Murari Sharma says there was a 'charm' for Hema Malini in the earlier elections but now people want a local face but eventually many will vote for Modi.\n\nStanding next to him, Vikas Tomar, who runs a shop of seeds and fertilisers, says this time RLD is fighting in alliance with BJP and it will consolidate the Jat votes in favour of Hema Malini.\n\nWhen asked about the caste equations and the Modi factor, Suresh Chand, a Congress worker at the party's office in Mathura, said that the main issue is \"Brajvasi verses Pravasi and Hema Malini ji is Pravasi. She hardly stays here.\"\n\nAnother factor which could pose some challenge for Hema Malini is the anger among Rajputs towards the BJP. Mathura has more than 4 lakh Rajputs, almost second-largest grouping after Jats and more than three lakh brahmins. There are around two lakh Muslims, around one lakh Dalits and a few other castes as well.\n\nBJP allying with RLD has strengthened the caste equations for BJP.

Meanwhile, BSP has also named Suresh Singh as its candidate for Mathura, making the poll battle a three-cornered fight.\n\nIn the 2019 Lok Sabha Elections, Hema Malini from BJP won the seat with a margin of 293,471 votes. A total of 671,293 votes were polled in favour of Malini with a vote share of 61.00 per cent who defeated Kunwar Narendra Singh from RLD who got 377,822 votes (34.21 per cent).\n\nIn the 2014 Lok Sabha Elections, Hema Malini from BJP won the seat and was polled 574,633 votes with a vote share of 53.29 per cent. RLD candidate Jayant Chaudhary got 243,890 votes (22.62 per cent) and was the runner-up. Hema Malini defeated Jayant Chaudhary by a margin of 330,743 votes. Now Jayant Choudhary Party RLD is an alliance partner of BJP in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nOn the last day of campaigning for the second phase, Hema Malini held a roadshow in Mathura.\n\nA large number of people gathered in the roadshow to support. While speaking to ANI, Hema Malini appealed people of Mathura to vote for her in the elections.\n\nArun Govil, who essayed the role of Lord Ram in Ramanand Sagar's mythological drama Ramayan has been given the BJP's ticket from Uttar Pradesh's Meerut Lok Sabha seat for the general polls.\n\nThe BJP is eying Western UP with optimism to achieve its ambitious target of 370 seats on its own, despite facing setbacks in the last elections. In 2014, the BJP secured 24 out of 27 seats in the region, which dwindled to 19 in 2019, with all eight seats going to the SP-BSP combined.\n\nIn 2019, BJP candidate Rajendra Agarwal had then managed to clinch the Meerut seat by defeating SP-backed BSP candidate Haji Yakub Qureshi by a thin margin of less than 5,000 votes.\n\nOn the Gautam Buddha Nagar seat, the BJP has fielded incumbent sitting MP, Mahesh Sharma for the third time in a row from the seat. He will be in the electoral fray against INDIA bloc candidate Mahendra Singh Nagar on the SP ticket while the BSP, who is fighting alone has fielded Rajendra Singh Solanki.\n\nGautam Buddha Nagar seat can be considered the stronghold of the Bharatiya Janata Party as it has won in both the 2014 and 2019 elections.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath campaigned for the ruling NDA.\n\nSamajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, BSP president Mayawati, and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief Jayant Singh were on a hectic campaign trail of these constituencies during the past couple of days.

Here are a few excerpts from the interview.\n\nVOICE: What are the issues in the Lok Sabha polls this time?\n\nHema Malini: Tasks that remained unaccomplished during the previous terms will be finished during the third term. New projects will also be undertaken as development cannot be paused. It goes on and on. The MP here will have to be dynamic so that they can continue with development work.\n\nVOICE: The Opposition is cornering the Centre over the issue of unemployment. What is the BJP's strategy to tackle it?\n\nHema Malini: The Opposition's accusations are baseless, especially concerning unemployment. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has done a lot of developmental work. The Opposition will not get anything by raking up baseless issues. Youths should meet BJP workers. All information is available on government websites. They should use it.\n\nVOICE: Last time the RLD had pitted a candidate against you. This time the RLD is contesting as an ally of the BJP. What impact will this have on the polls?\n\nHema Malini: The RLD stitching up an alliance with the BJP is a positive development. Jayant is doing good work. I am happy with him as an ally and it is a plus point for us.\n\nVOICE: What is your opinion about the Krishna Janmabhoomi issue?\n\nHema Malini: The matter is in court. What can I say? Let the court take a decision, then we will talk about the issue.\n\nVOICE: Many Bollywood stars entered politics and failed, but you got success...\n\nHema Malini: If you become an MP, you have to have a vision of what you want to achieve. I was offered many areas like Noida, Ghaziabad etc, but I chose Mathura because it has ample opportunities for doing development work. If one becomes the MP of Ayodhya, it would be a matter of pride. There are ample opportunities to do work over there.

The actor won the seat with a margin of about 3 lakh votes in 2014 and 2019.\n\n\"I left the BJP after 20 years of my selfless service to the party just because Hema Malini is being imposed upon the people of Mathura. The BJP party workers are fed up facing the public over her unavailability in the constituency and her ignorance about the issues being faced by the voters here,\" said Bhanu Pratap Singh, an Independent contesting against Hema Malini after he was denied a ticket.\n\nSingh also told the Indian Express that he raised his voice against her candidature for the third time ignoring the pre-poll surveys and mood of the public \"but of no avail as no one is ready to oppose fearing punishment from the party\".\n\nHema Malini, 75, appeared unfamiliar with the local BJP leadership when, during a public meeting at Mant assembly segment in Mathura, she read out a few names from the paper provided by the organisers and abruptly asked about one name: \" Yeh kaun hai bhai (who is this person)?\" The local leaders on the stage instantly told her he was the 'Mandal Pramukh'. An uneasy look was quite visible on the faces of those sharing the stage with her.\n\n\"Being a party karyakarta (office-bearer), we have no option but to obey the organisation's orders. We have shared our views and feedback about her candidature with the top leadership but we have not been heard. We have been facing people's questions about her unavailability and ignorance about the constituency at the forefront. Still, we are helpless,\" one of the BJP local leaders engaged in the poll campaign told The Indian Express on the condition of anonymity.\n\nShyam Sundar Sharma, an eight-time former MLA from the Mant Assembly constituency, publicly opposes the star's candidature \"The 2024 election is different and those within the BJP miffed with her candidature are secretly supporting the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) candidate Suresh Singh, who was with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) for several years.\"\n\n\"I challenge Hema Malini to tell me the names of 10 villages in the Mathura district. She is just a dummy who has been imposed upon us and is facing the opposition within the party,\" he added.\n\nBrajwasi vs Pravasi\n\nOne political slogan from the Opposition that has successfully reached the masses in Mathura is the 'Brajwasi vs Pravasi' campaign against the sitting MP. Congress candidate Mukesh Dhangar's hoardings say, \"Nahi chahiye pravasi, abki baar Brajwasi (don't want an outsider, want a local from Braj now).\"\n\nBSP candidate Suresh Singh's slogan is\" \"Sarkari coaching, chhatravas, library- inme se kuch mila? Ya Bambai wali sansad ne chhatron ko sirf chhala. Yaad rakhiye apna hi kaam aayega (government coaching, hostel, library - did you get any of these? This MP from Mumbai just deceived the students. Remember this, a local resident will come for help)\".\n\nThe Independent candidate Pratap Singh's campaign is based on the slogan: Mera Braj meri shaan, Braj me bajegi bansuri (flute is his election symbol). While the Opposition is banking on the Braj identity, Hema Malini's posters also counter the narrative with- \"Viksit Braj, Hema ki guarantee.\" Her hoardings have a bigger picture of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.\n\nMathura, which constitutes a sizable number of Rajputs (over 4 lakh), Brahmins (over 3 lakh), Jaat (3.75 lakh), Muslims (1.5 lakh) and other castes (1.25 lakh), looks divided over caste lines but sounds united over the issues of Brajwasi vs Bahari and the BJP's incumbent two-time MP is facing an uphill task now to counter it.\n\nShe has said she is a Brajwasi as she has been coming here for the last 10 years and is an ardent Lord Krishna devotee. The BJP finds it tough to counter the opposition attack multiplied by the questions over her unavailability in the constituency over the last 10 years.\n\nBanking on the slogan of being Brajwasi first, Congress's INDIA bloc candidate Mukesh Dhangar is campaigning barefoot across the Braj area and kicking off public meets by bowing down to the ground.\n\n\"I am the son of this land, I am one among these Brajwasis. I filed my nomination by drinking one litre of Yamuna Jal because we revere the Yamuna river but when Hemaji was asked to do the achaman (to have the water as a part of worship) by purohit, she said no. This is what the people of Mathura have seen and decided to send her out from here now,\" Dhangar said.\n\nWatch video:\n\nNotably, during her first bid for the Mathura Lok Sabha seat in 2014, Hema Malini and the BJP promised the rejuvenation of Yamuna and also mentioned that river cruises and boats would be functional in the holy river in their bid to promote tourism in Mathura. However, 10 years later, things are still the same, and Yamuna rejuvenation is once again one of the hottest topics in Lok Sabha elections 2024.\n\nShift in poll dynamics\n\nDespite her image of an outsider, two-term anti-incumbency and infighting within the BJP leadership, along with a host of other issues -- including unemployment, inflation and her unavailability in the constituency -- are making this a tough fight for the BJP candidate this time. Voters openly commend 'Modi and Yogi' for their development works done in and around the religious sites but the BJP's hardcore voters are also seen admitting Hema Malini's absence from the area for five years.\n\nAshok Pathak, 50, sitting in front of Krishna Janm Bhoomi gate, said,\" Mathura is voting for Modi and Yogi, not for any MP. We have also seen Brajwasi ruling us before; they also could not do much. Why expect much from her now?\"\n\nThe other issues that resonate most on ground zero are massive unemployment and paper leaks. \" Ravindra Singh, 22, qualified for eight out of 12 government exams but was not selected for multiple reasons. Sitting in Hema Malini's public meeting in Jawra village, he said, \"I will not vote for the BJP; I will vote for Rahul Gandhi because he is a well-educated person.\"\n\nThe youth said he is troubled by unemployment and the current government's inaction to address the issue. He also added that youngsters are hopeful of Rahul Gandhi's announcement that he will scrap the Agniveer scheme if he comes to power.\n\nInterestingly, none of the posters, banners, hoardings, or public speeches by the BJP leaders mention employment issues. According to the Election Commission of India (ECI) data, at least 1.82 crore first-time voters and 19.74 crore young voters in the 20-29 age group are on the electoral rolls in India.\n\nMathura is a farmers-dominated area, and the youth aspire to join the defence forces, but there is evident anger over the implementation of the Agniveer scheme. \"Char-char saal ki naukri karke, barbad kar diya Modi ne (Modi is ruining the future of the youth by giving employment for four years),\" said an elderly woman walking back from Hema Malini's public meeting.\n\n\"Our boys have stopped preparing for Agniveer, fearing the lack of future security. We have been giving Modi our votes but getting back unemployment in return. He should think of us.\"\n\nRural vs Urban divide\n\nThe voices for and against the current regime visibly differ in rural Mathura and urban periphery. In and around the city hails 'Modi and Yogi' and gives an advantage to Hema Malini for the hattrick, whereas the villages in all five Assembly segments- Mant, Baldev, Mathura, Goverdhan and Chhata- sound disheartened and seeking a 'parivartan' (change).\n\nBaldev Kumar, who runs a tea stall outside Rawal village, said, \"We are so much troubled by unemployment. We openly support Congress because the candidate (Mukesh Dhanagar) is a farmer like us. The rural areas of Mathura are supporting him in a big way.\"\n\nHema Malini adopted this village in 2014 under the Sansad Adarsh Gaon scheme and spent Rs 35 lakh on the road, street lights, drinking water, and other basic amenities. The Rawal village has historical significance as it's the birthplace of Radha Rani, and people who come to Krishna Janmbhoomi also offer obeisance to this place.\n\nWith over 800 villages, 504 gram panchayats. Mathura has a total rural electorate of approximately 15 lakh.\n\nBhanu Pratap said, \"Rural population is facing multiple issues like unavailability of meetha pani as the groundwater here is khara pani. Hema Malini and the state BJP government have only been able to install the RO system for just 31 villages out of 800. Women and girls still fetch drinking water from 2-3 km away.\"\n\nThe farmers' distress is another major issue the BJP finds challenging to address. \"We all have been seeing how the BJP is treating the farmers, but also, we have been made paralysed since the Chhata Suger Mill got shut in 2008. We used to grow sugarcane earlier but after the mill's closure, we had no choice but to shift to paddy, which is not profitable. Ahead of every election, they are promising the mill's revival but it has still not been functional,\" said Ram Khiladi Dhangar, a farmer in Naglapula in the Baldev area.", "source": {"uri":

Seeking a third consecutive term under the Bharatiya Janata Party banner, Malini finds herself under fire, labeled as a 'Missing MP' and an outsider in her own constituency.\n\nThe opposition, led by Congress-Samajwadi Party alliance candidate Mukesh Dhangar, has championed the narrative of 'Brajwasi versus Pravasi', painting Malini as disconnected from local issues. Despite her two-term tenure since 2014, doubts linger about her presence during crucial moments, such as the 2016 Mathura riots, with reports suggesting she was away shooting in Mumbai.\n\n\"Mathura needed her the most during the 2016 riots, but she was nowhere to be found. When contacted, she cited law and order as a state subject, shifting responsibility on Akhilesh Yadav,\" remarked Manish Sharma, an activist with a local NGO, invoking a line from one of her famous film songs to underscore the community's longing for her support during crisis.\n\nCritics highlight multiple areas where Malini's performance has purportedly fallen short, particularly in addressing environmental concerns like the pollution of the river Yamuna. Despite symbolic gestures such as Yamuna puja ceremonies, the river remains polluted, sparking frustration among locals who depend on it for drinking water.\n\n\"Our leaders should remember that the Yamuna is the lifeline for thousands. If we neglect the river, what future are we leaving for ourselves?\" asked local activist Madhu Mangal Shukla.\n\nFurthermore, Malini's recent photo-op while harvesting wheat has drawn sharp criticism, with detractors accusing her of prioritising optics over genuine engagement with local issues.\n\n\"Instead of indulging in photo opportunities, she should have focused on preserving Mathura's rich heritage,\" lamented Anil Yadav, general secretary of the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee.\n\nThe upcoming election has transformed into a battleground of contrasting visions for Mathura's representation. While the opposition stresses the significance of local roots and accountability, Malini's camp relies on her celebrity status and ties with prominent political figures like Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah.\n\n\"Aapne BJP ko vote nahin diya to desh mein andhkar ho jayega, andhere se kya fayda?\" warned Malini, highlighting the Modi government's accomplishments in her campaign speeches.\n\nDespite the opposition's attempts to frame the election as 'Brajwasi versus Pravasi', BJP leaders exude confidence in Malini's prospects.\n\n\"Congress is not even in the competition and has failed to field a suitable candidate, resorting to importing one,\" asserted Shyam Bhadoria, BJP's election in-charge for the Mathura constituency.\n\nWith polling scheduled for April 26, the contest in Mathura escalates, fueled by debates over local representation, environmental stewardship and the role of celebrity in politics. As voters deliberate their choices, the outcome of this election will not only shape Mathura's future but also reflect broader trends in Indian politics.\n\nIn the electoral arena, Hema Malini (Bharatiya Janata Party) faces Mukesh Dhangar (Congress) and Suresh Singh (Bahujan Samaj Party).", "source": {"uri": "dailypioneer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Pioneer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "biswajeet_banerjee@dailypioneer.com", "name": "Biswajeet Banerjee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hema_Malini", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hema Malini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathura", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mathura"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mathura"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamuna", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yamuna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhangar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dhangar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puja_(Hinduism)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Puja (Hinduism)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhilesh_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Akhilesh Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wheat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pradesh_Congress_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pradesh Congress Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Shah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amit Shah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yadav", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yadav"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahujan_Samaj_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bahujan Samaj Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Home_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Home Affairs (India)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507494", "eventUri": "eng-9507494", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-26", "textStart": 2900, "textEnd": 2908}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

A similar number of processions were organised in Agra on the occasion.\n\nThe tableaus in Mathura had a man and a woman posing as Ambedkar and his wife, Ramabai, there was also a Buddhist monk and his disciples, Dalit saint-poet Ravidas and others. There were images of Dalit thinkers and Gautam Buddha in the tableaus in Agra, 58km east of Mathura.\n\nUnlike other parties' voters in Uttar Pradesh who have maintained a stoic silence this time on whom to vote for, participants at the BSP processions made no bones about their allegiance to the party, giving a clear hint that it would be unfair to write off Mayawati this early.\n\n\"These people will support the BSP candidates this election because Mathura and Agra have witnessed developments during Mayawati's term (between 2007 and 2012). There is disillusionment among people here concerning the insensitivity of Hema Malini and S.P. Singh Baghel, the two-time BJP MPs from Mathura and Agra (respectively),\" said Vivek Kumar, who enacted Ravidas in a Mathura rally.\n\nSant Ram and his wife Sashi, who played Ambedkar and Ramabai, said there is no hope other than the BSP in the current situation. \"The BJP has ignored the poor and tried to reduce them to beggars,\" he said.\n\nNot only followers of Ambedkar, whom BSP president Mayawati considers her party's \"guiding force\", but also some priests of the revered Shri Rangnath Mandir in Vrindavan claimed off the record that they would vote for the party candidate.\n\n\"We had invited Hema Malini in 2014 and sent her to Parliament with due respect. We will try to send her back to Mumbai this time by voting for the BSP or whoever is in a position to defeat them,\" said a priest, with other seers echoing him.\n\n\"To beat the BJP in its own game, Behenji has made a good strategy. Suresh Singh, the BSP candidate from Mathura, is a former Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) leader. Singh is also a Jat, the community which plays a decisive role in Mathura,\" said another priest.\n\nSuresh Singh said a major part of Mathura district was included in the Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ) a few years ago. \"Since then, all the industries here have shut down. But Mathura's share in the income of Taj Mahal is zero. It is unfair that we have to suffer because of the mausoleum. We don't get anything from its earnings. I aim to make a common panel to manage the twin districts.\"\n\nThe TTZ was formed to protect the Taj Mahal from environmental pollution.\n\n\"The failure of the Narendra Modi government is a major reason behind voters swaying away from the BJP,\" Singh said.\n\nPolitical observers said Congress candidate Mukesh Dhangar has a strong influence in the urban areas of Mathura-Vrindava but the BSP has a better grip in Chhatta, Mant, Goverdhan and Baldev -- the remaining four Assembly segments of the districts.", "source": {"uri": "telegraphindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "piyush_srivastava@telegraphindia.com", "name": "Piyush Srivastava", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._R._Ambedkar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "B.

A wrong impression has been created among the people that Chhattisgarh is only known for Maoist violence, Mr Sai lamented. He said that Leftwing extremism is not the identity of Chhattisgarh as Maoist menace is confined to \u2018only limited areas\u2019 in five districts (in Bastar) in the state. The chief minister who is currently on a tour of Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of the new NDA government-led by Narendra Modi was addressing a news conference in the national capital. \u201cLeftwing extremism is not the identity of Chhattisgarh. There is an impression among people that Chhattisgarh is only known for Maoist violence. But, it is not so. Naxal menace is confined to only limited areas of five districts (in Bastar) in the state. The Naxal base is fast shrinking in Bastar. I appeal to the media not to identify Chhattisgarh with Leftwing insurgency\u201d, Mr Sai said, according to a press release issued by Chhattisgarh government. Mr Sai said that as many as 25 security camps have been established in the insurgency-hit areas in these five districts so far. The establishment of each security camp has helped the government reach the benefits of its various welfare schemes to the people residing in a radius of five km from it. He said that his government has intensified counterinsurgency measures to combat Maoism in Bastar. Describing Bastar as tourists\u2019 paradise, Mr Sai said that tourist hotspots such as Chitrakote waterfall and Kutumsar cave in Bastar have attracted a huge number of tourists every year. He said that his government has focused on development of tourism in the state particularly in Bastar to generate revenue and employment. Mr Sai said that his government has fulfilled key promises made under \u2018Modi guarantees\u2019 within 100 days of coming to power. He said that BJP had put up its best ever performance in the November 2023 Assembly polls in Chhattisgarh by securing 54 out of 90 seats and getting a vote share of 46 percent. BJP has also secured ten out of 11 LS seats in the state, the best ever performance by the party in the Lok Sabha elections in the state so far.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/news/chhattisgarh-identity-not-leftwing-insurgency-naxal-menace-confined-to-limited-areas-of-5-districts-only-898128", "image": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/06/09/1095969-54.webp", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:47:05", "author": "Rabindra Nath Choudhury", "authors": ["Rabindra Nath Choudhury"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.166}

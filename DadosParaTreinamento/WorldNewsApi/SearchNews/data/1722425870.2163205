San Jose police officers found the man\u2019s body around 10 a.m. on July 17, 2016, in the 400 block of North First Street, near Ryland Park. He had been stabbed at least once. \u201cDespite investigative efforts, a suspect was not identified or apprehended at the time of the incident,\u201d Officer Tanya Hernandez said in a news release announcing the arrest. The victim was later identified as Jose Lopez, 51, of San Jose. His death marked the city\u2019s 27th homicide of 2016. The Santa Clara County District Attorney\u2019s Office Cold Case Team re-examined the case in 2022 and identified Marco Iniquez Jr. as a potential suspect, Hernandez said. Detectives obtained a warrant for Iniquez\u2019s arrest, but he would remain at large for another two years. On May 30, officers found and arrested Iniquez in Aromas, an unincorporated community in Monterey and San Benito counties. He was booked into Santa Clara County jail on a murder charge. Iniquez is being held without bail at the Main Jail in San Jose, according to jail records. He is slated to appear in court on July 22. Hernandez said the motive and circumstances surrounding the homicide are under investigation. In the first half of 2024, detectives have closed six homicide cases from prior years, two of them with help from the DA\u2019s Office Cold Case Team, Hernandez said. \u201cThe San Jose Police Department values this collaborative relationship and will continue to seek justice for the victims of unsolved homicides,\u201d Lt. John Barg said in a statement. Anyone with information related to the case can contact Detective Sgt. Ivan Barragan at 4106@sanjoseca.gov, Detective Catherine Van Brande at 4542@sanjoseca.gov or both at 408-277-5283.

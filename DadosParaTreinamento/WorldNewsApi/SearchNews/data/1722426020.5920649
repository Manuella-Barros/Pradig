{"id": 243275490, "title": "Troubled by desires of selfish - Trinidad and Tobago Newsday", "text": "THE EDITOR: As I write this, I am deeply troubled. I see opportunities for a better TT, and moreover a better world, totally ignored and replaced by man\u2019s desire for power. The solutions are there in front of all of us but the desires of the selfish seems more powerful, more determined and poised for more domination. If I were to talk about people accused of misappropriating public funds, there is interest. That interest is magnified if I dare to call names or identify people by the political party they represent. The very same people who were interested in those topics will totally ignore plans for better water distribution, flood alleviation, long-term financial planning and strategic plans for economic development. The fact that one catchment basin on South Quay prevented flooding in that area for years until it was left to be filled with debris does not inspire anyone to dredge the basin and place more such basins in areas prone to serious flood challenges. Instead, we will wait for the next disaster, to respond with hampers and a flood of media personnel noting how we respond to the plight of those affected. I am deeply troubled by the lack of planning for the future of our young graduates. Where are they to find jobs? How can this new generation find the security, economic stability and hope for a future family? As I examine the political landscape and the poor quality of options opposed to the PNM, I wonder if the people of TT could or would ever find the concerted strength to present themselves as viable candidates, ready to finance political entities that can provide hope for a better tomorrow for TT. World politics has clearly indicated the strength of financing political parties. When finance is injected into a political organisation, the financiers control the party\u2019s view of morality, of justice and treatment of the poor. In TT, unless some financier with strong moral convictions decides to invest in the future of our nation and the long-term interest of our children, we will continue to hold our breaths, fighting with our deep personal convictions to support people who we know deep inside is inimical to the long-term interest of our country. I am today reminded of a slave trader who lived a comfortable life undisturbed by the nature of his business. He was OK as long as he benefitted from his endeavours. Then one day he met with a storm, and after surviving he wrote that popular hymn that said, \u201cAmazing grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me.\u201d Maybe only after we face the storm we may understand the need to unite and rebuild our nation.

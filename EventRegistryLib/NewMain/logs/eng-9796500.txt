I will take the best out of my instinct and my father's policies.\"\n\nMahinda is credited with ending Sri Lanka's Tamil separatist war in 2009 -- but which also sparked allegations that troops killed up to 40,000 Tamil civilians in the final months of fighting.\n\n- Deepening divide-\n\nThe entry of a Rajapaksa into the presidential race formalised a widening split in the government.\n\nA majority of legislators from the SLPP had wanted the party to back their new ally, President Ranil Wickremesinghe, after praising him for turning the economy around after the 2022 crisis.\n\nWickremesinghe is not from the SLPP, but he had the party's backing to replace then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa.\n\nDespite the downfall of Gotabaya, the SLPP enjoyed a majority in the 225-member parliament, controlled the government -- and had supported Wickremesinghe.\n\nHowever, the parting of ways began when the election was called last month.\n\nThat revealed the divisions in the once-dominant SLPP, a nationalist party appealing to the Sinhala-Buddhist majority.\n\nNamal's entry turns the presidential poll into a battle among four main candidates.\n\nWickremesinghe had contested two presidential elections and lost both. However, he had been prime minister six times since entering parliament in 1977.\n\nHe is seeking a full five-year term to press ahead with his austerity measures, which he says are necessary to shore up reserves of the cash-strapped nation and start repaying its external loans.\n\nSri Lanka defaulted on its $46 billion foreign debt in April 2022 when it ran out of foreign exchange for essential imports.\n\nTwo other front runner candidates -- Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake -- say they will continue with the $2.9 billion IMF bailout negotiated by Wickremesinghe last year, but will reduce taxes and halt privatisation.\n\nDissanayake, leader of a leftist party, is also vowing to jail members of the Rajapaksa family, as well as Wickremesinghe, who is accused of blocking investigations into corruption during their time in power.", "source": {"uri": "sg.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A formal announcement, expected shortly after the SLPP's high-level meeting on Wednesday morning, comes at a crucial time as the party and country are still grappling with the impacts of economic crisis and chaos.\n\nThe September 21 presidential election in Sri Lanka, the first since the 2022 people's uprising that ousted President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, promises to be a fiercely contested four-way race. Incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe will face off against Sajith Premadasa of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the leader of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP).\n\nThe decision to field Namal Rajapaksa, 38, emerged after MP Dhammika Perera, the SLPP candidate, informed the party he would not contest the 2024 Presidential Election due to personal reasons. Namal volunteered to contest, and the party backed the idea at a meeting on Tuesday night, a top SLPP source said. \"A high-level party meeting would formally announce the decision on Wednesday,\" the source added.\n\nNamal, the national organiser of the SLPP, will be the youngest candidate in this presidential poll. A senior SLPP leader said many believed the Mahinda family should step away from the contest due to the ongoing chaos in the country. \"This election will not be easy for anyone. Even as there are challenges and nobody is going to get 50 per cent vote share, Namal has been working hard in the past few years, especially focusing on the Northern region,\" the leader said.\n\nLast week, several SLPP Parliamentary groups supported President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who announced his intention to contest as an independent candidate, defying the party's decision to field its candidate. When asked about the MPs supporting Wickremesinghe, the party leader said, \"Those young SLPP MPs who supported Ranil Wickremesinghe's candidature will now support Namal.\"\n\nNamal is the eldest son of Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is seen as the most popular Sinhala Buddhist leader in Sri Lankan history. Namal has been slowly building his team for nearly a decade, focusing on both the south and east and permanently deploying and visiting Tamil-majority Northern Sri Lanka, escalating his direct engagements with the Tamil population.\n\nNamal contested the 2010 parliamentary election as one of the United People's Freedom Alliance's candidates in the Hambantota district and was elected to Parliament. His father, Mahinda, was an MP from Hambantota for 16 years before becoming the president in 2005.\n\nWhile Mahinda and his brother and former president Gotabaya are all known for their extreme Sinhala Buddhist views, Namal Rajapaksa in an interview with The Indian Express in 2018 spoke about his Sinhalese identity. \"Everyone believes in what they believe in. Protecting your own beliefs and culture is not extremism. I believe that it is always good to have a culture and belief in something. It is very important to take that forward to our next generation,\" he said.\n\nNamal graduated with a law degree from the City, University of London, and later qualified as an attorney at law from Sri Lanka Law College. He married Limini Weerasinghe in 2019 and they have two children.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arun_janardhanan@indianexpress.com", "name": "Arun Janardhanan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namal_Rajapaksa", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Namal Rajapaksa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahinda_Rajapaksa", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mahinda Rajapaksa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka_Podujana_Peramuna", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samagi_Jana_Balawegaya", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Samagi Jana Balawegaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranil_Wickremesinghe", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ranil Wickremesinghe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotabaya_Rajapaksa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gotabaya Rajapaksa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sajith_Premadasa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sajith Premadasa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indian_Express", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Indian Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhammika_Perera", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dhammika Perera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anura_Kumara_Dissanayaka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anura Kumara Dissanayaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janatha_Vimukthi_Peramuna", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhalese_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sinhalese language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka_Law_College", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka Law College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhalese_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sinhalese people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_People's_Freedom_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United People's Freedom Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tamil language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Sri_Lanka", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of Sri Lanka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_London", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buddhism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Province,_Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern Province, Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Province, Sri Lanka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hambantota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hambantota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hambantota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/08/namal-rajapaksa.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796500", "eventUri": "eng-9796500", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-21", "textStart": 470, "textEnd": 482}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

But a section led by Namal and his uncle Basil refused to back him, triggering a mass exodus of their MPs from SLPP to Wickremesinghe's side.\n\nAccording to insiders, they were not comfortable with Perera contesting on the SLPP ticket.\n\nSpeaking about Namal's candidature, Mahinda Rajapaksa said: \"The Aragalaya asked for a young leader, so we have presented a young leader.\"\n\nThe unexpected candidature of Namal has turned the election into a four-cornered contest. Besides Namal and Wickremesinghe, leader of the opposition Sajith Premadasa and a Marxist party JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayaka are also in the fray, making it the most difficult election in the history of Sri Lanka.\n\nDissanayaka, who is popularly known as AKD, is hopeful of a win. He claims people are fed up with all established politicians of the country whom they hold responsible for the current situation. Premadasa, meanwhile, is banking on his image and anti-establishment votes to realise the dream.\n\nWickremesinghe feels that the people owe him something for bringing the country back to stability in record time.\n\nNamal, who is the youngest, is facing an uphill battle as his party is facing an exodus and public indifference. According to insiders, Namal is not hoping to win the presidency in his first attempt and he knows odds are stacked against him.\n\nTo save the vote base of SLPP and prevent the exodus of MPs and other leaders, he has taken a gamble. His close friends and aides believe that it will help him in giving a good fight in the parliamentary elections due after the presidential election.\n\n\"If he wins 50-60 seats in the parliamentary elections, he can even become the prime minister in a coalition government or become leader of opposition party in Parliament. It will save his party, father's legacy and ensure the future for him,\" said a close friend.\n\nNamal has been an MP since 2010. He has been a Cabinet minister in the past and he won the 2020 Parliament elections from family stronghold Hambantota district in the Deep South by a big margin.\n\nNamal has studied law in England and Sri Lanka. An avid sportsman and fitness freak, he was also Sri Lanka's national Rugby team captain. He is married to Limini Weerasinghe and they have two sons.\n\nPopular among the youth and his father's followers, Namal has recently replaced his controversial uncle Basil Rajapaksa as SLPP's national organiser, the second-most important post in the party.\n\nMost of his friends know that Namal did not want to contest in the Presidential elections before he turned at least 40. He had always maintained that he had a long career ahead and he would throw his hat in the ring in his mid-40s. But fate seems to have changed that, forcing him to try to his luck at just 38.\n\nIf he wins, it will be huge for the Rajapaksa family and his party. If he doesn't, he will stay relevant in national politics.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranil_Wickremesinghe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ranil Wickremesinghe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namal_Rajapaksa", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Namal Rajapaksa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahinda_Rajapaksa", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mahinda Rajapaksa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka_Podujana_Peramuna", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhammika_Perera", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhammika Perera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sajith_Premadasa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sajith Premadasa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anura_Kumara_Dissanayaka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anura Kumara Dissanayaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Island country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Sri_Lankan_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2022 Sri Lankan protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Rajapaksa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basil Rajapaksa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajapaksa_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajapaksa family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janatha_Vimukthi_Peramuna", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marxism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Sri_Lanka", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of Sri Lanka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rugby football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hambantota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hambantota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hambantota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/08/namal-rajapaksa-2024-08-5704361cd319c7aa2bd2a8a4e294ac76-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796500", "eventUri": "eng-9796500", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-21", "textStart": 637, "textEnd": 649}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

SLPP Founder Basil Rajapaksa confirmedto Daily Mirror that Namal will be named as the SLPP'S Presidential candidate today morning at 9 a.m. and his campaign will start immediately.\n\nPolitical mayhem erupted in the SLPP camp yesterday when casino kingpin Dhammika Perera pulledout of being named as the party's Presidential candidate at the last minute following rumours that he had been pressured to do so and was likely to join President Ranil Wickremesinghe.\n\nIn a letter sent to the General Secretary of the SLPP, Dhammika Perera said that he pulled out for personal reasons. However, the Daily Mirror learns that Dhammika Perera has informed some of the SLPP members that his mother has fallen ill which is why he could not contest the race.\n\nThe stage was all set to announce Dhammika as the Presidential candidate at 9 a.m. today morning but plans suddenly changed prompting the party to go ahead with naming Namal Rajapaksa as the SLPP candidate.\n\nNamal himself rushed to Anuradhapura yesterday to seek blessings and will now be elected and named as the Presidential candidate.\n\nFor months Dhammika Perera had been requesting the party to name him as the Presidential candidate considering his business knowledge and financial strength. The party higher up had agreed toname him considering that Dhammika could capture the youth's support following his knowledge on the economy and his possibility of creating job opportunities.\n\nHowever, following a last minute u-turn, the next possible candidate, Namal Rajapaksa was immediately pulled in to join the race and will officially contest for the presidency on September 21.\n\nNamal was one of the members who had voted against supporting Ranil Wickremesinghe at the September 21 Presidential Election and said the SLPP would instead field its own candidate.\n\nHe had remained steadfast that the Pohotuwa would have its own symbol on the ballot paper and accused President Wickremesinghe for bypassing the SLPP Leadership and approaching the MPS direct to gain support.", "source": {"uri": "dailymirror.lk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mirror"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhammika_Perera", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dhammika Perera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namal_Rajapaksa", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Namal Rajapaksa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka_Podujana_Peramuna", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Rajapaksa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basil Rajapaksa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politburo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colombo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colombo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranil_Wickremesinghe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ranil Wickremesinghe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anuradhapura", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anuradhapura"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Anuradhapura"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://bmkltsly13vb.compat.objectstorage.ap-singapore-1.oraclecloud.com/cdn.sg.dailymirror.lk/assets/uploads/image_cf3c4973cc.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796500", "eventUri": "eng-9796500", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colombo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 9, "textEnd": 17}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-21", "textStart": 1898, "textEnd": 1910, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

The party, which leads the government coalition, had supported incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe in the current term.\n\n\"Victory for Namal is guaranteed because he possesses local values, understands the aspirations of the people, and can face up to challenges,\" said party general secretary Sagara Kariyawasam.\n\nThe vote on Sept 21 will be the first for the country after a historic debt default in May 2022 that resulted in living standards plummeting and led to widespread unrest, forcing Namal's uncle Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country and resign.\n\nNamal's participation in the presidential election signals the Rajapaksa clan is trying to re-consolidate power among the country's Buddhist majority.\n\nThe former sports minister will run against Wickremesinghe, main opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, and Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who is backed by the socialist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna party. Nearly 20 candidates have so far placed deposits at the Election Commission to contest the polls, for which the nominations are due on Aug 15.\n\nNamal's father Mahinda Rajapaksa, whose decade in power brought the end of Sri Lanka's ethnic war, and uncle Basil Rajapaksa, a former finance minister, attended Wednesday's event at the party headquarters. Supporters held prayers and cheered the announcement. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, however, was not present, suggesting some friction within the clan.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg News in 2022, Namal said that while his uncle's government had inherited a bad economy from the previous administration, it also made some key policy errors and failed to pivot quickly when the pandemic hit.\n\nWickremesinghe, 75, who took the presidency through a parliament vote, is standing as an independent candidate. He's won endorsement from some members of the SLPP, who have been part of his cabinet that oversaw a recovery of the economy and backed a $3-billion International Monetary Fund bailout package.\n\nWickremesinghe, seen by most as the frontrunner, is campaigning on a platform of continuing reforms in order to tap more funds and sustain growth. Dissanayake has won support amid a campaign for equitability of growth and elimination of corruption.\n\nNamal Rajapaksa's candidacy will test whether his powerful family has managed to retain its popularity despite the country's gruelling financial crisis.\n\nSri Lanka defaulted on its foreign debt in May 2022 but has since signed a $10-billion restructuring deal with bilateral creditors and aims to finalise a $12.5-billion debt restructuring with bondholders, efforts Namal Rajapaksa said he would support.\n\nHe added that he would work to create jobs and help small businesses as the economy makes a fragile recovery, backed by the IMF bailout.\n\n\"We are studying the IMF programme to see how we can work around some of its requirements, such as government revenue increases ... without increasing the burden on the public,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "bangkokpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangkok Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Would the electorate follow their representatives in Parliament as they switched allegiance to various presidential candidates? Could they be influenced by turncoat parliamentarians whose political intentions generally depend on personal benefits? That is the ugly truth the electorate must come to terms with.\n\nThere'll be about 1.1 million new voters among 1.71 mn eligible to vote at the presidential election.\n\nBefore we discuss the forthcoming presidential poll, let me remind the readers of the composition of the current Parliament. The Parliament consists of 196 elected on a district basis and 29 chosen from the National List.\n\nFifteen recognized political parties are represented in the Parliament. The following are the political parties and the number of seats they won at the last parliamentary election conducted in August 2020. The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP/145 seats), Samagi Jana Balwegaya (SJB/54), Illankai Thamil Arasu Kadchi (ITAK/10), Jathika Jana Balawegaya (JJB/03), Eelam People's Democratic Party (EPDP/02), Ahila Ilankai Thamil Congress (AITC/02) and the remaining nine parties, namely Thamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal (TMVP), Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), Muslim National Alliance (MNA), Thamil Makkal Thesiya Kuttani (TMTK), All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC), National Congress (NC), Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), United National Party (UNP) and Our Power of People Party (OPPP) secured one seat each.\n\nThe number of seats mentioned above included National List slots. Of the 29 NL slots, the SLPP secured 17 and the SJB 07 whereas five other parties-ITAK, JJB, AITC, UNP and OPPP obtained one each.\n\nHowever, the SLPP has been fragmented to such an extent and in disarray, the party faces a catastrophic situation. The Rajapaksas-led SLPP that handsomely won the last Local Government polls (Feb. 2018), Presidential Polls (Nov. 2019) and the General Election (Aug. 2020) is approaching a real moment of truth. In spite of the likes of its National Organizer Namal Rajapaksa, Johnston Fernando and retired Navy Chief of Staff Sarath Weerasekera continuing to put on a brave face, the ground situation is deteriorating rapidly and the party seems to be in dire straits.\n\nThe failure on the part of the ruling party to name its presidential candidate, ahead of President Ranil Wickremesinghe's declaration of him as an independent candidate, exposed the SLPP badly.\n\nThe SLPP has repeatedly assured that its candidate would be disclosed today (07). Business tycoon Dhammika Perera, who had been accommodated in the SLPP National List, in June 2022, in place of Basil Rajapaksa, is widely believed to be their choice. Newcomer Perera, who served as Investment Promotion Minister during Gotabaya Rajapaksa's presidency (June-July 2022), faces a daunting challenge in obtaining a respectable final count if the former people's president Mahinda Rajapaksa, too, has been abandoned by his ardent supporters.\n\nLawmaker Namal Rajapaksa seems still confident that their candidate Dhammika Perera, or a last minute change, could still win the presidential race. With the SLPP's backing, wartime Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who had absolutely no experience in politics, secured a staggering 6.9 mn at the last presidential poll. With the original SLPP parliamentary group divided among presidential candidates, UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, SJB leader Sajith Premadasa, MJP leader Dilith Jayaweera and yet to be named SLPP contestant, in terms of numbers, the incumbent President seems to be in the lead. But that could be a grave mistake on the part of the Wickremesinghe's camp. The number of turncoats does not necessarily mean voters will follow especially because of undying loyalty professed by many to ex-President Mahinda. Even after he was trounced at the January 2015 presidential election and he silently withdrew into his Medamulana abode, it was the ordinary Sinhala masses having realized the anti-national frauds who were elected to replace Rajapaksas, went in their hundreds, if not thousands, daily, as if in pilgrimage, to plead with him to return to national politics. What would have swayed the masses was his natural appeal in his ability to interact with them. He was one leader who made Temple Trees an open house for ordinary people to come and have a meal at their leader's palace, at least on Wesak days each year. He actually showed his mettle to not only to our masses, but to the whole world when he literally told a delegation of powerful entities from the West, like then British Foreign Secretary David Miliband and French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner, to get lost when they tried to arm twist him into saving terrorist numero uno Velupillai Prabhakaran and his band as they were facing total annihilation in Wanni in 2009.\n\nThe SLPP appears to be confident that the voters wouldn't go along with those who had treacherously pledged their support to Wickremesinghe, Premadasa and Dilith Jayaweera at the expense of the party they represented in Parliament. Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC, another SLPP MP, is in the fray as the candidate of the National Democratic Front (NDF). Former Justice Minister Rajapakshe is unlikely to attract any sitting MPs representing the SLPP or any other party. He must be relying on his sizeable caste vote to make a strong showing rather than an actual victory.\n\nImpact of Aragalaya on voters\n\nIn the absence of proper examination of the events leading to Aragalaya, or change of government through unconstitutional means in July 2022, the SLPP or any other political party represented in Parliament lacked understanding of the ground situation. Therefore, political parties face the first national election in less than 50 days without proper comprehension of the developing situation and the forces working behind the scene.\n\nInstead of seeking political advantage, political parties, represented in Parliament, should have sought to examine the circumstances leading to the eruption of the violent public protest campaign outside President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's residence at Pangiriwatte, Mirihana, on the night of March 31, 2022. Even though the US definitely wanted to oust Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the global power couldn't have achieved its objectives without the SLPP's unintentional or deliberately flawed decisions contributing to the crisis with economic hitmen working within.\n\nThe SLPP parliamentary group cannot absolve itself of the responsibility for the ruination of the economy. Similarly, the UNP and SJB, under any circumstances, cannot deny their culpability for the massive Treasury bond scams perpetrated by the Yahapalana regime in 2015 (February) and 2016 (March) under the then Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe's watch and still unexplained commercial borrowings. Over USD 10,000 million in new International Sovereign Bonds at high interest that were taken between 2015 and 2019 broke the economy.\n\nThe truth is an explosive mixture of domestic and international issues brought Gotabaya Rajapaksa's government under pressure. The operation got underway within a week after Gotabaya Rajapaksa won the 2019 presidential election with the Swiss Embassy, in Colombo, staging the Garnier Francis drama that even captured the attention of the New York Times.\n\nThe swift and decisive exposure of the Swiss and their local counterparts should have alerted the Gotabaya Rajapaksa administration. Unfortunately, the powers that be caused a catastrophic situation by a series of ill-fated decisions. The Covid-19 pandemic made the situation far worse, coupled with unprecedented tax cuts, including pruning of Value Added Tax (VAT) from 15% to 8%, crippled the national economy. Who really advised President Gotabaya Rajapaksa not to reverse the decisions in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis? Or was it his pure stubbornness, coming from a military background?\n\nThe entire Cabinet-of-Ministers should be held responsible for the outrageous decision to do away with taxes at a time the country was experiencing severe economic difficulties. In fact, Sri Lanka effected tax cuts, regardless of specific warning issued by the IMF. No less than incumbent Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe exposed the guilty lot when he appeared before a parliamentary watchdog committee in May 2022.\n\nThe arrival of a ship-load of allegedly toxic Chinese fertiliser, in the wake of a sudden decision to stop all chemical fertiliser imports in May 2021, Sri Lanka's refusal to accept the consignment that led to a diplomatic tussle and the blacklisting of a State-owned bank, unsettled the country. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa made the ill-fated announcement as regards the ban on chemical fertiliser on April 22, 2021, at the President's House. The President was flanked by Presidential Secretary Dr. P. B. Jayasundera, Senior Presidential Advisor Lalith Weeratunga and Finance Secretary S.R. Attygalle.\n\nThe sugar tax scam, too, contributed to the government's downfall. Regardless of the relentless media attacks, and with the Opposition taking it up both in and outside Parliament, the government conveniently turned a blind eye as it would have been their way of paying back their election financiers.\n\nUntil the announcement of the Presidential Polls results, the impact of Aragalaya wouldn't be known. Those who had really suffered as a result of the economic-political-social crisis caused in 2022 are likely to be the easiest to manipulate though public and private sector workers and their families are expected to reflect their discontent with the system.\n\nIt would be prudent to examine how the ex-military and police, as well as the serving officers and men, respond to political campaigns. The JJB and SJB are engaged in a fierce contest for those votes, with both making headway. The SJB appears to have consolidated its campaign meant to attract ex-military and serving officers and men in the face of JJB making early gains. Both parties seemed to be quite cleverly exploiting the 'military vote' bank as other contenders (Wickremesinghe and SLPP) lacked a cohesive strategy to entice them.\n\nYahapalana Army Chief General Mahesh Senanayake, one of the unsuccessful candidates at the 2019 presidential election, has joined the SJB campaign. Senanayake polled just over 49,000 votes and was placed fourth on the list of candidates. Gotabaya Rajapaksa polled 6,924,255 votes (52.25%) whereas Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake obtained 5,564,239 (41.99%) and 418,553 (3.16%), respectively. Senanayake polled a paltry 49,655 (0.37%).\n\nPast Presidential Polls\n\nField Marshal Sarath Fonseka on Monday (05) declared his intention to join the presidential fray by paying the stipulated deposit. There had never been so many prominent candidates at any previous presidential polls and the contest was always between two major political groups. However, the entry of several prominent candidates may cause quite disturbing impact on the electorate and may impede the contestant polling the highest number of votes reaching 51% of the votes cast.\n\nThe war-winning Army Chief suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of Mahinda Rajapaksa at the 2010 presidential election. Fonseka, in spite of being backed by the UNP-led coalition that included the JVP, TNA, SLMC, and out rightly supported by Western interests, led by the US, was trounced by Mahinda Rajapaksa. Fonseka lost by a staggering 1.8 mn votes and was abandoned by the UNP. The rest is history.\n\nAt the first presidential election held on Oct 20, 1982 there were six candidates. J. R. Jayewardene (UNP) 3,450,811 (52.91%), Hector Kobbekaduwa (SLFP) 2,548,438 (39.07%), Rohana Wijeweera (JVP) 273,428 (4.19%), Kumar Ponnambalam (ACTC) 173,934 (2.67%), Colvin R. de Silva (LSSP) 58,531 (0.90%) and Vasudeva Nanayakkara (NSSP) 17,005 (0.26%).\n\nOf them, only Vasudeva Nanayakkara, now 85, represents the current Parliament (SLPP Ratnapura District) and the one-time LSSP/NSSP firebrand is unlikely to contest the next general election.\n\nClose on the heels of the presidential election victory, JRJ, in a disgraceful bid to consolidate power in Parliament, staged a rigged national referendum on December 22, 1982, using state resources to the maximum. The referendum gave JRJ the opportunity to extend the life of Parliament by six years, thereby thwarted the possibility of losing his party UNP's massive (5/6) supermajority in Parliament that it secured in 1977.\n\nThe second presidential election was held on December 19, 1988, amidst countrywide violence with the Indian Army deployed in the Northern and Eastern provinces in terms of the Indo-Lanka accord signed on July 29, 1987. The South was on fire with the JVP-led insurgency in full swing. There had been only three candidates with both the UNP and SLFP in the fray. Ranasinghe Premadasa (UNP) won the contest by polling 2,569,199 (50.43%), Sirimavo Bandaranaike (SLFP) obtained 2,289,86 (44.95%) and Ossie Abeygunasekera (Sri Lanka Mahajana Pakshaya) 235,719 (4.63%).\n\nBy the time Sri Lanka went for its third presidential election, on November 09, 1994, the SLFP had been transformed to People's Alliance (PA) and was able to bring the 17-year-old UNP reign to an end. There had been six contestants again with Srima Dissanayake replacing her assassinated husband Gamini Dissanayake. The LTTE, in an obvious bid to manipulate and influence the electorate, assassinated Dissanayake at a public rally at Thotalanga on the night of October 23, 1994.\n\nPA candidate Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga polled 4,709,205 (62.28%), Srima Dissanayake (UNP) 2,715,283 (35.91%), Hudson Samarasinghe (Independent) 58,886 (0.78%), Harischandra Wijayatunga (Sinhalaye Mahasammatha Bhoomiputra Pakshaya) 32,651 (0.43%), A. J. Ranasinghe (Independent) 22,752 (0.30%) and Nihal Galappaththi (Sri Lanka Progressive Front) 22,749 (0.30%).\n\nThe fourth presidential poll was again marred by unprecedented violence. The LTTE made an abortive bid to assassinate PA candidate Kumaratunga on December 19, 1999, just two days before the election, in Colombo, while another suicide attack claimed the life of former Army Chief of Staff Lakshman Algama campaigning for UNP candidate Ranil Wickremesinghe. Altogether there had been 13 candidates with interested parties fielding proxies.\n\nChandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga (PA) polled 4,312,157 (51.12%), Ranil Wickremasinghe (UNP) 3,602,743 ( 42.71%), Nandana Gunathilake (JVP) 344,173 (4.08%), Harischandra Wijayatunga (Sinhalaye Mahasammatha Bhoomiputra Pakshaya) 35,854 (0.43%), W.V.M. Ranjith (Independent) 27,052 ( 0.32%), Rajiva Wijesinha (Liberal Party) 25,085 ( (0.30%), Vasudeva Nanayakkara (Left & Democratic Alliance) 23,668 ( 0.28%), Tennyson Edirisuriya (Independent) 21,119 (0.25%), Abdul Rasool (Sri Lanka Muslim Party) 17,359 (0.21%), Kamal Karunadasa (People's Liberation Solidarity Front) 11,333 (0.13%), Hudson Samarasinghe (Independent) 7,184 (0.09%), Ariyawansa Dissanayaka (Democratic United National Front) 4,039 (0.05%) and A. W. Premawardhana (Bahujana Nidahas Peramuna) 3,983 (0.05%).\n\nThe fifth presidential election held on November 17, 2005, was called amidst increased threat posed by the LTTE. Against the backdrop of the assassination of Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, the war seemed imminent and unavoidable. Like the previous election, there had been 13 candidates. Initially, there had been serious doubts whether the election would be held at all. As incumbent President Kumaratunga had called the 1999 election one year ahead of schedule, she asserted and argued that the extra year should be appended to her second term. The Supreme Court rejected her move and the election went ahead.\n\nMahinda Rajapaksa (UPFA) won by polling 4,887,152 (50.29%), Ranil Wickremesinghe (UNP) 4,706,366 (48.43%), Siritunga Jayasuriya (United Socialist Party) 35,425 ( 0.36%), A. A. Suraweera (National Development Front) 31,238 (0.32%), Victor Hettigoda (United Lanka People's Party) 14,458 (0.15%), Chamil Jayaneththi (New Left Front ) 9,296 (0.10%), Aruna de Soyza (Ruhuna People's Party) 7,685 (0.08%), Wimal Geeganage (Sri Lanka National Front) 6,639 (0.07%), Anura de Silva (United Lalith Front) 6,357 (0.07%), Ajith Arachchige, (Democratic Unity Alliance) 5,082 (0.05%), Wije Dias Socialist Equality Party 3,500 (0.04%), Nelson Perera (Sri Lanka Progressive Front) 2,525 (0.03%) and Hewaheenipellage Dharmadwaja (United National Alternative Front) 1,316 (0.01%).\n\nHowever, the sixth presidential election, conducted on January 26, 2010, saw proxies and some seeking to attract limelight (at the previous elections, too, there had been some joining the fray for their own sake). In the absence of any sort of restrictions /safeguards, 22 contested the first presidential poll after the eradication of the LTTE. Mahinda Rajapaksa polled a staggering 6,015,934 (57.88%) to beat General Sarath Fonseka who managed to secure 4,173,185 (40.15%).\n\nAt the 2015 presidential that had been convincingly won by Maithripala Sirisena (New Democratic Front) by polling 6,217,162 (51.28%) there were 19 candidates. Mahinda Rajapaksa, who enacted 18th Amendment to enable him to contest, managed to get 5,768,090 (47.58%).\n\nThe last presidential election saw a record number of contestants with, for the first time, the number on the ballot paper passing the 30 mark. The election, handsomely won by Gotabaya Rajapaksa, was contested by 35.\n\nOf them, only Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Sajith Premadasa polled more than 500,000 votes. Anura Kumara Dissanayake polled over 400,000 and the rest polled less than 50,000, ranging from 900 to 49,000.\n\nThe forthcoming presidential poll that'll decide Sri Lanka's fate depends on its outcome and the workable agenda for a bankrupt country.\n\nExternal interventions will play a crucial role in the election with geopolitics being a key factor in post-Aragalaya Sri Lanka. Two major parties involved in the Aragalaya - the JVP-led JJB and Jana Aragala Sandhanaya that fields lawyer Nuwan Bopage should attract public attention as the importance of their strategic role cannot be underestimated.\n\n****\n\nThe longest serving Premier of Bangladesh Sheihk Hasina, of the Awami League party, was forced to resign on Monday in the face of a mounting wave of protests and counter action by her government that killed nearly 300 people since mid-July. She took refuge in India after fleeing aboard a Bangladesh Air Force C 130.\n\nThe relatively new country Bangladesh was created in 1971 following a successful rebellion against high handed Pakistani rule over Bengalis in the then East Pakistan, launched by her late father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman after Islamabad refused to recognize his popular election victory with predominantly Bengali votes of East Pakistan and jailed by the then rulers.\n\nMost unfortunately Sheikh Mujibur Rahman himself was killed by disgruntled elements in his own Army, along with his entire family, barring Hasina and her sister Rezhana during a subsequent coup in August 1975.\n\nMany compared the 76-year-old leader's ouster with the forcing out of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa following a similar protest campaign alleged to have been backed by the US. Rajapaksa resigned though India advised him against doing so.\n\nOver two years after Rajapaksa's ouster the circumstances leading to his ouster remained uninvestigated and unexamined. The role of the Muslim community as a whole in Rajapaksa's ouster in the wake of the Easter Sunday repercussions and cremation of Covid-19 victims, as well as the Catholic Church interventions, remained to be properly examined. Perhaps, against the backdrop of Hasina's ouster, Sri Lanka can take a fresh look at the Aragalaya as well as post-Aragalaya issues.", "source": {"uri": "island.lk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP/145 seats), Samagi Jana Balwegaya (SJB/54), Illankai Thamil Arasu Kadchi (ITAK/10), Jathika Jana Balawegaya (JJB/03), Eelam People's Democratic Party (EPDP/02), Ahila Ilankai Thamil Congress (AITC/02) and the remaining nine parties, namely Thamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal (TMVP), Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), Muslim National Alliance (MNA), Thamil Makkal Thesiya Kuttani (TMTK), All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC), National Congress (NC), Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), United National Party (UNP) and Our Power of People Party (OPPP) secured one seat each.\n\nThe number of seats mentioned above included National List slots. Of the 29 NL slots, the SLPP secured 17 and the SJB 07 whereas five other parties-ITAK, JJB, AITC, UNP and OPPP obtained one each.\n\nHowever, the SLPP has been fragmented to such an extent and in disarray, the party faces a catastrophic situation. The Rajapaksas-led SLPP that handsomely won the last Local Government polls (Feb. 2018), Presidential Polls (Nov. 2019) and the General Election (Aug. 2020) is approaching a real moment of truth. In spite of the likes of its National Organizer Namal Rajapaksa, Johnston Fernando and retired Navy Chief of Staff Sarath Weerasekera continuing to put on a brave face, the ground situation is deteriorating rapidly and the party seems to be in dire straits.\n\nThe failure on the part of the ruling party to name its presidential candidate, ahead of President Ranil Wickremesinghe's declaration of him as an independent candidate, exposed the SLPP badly.\n\nThe SLPP has repeatedly assured that its candidate would be disclosed today (07). Business tycoon Dhammika Perera, who had been accommodated in the SLPP National List, in June 2022, in place of Basil Rajapaksa, is widely believed to be their choice. Newcomer Perera, who served as Investment Promotion Minister during Gotabaya Rajapaksa's presidency (June-July 2022), faces a daunting challenge in obtaining a respectable final count if the former people's president Mahinda Rajapaksa, too, has been abandoned by his ardent supporters.\n\nLawmaker Namal Rajapaksa seems still confident that their candidate Dhammika Perera, or a last minute change, could still win the presidential race. With the SLPP's backing, wartime Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who had absolutely no experience in politics, secured a staggering 6.9 mn at the last presidential poll. With the original SLPP parliamentary group divided among presidential candidates, UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, SJB leader Sajith Premadasa, MJP leader Dilith Jayaweera and yet to be named SLPP contestant, in terms of numbers, the incumbent President seems to be in the lead. But that could be a grave mistake on the part of the Wickremesinghe's camp. The number of turncoats does not necessarily mean voters will follow especially because of undying loyalty professed by many to ex-President Mahinda. Even after he was trounced at the January 2015 presidential election and he silently withdrew into his Medamulana abode, it was the ordinary Sinhala masses having realized the anti-national frauds who were elected to replace Rajapaksas, went in their hundreds, if not thousands, daily, as if in pilgrimage, to plead with him to return to national politics. What would have swayed the masses was his natural appeal in his ability to interact with them. He was one leader who made Temple Trees an open house for ordinary people to come and have a meal at their leader's palace, at least on Wesak days each year. He actually showed his mettle to not only to our masses, but to the whole world when he literally told a delegation of powerful entities from the West, like then British Foreign Secretary David Miliband and French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner, to get lost when they tried to arm twist him into saving terrorist numero uno Velupillai Prabhakaran and his band as they were facing total annihilation in Wanni in 2009.\n\nThe SLPP appears to be confident that the voters wouldn't go along with those who had treacherously pledged their support to Wickremesinghe, Premadasa and Dilith Jayaweera at the expense of the party they represented in Parliament. Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, PC, another SLPP MP, is in the fray as the candidate of the National Democratic Front (NDF). Former Justice Minister Rajapakshe is unlikely to attract any sitting MPs representing the SLPP or any other party. He must be relying on his sizeable caste vote to make a strong showing rather than an actual victory.\n\nImpact of Aragalaya on voters\n\nIn the absence of proper examination of the events leading to Aragalaya, or change of government through unconstitutional means in July 2022, the SLPP or any other political party represented in Parliament lacked understanding of the ground situation. Therefore, political parties face the first national election in less than 50 days without proper comprehension of the developing situation and the forces working behind the scene.\n\nInstead of seeking political advantage, political parties, represented in Parliament, should have sought to examine the circumstances leading to the eruption of the violent public protest campaign outside President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's residence at Pangiriwatte, Mirihana, on the night of March 31, 2022. Even though the US definitely wanted to oust Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the global power couldn't have achieved its objectives without the SLPP's unintentional or deliberately flawed decisions contributing to the crisis with economic hitmen working within.\n\nThe SLPP parliamentary group cannot absolve itself of the responsibility for the ruination of the economy. Similarly, the UNP and SJB, under any circumstances, cannot deny their culpability for the massive Treasury bond scams perpetrated by the Yahapalana regime in 2015 (February) and 2016 (March) under the then Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe's watch and still unexplained commercial borrowings. Over USD 10,000 million in new International Sovereign Bonds at high interest that were taken between 2015 and 2019 broke the economy.\n\nThe truth is an explosive mixture of domestic and international issues brought Gotabaya Rajapaksa's government under pressure. The operation got underway within a week after Gotabaya Rajapaksa won the 2019 presidential election with the Swiss Embassy, in Colombo, staging the Garnier Francis drama that even captured the attention of the New York Times.\n\nThe swift and decisive exposure of the Swiss and their local counterparts should have alerted the Gotabaya Rajapaksa administration. Unfortunately, the powers that be caused a catastrophic situation by a series of ill-fated decisions. The Covid-19 pandemic made the situation far worse, coupled with unprecedented tax cuts, including pruning of Value Added Tax (VAT) from 15% to 8%, crippled the national economy. Who really advised President Gotabaya Rajapaksa not to reverse the decisions in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis? Or was it his pure stubbornness, coming from a military background?\n\nThe entire Cabinet-of-Ministers should be held responsible for the outrageous decision to do away with taxes at a time the country was experiencing severe economic difficulties. In fact, Sri Lanka effected tax cuts, regardless of specific warning issued by the IMF. No less than incumbent Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe exposed the guilty lot when he appeared before a parliamentary watchdog committee in May 2022.\n\nThe arrival of a ship-load of allegedly toxic Chinese fertiliser, in the wake of a sudden decision to stop all chemical fertiliser imports in May 2021, Sri Lanka's refusal to accept the consignment that led to a diplomatic tussle and the blacklisting of a State-owned bank, unsettled the country. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa made the ill-fated announcement as regards the ban on chemical fertiliser on April 22, 2021, at the President's House. The President was flanked by Presidential Secretary Dr. P. B. Jayasundera, Senior Presidential Advisor Lalith Weeratunga and Finance Secretary S.R. Attygalle.\n\nThe sugar tax scam, too, contributed to the government's downfall. Regardless of the relentless media attacks, and with the Opposition taking it up both in and outside Parliament, the government conveniently turned a blind eye as it would have been their way of paying back their election financiers.\n\nUntil the announcement of the Presidential Polls results, the impact of Aragalaya wouldn't be known. Those who had really suffered as a result of the economic-political-social crisis caused in 2022 are likely to be the easiest to manipulate though public and private sector workers and their families are expected to reflect their discontent with the system.\n\nIt would be prudent to examine how the ex-military and police, as well as the serving officers and men, respond to political campaigns. The JJB and SJB are engaged in a fierce contest for those votes, with both making headway. The SJB appears to have consolidated its campaign meant to attract ex-military and serving officers and men in the face of JJB making early gains. Both parties seemed to be quite cleverly exploiting the 'military vote' bank as other contenders (Wickremesinghe and SLPP) lacked a cohesive strategy to entice them.\n\nYahapalana Army Chief General Mahesh Senanayake, one of the unsuccessful candidates at the 2019 presidential election, has joined the SJB campaign. Senanayake polled just over 49,000 votes and was placed fourth on the list of candidates. Gotabaya Rajapaksa polled 6,924,255 votes (52.25%) whereas Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake obtained 5,564,239 (41.99%) and 418,553 (3.16%), respectively. Senanayake polled a paltry 49,655 (0.37%).\n\nPast Presidential Polls\n\nField Marshal Sarath Fonseka on Monday (05) declared his intention to join the presidential fray by paying the stipulated deposit. There had never been so many prominent candidates at any previous presidential polls and the contest was always between two major political groups. However, the entry of several prominent candidates may cause quite disturbing impact on the electorate and may impede the contestant polling the highest number of votes reaching 51% of the votes cast.\n\nThe war-winning Army Chief suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of Mahinda Rajapaksa at the 2010 presidential election. Fonseka, in spite of being backed by the UNP-led coalition that included the JVP, TNA, SLMC, and out rightly supported by Western interests, led by the US, was trounced by Mahinda Rajapaksa. Fonseka lost by a staggering 1.8 mn votes and was abandoned by the UNP. The rest is history.\n\nAt the first presidential election held on Oct 20, 1982 there were six candidates. J. R. Jayewardene (UNP) 3,450,811 (52.91%), Hector Kobbekaduwa (SLFP) 2,548,438 (39.07%), Rohana Wijeweera (JVP) 273,428 (4.19%), Kumar Ponnambalam (ACTC) 173,934 (2.67%), Colvin R. de Silva (LSSP) 58,531 (0.90%) and Vasudeva Nanayakkara (NSSP) 17,005 (0.26%).\n\nOf them, only Vasudeva Nanayakkara, now 85, represents the current Parliament (SLPP Ratnapura District) and the one-time LSSP/NSSP firebrand is unlikely to contest the next general election.\n\nClose on the heels of the presidential election victory, JRJ, in a disgraceful bid to consolidate power in Parliament, staged a rigged national referendum on December 22, 1982, using state resources to the maximum. The referendum gave JRJ the opportunity to extend the life of Parliament by six years, thereby thwarted the possibility of losing his party UNP's massive (5/6) supermajority in Parliament that it secured in 1977.\n\nThe second presidential election was held on December 19, 1988, amidst countrywide violence with the Indian Army deployed in the Northern and Eastern provinces in terms of the Indo-Lanka accord signed on July 29, 1987. The South was on fire with the JVP-led insurgency in full swing. There had been only three candidates with both the UNP and SLFP in the fray. Ranasinghe Premadasa (UNP) won the contest by polling 2,569,199 (50.43%), Sirimavo Bandaranaike (SLFP) obtained 2,289,86 (44.95%) and Ossie Abeygunasekera (Sri Lanka Mahajana Pakshaya) 235,719 (4.63%).\n\nBy the time Sri Lanka went for its third presidential election, on November 09, 1994, the SLFP had been transformed to People's Alliance (PA) and was able to bring the 17-year-old UNP reign to an end. There had been six contestants again with Srima Dissanayake replacing her assassinated husband Gamini Dissanayake. The LTTE, in an obvious bid to manipulate and influence the electorate, assassinated Dissanayake at a public rally at Thotalanga on the night of October 23, 1994.\n\nPA candidate Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga polled 4,709,205 (62.28%), Srima Dissanayake (UNP) 2,715,283 (35.91%), Hudson Samarasinghe (Independent) 58,886 (0.78%), Harischandra Wijayatunga (Sinhalaye Mahasammatha Bhoomiputra Pakshaya) 32,651 (0.43%), A. J. Ranasinghe (Independent) 22,752 (0.30%) and Nihal Galappaththi (Sri Lanka Progressive Front) 22,749 (0.30%).\n\nThe fourth presidential poll was again marred by unprecedented violence. The LTTE made an abortive bid to assassinate PA candidate Kumaratunga on December 19, 1999, just two days before the election, in Colombo, while another suicide attack claimed the life of former Army Chief of Staff Lakshman Algama campaigning for UNP candidate Ranil Wickremesinghe. Altogether there had been 13 candidates with interested parties fielding proxies.\n\nChandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga (PA) polled 4,312,157 (51.12%), Ranil Wickremasinghe (UNP) 3,602,743 ( 42.71%), Nandana Gunathilake (JVP) 344,173 (4.08%), Harischandra Wijayatunga (Sinhalaye Mahasammatha Bhoomiputra Pakshaya) 35,854 (0.43%), W.V.M. Ranjith (Independent) 27,052 ( 0.32%), Rajiva Wijesinha (Liberal Party) 25,085 ( (0.30%), Vasudeva Nanayakkara (Left & Democratic Alliance) 23,668 ( 0.28%), Tennyson Edirisuriya (Independent) 21,119 (0.25%), Abdul Rasool (Sri Lanka Muslim Party) 17,359 (0.21%), Kamal Karunadasa (People's Liberation Solidarity Front) 11,333 (0.13%), Hudson Samarasinghe (Independent) 7,184 (0.09%), Ariyawansa Dissanayaka (Democratic United National Front) 4,039 (0.05%) and A. W. Premawardhana (Bahujana Nidahas Peramuna) 3,983 (0.05%).\n\nThe fifth presidential election held on November 17, 2005, was called amidst increased threat posed by the LTTE. Against the backdrop of the assassination of Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, the war seemed imminent and unavoidable. Like the previous election, there had been 13 candidates. Initially, there had been serious doubts whether the election would be held at all. As incumbent President Kumaratunga had called the 1999 election one year ahead of schedule, she asserted and argued that the extra year should be appended to her second term. The Supreme Court rejected her move and the election went ahead.\n\nMahinda Rajapaksa (UPFA) won by polling 4,887,152 (50.29%), Ranil Wickremesinghe (UNP) 4,706,366 (48.43%), Siritunga Jayasuriya (United Socialist Party) 35,425 ( 0.36%), A. A. Suraweera (National Development Front) 31,238 (0.32%), Victor Hettigoda (United Lanka People's Party) 14,458 (0.15%), Chamil Jayaneththi (New Left Front ) 9,296 (0.10%), Aruna de Soyza (Ruhuna People's Party) 7,685 (0.08%), Wimal Geeganage (Sri Lanka National Front) 6,639 (0.07%), Anura de Silva (United Lalith Front) 6,357 (0.07%), Ajith Arachchige, (Democratic Unity Alliance) 5,082 (0.05%), Wije Dias Socialist Equality Party 3,500 (0.04%), Nelson Perera (Sri Lanka Progressive Front) 2,525 (0.03%) and Hewaheenipellage Dharmadwaja (United National Alternative Front) 1,316 (0.01%).\n\nHowever, the sixth presidential election, conducted on January 26, 2010, saw proxies and some seeking to attract limelight (at the previous elections, too, there had been some joining the fray for their own sake). In the absence of any sort of restrictions /safeguards, 22 contested the first presidential poll after the eradication of the LTTE. Mahinda Rajapaksa polled a staggering 6,015,934 (57.88%) to beat General Sarath Fonseka who managed to secure 4,173,185 (40.15%).\n\nAt the 2015 presidential that had been convincingly won by Maithripala Sirisena (New Democratic Front) by polling 6,217,162 (51.28%) there were 19 candidates. Mahinda Rajapaksa, who enacted 18th Amendment to enable him to contest, managed to get 5,768,090 (47.58%).\n\nThe last presidential election saw a record number of contestants with, for the first time, the number on the ballot paper passing the 30 mark. The election, handsomely won by Gotabaya Rajapaksa, was contested by 35.\n\nOf them, only Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Sajith Premadasa polled more than 500,000 votes. Anura Kumara Dissanayake polled over 400,000 and the rest polled less than 50,000, ranging from 900 to 49,000.\n\nThe forthcoming presidential poll that'll decide Sri Lanka's fate depends on its outcome and the workable agenda for a bankrupt country.\n\nExternal interventions will play a crucial role in the election with geopolitics being a key factor in post-Aragalaya Sri Lanka. Two major parties involved in the Aragalaya - the JVP-led JJB and Jana Aragala Sandhanaya that fields lawyer Nuwan Bopage should attract public attention as the importance of their strategic role cannot be underestimated.\n\n****\n\nThe longest serving Premier of Bangladesh Sheihk Hasina, of the Awami League party, was forced to resign on Monday in the face of a mounting wave of protests and counter action by her government that killed nearly 300 people since mid-July. She took refuge in India after fleeing aboard a Bangladesh Air Force C 130.\n\nThe relatively new country Bangladesh was created in 1971 following a successful rebellion against high handed Pakistani rule over Bengalis in the then East Pakistan, launched by her late father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman after Islamabad refused to recognize his popular election victory with predominantly Bengali votes of East Pakistan and jailed by the then rulers.\n\nMost unfortunately Sheikh Mujibur Rahman himself was killed by disgruntled elements in his own Army, along with his entire family, barring Hasina and her sister Rezhana during a subsequent coup in August 1975.\n\nMany compared the 76-year-old leader's ouster with the forcing out of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa following a similar protest campaign alleged to have been backed by the US. Rajapaksa resigned though India advised him against doing so.\n\nOver two years after Rajapaksa's ouster the circumstances leading to his ouster remained uninvestigated and unexamined. The role of the Muslim community as a whole in Rajapaksa's ouster in the wake of the Easter Sunday repercussions and cremation of Covid-19 victims, as well as the Catholic Church interventions, remained to be properly examined. Perhaps, against the backdrop of Hasina's ouster, Sri Lanka can take a fresh look at the Aragalaya as well as post-Aragalaya issues.", "source": {"uri": "island.lk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Besides, President Wickremesinghe, the main opposition leader Sajith Premadasa and the Marxist JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake are already in the fray.\n\nThe Rajapaksas - Mahinda, Basil and Gotabaya - were instrumental in Wickremesinghe winning the parliamentary vote in July 2022 to take over Gotabaya's remaining term.\n\nIt was soon after the unprecedented development of mid-April 2022 when the island nation declared its first-ever sovereign default since gaining independence from Britain in 1948 and almost civil war-like conditions followed as unrest spread amid locals over inflation and other economic stress that had led to Gotabaya's ouster.\n\nWednesday's development comes days after the SLPP lost nearly 100 of its MPs to Wickremesinghe after he announced his candidature as an independent.\n\nThose MPs have condemned their party's decision to ditch Wickremesinghe but the SLPP, in turn, has vowed disciplinary action against those who back Wickremesinghe, defying the party decision.\n\nNamal was a late decision from the party.

The party, which leads the government coalition, had supported the incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe in the current term.\n\n\"Victory for Namal is guaranteed because he possesses local values, understands the aspirations of the people, and can face up to challenges,\" said party general secretary Sagara Kariyawasam after announcing the candidacy.\n\nThe national vote on Sept. 21 will be the first for the country after a historic debt default in May 2022 that saw living standards plummet and widespread unrest, forcing Namal's uncle Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country and resign. Namal's participation in the presidential election signals the Rajapaksa clan is trying to re-consolidate power among the country's Buddhist majority.\n\nThe former sports minister will run against Wickremesinghe, main opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, and Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who is backed by the socialist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna party. Nearly 20 candidates have so far placed deposits at Sri Lanka's Election Commission to contest the polls, for which the nominations are due on Aug. 15.\n\nNamal's father Mahinda Rajapaksa, whose decade in power saw the end of Sri Lanka's ethnic war, and uncle Basil Rajapaksa, a former finance minister, attended Wednesday's event at the party headquarters. Supporters held prayers and cheered the announcement. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, however, wasn't present at the celebrations, suggesting some friction within the clan.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg News in 2022, Namal said that while his uncle's government had inherited a bad economy from the previous administration, it also made some key policy errors and failed to pivot quickly when the pandemic hit.\n\nWickremesinghe, 75, who took the presidency through a parliament vote, is standing as an independent candidate. He's won endorsement from some members of the SLPP, who have been part of his cabinet that oversaw a recovery of the economy and backed a $3 billion International Monetary Fund bailout package.\n\nWickremesinghe is campaigning on a platform of continuing reforms in order to tap more funds and sustain growth, while Premadasa has said revisions need to be made in tax measures and debt restructuring that's part of the IMF program.\n\nDissanayake has won support amid a campaign for equitability of growth and elimination of corruption.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

It is reported that Rajapaksa will be nominated for the top position as the Casino King Dhammika Perera pulled out.\n\nRajapaksa, 38, is the youngest candidate in this election. If won, he would emerge as the youngest president of Sri Lanka.\n\nWho is Namal Rajapaksa?\n\nEldest son of country's former president and prime minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, he has graduated with a Law degree City University London. He later joined Sri Lanka Law College to qualify as an attorney at law.\n\nNamal married Limini Weerasinghe in 2019 and have two children.\n\nNamal contested the 2010 parliamentary election as one of the United People's Freedom Alliance's candidates in Hambantota District and was elected to Parliament. Mahinda was an MP from Hambantota for 16 years before becoming President in 2005.\n\nHe was re-elected as an MP in 2015 and 2020. In 2020, he served as the Minister of Youth and Sports in the government. However, he resigned during the mass resignation of the Second Gotabaya Rajapaksa Cabinet. He was appointed as the National Organiser of the SLPP in March 20204.\n\nEarlier in January this year, Namal paid a visit to Ayodhya's Ram Janmabhoomi Temple.

This will be the first election to be held in Sri Lanka after it plunged into economic bankruptcy in 2022.\n\nSri Lanka Economic Crisis:\n\nYears of economic mismanagement culminated in a major economic crisis in 2022. It led to a foreign currency shortage, making it difficult for the Sri Lankan government to pay for the import of basic items like oil. IMF and other countries, including India offered multiple aids and multiple occasions.\n\nGotabaya Rajapaksa was forced into temporary exile after protesters stormed his official residence in 2022, following months of street protests over the island nation's worst-ever economic crisis.\n\nFormer PM Ranil Wickremesinghe assumed the power as the acting President following Rajapaksa's resignation. He was then selected as the President by the Sri Lankan Parliament. In two years, the country has attempted to strike loan deals with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and countries like India and China.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news",

He told ANI, \"With the 'Pran Pratishtha' of Lord Ram, the old glory has been restored to the original birthplace of the deity.\"\n\nIn 2016, he made headlines when he was arrested on suspicion of money laundering.\n\nAccording to the BBC, he allegedly laundered 45 million Sri Lankan rupees (~Rs 1.25 crore) through two firms: NR Projects and Aspen.\n\nThe arrest came after Sri Lankan Nimal Perera confessed to collecting money for Namal.\n\nAs per a 2022 Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) investigation, Namal was accused of receiving millions of rupees in payoffs from Australian medical firm Aspen, which had no experience in large-scale healthcare projects.\n\nThe investigation claimed that the first transaction was worth 1.4 million euros (~Rs 12.83 crore) to a \"mysterious\" company named Sabre Vision Holdings in the British Virgin Islands, which was \"secretly owned\" by Perera, who was close to the Rajapaksa family.\n\nIn the same year, the opposition Janatha Vimukhti Peramuna (JVP) party further alleged payoffs made in construction projects involving Namal.\n\nAccording to The Print, the party said that Perera's Sabre Vision had received 4.33 million euros (~Rs 39.68 crore) from NR Projects and another US$555,000 (~Rs 4.65 crore) from Aspen, which were then routed to an account held by Namal.\n\nAt the time, Perera tweeted, \"Sabre Vision Holdings was a subsidiary of a diversified business entity founded in 1918 in Sri Lanka, and not owned by me.\"\n\nAccording to the BBC, in 2016, several members of the powerful Rajapaksa family were under investigation over alleged corruption.\n\nNamal's brother Yoshitha was accused of money laundering, while Mahinda's brother and former Economic Development Minister, Basil, was arrested three times over suspected misuse of funds and money laundering.\n\nNamal had denied the allegations, saying that he and his family had \"no clue\" about the two companies.\n\nYears of economic mismanagement combined with fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and 2019 terrorist attacks that devastated its important tourism industry, culminated in a major economic crisis in 2022.\n\nAdditionally, the then-government slashed taxes in 2019, depleting the treasury just as the virus hit. Foreign exchange reserves plummeted, leaving Sri Lanka unable to pay for imports or defend its stressed currency.\n\nThe island nation later declared bankruptcy and suspended repayments on some $83 billion in domestic and foreign loans.\n\nThis followed a severe foreign exchange crisis that led to a severe shortage of essentials such as food, medicine, fuel and cooking gas, and extended power outages.\n\nSri Lanka's economic upheaval led to a political crisis that forced then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to resign in 2022.\n\nGotabaya was forced into temporary exile after protesters stormed his official residence, following months of street protests over the island nation's worst-ever economic crisis.\n\nLater, former PM Ranil Wickremesinghe assumed power as acting president. He was then selected as president by the Parliament.\n\nUnder Wickremesinghe, Sri Lanka has been negotiating with international creditors to restructure the staggering debts and put the economy back on track. The IMF also approved a four-year bailout programme last March to help the island nation.\n\nLast month, Wickremesinghe announced that his government has struck a debt restructuring deal with countries including India, France, Japan and China, marking a key step in the country's economic recovery after defaulting on debt repayment in 2022, as per The Associated Press.\n\nUnder the agreements with its creditors, the cash-strapped country will be able to defer all bilateral loan installment payments until 2028.\n\nFurthermore, the neighbouring country will be able to repay all the loans on concessional terms, with an extended period until 2043. The agreements would cover $10 billion of debt.\n\nBy 2022, Sri Lanka had to repay about $6 billion in foreign debt every year, amounting to about 9.2 per cent of gross domestic product.\n\nThe agreement would enable Sri Lanka to maintain debt payments at less than 4.5 per cent of GDP between 2027 and 2032.\n\nSri Lanka presidential election\n\nThe neighbourhood will hold the presidential poll on September 21, a race that will likely determine the future of economic reforms in the country.\n\nIt will be the first election in the South Asian island nation after it plunged into economic bankruptcy in 2022.\n\nThe date was announced by the independent elections commission on Friday, July 26, which said nominations will be accepted on August 15.\n\nWickremesinghe is expected to run, while his main rivals will be his one-time party colleague Sajith Premadasa, who founded the political alliance Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) and Anura Dissanayake, who is the leader of the leftist political JVP party.\n\nWickremesinghe had contested two presidential elections and lost both. However, he had been prime minister six times since entering parliament in 1977.\n\nThe entry of a Rajapaksa into the fray formalised a widening split in the government ahead of the election.\n\nAccording to AFP, a majority of legislators from the SLPP had wanted the party to back their new ally, President Wickremesinghe, after praising him for turning the economy around after the economic crisis.\n\nThough the president is not from the SLPP, the SLPP backed him after Gotabaya fled his own country.\n\nDespite its downfall, the SLPP enjoyed a majority in the 225-member parliament, controlled the government, and supported Wickremesinghe.\n\nHowever, the parting of ways began when the election was called last month.\n\nThat revealed the splits in the once-dominant SLPP, a nationalist party appealing to the Sinhala Buddhist majority.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The party, which leads the government coalition, had supported the incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe in the current term.\n\n\"Victory for Namal is guaranteed because he possesses local values, understands the aspirations of the people, and can face up to challenges,\" said party general secretary Sagara Kariyawasam after announcing the candidacy.\n\nThe national vote on Sept 21 will be the first for the country after a historic debt default in May 2022 that saw living standards plummet and widespread unrest, forcing Mr Namal's uncle Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country and resign. Mr Namal's participation in the presidential election signals the Rajapaksa clan is trying to re-consolidate power among the country's Buddhist majority.\n\nThe former sports minister will run against Mr Wickremesinghe, main opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, and Mr Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who is backed by the socialist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna party. Nearly 20 candidates have so far placed deposits at Sri Lanka's Election Commission to contest the polls, for which the nominations are due on Aug 15.\n\nMr Namal's father Mahinda Rajapaksa, whose decade in power saw the end of Sri Lanka's ethnic war, and uncle Basil Rajapaksa, a former finance minister, attended Aug 7's event at the party headquarters. Supporters held prayers and cheered the announcement. Mr Gotabaya Rajapaksa, however, wasn't present at the celebrations, suggesting some friction within the clan.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg News in 2022, Mr Namal said that while his uncle's government had inherited a bad economy from the previous administration, it also made some key policy errors and failed to pivot quickly when the pandemic hit.\n\nMr Wickremesinghe, 75, who took the presidency through a parliament vote, is standing as an independent candidate. He's won endorsement from some members of the SLPP, who have been part of his cabinet that oversaw a recovery of the economy and backed a US$3 billion (S$3.98 billion) International Monetary Fund bailout package.\n\nMr Wickremesinghe is campaigning on a platform of continuing reforms in order to tap more funds and sustain growth, while Mr Premadasa has said revisions need to be made in tax measures and debt restructuring that's part of the IMF program.\n\nMr Dissanayake has won support amid a campaign for equitability of growth and elimination of corruption.

But without the official backing of the party, and simmering discontent amongst its members that they haven't fielded their own candidate, reports swirled this week that Namal Rajapaksa - the son of accused war criminal Mahinda Rajapaksa.\n\nThe Rajapaksa press team sent out a series of flashy portraits of the controversial 38-year-old on Tuesday, with a potential official unveiling set to take place later this week.\n\nMeanwhile, Wickremesinghe managed to secure the support of a breakaway faction of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), one of the Sinhala South's oldest political parties and traditional rivals of his United National Party (UNP).\n\nThe SLFP had been divided into three groups with one of them being led by former president Maithripala Sirisena, who had an acrimonious split from Wickremesinghe during his tenure in government, the other led by Dayasiri Jayasekara and the central committee having the support of ministers such as Nimal Siripala, Mahinda Amaraweera and Lasantha Alagiyawanna.\n\nThe SLFP has been embroiled in internal party struggles for months with different groups putting forward their own representative.\n\nThe party offices have been under police guard in recent months, as court cases were filed between members clamouring for control of the party.\n\nWhile the infighting continued, two security guards were even reportedly held hostage at the SLFP headquarters in Colombo for five days. Earlier last week, Sri Lanka's Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa announced his resignation from his ministerial post to contest the elections on the SLFP ticket.\n\nThe support from two of Sri Lanka's main political parties bolsters Wickremesinghe's bid for the presidency with the election scheduled for September 21st this year.

The two main political parties that alternated in power in the last century, the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) are now a shadow of their former selves. Recently, a prominent political analyst humorously wrote that the UNP was the Grand Old Party, but the ' grand ' part of it is no longer valid.\n\nThe Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) formed by the Rajapaksas after they abandoned the SLFP, grew to be the most powerful political party in the country and came to power in a very short time, but it too lost its influence following the unprecedented popular uprising that ousted them two years ago.\n\nThe UNP could not win even a single seat in the last parliamentary elections except for a national list seat. The same fate would have befallen the SLFP under former President Maithripala Sirisena, if it had not contested with SLPP.\n\nThe UNP's vote bank is currently with the Samagi Jana Balawegaya ( SJB ) which was formed by the Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa four years ago after falling out with President Ranil Wickremesinghe in a battle for leadership in the UNP.\n\nThe Janatha Vimukti Peramuna (JVP ) which had a very small vote base formed an alliance called National People's Power (NPP ) is yet to be tested in an election, although its support seems to have multiplied in the South after the popular uprising.\n\nRecent opinion polls have shown that the NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake and SJB leader Sajith Premadasa are ahead in popular support.\n\nDistancing himself from his party, President Wickremesinghe is running as an independent candidate. Wickramasinghe has entered the fray relying on a broad coalition that is said to be formed under the leadership of Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena.\n\nAll Members of Parliament rallying behind the President were elected to parliament on behalf of the SLPP four years ago when the Rajapaksas' popularity was at its peak. An important question now arises as to how much support these MPs have among the people now when the Rajapaksas themselves have lost popularity.\n\nIt is the people of the country who are going to elect the new president, not the MPs.\n\nSince President Wickramasinghe could not even save his seat in Colombo district in the last parliamentary election, can an Alliance formed by enticing politicians from various parties and groups ensure him the 50 percent votes needed to win the presidential election?\n\nDespite having nearly half a century of political experience, Wickremesinghe goes to the people claiming credit for the economic restructuring measures undertaken by his government under the guidance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF ) in the last two years.\n\nThe President is entirely dependent on his economic policies to win the election. Will that be enough to bring him back to the Presidency?\n\nMany of the actions taken by his government and some of the laws passed by parliament have eroded his reputation as one of the Sri Lanka's most liberal-democratic political leaders. His recent flouting of the judgments of the highest judiciary have earned him the ire of those who believe in democratic governance.\n\nThere is also an impression that the decision taken by the Rajapaksas not to support Wickremesinghe is not detrimental to the President. If so, how can Wickramasinghe benefit from the support of the same MPs who had supported all the Rajapaksas' policies and actions that have ruined the country? The public's perception of these MPs will definitely have an impact on Wickramasinghe's chances in the election.\n\nDespite what the Rajapaksas say in public to brag that they still have big support among the people, it was widely expected that they would support Wickremesinghe in the Presidential election. But, now they have decided to field a separate candidate on behalf of their party after their attempts to secure assurances from the President that would ensure their family's interests and future political prospects proved futile.\n\nBut they are not ready to field a Rajapaksa as the candidate. They fear that if the SLPP does not contest in the Presidential election, their voter base will be scattered among other parties and that will have a negative impact on the next parliamentary elections.\n\nTo ensure the future prospects of their party, they will nominate a loyalist as their presidential candidate.\n\nThe Rajapaksas have an instinct of giving priority to their own interests above everything else. The Presidential election will surely prove what the people of the country feel about the Rajapaksas and those who stood with them.\n\nPrime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena is said to be in talks with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to reverse the decision taken by SLPP. It is difficult to guage how successful his efforts will be.\n\nAlthough it is widely believed that distancing himself from the Rajapaksas would be advantageous to President Wickremesinghe, he does not comment on the Rajapaksas' decision to abandon him.\n\nThe Rajapaksas are furious at the President's strategy to win the support of SLPP ministers and MPs by circumventing them. They accuse the President of dividing the SLPP.\n\nIncumbents trying to weaken opposition parties is nothing new in politics. The Rajapaksas did an \" excellent job of dividing the opposition during their time in power. It is Wickramesinghe who suffered the worst by that. It was one of the main reasons for his party's present pathetic situation.\n\nNow it is Wickremesinghe's turn to hit back. It is said that there are now 115 MPs, including SLPPers, in support of Wickramasinghe.\n\nMean while the decision of Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena's Mahajana Ekshath Peramuna (MEP ) to support Wickremesinghe in the Presidential election is an interesting political development. The President and Prime Minister are close friends from their school days though they are polar opposites in politics.\n\nIn politics, Gunawardena has traditionally identified himself with the anti-UNP camp and has been a fierce critic of Wickramasinghe's policies. He followed a policy of blending left-wing principles with Sinhalese nationalism.\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events after the popular uprising, he is serving as Prime Minister under Wickramasinghe's Presidency and it seems that both of them have developed a good understanding politically in the interest of their future prospects.\n\nNot only that, it is said that President's election campaign is going to be spearheaded under the leadership of Gunawardena.\n\nThe Prime Minister's father, the late Philip Gunawardena, was credited with introducing Marxism to Sri Lanka. In his final days he was a key minister in the UNP government under the late PM Dudley Senanayake whose policies were diametrically opposed to left-wing politics.\n\nSimilarly, his son has joined the ranks of the current UNP leader. Dramatic changes in the political landscape make strange bedfellows. We will see more such additions in the coming days.", "source": {"uri": "lankaweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LankaWeb.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

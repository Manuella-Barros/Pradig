The designer of the much-ridiculed double-decker airline seats \u2014 which spawned a thousand memes \u2014 has now rolled out a prototype for first class. \u201cNow that we know economy works, and now that\u2019s moving forward, we thought, \u2018Why not go to the other end of the cabin and do a business-class/first-class hybrid?\u2019\u201d Chaise Lounge founder Alejandro N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente told CNN at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg, Germany, where he\u2019s displaying his company\u2019s bi-level sky chairs. His original coach class arrangement \u2014 which features one row above another with the top level accessible by stairs \u2014 was designed to allow lower-seated passengers more legroom as there was no seat directly in front of them. Doing so required N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vincente to do away with the overhead luggage bin. The visionary\u2019s first-class iteration, dubbed \u201celevated class,\u201d is essentially the same concept except with a slightly different layout. Whereas the economy version has the standard three seats, this upper-crust configuration features only one seat on the bottom row, and two on the top like a sofa, allowing for much more space and comfort. N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente said he wanted to elevate air travel by creating \u201cmore space for more seats in the airplane\u201d while also providing \u201can even better experience than they get today in business or first class.\u201d Specifically, he envisioned the bottom seat as an enclosed cubicle with a spacious footwell that passengers can stretch their legs out into under the upper level \u2014 perfect for the solo traveler. Conversely, the more couch-like upper tier was designed for people traveling with a plus one as well as lone flyers who need more space. The lack of an overhead luggage locker might seem disconcerting, however, N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente claims that this is offset by the roomier footwells, which provide all the storage a passenger could need. \u201cThe real estate that you\u2019re getting is so much bigger than the one you would get in any business or first class,\u201d declared the entrepreneur, who founded Chaise Lounge as a 21-year-old college student, inspired by economy flights that didn\u2019t accommodate his 6-foot-2 frame. Unfortunately, his economy prototype became the subject of ridicule, with critics deeming the layout claustrophobic and weird. \u201cFresh hell just dropped,\u201d wrote author Amber Sparks on X in response to a CNN article about the design. Fellow writer Kaz Weida tweeted: \u201cI\u2019ll be back to comment on this once my claustrophobia lets me breathe again.\u201d Indeed, the top row\u2019s design is such that passengers will only have 4.92 feet of space between the seats and the top of the plane, preventing them from standing up to get out. Meanwhile, one Redditor claimed that those seated in the lower quadrant would break both of their knees at the same time should they encounter turbulence. However, Vincente remains undaunted by haters, declaring, \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as bad publicity.\u201d \u201cMost of the things that changed the world are normally from radical people that come with a crazy idea \u2013 like Steve Jobs with the iPhone,\u201d insisted the seat honcho, who claims that \u201cbig players\u201d are interested in the economy class design. N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vicente says he\u2019s also anxious for \u201celevated class\u201d to get off the ground, gushing: \u201cWe will put our reputation on the line, again, and see how it turns out.\u201d The visionary\u2019s not the first to design a seat that ostensibly saves space sans sacrificing comfort. Earlier this year, an Italian aerospace company unveiled a convertible \u201csofa-bed\u201d-style business class seat, which they claim could transform the face of air travel.", "summary": "The designer of the much-ridiculed double-decker airline seats \u2014 which spawned a thousand memes \u2014 has now rolled out a prototype for first class.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/05/29/lifestyle/double-decker-airline-seat-heading-for-first-class-too/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/82857910.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 14:09:46", "author": "Ben Cost", "authors": ["Ben Cost"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.1}

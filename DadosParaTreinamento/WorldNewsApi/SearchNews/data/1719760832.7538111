{"id": 225027552, "title": "A final graduation requirement: Making sense of protest", "text": "Standing on the stage at Radio City Music Hall, Mariame Sissoko began to speak in a voice trembling, ever so slightly.Growing up in Philadelphia, Sissoko was outspoken, a high achiever, captain of the high school debate team. In other words, just the sort of person who would go to Barnard College, run for student government and wind up giving a graduation speech before an audience of 4,700 university officials, classmates and parents.Sissoko, 22, who uses nonbinary pronouns, had been warned by administrators not to deviate from the speech they had turned in weeks earlier.But that speech was written before a pro-Palestinian encampment sprang up on the main lawn of Columbia University (Barnard\u2019s sibling school), before students occupied an academic building and police made more than 100 arrests, before the campus became a locus of anger over the more than 35,000 people killed in the Gaza Strip during the war and of fear over rising antisemitism.Now, on graduation day, Sissoko put those warnings from administrators aside.\u201cTo stand on this stage today is a privilege,\u201d Sissoko said. \u201cIt is a privilege that over 15,000 children in Gaza will never receive.\u201dSissoko\u2019s classmates broke into applause. On Sissoko\u2019s lapel was a poppy, meant to honor a 6-year-old Palestinian girl killed during the war and a 10-month-old Israeli baby taken hostage by Hamas. \u201cI know that there are countless poppies with the names of children in Gaza who have been killed,\u201d Sissoko continued. \u201cThey will walk across this stage with us.\u201dAs Sissoko paused, classmates seated in the audience began to sing an anthem that was popularized during the civil rights movement and that pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia had now taken up: \u201cWe shall not, we shall not be moved.\u201dFrom the rows of family seating came cries of \u201cBoo!\u201d a chorus that grew louder as the students kept singing. An automated voice came over the loudspeaker: \u201cToday\u2019s speaker shared personal views, which may not reflect the views and values of Barnard College.\u201dGraduation speakers usually offer encomiums about how college changes people with its intellectual striving, its community of peers, its moral dilemmas straddling the real world and the textbook page.But this year, students faced a test that for some really was foundational \u2014 one that asked them to define what they stood for and what they were willing to lose, from clean disciplinary records to social standing.In the weeks leading up to graduation, I spoke with more than a dozen Columbia and Barnard students about how the campus protests had shaped them.I focused especially on students at the periphery of the protests. Some of them said that what they had witnessed in the last months of college influenced how they viewed the world and their career choices.Sissoko has always created change in a largely orderly fashion \u2014 running for student government, getting good grades \u2014 but watching the protests unfold called into question some of that commitment to rule following. Reading the words that deviated from the preapproved graduation script, Sissoko tried not to cry.Then they took in the applause, which felt as if it roared on for hours, though in reality only moments passed before the ceremony continued.Caught in the MiddleAt Columbia, the pro-Palestinian protests have already left their imprint on Jeremy Faust.Faust, 23, grew up on Long Island, where he went to a Reform temple and Jewish summer camp. He felt unsettled by the entirely sunny view of Israel that both taught him. \u201cThe vibe was hummus, falafel and \u2018Yay, Israel,\u2019\u201d Faust said.When he arrived at Columbia four years ago, he gravitated to the campus chapter of J Street, a center-left advocacy group that opposes the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and supports the coexistence of Israelis and Palestinians in two states.Even before this year, Faust, a political science major with a dual degree in Jewish history at the Jewish Theological Seminary, was planning student events that challenged Israeli treatment of Palestinians.But Faust said he \u201cfelt caught in the middle,\u201d especially after the Hamas attacks on Israel and Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza. The left-wing group Jewish Voice for Peace rejected J Street for being Zionist, while some pro-Israel students said J Street\u2019s hosting of programs critical of Israel was shameful.Faust\u2019s sense of political isolation heightened over the past two months, as classmates erected tents at the pro-Palestinian encampment and called for Columbia to divest from Israel.Still, when one of his friends invited him to attend a Sabbath service in the encampment, Faust decided to go. As he sat on the campus lawn, surrounded by students in kaffiyehs, singing familiar Friday night Hebrew prayers, he felt immense gratitude to the organizers.But Faust\u2019s joy was quickly tempered. The next day, he saw that an Israeli assistant professor at Columbia\u2019s business school had reposted videos of the services on social media, referring to those who participated as akin to the Jews who supported the Nazi regime.Faust always knew he wanted his life after college to be filled with Jewish ritual. He even imagined that he might start a side gig leading tours of New York focused on Jewish history. But his struggle to find a politically inclusive Jewish community made him think more deeply about becoming a rabbi.\u201cThe appeal of being a rabbi is you\u2019re part psychologist, researcher, community leader and activist at the same time,\u201d he said.Julien Roa studied classics at Columbia, and he delighted in the arcane questions that anchored his seminars on ancient literature, poetry and philosophy. Campus social issues he treated with more distance, defining himself as the type of person who could argue any side of an issue.But some of that intellectual distance dissolved as the intensity of pro-Palestinian protests deepened. Roa, 22, was in midtown Manhattan on April 30, past midnight, when he got a text from a friend saying protesters were trying to enter Hamilton Hall, a campus building that has been a prominent site for activist occupation over the years.Roa called an Uber and headed uptown to witness a moment he knew would be historically important.In the weeks since, what has consumed Roa in conversations with friends and professors is the question \u2014 still esoteric, but also now deeply personal \u2014 of how colleges can live up to their promise of being spaces where students tangle with thorny ideas.After four years of abstract academic deliberating, he is alarmed to see schools quashing dissent, and wants campuses to stay open to free expression.Roa hopes to find a way to research university decision-making, whether in law school or in his spare time. \u201cPretty much with every person I\u2019ve spoken to in recent weeks, this is intellectually what\u2019s on my mind.\u201dIn any normal year, graduation week is that liminal space of bliss between final exams and real-world tests. Not this year.Columbia canceled its main commencement ceremony and moved its Class Day, a long-running tradition celebrating the graduates, off the main campus and uptown to Baker Athletics Complex, which the school said was meant to ensure a smooth event. The university\u2019s president did not attend.Some graduates crossed the stage wrapped in kaffiyehs and carrying signs that read, \u201cDivest.\u201d Roa held up a graduation cap with a picture of the university president, his way of gesturing that a school leader should show up and face students.At the Jewish Theological Seminary\u2019s graduation, where Faust\u2019s parents and grandmother waited eagerly for his name to be called, students and their families stood to sing \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d They remained standing to sing Israel\u2019s national anthem, \u201cHatikvah.\u201dWhile Faust listened to the speakers reciting prayers for Israel, he felt that now familiar sense of discomfort, though he tried to focus on his family, all abuzz with excitement.At Radio City Music Hall, as soon as Sissoko left the stage, their family and friends rushed forward with hugs. Sissoko\u2019s middle sister, Kemi, through tears, texted the video of her sibling\u2019s speech to friends. \u201cThey were like, \u2018Yup, this is what we expected Mariame to do,\u2019\u201d Kemi said laughing.During their four years at Barnard, Sissoko took classes on politics, speculative literature and women\u2019s health, but they weren\u2019t entirely certain where it all would lead.By the time Sissoko was posing for pictures in Radio City Music Hall, they felt confident in their ambition: become a college professor. It was a goal influenced by members of Columbia\u2019s faculty, who had linked arms and surrounded the encampment organizers in a show of protection when the police first arrived.\u201cSeeing my professors show up for students, it\u2019s like: Yes, I can see myself doing this in 20 or 30 years, for whatever the next world crisis is,\u201d Sissoko said.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/world/palestine-columbia-pro-palestine-protest-9359530/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/NYT-photo.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:09:52", "author": "New York Times", "authors": ["New York Times"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.16}

The alleged incident unfolded when Combs, now 54, was a student at Howard University in Washington, D.C., multiple witnesses told Rolling Stone in a wide-ranging report into the disgraced star\u2019s \u201chistory of violence.\u201d The \u201cBad Boy 4 Life\u201d rapper had been standing outside the college\u2019s Harriet Tubman Quadrangle dorm when he started screaming in a \u201cbelligerent\u201d manner for his then-girlfriend to come outside, one classmate alleged. \u201cHe screamed and hollered and acted a stone fool until she came downstairs,\u201d said a former student, who claimed to have witnessed the ordeal. Combs appeared to be \u201csuper angry\u201d and \u201cscreaming at the top of his lungs\u201d \u2014 then allegedly used what appeared to be a belt to hit the girlfriend \u201call over the place,\u201d the witness continued. He \u201cwhupped her butt \u2014 like really whupped her butt,\u201d the alleged witness claimed. \u201cShe was trying to defend herself a little bit. She was crying. And we were telling him, \u2018Get off of her.\u2019 We were screaming for her.\u201d Another classmate recalled several panicked female students running through the dorm, knocking on doors and shouting that Combs \u2014 who was then known as \u201cPuff\u201d \u2014 was allegedly attacking his girlfriend. \u201cPuff is out here acting crazy. He\u2019s beating her,\u201d the students allegedly were saying, according to a witness. It wasn\u2019t immediately exactly when the alleged incident occurred, although Combs dropped out of Howard University in 1990 after just one year. The alleged victim declined to comment when reached by Rolling Stone. Combs\u2019 lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. The rapper received an honorary doctorate degree from the college in 2014, and last year gifted his alma mater $1 million. The newly surfaced on-campus allegation emerged after a slew of other women have come forward to accuse Diddy of assault spanning decades \u2014 with the disgraced star forced to apologize after disturbing footage emerged of him battering then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura in 2016. Since Ventura accused Combs of rape and abuse back in November, he\u2019s been hit with six lawsuits alleging abuse \u2014 including the latest from model Crystal McKinney, who claims he drugged her and forced her to perform oral sex on him during a visit to his New York City studio two decades ago. Meanwhile, federal investigators are now said to be preparing to bring Combs\u2019 accusers before a federal grand jury in the Big Apple, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. Combs has previously denied the allegations against him, having accused those suing him of \u201clooking for a quick pay day.\u201d \u201cLet me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged,\u201d he wrote on social media last December. However, he was later forced to apologize for beating Cassie after the footage was obtained by CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life, but sometimes you got to do that,\u201d Diddy said in a video on Instagram in which he did not name Ventura or refer to her directly. \u201cI was f\u2014ed up. I hit rock bottom \u2014 but I make no excuses. My behavior on that video is inexcusable.\u201d", "summary": "The alleged incident unfolded when Combs, now 54, was a student at the Washington, D.C. college more than 30 years ago, multiple witnesses claimed to Rolling Stone in a wide-ranging report published Tuesday.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/05/29/us-news/diddy-allegedly-whupped-college-girlfriend-with-a-belt/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/82859254.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/K7Ke1u2s-RyIcpnTz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:57:21", "author": "Emily Crane", "authors": ["Emily Crane"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.537}

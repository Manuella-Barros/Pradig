This, she said in the video, was compounded by fans who \"cheer on the bullying,\" by Biles' post seemingly shading Skinner and the \"wave of hateful comments, DMs, articles and emails\" that followed.\n\nThis back-and-forth drama within the gymnastics world began in June when Skinner posted a now-deleted YouTube video about the 2024 Olympic team.\n\n\"Besides Simone, I feel like the talent and the depth just isn't what it used to be,\" Skinner said in the YouTube video. \"I mean, obviously, a lot of girls just don't work as hard. The girls just don't have the work ethic.\"\n\nThe comments drew backlash, in part, because many of the women representing Team USA in this year's team were also Skinner's 2020 teammates. In 2020, Skinner competed in an individual event along with Jade Carey while Biles, Jordan Chiles, Suni Lee and Grace McCallum competed in the team event. This year, Biles, Chiles, Lee, Carey and Hezly Rivera made up the team.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by MyKayla Skinner (Harmer) (@mykaylaskinner2016)\n\nSkinner later said in another video posted to her Instagram on July 3 that her comments about the girls were \"misinterpreted\" and \"misunderstood\" before posting a formal apology a few days later saying she didn't intend \"to offend or disrespect\" the athletes.\n\nIn her latest video, Skinner said she takes \"100% responsibility for poorly articulating the point I was trying to make\" and said that the 2024 team was \"the very best of the best.\" She said she also sent individual messages to each team member, though Biles was the only one who responded to say she was proud of Skinner.\n\nSkinner then said viewers could \"imagine my surprise\" when she saw the drama strongly reignited after Biles' Instagram post. The post, celebrating the team's gold medal win at the 2024 Games, appeared to call back to Skinner's comments with the caption, \"lack of talent, lazy, olympic champions.\" Biles said on social media the next day that Skinner had blocked her on Instagram.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Simone Biles (@simonebiles)\n\nIn her latest video, Skinner said that if Biles \"truly believes that I called our team lazy and lacking talent... I am really heartbroken over it.\" But she said she wasn't only heartbroken because \"it isn't what I feel or even what I previously said,\" but because the post fueled cyberbullying that has included death threats to her and those close to her.\n\n\"My family and my friends don't deserve to be caught in the crossfire here. They've done nothing,\" Skinner said.\n\nShe concluded the video by asking Biles \"directly and publicly\" to ask her followers to end their attacks. She noted the champion's work in mental health, saying \"a lot of people need your help now.\"\n\n\"We've been hurt and attacked in ways that I am certain you never intended,\" Skinner said. \"Your performance, the team's performance and the Olympics in general should be a time that we support one another and lift each other and our country up. I love our country, and I love our team and I hope that we can move on and move forward and cheer on the rest of our teammates and our athletes together.\"\n\nBiles, who took home three gold medals and one silver medal in Paris, hasn't yet responded to Skinner's video.", "source": {"uri": "denver7.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Denver 7 Colorado News (KMGH)"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_arger@denver7.com", "name": "Alex Arger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyKayla_Skinner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MyKayla Skinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf at the 2020 Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberbullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyberbullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artistic gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_skating_at_the_2022_Winter_Olympics_\u2013_Team_event", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Figure skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics \u2013 Team event"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezly_Rivera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hezly Rivera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_McCallum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grace McCallum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Carey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jade Carey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/caa1caa/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+73/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2F4e%2F72%2F7a42abd844c0b7c914f39c065246%2Fap21203313438537.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795884", "eventUri": "eng-9795884", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-03", "textStart": 1792, "textEnd": 1798}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 236, "relevance": 1}

Please ask your followers to stop.\"\n\n\"You have been an incredible champion for mental health awareness, and lot of people need your help now. We've been hurt and attacked in ways that I am certain you never intended,\" she continued, explaining that her friends and family have \"been caught in the crossfire.\"\n\n\"Your performance, your team's performance and the Olympics, in general, should be a time that we support one another and lift each other and our country up,\" she added. \"I love our country, and I love our team, and I hope that we can move on and move forward and cheer on the rest of our teammates and our athletes together.\"\n\nThe back-and-forth between Skinner and Biles, now the most decorated American gymnast in Olympic history, started in June after Skinner said some gymnasts -- which many took to mean members of the 2024 team -- lacked \"work ethic.\"\n\n\"Besides Simone, I feel like the talent and the depth just isn't like what it used to be,\" Skinner said in part, in a since-deleted YouTube video posted during the Olympic trials in June. \"Just notice like, I mean, obviously a lot of girls don't work as hard. The girls just don't have the work ethic.\"\n\nAfter her comments received backlash, Skinner claimed in a video posted to her Instagram story on July 3 that her initial comments had been \"misinterpreted\" or \"misunderstood,\" adding that they \"[weren't] necessarily about the current team.\"\n\nSimone Biles seemingly shades MyKayla Skinner's critique of US team\n\nSkinner, who retired from gymnastics following the 2020 Olympics, later posted a formal apology on social media on July 6.\n\n\"I want to formally apologize to Team USA and to our gymnastic community for my comments during my recent YouTube episodes of the gymnastics Olympic trials,\" Skinner wrote, in part. \"It was not my intention to offend or disrespect any of the athletes or to take away from their hard work. Your hard work and dedication has paid off and I congratulate each and every one of you.\"\n\nThe public controversy around Skinner's comments seemingly erupted again with Biles' July 31 post on Instagram, which many people interpreted as a pointed response to Skinner's earlier remarks.\n\nThe U.S. women's gymnastics team -- composed of Jordan Chiles, Suni Lee, Hezly Rivera and Jade Carey, in addition to Biles -- took home the gold medal in the women's team competition in Paris.\n\nIn her newly-posted Instagram video, Skinner said she sent personal apologies to the women on the Paris Olympic team following her remarks, for which she said she takes \"100% responsibility.\"\n\n\"To be totally clear, I take 100% responsibility for poorly articulating the point I was trying to make, and the last thing I wanted was to cause harm or offend our U.S. Olympic team,\" Skinner said Tuesday. \"I know these women are incredible, the very best of the best, and almost all of them are my former teammates who I have enjoyed very much cheering on the last few years.\"\n\nWhat Simone Biles, Jordan Chiles said about bowing to Rebeca Andrade after Paris gymnastics floor final\n\nSkinner also said she feels \"heartbroken\" about what has transpired.\n\n\"If Simone truly believes that I called our team lazy and lacking talent, and if that's really how she feels, I am really heartbroken over it,\" Skinner said. \"But not just heartbroken because it isn't how I feel or even what I previously said, but heartbroken because Simone's latest post and others that followed it fueled another wave of hateful comments, DMs, articles and emails.\"\n\nSkinner said she would be taking a break from social media and called on people to stop what she described as cyberbullying, saying, \"At this point, I am just asking for it to just stop, for the sake of my family, because enough is enough.\"\n\nBiles, who took home four medals in Paris, has not yet publicly responded to Skinner's

Biles later confirmed on X that the photo resulted in Skinner blocking her.\n\nIn an almost 4-minute video posted to her Instagram Tuesday, Skinner addressed her past comments and called for an end to online abuse.\n\n\"It's one thing to disagree with me regarding something I have said or a point I was trying to make, but it's something else entirely when that turns into cyberbullying or even worse,\" Skinner said in the video.\n\n\"Threats of physical harm to me, my husband, and our daughter is disgusting, so please, at this point, I am just asking for it to just stop for the sake of my family because enough is enough,\" she continued.\n\nShe went on to reiterate that she didn't mean to offend with her comments and sent apologies to each team member. She says Biles was the only one who responded and shared kind words.\n\nThat's why Skinner was \"heartbroken\" when Biles took the jab in the caption.

Please ask your followers to stop.\"\n\n\"You have been an incredible champion for mental health awareness, and lot of people need your help now. We've been hurt and attacked in ways that I am certain you never intended,\" she continued, explaining that her friends and family have \"been caught in the crossfire.\"\n\n\"Your performance, your team's performance and the Olympics, in general, should be a time that we support one another and lift each other and our country up,\" she added. \"I love our country, and I love our team, and I hope that we can move on and move forward and cheer on the rest of our teammates and our athletes together.\"\n\nThe back-and-forth between Skinner and Biles, now the most decorated American gymnast in Olympic history, started in June after Skinner said some gymnasts -- which many took to mean members of the 2024 team -- lacked \"work ethic.\"\n\n\"Besides Simone, I feel like the talent and the depth just isn't like what it used to be,\" Skinner said in part, in a since-deleted YouTube video posted during the Olympic trials in June. \"Just notice like, I mean, obviously a lot of girls don't work as hard. The girls just don't have the work ethic.\"\n\nAfter her comments received backlash, Skinner claimed in a video posted to her Instagram story on July 3 that her initial comments had been \"misinterpreted\" or \"misunderstood,\" adding that they \"[weren't] necessarily about the current team.\"\n\nSkinner, who retired from gymnastics following the 2020 Olympics, later posted a formal apology on social media on July 6.\n\n\"I want to formally apologize to Team USA and to our gymnastic community for my comments during my recent YouTube episodes of the gymnastics Olympic trials,\" Skinner wrote, in part. \"It was not my intention to offend or disrespect any of the athletes or to take away from their hard work. Your hard work and dedication has paid off and I congratulate each and every one of you.\"\n\nThe public controversy around Skinner's comments seemingly erupted again with Biles' July 31 post on Instagram, which many people interpreted as a pointed response to Skinner's earlier remarks.\n\nThe U.S. women's gymnastics team -- composed of Jordan Chiles, Suni Lee, Hezly Rivera and Jade Carey, in addition to Biles -- took home the gold medal in the women's team competition in Paris.\n\nIn her newly-posted Instagram video, Skinner said she sent personal apologies to the women on the Paris Olympic team following her remarks, for which she said she takes \"100% responsibility.\"\n\n\"To be totally clear, I take 100% responsibility for poorly articulating the point I was trying to make, and the last thing I wanted was to cause harm or offend our U.S. Olympic team,\" Skinner said Tuesday. \"I know these women are incredible, the very best of the best, and almost all of them are my former teammates who I have enjoyed very much cheering on the last few years.\"\n\nSkinner also said she feels \"heartbroken\" about what has transpired.\n\n\"If Simone truly believes that I called our team lazy and lacking talent, and if that's really how she feels, I am really heartbroken over it,\" Skinner said. \"But not just heartbroken because it isn't how I feel or even what I previously said, but heartbroken because Simone's latest post and others that followed it fueled another wave of hateful comments, DMs, articles and emails.\"\n\nSkinner said she would be taking a break from social media and called on people to stop what she described as cyberbullying, saying, \"At this point, I am just asking for it to just stop, for the sake of my family, because enough is enough.\"\n\nBiles, who took home four medals in Paris, has not yet publicly responded to Skinner's video.\n\nUSA Gymnastics did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "source": {"uri":

On Aug. 6, Skinner took to Instagram, responding to Simone Biles' pointed Instagram caption. Now, Skinner is asking for her former teammate's help as she deals with social media hate.\n\nICYMI, the back-and-forth between Skinner and Biles started when Skinner criticized the 2024 Olympic team's work ethic and skill. \"Besides Simone, I feel like the talent and the depth just isn't like what it used to be,\" Skinner said in a since-deleted YouTube video, per CNN. \"A lot of girls don't work as hard. The girls just don't have the work ethic.\"\n\nThen, on July 30, Biles seemingly called out Skinner in an Instagram post celebrating team USA's gold medal win. \"lack of talent, lazy, olympic champions \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd47\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8,\" she captioned the post. Afterward, Skinner blocked Biles.\n\nApparently, since then, Skinner has been receiving a lot of hate on social, prompting her to address the subject again. \"I sincerely hoped that this topic wouldn't need to be revisited but unfortunately things have really gotten out of hand lately. And it's one thing to disagree with me regarding something I have said or a point I was trying to make, but it's something else entirely when that turns into cyber bullying or even worse,\" Skinner said in her IG post.\n\n\"Watching people cheer on the bullying -- which has led to threats of physical harm to me my husband and our daughter -- is disgusting. So please at this point, I'm just asking for it to stop for the sake of my family because enough is enough,\" she continued.\n\nSkinner then explained her perspective on what went down. \"About four weeks ago, I made a comment about work ethic and what seems to be taking pace with the rising generation. To be totally clear, I take 100 percent responsibility for poorly articulating the point I was trying to make and the last thing I wanted was to cause harm or offend our US Olympic team.\" She added that the team was \"the very best of the best.\"\n\n\"I posted a video apology on Instagram and I followed up with a written apology, and I sent individual messages to each of the women on the team,\" she shared. \"Only Simone had responded and she told me that she was proud of me.\"\n\nAccording to Skinner, this situation made it all the more surprising when Biles referenced her in her Instagram caption. \"You guys can imagine my surprise last week when I was celebrating our team winning gold just to see this brought up all over again by a caption on an Instagram post. If Simone truly believes that I called our team lazy and lacking talent and if that's really how she feels, I am really heartbroken over it,\" she said.\n\nSkinner said that she thought Biles' caption \"fueled another wave of hateful comments, DMs, articles, and emails.\" Per her, \"death threats\" were even made to her family and her agent.\n\nSkinner then addressed Biles directly: \"To Simone, I am asking you directly and publicly to please put a stop to this.

Unfortunately, the 2021 silver medalist has become the victim of bullying herself -- some of which is targeted at her family members.\n\nThis has led Skinner to appeal publicly to Biles for help, to which the 11-time Olympic medalist has yet to respond. Who knows, she might be too busy celebrating her multiple podiums from her successful competition in Paris.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the latest developments in the Skinner-Biles beef.\n\n2024 PARIS OLYMPICS\n\nFull Olympics schedule | How to watch in USA | Meet NBC's broadcasters\n\nSkinner took to social media to address the amount of cyberbullying she and her family had been subject to since her controversial comments about this year's USA women's gymnastics team. She, along with her husband and daughter, have received death threats and other threats of physical harm as a result of the situation.\n\nIn the Instagram video, Skinner said things \"have really gotten out of hand lately\" and that people are cheering on the bullying. She also explained that she had taken responsibility for her harsh criticism of today's USA gymnastics program and contacted each of the women on the team.\n\n\"Only Simone had responded, and she told me that she was proud of me,\" Skinner explained. \"You guys can imagine my surprise last week when I was celebrating our team winning gold just to see this brought up all over again by a caption on an Instagram post.\"\n\nThe post that Skinner was referring to was Biles' post after winning the team event gold medal, in which the caption said \"lack of talent, lazy, olympic champions.\"\n\n\"If Simone truly believes that I called our team lazy and lacking talent, and if that's really how she feels, I am really heartbroken over it,\" Skinner said. \"But not just heartbroken because it isn't what I feel or even how I previously said, but because Simone's latest post and others that followed it fueled another wave of hateful comments, DMs, articles and emails -- hate that includes death threats to me my family and even my agent.\n\n\"My family and my friends don't deserve to be caught in the crossfire here,\" Skinner added. \"They've done nothing.\"\n\nShe then directly appealed to Biles, asking her to tame the fire, using the all-around champion's own mental health as an example as to why she should help Skinner.\n\n\"To Simone, I am asking you directly and publicly to please put a stop to this,\" Skinner said. \"Please ask your followers to stop. You have been an incredible champion for mental health awareness and a lot of people need your help now. We've been attacked in ways that I'm certain you never intended. Your performance, the team's performance, and the Olympics in general should be a time that we support one another.\"\n\nBiles has yet to respond to Skinner's video.\n\nSkinner first entered headlines surrounding the Paris Olympics just before the games, when she made extremely critical comments toward this year's Olympic team and the USA gymnastics program on a live stream during an Olympic trial watch party.\n\nShe said things along the lines of: \"Besides Simone, I feel like the talent and the depth just isn't what it used to be.

The girls just don't have the work ethic.\"\n\nAfter winning the team gold medal in Paris, Biles -- now the most decorated American gymnast in Olympics history -- seemingly hit back at Skinner's June comments in an Instagram post celebrating alongside her teammates.\n\n\"Lack of talent, lazy, olympic champions \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd47\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8,\" Biles captioned her post alongside photos of her and her team -- Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey, Suni Lee and Hezly Rivera -- marking the special moment.\n\nIn Tuesday's clip, Skinner alleged that \"Simone's latest post and others that followed it fueled another wave of hateful comments, DMs, articles and emails -- hate that includes death threats to me, my family and even my agent.\"\n\nSkinner, a silver medalist at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, said the alleged backlash has left her \"heartbroken,\" and that she reached out to the Team USA women's gymnastics roster to apologize to them personally.\n\n\"Only Simone had responded and she told me that she was proud of me,\" Skinner claimed. \"You guys can imagine my surprise last week when I was celebrating our team winning gold, just to see this brought up all over again by a caption on an Instagram post.\"\n\n\"To Simone, I am asking you directly and publicly to please put a stop to this,\" Skinner said in the Instagram video. \"Please ask your followers to stop. You have been an incredible champion for mental health awareness and a lot of people need your help now.\"\n\n\"We've been hurt and attacked in ways that I am certain you never intended,\" she added. \"Your performance, the team's performance and the Olympics in general should be a time that we support one another.\"\n\nNot everyone found Skinner's plea entirely persuasive.

And it's one thing to disagree with me regarding something I have said or a point I was trying to make, but it's something else entirely when that turns into cyberbullying or even worse,\" Skinner said.\n\n\"Watching people cheer on the bullying -- which has led to threats of physical harm to me, my husband, and our daughter -- is disgusting. So please at this point, I'm just asking for it to just stop for the sake of my family because enough is enough.\n\n\"So why I'm here is because about four weeks ago, I made a comment about work ethic and what seems to be taking place with the rising generation.

Please ask your followers to stop.\"\n\nAs of Tuesday morning in the United States, or evening in Paris, Biles had yet to respond to Skinner's Instagram post -- if she was even aware of it. She simply posted on X: \"just woke up from a much needed nap.\"\n\nSkinner sparked a feud with Biles and backlash from other top gymnasts when she posted a since-deleted July 3 vlog, commenting negatively on the 2024 team going to Paris. While she briefly, if perfunctorily, praised Biles, she also said that Suni Lee did not have a \"gymnast body,\" criticized the team's makeup, mispronounced team member Hezly Rivera's name and asserted that the team, overall, lacked the talent, depth and \"work ethic\" of years past.\n\nSkinner also made things worse when she complained about the changing culture of gymnastics, with its increased focus on athletes' physical and mental health safety. She said that the U.S. Center for SafeSport had made it harder for coaches to push their athletes to Olympic levels. Skinner didn't mention that the independent nonprofit was founded to reduce sexual, physical and emotional abuse of minors and athletes. Starting in 2016, USA gymnastics faced a reckoning over reports of widespread sexual abuse committed by Larry Nasser, the former national team doctor. Biles and some of Skinner's gymnastics contemporaries came forward to identify themselves as Nasser's victims.\n\nBiles appeared to hit back at Skinner on July 30 after she led members of the gymnastics team to win the gold in the team competition, the first of their total 10 U.S. medals at the Paris Olympics. Biles shared a carousel of Instagram images of her and teammates Lee, Rivera, Jade Carey and Jordan Chiles, raising an American flag to celebrate their win. Biles, who won four medals at the games, captioned her post, \"lack of talent, lazy, olympic champions.\" The following day, Biles told her 1.7 million followers on X that she had been blocked, TMZ reported. While she didn't name names, the assumption is that she was blocked by Skinner.\n\nSkinner was an alternate for the U.S. team at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, when Biles won four gold medals, including for the all-around competition. She took Biles' place in the final vault competition at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. She won silver, after Biles withdrew from the games, citing mental health and physical safety concerns. She retired from gymnastics in 2021 to study broadcast journalism. She also married and gave birth to a daughter in September 2023.\n\nAfter Skinner faced initial blowback for her vlog from Biles and others associated with the current team, she deleted it and issued an apology. She claimed that her comments were \"misinterpreted\" and \"misunderstood. But she again poured the proverbial salt into very deep wounds by suggesting she appreciated aspects of gymnasts' work ethic \"in the Martha (Karolyi) era.\"\n\nSubsequent investigative reporting by the Associated Press, ESPN's 30 for 30 podcast, the Indianapolis Star and other outlets showed that Nasser's abuse was enabled by the \"cruel,\" \"toxic,\" authoritarian gymnastics culture created by former national coaches Bela and Martha Karolyi. The husband-and-wife duo from Romania became celebrities in the sports world by coaching past champions Nadia Comanici and Mary Lou Retton.\n\n\"I'm not sticking up for Martha or saying what she did was good,\" Skinner said in her Instagram apology. \"I'm just saying it was different. So sorry for anything that got out of context or seemed hurtful.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Skinner said she took 100% responsibility for poorly articulating \"the point I was trying to make\" about the Paris team. \"I know these women are incredible -- the very best of the best,\" she said. \"And almost all of them are my former teammates, who I have enjoyed very much cheering on the last few years.\"\n\nAfter she publicly apologized for her vlog, she said she sent individual messages to each of the women on the team, but said \"only Simone responded\" with a positive note, saying \"that she was proud of me.\"\n\nSo, Skinner said, she was surprised that Biles seemed to hit out at her after the team won the team gold medal. Skinner said she was dismayed to \"to see this all brought up all over again by a caption on an Instagram post.\"\n\nSkinner also said she was \"heartbroken\" if Biles truly believes that thought the team was \"lazy and lacking talent.\" The retired gymnast also said she was \"heartbroken\" because Bile's social media post and others have fueled \"a wave of hateful comments\" and \"death threats to me, my family and even my agent.\"\n\nTo plead her case, Skinner also tried to appeal to Biles' advocacy on behalf of mental health by saying, \"You have been an incredible champion for mental health awareness, and a lot of people need your help now. We've been hurt and attacked in ways that I am certain you never intended.\"\n\n\"Your performance, the team's performance and the Olympics in general should be a time when we support one another and lift each other and our country up,\" Skinner said. \"I love our country and I love our team and I hope we can move on and move forward and cheer on the rest of our teammates and our athletes together.\"", "source": {"uri": "eastbaytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "East Bay Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martha_ross@eastbaytimes.com", "name": "Martha Ross", "type": "author",

Please ask your followers to stop, you have been an incredible champion for mental health awareness and a lot of people need your help now,\" Skinner said.\n\n\"We've been hurt and attacked in ways that I am certain you never intended.\"\n\nBiles seemingly shaded Skinner after Team USA's women's gymnastics team captured gold in the all-round at the Paris Games.\n\nThe 27-year-old Biles used similar language in an Instagram post after Skinner criticised the team's \"work ethic\" in a since-deleted YouTube video.\n\nThe 27-year-old Skinner, who retired from gymnastics three years ago, said she and her husband, Jonas Harmer, and their 23-month-old daughter Charlotte Jane, have been subjected to cyber-bullying and threats of physical harm.\n\n\"Watching people cheer on the bullying -- which has led to threats of physical harm to me, my husband and our daughter -- is disgusting. So please at this point, I'm just asking for it to just stop for the sake of my family because enough is enough,\" she said.\n\nBiles' shade came after Skinner lamented in a previous video how younger gymnasts, like 2024 Olympians Suni Lee, Hezly Rivera, Jade Carey and Jordan Chiles, were getting \"lazy.\"\n\n\"Besides Simone, I feel like the talent and the depth just isn't like what it used to be. Just notice like, I mean, obviously a lot of girls don't work as hard. The girls just don't have the work ethic,\" Skinner said in a since-deleted YouTube video, which has gone viral on X.\n\nSkinner said on Tuesday she takes responsibility for \"poorly articulating\" her point and wasn't trying to cause harm.\n\n\"I know these women are incredible -- the very best of the best -- and almost all of them are my former teammates who I have enjoyed very much cheering on the last few years,\" Skinner said.\n\nAfter Team USA won gold in the all-round event, Biles posted a photo of the group celebrating and captioned her post with: \"Lack of talent, lazy, Olympic champions.\"\n\nThat was an apparent reference to previous comments Skinner made criticising the women's gymnastics team -- Suni Lee, Hezly Rivera, Jade Carey and Jordan Chiles -- for their work ethic, with the exception of Biles.\n\nSkinner previously apologised and walked back her remarks on social media last month -- and she sent individual messages to the Team USA gymnasts competing in Paris.\n\nIn her video on Tuesday, she said she only heard back from one of the five gymnasts competing in Paris.\n\n\"Only Simone had responded and she told me that she was proud of me,\" Skinner said.\n\n\"You guys can imagine my surprise last week when I was celebrating our team winning gold just to see this brought up all over again by a caption on an Instagram post.\n\n\"If Simone truly believes that I called our team lazy and lacking talent and if that's really how she feels, I am really heartbroken over it.\n\n\"But not just heartbroken because it isn't what I feel or even how I previously said, but because Simone's latest post and others that followed it fuelled another wave of hateful comments, DMs, articles and emails.\n\n\"Hate that includes death threats to me, my family and even my agent.

Please ask your followers to stop.\"\n\nAs of Tuesday morning in the United States, or evening in Paris, Biles had yet to respond to Skinner's Instagram post -- if she was even aware of it. She simply posted on X: \"just woke up from a much needed nap.\"\n\nSkinner sparked a feud with Biles and backlash from other top gymnasts when she posted a since-deleted July 3 vlog, commenting negatively on the 2024 team going to Paris. While she briefly, if perfunctorily, praised Biles, she also said that Suni Lee did not have a \"gymnast body,\" criticized the team's makeup, mispronounced team member Hezly Rivera's name and asserted that the team, overall, lacked the talent, depth and \"work ethic\" of years past.\n\nSkinner also made things worse when she complained about the changing culture of gymnastics, with its increased focus on athletes' physical and mental health safety. She said that the U.S. Center for SafeSport had made it harder for coaches to push their athletes to Olympic levels. Skinner didn't mention that the independent nonprofit was founded to reduce sexual, physical and emotional abuse of minors and athletes. Starting in 2016, USA gymnastics faced a reckoning over reports of widespread sexual abuse committed by Larry Nasser, the former national team doctor. Biles and some of Skinner's gymnastics contemporaries came forward to identify themselves as Nasser's victims.\n\nBiles appeared to hit back at Skinner on July 30 after she led members of the gymnastics team to win the gold in the team competition, the first of their total 10 U.S. medals at the Paris Olympics. Biles shared a carousel of Instagram images of her and teammates Lee, Rivera, Jade Carey and Jordan Chiles, raising an American flag to celebrate their win. Biles, who won four medals at the games, captioned her post, \"lack of talent, lazy, olympic champions.\" The following day, Biles told her 1.7 million followers on X that she had been blocked, TMZ reported. While she didn't name names, the assumption is that she was blocked by Skinner.\n\nSkinner was an alternate for the U.S. team at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, when Biles won four gold medals, including for the all-around competition. She took Biles' place in the final vault competition at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. She won silver, after Biles withdrew from the games, citing mental health and physical safety concerns. She retired from gymnastics in 2021 to study broadcast journalism. She also married and gave birth to a daughter in September 2023.\n\nAfter Skinner faced initial blowback for her vlog from Biles and others associated with the current team, she deleted it and issued an apology. She claimed that her comments were \"misinterpreted\" and \"misunderstood. But she again poured the proverbial salt into very deep wounds by suggesting she appreciated aspects of gymnasts' work ethic \"in the Martha (Karolyi) era.\"\n\nSubsequent investigative reporting by the Associated Press, ESPN's 30 for 30 podcast, the Indianapolis Star and other outlets showed that Nasser's abuse was enabled by the \"cruel,\" \"toxic,\" authoritarian gymnastics culture created by former national coaches Bela and Martha Karolyi. The husband-and-wife duo from Romania became celebrities in the sports world by coaching past champions Nadia Comanici and Mary Lou Retton.\n\n\"I'm not sticking up for Martha or saying what she did was good,\" Skinner said in her Instagram apology. \"I'm just saying it was different. So sorry for anything that got out of context or seemed hurtful.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Skinner said she took 100% responsibility for poorly articulating \"the point I was trying to make\" about the Paris team. \"I know these women are incredible -- the very best of the best,\" she said. \"And almost all of them are my former teammates, who I have enjoyed very much cheering on the last few years.\"\n\nAfter she publicly apologized for her vlog, she said she sent individual messages to each of the women on the team, but said \"only Simone responded\" with a positive note, saying \"that she was proud of me.\"\n\nSo, Skinner said, she was surprised that Biles seemed to hit out at her after the team won the team gold medal. Skinner said she was dismayed to \"to see this all brought up all over again by a caption on an Instagram post.\"\n\nSkinner also said she was \"heartbroken\" if Biles truly believes that thought the team was \"lazy and lacking talent.\" The retired gymnast also said she was \"heartbroken\" because Bile's social media post and others have fueled \"a wave of hateful comments\" and \"death threats to me, my family and even my agent.\"\n\nTo plead her case, Skinner also tried to appeal to Biles' advocacy on behalf of mental health by saying, \"You have been an incredible champion for mental health awareness, and a lot of people need your help now. We've been hurt and attacked in ways that I am certain you never intended.\"\n\n\"Your performance, the team's performance and the Olympics in general should be a time when we support one another and lift each other and our country up,\" Skinner said. \"I love our country and I love our team and I hope we can move on and move forward and cheer on the rest of our teammates and our athletes together.\"", "source": {"uri": "mercurynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Jose Mercury News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martha_ross@mercurynews.com", "name": "Martha Ross", "type": "author",

The retired gymnast wants the back and forth to end as it is entering dangerous waters for her and her family.\n\nA somber Skinner expressed her dilemma in a four-minute video on Instagram. \"I sincerely hoped that this topic wouldn't need to be revisited, but unfortunately, things have really gotten out of hand lately,\" she began. \"It's one thing to disagree with me regarding something I have said or a point I was trying to make, but it's something else entirely when that turns into cyberbullying or even worse.\" Skinner explained that fans celebrated the bullying, which spiraled into \"physical threats\" against her husband and daughter.\n\n\"So please at this point, I'm just asking for it to stop for the sake of my family because enough is enough.\"\n\nSkinner referenced the July 2024 video that made her public enemy number. The 27-year-old \"took responsibility\" for the harm the since-deleted YouTube clip caused. \"The last thing I wanted was to cause harm or offend our U.S. Olympic team,\" she explained. As a result, she posted an apology video and reached out to all the women, including Biles.\n\n\"Only Simone had responded and she told me that she was proud of me. You guys can imagine my surprise last week when I was celebrating our team winning gold just to see this brought up all over again by a caption on an Instagram post.\"\n\nAn emotional Skinner said she was \"heartbroken\" because of how Biles reacted to her controversial video. \"I am really heartbroken over it. But not just heartbroken because it isn't what I feel or even how I previously said, but because Simone's latest post and others that followed it fueled another wave of hateful comments.\" As a last resort to end the cyberbullying, the Arizona native called on her former colleague.\n\nTo Simone, I am asking you directly and publicly to please put a stop to this. Please ask your followers to stop. You have been an incredible champion for mental health awareness.\"\n\nBiles and Skinner's beef began in July when she critiqued Team USA after their selection at the U.S. Olympic Trials. Skinner insinuated team members Suni Lee, Jade Carey, Jordan Chiles, and Hezly Rivera didn't have a \"work ethic\" like Biles. Following the team snagging gold at the Women's Gymnastics final, Biles threw jabs at Skinner. \"Lack of talent, lazy, Olympic champions,\" she captioned a celebratory post featuring the entire team.

Skinner expressed her dismay at the ongoing bullying and threats directed at her, her husband, and their daughter, pleading for the hostility to cease for the sake of her family's safety.\n\nThe controversy dates back to earlier this summer when Skinner made comments in a YouTube video, suggesting that the current Team USA gymnasts, aside from Biles, lacked the same talent and work ethic as previous generations. She remarked, \"Besides Simone, I feel like the talent and the depth just isn't, like, what it used to be. A lot of girls don't work as hard. The girls just don't have the work ethic.\"\n\nAlthough Skinner attempted to walk back her comments, explaining they were misinterpreted and not intended to harm or offend the team, the damage had been done. The remarks struck a nerve, particularly within the gymnastics community, culminating in a pointed response from Biles.\n\nFollowing Team USA's victory at the Olympics team final at Bercy Arena in Paris, Biles posted a series of celebratory photos on Instagram with the caption, \"lack of talent, lazy, olympic champions \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd47.\"\n\nThe caption was a direct reference to Skinner's earlier comments. Fellow gymnasts Suni Lee and Jordan Chiles supported Biles' post, with Lee adding, \"Put a finger down if Simone Biles just ended you,\" and Chiles chiming in, \"and that's on period!!\"\n\nEven former Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney weighed in, stating, \"She f'd around n found out fr. Feels like I need to apologize just to redeem my first name.\" The post quickly amassed nearly 2.5 million likes, further intensifying the scrutiny on Skinner.\n\nMyKayla Skinner's plea for peace to Simone Biles\n\nIn her video, Skinner expressed deep sorrow over the situation, emphasizing that her initial comments were poorly articulated and not meant to target the current team specifically. She clarified that her remarks were more about the broader \"rising generation\" of gymnasts and not aimed at the gold medal winners.\n\n\"I know these women are incredible -- the very best of the best -- and almost all of them are my former teammates who I have enjoyed very much cheering on the last few years,\" Skinner said. She noted that she had personally apologized to each team member and believed she had reconciled with Biles until the recent post reignited the controversy.\n\nSkinner detailed the severe impact the backlash has had on her personal life, with threats extending to her family and friends. \"Hate that includes death threats to me, my family, and even my agent. My family and my friends don't deserve to be caught in the crossfire here. They've done nothing,\" she lamented.\n\nIn a direct appeal to Biles, Skinner requested her to intervene and ask her supporters to cease the attacks. \"We've been attacked in ways that I'm certain you never intended. Your performance, the team's performance, and the Olympics in general should be a time that we support one another.\"\n\nThis incident underscores the intense scrutiny and pressure athletes face, not only from the public but also within their own community. The dynamics of social media amplify these pressures, turning disagreements into public spectacles with far-reaching consequences.\n\nFor Skinner, the ordeal serves as a harsh reminder of the repercussions that come with public statements, especially those that can be perceived as critical of peers. As for Biles, the situation highlights the immense influence she wields within the gymnastics community and the broader public.\n\nAs the dust settles, it remains to be seen how this drama will affect the relationships within Team USA gymnastics and what steps, if any, will be taken to foster a more supportive and less hostile environment for all athletes involved.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nayan_brahmbhatt@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Nayan Brahmbhatt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyKayla_Skinner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MyKayla Skinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKayla_Maroney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McKayla Maroney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Olympic_&_Paralympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Rhythmic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Rhythmic", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Organizations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Olympics-news-MyKayla-Skinner-received-death-threats-after-Simone-Biles-drama.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795884", "eventUri": "eng-9795884", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

And in an unexpected turn of events, she is now asking her former teammate Simone Biles to intervene.\n\nIn an Aug. 6 Instagram post pleading for a break from the online critics, Skinner said, \"Things have really gotten out of hand lately,\" adding that she and her family and friends have been enduring \"cyberbullying,\" including \"disgusting\" threats of physical harm and death.\n\n\"Enough is enough...I take 100 percent responsibility for poorly articulating the point I was trying to make\" she said. Biles and her Team USA teammates, Jordan Chiles, Sunni Lee, Hezly Rivera, and Jade Carey, just completed a victorious series of performances at the Paris 2024 Olympics.\n\nThe Columbus, Ohio, native became the nation's most decorated Olympic gymnast, adding four medals -- three gold and one silver -- to her collection, bringing her lifetime total to 11.\n\nWhen the collective took top honors with their floor routines last week, Biles marked the milestone with a carousel of photos of them celebrating. She captioned the post, \"lack of talent, lazy, olympic champions,\" a veiled reply to Skinner that fans picked up on.\n\nSkinner's feet, so to speak, have been held to the fire after a since-deleted YouTube video she posted in June became a viral talking point. In it, she said, \"Besides Simone, I feel like the talent and the depth just isn't like what it used to be. Just notice, like, I mean, obviously a lot of girls don't work as hard. ... The girls just don't have the work ethic.\"\n\nThe new mom last competed in the 2021 Games, when she filled in for Biles after she was unable to compete in a number of events due to suffering from what was variously described as disorienting affliction called \"the \"twisties.\"\n\nSkinner won her only medal, a silver one, when she completed an impressive vault performance.\n\nSince her July 6 apology on X, her acknowledgment of the fallout from her remarks included reiterating that she publicly apologized to each of the women, noting that Biles was the only gymnast who responded -- gracefully at that -- and again in a post explaining she did not intend to discredit the athletes with her remarks.\n\nStill, Skinner claimed that Biles ignited a storm of criticism with her celebratory post last week. Even now, Skinner places the onus to put a stop to the \"hateful comments\" directly on Biles. Amid the last week's wave of blowback at Skinner, Biles revealed that Skinner blocked her on social media. She also was not tagged by Skinner in the post.\n\n\"To Simone, I am asking you directly and publicly to please put a stop to this. Please ask your followers to stop. You have been an incredible champion for mental health awareness, and a lot of people need your help now,\" said Skinner in her plea.\n\nShe continued, \"We've been hurt and attacked in ways that I am certain you never intended. Your performance and the team's performance and the Olympics in general should be a time that we support one another and lift our country up.\"\n\nHer comments were limited, leaving room for only supporters to weigh in. They wrote things like, \"For someone who promotes how important mental health is, I have been sad to see how yours has not been taken into consideration.\"\n\nBut elsewhere online, the GOAT Olympian's supporters were swift in calling out Skinner for what countless people saw as an attempt to shame Biles into defending her.\n\n\"What's also unacceptable, is her using Simone's mental health struggles and advocation to guilt trip her when her own comments could've impacted the rest of team USA's mental health as well,\" posed one person on X.\n\nAnother said, \"@mykaylaskinner started with Simone and now on IG trying to weaponize white tears asking Simone to make folks leave her alone as if it's Simone's responsibility.\"\n\nSomeone else felt the blowback was deserved and wrote, \"YOU SAID WHAT YOU SAID, you just didn't think a pretty blond girl would get blowback tryna dunk on the nonwhite girls. You deserve ALL THE S-T YOU GETTING, and Simone does not need to save you. Don't want none, DON'T START NONE.\"\n\nBiles has opened up about her mental health in the past, revealing she was hesitant to start therapy after withdrawing from several events at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.\n\nBiles and her teammates are done with their competitions but will remain in Paris for closing ceremonies on Aug. 11. At 27, the superstar gymnast is the oldest to compete on the mat this year.

I sincerely hope that this topic wouldn't need to be revisited. But unfortunately things have really gotten out of hand lately, and it's one thing to disagree with me regarding something I've said or a point I was trying to make, but it's something else entirely when that turns into cyber bullying or even worse.\n\nWatching people cheer on the bullying which has led to threats of physical harm to me, my husband and our daughter is disgusting. So please, at this point, I am just asking for it to just stop for the sake of my family because enough is enough. So why I'm here. It's because about four weeks ago, I made a comment about work ethic and what seems to be taking place with the rising generation. To be totally clear, I take 100% responsibility for poorly articulating the point I was trying to make, and the last thing I wanted was to cause harm or offend our US Olympic team.\n\nI know these women are incredible, the very best of the best, and almost all of them are my former teammates who I have enjoyed very much cheering on the last few years.\n\nI posted a video apology on Instagram.\n\nAnd I followed up with a written apology and I sent individual messages to each of the women on the team. Only Simone had responded, and she told me that she was proud of me. You guys can imagine my surprise last week when I was celebrating our team winning gold, just to see this brought up all over again by a caption on an Instagram post.\n\nIf Simone truly believes that I called our team lazy and lacking talent, and if that's really how she feels, I am really heartbroken over it, but not just heartbroken because it isn't how I feel or even what I previously said, but heartbroken because Simone's latest post and others that followed it fueled another wave of hateful comments. DMs, articles and emails. Hate that includes death threats to me, my family and even my agent. My family and my friends don't deserve to be caught in a crossfire here. They've done nothing. So, to Simone, I am asking you to directly and publicly to please put a stop to this. Please ask your followers to stop. You have been an incredible champion for mental health awareness, and a lot of people need your help now. We've been hurt and attacked in ways that I am certain you never intended.\n\nYour performance. the team's performance and the Olympics in general should be a time that we support one another and lift each other and our country up.\n\nI love our country, and I love our team. And I hope that we can move on and move forward and cheer on the rest of our teammates and our athletes together.\n\nLast week, Biles took to social media to celebrate her team's incredible gold medal win at the 2024 Olympics, but her word choice set the gymnastics world on fire.\n\nBiles shared images of her team holding the American flag after winning gold in the women's gymnastics all-around team final. The team included Biles, Suni Lee, Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey and Hezly Rivera.\n\n\"Lack of talent, lazy, olympic champions,\" she captioned the post.\n\nBiles' words appeared to reference a comment made by Skinner, who stepped in for Biles at the Tokyo Olympics after she dropped out due to the twisties. In the now-deleted YouTube video, Skinner commented on what she said was a lack of \"talent\" and \"depth\" in the upcoming gymnastics fields.\n\nBiles had responded to the remark shortly after Skinner made it, and Skinner had apologized for the remarks saying they were \"misinterpreted\" or \"misunderstood.\"\n\nBut all the controversy surrounding the video resurfaced after Biles' post last week, which was praised by Olympians around the world, including her gold medal-winning teammates.\n\n\"At this point, I am just asking for it to just stop for the sake of my family, because enough is enough,\" Skinner said in the new video, explaining, \"I made a comment about work ethic and what seems to be taking place with the rising generation. To be totally clear, I take 100% responsibility for poorly articulating the point I was trying to make, and the last thing I wanted was to cause harm or offend our US Olympic team.\"\n\n\"I know these women are incredible, the very best of the best, and almost all of them are my former teammates who I have enjoyed very much cheering on the last few years,\" she continued, saying she posted a video apology on Instagram and followed up with a written apology and individual messages \"to each of the women on the team.\"\n\n\"Only Simone had responded and she told me that she was proud of me,\" Skinner said. \"You guys can imagine my surprise last week when I was celebrating our team winning gold.

The former Olympic gymnast, 27, apologized earlier in July after she questioned the talent and work ethic of this year's U.S. women's gymnastics competitors.\n\nOn Aug. 6, Skinner addressed the caption, and its fallout, in a video message shared to Instagram.\n\nThe 27-year-old said she and her family have been the target of online harassment following Biles' social media post.\n\n\"I sincerely hoped that this topic wouldn't need to be revisited, but unfortunately things have really gotten out of hand lately and it's one thing to disagree with me regarding something I have said or a point I was trying to make. But it's something else entirely when that turns into cyberbullying or even worse,\" Skinner began the post.\n\nSkinner concluded the video by speaking to Biles \"directly and publicly,\" asking that she put an end to the cyberbullying and harassment. \"Enough is enough,\" she said at one point.\n\n\"Please ask your followers to stop. You have been an incredible champion for mental health awareness and a lot of people need your help now. We've been hurt and attacked in ways that I am certain you never intended. Your performance, the team's performance and the Olympics in general should be a time that we support one another and lift each other and our country up.\"\n\nBiles' caption led to support from her team members and a plethora of media coverage. Team USA gymnast Suni Lee wrote: \"Put a finger down if simone biles just ended you.\"\n\nBiles' other teammate Jordan Chiles also commented on her post: \"And that's on periodt!!\"\n\nFormer Olympic figure skater Michelle Kwan also clapped back at \"haters\" in general in her comment on Biles' post: \"Four letter word for all the haters -- G.O.A.T \ud83d\udc10!!! Bravo.\"\n\nMcKayla Maroney, a retired artistic gymnast and Olympic gold medalist, appeared to reference Skinner's past comments, and their similar first name, in a comment on Biles' post.\n\n\"It doesn't get more iconic than this,\" Maroney wrote. \"She f'd around n found out fr. Feels like I need to apologize just to redeem my first name.\"\n\nRead on to learn more about the history between Skinner and Biles.\n\nTODAY.com has reached out to Skinner and Biles comment.\n\nSkinner took Biles' place in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics after Biles withdrew from the vault and uneven bars finals, citing the twisties. Before Biles withdrew, Skinner had been planning to return home because she had not qualified for the vault finals, which were limited to two athletes per country.\n\nHowever, when Biles' spot opened up, Skinner competed in the vault finals and received a silver medal, earning an overall score of 14.916. Jade Carey, a member of Team USA in the 2024 Paris Olympics, also competed in the vault finals that year, finishing eighth.\n\nSkinner reflected on replacing Biles in an August 2021 interview with TODAY's Hoda Kotb, saying she was \"inspired\" by her fellow gymnast.\n\nShe opened up about how much she valued Biles' support as she replaced her in the finals.\n\n\"I was running for my second vault, and I'm like, 'Simone's cheering so loud. Oh, my gosh.' I felt like I was going to be distracted almost. I could hear them up there,\" she said. \"Even the guys' team was just so loud, it was insane, so that definitely was much needed.\"\n\nBiles and Skinner have been crossing paths throughout their gymnastics careers. They were both junior competitors in the 2011 Visa U.S. National Gymnastics Championships, and Skinner placed second to Biles at the 2015 AT&T American Cup.\n\nIn a now-deleted YouTube video reacting to the gymnastics trials in July, Skinner suggested that members of the 2024 women's gymnastics team had less talent and work ethic than previous gymnasts.\n\n\"Besides Simone, I feel like the talent and the depth just isn't like what it used to be,\" she said, according to a clip from her video shared by E! News. \"I mean, obviously a lot of girls don't work as hard.\"\n\nShe also mentioned the impact on gymnastics she perceived from the U.S. Center for SafeSport, an organization created in 2017 to address and prevent abuse in Olympic and Paralympic sports in the U.S.\n\n\"The girls just don't have the work ethic,\" Skinner said. \"And it's hard too because of SafeSport. Like, coaches can't get on athletes and they have to be really careful what they say. Which, in some ways is really good, but at the same time, to get to where you need to be in gymnastics you do have to be, I feel like, a little aggressive and a little intense.\"\n\nAfter her remarks received widespread backlash, Skinner issued an apology video in her Instagram story on July 3, saying her earlier comments had been \"misinterpreted.\"\n\n\"A lot of the stuff that I was talking about wasn't always necessarily about the current team, because I love and support all the girls that made it, and I'm so proud of them,\" she said, according to a clip of her Instagram story shared by E! News.\n\n\"It was more about going back into my own gym. Just the work ethic is different compared to when we were doing gymnastics in the M\u00e1rta (Karolyi) era,\" she continued, referencing the former team coordinator.\n\nMarta Karolyi and her husband, Hall of Fame gymnastics coach Bela Karolyi, were accused of creating a \"toxic environment\" in a lawsuit filed in 2016 that named USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar and Bela Karolyi as plaintiffs. Nassar pled guilty to abusing 10 of the more than 265 former patients who say they were molested and is serving 40 to 175 years in prison. The Karolyis deny any knowledge of the molestation.\n\nUSA Gymnastics reached a $380 million settlement with sexual abuse survivors in 2021, NBC News reported at the time. In exchange for accepting the settlement, survivors would agree to end legal claims against USA Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee and Bela and Martha Karolyi. USA Gymnastics filed for bankruptcy in 2018 after Nassar's sentencing. Lawsuits against USA Gymnastics could proceed if the organization exited bankruptcy without a deal.\n\n\"Sorry for anything that got out of context or seemed hurtful,\" Skinner went on. \"That is never my intention and seriously throughout the video, I was so pumped for the girls ... I love those girls and I'm seriously so happy for them.\"\n\nSkinner also posted an apology on X on July 6.\n\n\"I want to formally apologize to Team USA and to our gymnastic community for my comments during my recent YouTube episodes of the Gymnastics Olympic Trials,\" she wrote. \"It was not my intention to offend or disrespect any of the athletes or to take away from their hard work. Your hard work and dedication has paid off and I congratulate each and every one of you.\n\nShe also referred to abuse she says she experienced while K\u00e1rolyi was team coordinator.\n\n\"Upon reflection, I was comparing the 'Marta Era' to the current era,\" she continued. \"I am coming to terms that I have not fully dealt with the emotional and verbal abuse I endured under Marta that perhaps led to my hurtful comments. I take full responsibility for what I said and deeply apologize.\"\n\nFollowing Team USA's victory in Paris, Skinner shared a photo in her Instagram story of Biles and her teammates wearing their gold medals, captioning the image with three heart emoji.\n\nGina Chiles, the mother of U.S. gymnast Jordan Chiles, also appeared to reference Skinner's remarks on July 4 on the X platform.\n\n\"Whoa. She really said that out loud and posted it. That's something....\" she wrote.\n\nOn July 31, Team USA's Jordan Chiles posted a photo to her Instagram story of Skinner's Instagram profile. It appears to be taken from Biles' phone.\n\n\"When she blocks Simone,\" the caption reads.\n\nSkinner, on Aug. 6, posted a lengthy video to Instagram addressing Biles' Instagram caption, saying that it had led to cyberbullying and threats against herself and her family.\n\nShe opened by saying she \"sincerely hoped\" this topic wouldn't have been revisited, but things have \"really gotten out of hand.\"\n\nRead on for her full message.\n\nI sincerely hoped that this topic wouldn't need to be revisited, but unfortunately things have really gotten out of hand lately.\n\nIt's one thing to disagree with me regarding something I have said or a point I was trying to make. But it's something else entirely when that turns into cyberbullying or even worse. Watching people cheer on the bullying, which has led to threats of physical harm to me, my husband and our daughter is disgusting. So, please, at this point, I am just asking for it to just stop for the sake of my family because enough is enough.\n\nSo why I'm here is because about four weeks ago, I made a comment about work ethic and what seems to be taking place with the rising generation. To be totally clear, I take 100% responsibility for poorly articulating the point I was trying to make and the last thing I wanted was to cause harm or offend our U.S. Olympic team. I know these women are incredible, the very best of the best, and almost all of them are my former teammates who I have enjoyed very much cheering on the last few years.\n\nI posted a video apology on Instagram and I followed up with a written apology and I sent individual messages to each of the women on the team. Only Simone had responded and she told me that she was proud of me.\n\nYou guys can imagine my surprise last week when I was celebrating our team winning gold, just to see this brought up all over again by a caption on an Instagram post. If Simone truly believes that I called our team lazy and lacking talent and if that's really how she feels, I am really heartbroken over it.\n\nBut not just heartbroken because it isn't how I feel or even what I previously said, but heartbroken because Simone's latest post and others that followed it fueled another wave of hateful comments, DMs, articles and emails. Hate that includes death threats to me, my family and even my agent. So, my family and my friends don't deserve to be caught in the crossfire here. They've done nothing.\n\nSo to Simone, I am asking you directly and publicly to please put a stop to this. Please ask your followers to stop. You have been an incredible champion for mental health awareness and a lot of people need your help now.

It was more about going back into my own gym and the work ethic is different compared to when we were doing gymnastics in the Marta [Karolyi] era.\"\n\nBiles told the outlet that it \"meant a lot\" to her teammates to have \"somebody to stand up\" for them. She added that it felt like the right moment to take a stance \"because they're so young and they haven't fully stood in their power yet.\"\n\nIn the wake of Biles' post, Skinner, 27, blocked her former teammate on social media. \"Oop I've been blocked \ud83d\udc40\ud83e\udee2\ud83d\ude02,\" Biles wrote via X on Wednesday, July 31. Later that day, Chiles, 23, uploaded a snap of Skinner's profile, writing, \"When she blocks Simone.\"\n\nDays later, Skinner took to social media to explain that she posted an apology video after her initial YouTube video. Skinner also alleged that she wrote notes to each of the women on the team and only received a response from Biles.\n\n\"You guys can imagine my surprise last week when I was celebrating our team winning gold just to see this brought up all over again by a caption on an Instagram post,\" she said in an Instagram video on Tuesday. \"If Simone truly believes that I called our team lazy and lacking talent and if that's really how she feels, I am really heartbroken over it.

USA gymnastics team remain angry at MyKayla Skinner: What did you say that bothered them?\n\nMyKayla Skinner, a former Olympic gymnast, is making a heartfelt plea to fellow gymnast Simone Biles to help put an end to the cyberbullying that has recently escalated against her. The tension between the two athletes intensified after Biles made headlines for a seemingly dismissive Instagram caption celebrating her participation in the 2024 Paris Olympics. This prompted Skinner to respond with a powerful message of unity and support.\n\nIn her Instagram video, Skinner expressed her profound love for her country and emphasized that she does not want to detract from the accomplishments of other athletes. She stated: \"I love our country and don't want to take anything away from our athletes. Let's use this time to build each other up, not tear others down.\"\n\nHowever, Skinner revealed that the fallout from Biles' comments has led to an overwhelming wave of online hate directed at her. She described the situation as having gotten \"out of hand,\" noting that the threats have not only targeted her but also extended to her husband, Jonas Harmer, and their 10-month-old daughter, Charlotte.\n\nIn her emotional appeal, Skinner lamented: \"Watching people cheer on the bullying ... is disgusting. So please at this point, I'm just asking for it to stop for the sake of my family because enough is enough.\"\n\nThe retired gymnast also reflected on her past comments regarding Biles' teammates -Jade Carey, Jordan Chiles, Sunisa Lee, and Hazyl Rivera- where she suggested they lacked work ethic in a June YouTube video. This remark seems to have fueled the backlash she's now facing.\n\nSkinner's situation serves as a stark reminder of the darker side of social media and how quickly things can spiral out of control. Skinner's call for Biles to help stop the cyberbullying is not just about her personal experience; it's a broader appeal for compassion and understanding in a sport that should be about support and teamwork.\n\nAs the gymnastics community watches this unfold, Skinner's message resonates deeply: athletes should uplift one another rather than contribute to a culture of negativity.

With Jonathan Marchessault, Brett Pesce, and Steven Stamkos all joining a Predators team that has been trending upward for several seasons, they will be one of the toughest teams to beat when it gets into the postseason, and they may be a bigger force to be reckoned with than many fans expect right now. One big reason they may be a sleeper pick to win the Stanley Cup this season is their elite goaltender Juuse Saros, who has easily been the best player on the Predators for the past few seasons, and he was rewarded with a massive extension worth $7.74 million annually.\n\nRelated: Oilers Should Consider a Reunion With Taylor Hall at 2025 Trade Deadline\n\nWith the Predators expected to turn themselves from outsiders to contenders this season, they went out and made the moves they needed to confidently say they'd be able to make a strong run. Another team looking to make a deep run is the Edmonton Oilers, who made it to the Stanley Cup Final last season but lost in seven games to the Florida Panthers. The Oilers were backstopped by goaltender Stuart Skinner, who is just 25 years old and has shown signs of being one of the strongest goaltenders in the NHL. With two years left on his current contract, the Oilers shouldn't be concerned just yet about re-signing him, but that time will be coming soon.\n\nOne thing that surprised a few fans was that Skinner recently changed agents. Sometimes when players change agents, it's because they want a trade or are prepared to demand big money, so some Oilers fans being concerned is not a surprise. However, there is nothing to worry about right now. Skinner is an Alberta-born goaltender who has made it clear previously that he wants to be an Oiler for life, so switching agents seems to be a simple formality that will benefit him long-term. When the day does come that Skinner begins negotiating an extension though, Saros may be a direct comparable.\n\nOilers fans haven't considered what a Skinner extension will look like since he isn't an unrestricted free agent (UFA) until after the 2025-26 season. Still, there is someone that they can compare Skinner to since they have had similar stats in recent seasons, and it's Saros. Last season, Saros played 64 games where he won 35 of them and posted a 2.86 goals-against average (GAA) and a .906 save percentage (SV%). Skinner on the other hand played 59 games, winning 36 of them and posted a 2.62 GAA and a .905 SV%. Their stats in previous seasons have been similar too, but it can be argued Skinner has had a stronger team in front of him leading to slightly better stats.\n\nThere does happen to be a bit of an issue with this when it comes to Skinner's next contract. Saros could be used as a comparable when it comes to what Skinner asks for money-wise. While most Oilers fans would likely predict Skinner gets around $5-5.25 million per season on a long-term extension, it's clear that Skinner being younger than Saros with more playoff success and a slight edge in overall statistics could be used to Skinner's advantage during negotiations, driving up his price.\n\nWhile I would lean toward Skinner being willing to take a pay cut to stay in Edmonton, the number I was thinking originally may have gone up since the Saros extension was announced. Saros' extension coming in at $7.74 million annually could bring Skinner's ask up big time. He's probably worth the same as Saros considering the age and potential, as well as the comparable with playoff success. I don't think Skinner gets more than Saros, but I wouldn't be surprised if his new contract comes in around $6-6.75 million annually.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jesse_courville_lynch@thehockeywriters.com", "name": "Jesse Courville-Lynch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juuse_Saros", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juuse Saros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_Predators", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nashville Predators"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Marchessault", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Marchessault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Hall", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Stamkos", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steven Stamkos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Skinner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stuart Skinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goals_against_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goals against average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Stuart-Skinner-Oilers-3-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795884", "eventUri": "eng-9795884", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

In response, a high-level meeting was held to implement preventive measures. The government has activated its Nipah protocol and is working to control the outbreak. The virus, which has caused previous outbreaks in Kerala, is transmitted from animals to humans and can result in severe illness. Public health measures emphasize hygiene and awareness to prevent further spread.Kerala Health Minister Veena George announced on Saturday that a 14-year-old boy from Malappuram district has tested positive for the Nipah virus. This confirmation follows an urgent high-level meeting convened to address a suspected Nipah infection in the northern part of Malappuram district. The boy is currently receiving treatment in a private hospital in Kozhikode, and his samples have been sent to a central laboratory for comprehensive testing.\n\nIn response to the suspected case, the Kerala government has initiated preventive measures in accordance with the Nipah virus protocol. The meeting included senior officials such as the health secretary, National Health Mission state director, district collectors of Kozhikode and Malappuram, and the health director. Minister Veena George is expected to visit Malappuram to personally oversee and lead the Nipah prevention efforts.\n\nThe statement from the Health Minister's office highlighted that while final test results are still pending, immediate steps have been taken to manage the situation. The SOPs established by the government for Nipah virus control are being actively implemented. The meeting focused on reviewing the current situation and coordinating actions to curb the virus's spread.\n\nKerala has faced Nipah outbreaks on four previous occasions: in Kozhikode in 2018, 2021, and 2023, and in Ernakulam in 2019. The Nipah virus has also been detected in bats across several districts including Kozhikode, Wayanad, Idukki, Malappuram, and Ernakulam. The virus is zoonotic, meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans, and can also spread through contaminated food or direct contact with infected animals.\n\nThe Nipah virus has an incubation period that ranges from 4 to 14 days but can extend up to 45 days in some cases. Initial symptoms include fever, headache, drowsiness, respiratory issues, and muscle pain. The virus has a high case fatality rate, estimated between 40% and 75%, depending on the outbreak and regional healthcare capabilities.\n\nMinister George emphasized the importance of public caution and detailed several key preventive measures. She urged the public not to destroy bat habitats, as this could increase the risk of virus transmission. She also advised against consuming fruits that have been bitten by bats and drinking honey from banana peels, both of which could be contaminated. \"She recommended that hands should be thoroughly washed with soap and water if they come into contact with bats, their excrement, or objects they have bitten. She also stressed the importance of educating children about these precautions to ensure community-wide awareness and safety,\" the statement said.\n\nIn previous outbreaks, such as the one reported on May 19, 2018, in Kozhikode, the virus resulted in 17 deaths and 18 confirmed cases, underscoring the critical need for vigilance and effective public health responses.", "source": {"uri":

Additionally, she advised against consuming fruits that have been bitten by birds and drinking honey from banana peels, both of which could be contaminated by bats.\"\n\nVeena George also highlighted the necessity of proper hygiene practices.\n\n\"She recommended that hands should be thoroughly washed with soap and water if they come into contact with bats, their excrement, or objects they have bitten. She also stressed the importance of educating children about these precautions to ensure community-wide awareness and safety.\"\n\nThe Nipah virus, transmitted from animals to humans, can result in severe illness and fatalities.

The officials also reviewed the current situation and the steps taken so far to control the outbreak.\n\nMinister Veena George reached Malappuram to lead the efforts to control the outbreak. The government has also constituted committees to oversee the implementation of the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for Nipah virus control.\n\nThe meeting was attended by top officials, including the Additional Chief Secretary of the Health Department, the Director of the National Health Mission, and the District Collectors of Malappuram and Kozhikode.\n\nAs per officials, the samples of the suspected patient were sent to the Pune virology lab.\n\nEarlier last month, the Kerala Health Minister announced that Nipah prevention efforts will be intensified in the state, particularly during the critical months of May to September, when the virus is most likely to spread.\n\nMinister George emphasized the importance of extreme caution and outlined several key preventive measures.\n\nShe urged the public not to destroy bat habitats, as disturbing them could increase the risk of virus transmission. Additionally, she advised against consuming fruits that have been bitten by birds and drinking honey from banana peels, both of which could be contaminated by bats.\n\nVeena George also highlighted the necessity of proper hygiene, recommending that hands should be thoroughly washed with soap and water if they come into contact with bats, their excrement, or objects they have bitten.\n\nShe stressed the importance of educating children about these precautions to ensure community-wide awareness and safety.\n\nThe Nipah virus, transmitted from animals to humans, can lead to severe illness and fatalities.\n\nOn May 19, 2018, a Nipah virus disease (NiV) outbreak was reported in Kozhikode district of Kerala. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), there were 17 deaths and 18 confirmed cases as of June 1, 2018. The two affected districts were Kozhikode and Mallapuram.\n\nThe Nipah outbreak reported in Kozhikode and Malappuram districts of Kerala in May 2018 was the third Nipah virus outbreak in India, the earlier being in 2001 and 2007, both in West Bengal.

While the initial result suggests an infection, the state is awaiting confirmation from the National Institute of Virology in Pune, which is conducting further tests to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nThe infected 14-year-old boy is receiving medical care at a hospital in Kozhikode, and the government, under the guidance of Minister Veena George, is diligently tracing and gathering information on all individuals who have come into contact with him. Moreover, a control room has been set up in the district to coordinate and monitor the situation.\n\nRestrictions have been imposed in the Pandikkad and Anakkayam panchayats. Currently, 214 individuals are under observation, with 60 classified as high-risk.\n\nThe state is anxiously awaiting the results from the Pune virology lab, which are expected to confirm the diagnosis on Sunday afternoon. The minister reported that the child's condition has taken a critical turn, necessitating a transfer from a private hospital in Perinthalmanna to a specialized medical facility in Kozhikode, where the boy is receiving intensive care.\n\nThe child's health began to deteriorate five days ago, starting with a fever that prompted a visit to a pediatrician in Malappuram. As the fever persisted, he was admitted to a nearby private hospital, and later transferred to Moulana Hospital in Perinthalmanna and then to another private hospital in Kozhikode as his condition continued to worsen. Currently, the child's parents and uncle are under close medical surveillance, in accordance with the health department's guidelines.\n\nKerala has a history of Nipah virus outbreaks, dating back to 2018 when 18 cases were reported in Kozhikode and Malappuram, resulting in 17 fatalities. The state has since experienced recurring outbreaks, with cases reported in 2019, 2021, and 2023. The 2021 outbreak claimed the life of a 12-year-old boy, while the 2023 outbreak saw six cases, with two fatalities.\n\nFollowing the confirmation of Nipah, the Health Department opened a control cell in Malappuram.\n\nNipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic virus that transmits from animals to humans and can also spread through contaminated food or direct human-to-human contact. Infected individuals may experience a range of symptoms, from asymptomatic (subclinical) infection to acute respiratory illness and fatal encephalitis. The virus can also cause severe disease in animals, such as bats and pigs leading to significant economic losses for farmers.", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veena_George", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Veena George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozhikode", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kozhikode"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kozhikode"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perinthalmanna", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Perinthalmanna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perinthalmanna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malappuram", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Malappuram"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Malappuram"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nipah_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nipah virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_and_Family_Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Health and Family Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Virology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Institute of Virology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anakkayam", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anakkayam"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malappuram_district", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malappuram district"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Malappuram district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram_panchayat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gram panchayat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intensive care unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pediatrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zoonosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asymptomatic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Encephalitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://static-ai.asianetnews.com/images/01j382gq1e6yz76edp39srke2x/nipah-veena.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749040", "eventUri": "eng-9749040", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 70, "textEnd": 77}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

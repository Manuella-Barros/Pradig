Trea Turner and Brandon Marsh doubled for the Phillies, who improved their MLB-best record to 54-28. S\u00e1nchez (6-3), making his second start since signing a four-year, $22.5 million contract extension, allowed three hits, struck out nine and walked none for his first career complete game. The 27-year-old lefty retired 14 consecutive batters before Otto Lopez\u2019s leadoff single in the eighth. Lopez was the lone batter to reach second base after advancing on a groundout. \u201cIt was incredible,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said through an interpreter. \u201cNothing is impossible if you want to do something. You just have to focus and work really hard.\u201d S\u00e1nchez, who lowered his ERA to 2.41, threw 73 of his 101 pitches for strikes. \u201cHe\u2019s come so far,\u201d Phillies manager Rob Thomson said. \u201cNow, he\u2019s a dominant pitcher in major league baseball. He\u2019d be a number one on a lot of teams.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s one of the better young pitchers in the league,\u201d Marlins manager Skip Schumaker said. After putting runners on first and third with no out in the fifth, Philadelphia went ahead 1-0 on Stott\u2019s groundout off Kyle Tyler (0-1) that scored Whit Merrifield. The Phillies tacked on a run in the eighth. Johan Rojas led off with a base hit to center field that the speedy outfielder turned into a double when center fielder Vidal Bruj\u00e1n jogged to the ball. Rojas went to third on Calvin Faucher\u2019s wild pitch and scored on Stott\u2019s sacrifice fly to left. Before the game, Philadelphia placed Harper and Schwarber on the 10-day injured list after both were hurt in Thursday night\u2019s loss to Miami. Harper strained his left hamstring running the bases in the ninth inning, and Schwarber strained his left groin making a throw from left field in the eighth. \u201cBummed to go on the IL,\u201d Harper said before the game. \u201cNever wanted that to happen, obviously. But it was the best decision for our team. Hopefully get back in the smartest way possible and quickest way as well.\u201d Harper wouldn\u2019t specify a timetable for his return, only saying he hopes to be back as soon as possible. The two-time MVP is batting .303 with 20 homers and 58 RBIs. He extended his hitting streak to 12 consecutive games with an RBI double in the first inning on Thursday. TRAINER\u2019S ROOM Phillies: To take Harper and Schwarber\u2019s places on the roster, the Phillies recalled infielder Kody Clemens and Rojas from Triple-A Lehigh Valley.

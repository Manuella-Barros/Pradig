In the West, they are seen by governments and activists as wrongly detained political prisoners.\n\n\"We all hope that these are good signs,\" Ivan Pavlov, a prominent human rights activist who fled Russia and is now based in Prague, told Reuters.\n\n\"We hope that they (the authorities) have probably taken them all out of their prisons to gather them together in one place in preparation for an exchange.\"\n\nPavlov, whom Russian authorities have designated \"a foreign agent,\" said the prisoners were most likely to have been taken to Moscow's Lefortovo Prison.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin would then need to formally pardon them before they were put on a plane to a destination in Europe, which Pavlov said could be in Germany.\n\nUnder Russian law, the prison service does not comment on where prisoners are being moved to. Only the prisoners themselves can do so in writing once they have reached their destination or are able to.\n\nThe reported prison moves follow the unusually swift conviction 19 July of US journalist Evan Gershkovich on espionage charges he denies.

She denies wrongdoing.\n\nThe Kremlin, when asked on Tuesday (30 July) about the possibility of a prisoner exchange that would involve Gershkovich, declined to comment.\n\nThere are numerous other US nationals behind bars in Russia, including Paul Whelan, a former marine convicted of spying, a charge he denied, and Marc Fogel, who was convicted on drugs charges.\n\nIn Belarus meanwhile, President Alexander Lukashenko, a close Putin ally, on Tuesday pardoned Rico Krieger, a German citizen sentenced to death on terrorism charges, again with unusual haste and state media coverage.\n\nAmong those individuals Moscow has signalled it would like to get back in any exchange with the West is Vadim Krasikov, a Russian serving a life sentence in Germany for murder - an exchange that would require Berlin to get someone like Krieger in return.\n\nThe US is also holding at least two Russian nationals, Vladimir Dunaev and Roman Seleznev, convicted on serious cybercrime charges who could figure in the swap.\n\n\"It appears that we are on the cusp of a very large-scale exchange with the Americans (and not just the Americans),\" said Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.\n\n\"I believe the pressure factor in the exchange about to take place was timing,\" she wrote on her Telegram channel.\n\n\"(US President Joe Biden needs to finish his term with dignity.

In the West, they are seen by governments and activists as wrongly detained political prisoners.\n\n\"We all hope that these are good signs,\" Ivan Pavlov, a prominent human rights lawyer who fled Russia and is now based in Prague, told Reuters.\n\n\"We hope that they (the authorities) have probably taken them all out of their prisons to gather them together in one place in preparation for an exchange.\"\n\nPavlov, whom Russian authorities have designated \"a foreign agent,\" said the prisoners were most likely to have been taken to Moscow's Lefortovo Prison.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin would then need to formally pardon them before they were put on a plane to a destination in Europe, which Pavlov said could be in Germany.\n\nUNUSUALLY SWIFT CONVICTIONS\n\nUnder Russian law, the prison service does not comment on where prisoners are being moved to. Only the prisoners themselves can do so in writing once they have reached their destination or are able to.\n\nThe reported prison moves follow the unusually swift conviction on July 19 of U.S. journalist Evan Gershkovich on espionage charges he denies. He was handed 16 years in jail and Russia has already confirmed that talks about his possible exchange have taken place.\n\nAlsu Kurmasheva, a Russian-American journalist for U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, was also convicted in unusual haste in a secret trial on the same day and sentenced to 6-1/2 years in prison for spreading false information about the Russian army. She denies wrongdoing.\n\nThe Kremlin, when asked on Tuesday about the possibility of a prisoner exchange that would involve Gershkovich, declined to comment.\n\nThere are numerous other U.S. nationals behind bars in Russia, including Paul Whelan, a former marine convicted of spying, a charge he denied, and Marc Fogel, who was convicted on drugs charges.\n\nIn Belarus meanwhile, President Alexander Lukashenko, a close Putin ally, on Tuesday pardoned Rico Krieger, a German citizen sentenced to death on terrorism charges, again with unusual haste and state media coverage.\n\nAmong those individuals Moscow has signalled it would like to get back in any exchange with the West is Vadim Krasikov, a Russian serving a life sentence in Germany for murder - an exchange that would require Berlin to get someone like Krieger in return.\n\nThe U.S. is also holding at least two Russian nationals, Vladimir Dunaev and Roman Seleznev, convicted on serious cybercrime charges who could figure in the swap.\n\n\"It appears that we are on the cusp of a very large-scale exchange with the Americans (and not just the Americans),\" said Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.\n\n\"I believe the pressure factor in the exchange about to take place was timing,\" she wrote on her Telegram channel.\n\n\"(U.S. President Joe Biden needs to finish his term with dignity. Putin was also interested in a deal before the election, as after the election all the extremely complex painstaking preparatory work, involving several states, could be buried.\"\n\nPavlov, the rights lawyer, said the exchange would be carried out in an atmosphere of secrecy.\n\n\"The main thing is that they (the people detained in Russia) will get their freedom. They are hostages and political prisoners and the important thing is to get as many of them out as possible,\" he said.

In the West, they are seen by governments and activists as wrongly detained political prisoners.\n\n\"We all hope that these are good signs,\" Ivan Pavlov, a prominent human rights activist who fled Russia and is now based in Prague, told Reuters.\n\n\"We hope that they (the authorities) have probably taken them all out of their prisons to gather them together in one place in preparation for an exchange.\"\n\nPavlov, whom Russian authorities have designated \"a foreign agent,\" said the prisoners were most likely to have been taken to Moscow's Lefortovo Prison.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin would then need to formally pardon them before they were put on a plane to a destination in Europe, which Pavlov said could be in Germany.\n\nUNUSUALLY SWIFT CONVICTIONS\n\nUnder Russian law, the prison service does not comment on where prisoners are being moved to. Only the prisoners themselves can do so in writing once they have reached their destination or are able to.\n\nThe reported prison moves follow the unusually swift conviction on July 19 of U.S. journalist Evan Gershkovich on espionage charges he denies. He was handed 16 years in jail and Russia has already confirmed that talks about his possible exchange have taken place.\n\nAlsu Kurmasheva, a Russian-American journalist for U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, was also convicted in unusual haste in a secret trial on the same day and sentenced to 6-1/2 years in prison for spreading false information about the Russian army. She denies wrongdoing.\n\nThe Kremlin, when asked on Tuesday about the possibility of a prisoner exchange that would involve Gershkovich, declined to comment.\n\nThere are numerous other U.S. nationals behind bars in Russia, including Paul Whelan, a former marine convicted of spying, a charge he denied, and Marc Fogel, who was convicted on drugs charges.\n\nIn Belarus meanwhile, President Alexander Lukashenko, a close Putin ally, on Tuesday pardoned Rico Krieger, a German citizen sentenced to death on terrorism charges, again with unusual haste and state media coverage.\n\nAmong those individuals Moscow has signalled it would like to get back in any exchange with the West is Vadim Krasikov, a Russian serving a life sentence in Germany for murder - an exchange that would require Berlin to get someone like Krieger in return.\n\nThe U.S. is also holding at least two Russian nationals, Vladimir Dunaev and Roman Seleznev, convicted on serious cybercrime charges who could figure in the swap.\n\n\"It appears that we are on the cusp of a very large-scale exchange with the Americans (and not just the Americans),\" said Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.\n\n\"I believe the pressure factor in the exchange about to take place was timing,\" she wrote on her Telegram channel.\n\n\"(U.S. President Joe Biden needs to finish his term with dignity. Putin was also interested in a deal before the election, as after the election all the extremely complex painstaking preparatory work, involving several states, could be buried.\"\n\nPavlov, the rights lawyer, said the exchange would be carried out in an atmosphere of secrecy.\n\n\"The main thing is that they (the people detained in Russia) will get their freedom. They are hostages and political prisoners and the important thing is to get as many of them out as possible,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Tomasz Janowski)", "source": {"uri":

Reuters could not confirm that.\n\nPaul Whelan, a former US marine, and Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Russian-British dissident, both jailed in Russia, have suddenly disappeared from view, their lawyers said a day earlier, after at least seven Russian dissidents were unexpectedly moved from their prisons in recent days.\n\nOn Thursday, there were unconfirmed Russian media reports that another dissident, opposition activist Vadim Ostanin, had been removed from his Siberian prison and moved to Moscow.\n\nOnline Russian media outlet \"Agenstvo\" has reported that at least six special Russian government planes have flown in recent days to and from regions where prisons holding dissidents are located.\n\nMeanwhile, a lawyer for Alexander Vinnik, a Russian man held in the United States, declined on Wednesday to confirm the whereabouts of his client to the state RIA news agency \"until the exchange takes place.\" But the lawyer, Arkady Bukh, was quoted by RIA as saying he'd been told by lawyers representing people imprisoned in Russia that they were \"en route\" to unknown locations.\n\nRIA also reported that four Russians jailed in the United States had disappeared from a database of prisoners operated by the US Federal Bureau of Prisons. It named them as Vinnik, Maxim Marchenko, Vadim Konoshchenok and Vladislav Klyushin.\n\nThe US is also holding at least two other Russian nationals, Vladimir Dunaev and Roman Seleznev, convicted of serious cybercrimes, who could also figure.\n\nThe Kremlin has declined to say whether an exchange is looming, as has Russia's embassy in Washington, and there has been no comment from Western countries. Such exchanges are typically shrouded in secrecy until they happen.\n\nDissidents inside Russia whose supporters say they have been told that they have been suddenly moved in recent days include opposition politician Ilya Yashin, human rights activist Oleg Orlov and Daniil Krinari, who was convicted of secretly cooperating with foreign governments.\n\nOthers to have abruptly gone missing in the prison system include German-Russian citizen Kevin Lik, convicted of treason, opposition activists Liliya Chanysheva and Ksenia Fadeeva, and anti-war artist Sasha Skochilenko.\n\nIvan Pavlov, a prominent Russian human rights lawyer now living in Prague who founded Pervy Otdel, said the disappearance of so many people with similar profiles suggested the authorities were gathering them, probably in Moscow, for the exchange.\n\nHe said President Vladimir Putin would need to pardon them before their exchange, a necessary formality. Media outlet \"Important Stories\" drew attention to the fact that Putin, according to a government website, had signed a number of secret decrees on July 30 which it said could be prisoner pardons.\n\nIn December 2022, Russia traded basketball star Brittney Griner, sentenced to nine years for having vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage, for arms dealer Viktor Bout, serving a 25-year sentence in the US\n\nThe biggest prisoner swap since the Cold War took place in 2010, involving 14 people in total.\n\nWEST SEES DETAINEES AS POLITICAL PRISONERS\n\nIn the West, the dissidents are seen by governments and activists as wrongfully detained political prisoners. All have, for different reasons, been designated by Moscow as dangerous extremists.\n\nThe exchange is also expected to include two journalists.\n\nOn July 19, Gershkovich was convicted unusually swiftly on espionage charges that he denies. He was handed 16 years in jail and Russia has already confirmed talks about his possible exchange.\n\nAlsu Kurmasheva, a Russian-American journalist for US-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, was also convicted in a secret trial the same day and sentenced to 6-1/2 years, accused of spreading false information about the Russian army. She denies wrongdoing.\n\nOther US nationals behind bars in Russia include former schoolteacher Marc Fogel, convicted for possessing marijuana, which he said he used for medical reasons.\n\nIn Belarus, meanwhile, President Alexander Lukashenko, a close Putin ally, on Tuesday pardoned Rico Krieger, a German sentenced to death on terrorism charges, again with unusual haste and state media coverage.\n\nAmong those Moscow has signaled it wants is Vadim Krasikov, a Russian serving life in Germany for murdering an exiled Chechen-Georgian dissident in a Berlin park.\n\nA Slovenian court on Wednesday sentenced two Russians to time served for espionage and using fake identities, and said they would be deported, the state news agency STA reported, a move a Slovenian TV channel said was

Reuters could not immediately confirm that.\n\nMeanwhile, a lawyer for Alexander Vinnik, a Russian man held in the United States, declined to confirm the whereabouts of his client to the state RIA news agency \"until the exchange takes place.\" But the lawyer, Arkady Bukh, was quoted by RIA as saying he'd been told by lawyers representing people imprisoned in Russia that they were \"en route.\"\n\nShrouded in secrecy\n\nRIA also reported that four Russians jailed in the United States had disappeared from a database of prisoners operated by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons. It named them as Vinnik, Maxim Marchenko, Vadim Konoshchenko and Vladislav Klyushin.\n\nThe U.S. is also holding at least two other Russian nationals, Vladimir Dunaev and Roman Seleznev, convicted of serious cybercrimes, who could also figure.\n\nThe Kremlin has declined to say whether an exchange is looming as has Russia's embassy in Washington, and there has been no comment from Western countries. Such exchanges are typically shrouded in secrecy until they happen.\n\nDissidents inside Russia whose supporters say they have been told that they have been suddenly moved in recent days include opposition politician Ilya Yashin, human rights activist Oleg Orlov and Daniil Krinari, who was convicted of secretly cooperating with foreign governments.\n\nOthers to have abruptly gone missing in the prison system include German-Russian citizen Kevin Lik, convicted of treason, opposition activists Liliya Chanysheva and Ksenia Fadeeva, and anti-war artist Sasha Skochilenko.\n\nIvan Pavlov, a prominent Russian human rights lawyer now living in Prague, said the disappearance of so many people with similar profiles suggested the authorities were gathering them, probably in Moscow, for the exchange.\n\nHe said President Vladimir Putin would need to pardon them before their exchange, a necessary formality.\n\nIn December 2022, Russia traded basketball star Brittney Griner, sentenced to nine years for having vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage, for arms dealer Viktor Bout, serving a 25-year sentence in the U.S.\n\nThe biggest prisoner swap since the Cold War took place in 2010, involving 14 people in total.\n\nWest sees detainees as political prisoners\n\nIn the West, the dissidents are seen by governments and activists as wrongfully detained political prisoners. All have, for different reasons, been designated by Moscow as dangerous extremists.\n\nThe exchange is also expected to include two journalists.\n\nOn July 19, American journalist Evan Gershkovich was convicted unusually swiftly on espionage charges that he denies. He was handed 16 years in jail and Russia has already confirmed talks about his possible exchange.\n\nAlsu Kurmasheva, a Russian-American journalist for U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, was also convicted in unusual haste in a secret trial the same day and sentenced to 6-1/2 years, accused of spreading false information about the Russian army. She denies wrongdoing.\n\nOther U.S. nationals behind bars in Russia include former schoolteacher Marc Fogel, convicted in 2022 for possessing marijuana, which he said he used for medical reasons.\n\nIn Belarus, meanwhile, President Alexander Lukashenko, a close Putin ally, on Tuesday pardoned Rico Krieger, a German sentenced to death on terrorism charges, again with unusual haste and state media coverage.\n\nAmong those Moscow has signalled it wants is Vadim Krasikov, a Russian serving life in Germany for murdering a former Chechen militant.\n\nA Slovenian court on Wednesday sentenced two Russians to time served for espionage and using fake identities, and said they would be deported, the state news agency STA reported, a move a Slovenian TV channel said was part of the wider exchange.\n\nReuters could not independently confirm that.\n\nReporting by Andrew Osborn in Moscow and Filipp Lebedev and Lucy Papachristou in London; Writing by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Kevin

Reuters could not confirm that.\n\nPaul Whelan, a former U.S. marine, and Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Russian-British dissident, both jailed in Russia, have suddenly disappeared from view, their lawyers said a day earlier, after at least seven Russian dissidents were unexpectedly moved from their prisons in recent days.\n\nOn Thursday, there were unconfirmed Russian media reports that another dissident, opposition activist Vadim Ostanin, had been removed from his Siberian prison and moved to Moscow.\n\nOnline Russian media outlet \"Agenstvo\" has reported that at least six special Russian government planes have flown in recent days to and from regions where prisons holding dissidents are located.\n\nMeanwhile, a lawyer for Alexander Vinnik, a Russian man held in the United States, declined on Wednesday to confirm the whereabouts of his client to the state RIA news agency \"until the exchange takes place.\" But the lawyer, Arkady Bukh, was quoted by RIA as saying he'd been told by lawyers representing people imprisoned in Russia that they were \"en route\" to unknown locations.\n\nRIA also reported that four Russians jailed in the United States had disappeared from a database of prisoners operated by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons. It named them as Vinnik, Maxim Marchenko, Vadim Konoshchenok and Vladislav Klyushin.\n\nThe U.S. is also holding at least two other Russian nationals, Vladimir Dunaev and Roman Seleznev, convicted of serious cybercrimes, who could also figure.\n\nThe Kremlin has declined to say whether an exchange is looming, as has Russia's embassy in Washington, and there has been no comment from Western countries. Such exchanges are typically shrouded in secrecy until they happen.\n\nDissidents inside Russia whose supporters say they have been told that they have been suddenly moved in recent days include opposition politician Ilya Yashin, human rights activist Oleg Orlov and Daniil Krinari, who was convicted of secretly cooperating with foreign governments.\n\nOthers to have abruptly gone missing in the prison system include German-Russian citizen Kevin Lik, convicted of treason, opposition activists Liliya Chanysheva and Ksenia Fadeeva, and anti-war artist Sasha Skochilenko.\n\nIvan Pavlov, a prominent Russian human rights lawyer now living in Prague who founded Pervy Otdel, said the disappearance of so many people with similar profiles suggested the authorities were gathering them, probably in Moscow, for the exchange.\n\nHe said President Vladimir Putin would need to pardon them before their exchange, a necessary formality. Media outlet \"Important Stories\" drew attention to the fact that Putin, according to a government website, had signed a number of secret decrees on July 30 which it said could be prisoner pardons.\n\nIn December 2022, Russia traded basketball star Brittney Griner, sentenced to nine years for having vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage, for arms dealer Viktor Bout, serving a 25-year sentence in the U.S.\n\nThe biggest prisoner swap since the Cold War took place in 2010, involving 14 people in total.\n\nWEST SEES DETAINEES AS POLITICAL PRISONERS\n\nIn the West, the dissidents are seen by governments and activists as wrongfully detained political prisoners. All have, for different reasons, been designated by Moscow as dangerous extremists.\n\nThe exchange is also expected to include two journalists.\n\nOn July 19, Gershkovich was convicted unusually swiftly on espionage charges that he denies. He was handed 16 years in jail and Russia has already confirmed talks about his possible exchange.\n\nAlsu Kurmasheva, a Russian-American journalist for U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, was also convicted in a secret trial the same day and sentenced to 6-1/2 years, accused of spreading false information about the Russian army. She denies wrongdoing.\n\nOther U.S. nationals behind bars in Russia include former schoolteacher Marc Fogel, convicted for possessing marijuana, which he said he used for medical reasons.\n\nIn Belarus, meanwhile, President Alexander Lukashenko, a close Putin ally, on Tuesday pardoned Rico Krieger, a German sentenced to death on terrorism charges, again with unusual haste and state media coverage.\n\nAmong those Moscow has signalled it wants is Vadim Krasikov, a Russian serving life in Germany for murdering an exiled Chechen-Georgian dissident in a Berlin park.\n\nA Slovenian court on Wednesday sentenced two Russians to time served for espionage and using fake identities, and said they would be deported, the state news agency STA reported, a move a Slovenian TV channel said was part of the wider exchange.\n\nReuters could not independently confirm that.\n\n(Reporting by Andrew Osborn in Moscow and Filipp Lebedev and Lucy Papachristou in London; Writing by Andrew Osborn;

Reuters could not immediately confirm that.\n\nMeanwhile, a lawyer for Alexander Vinnik, a Russian man held in the United States, declined to confirm the whereabouts of his client to the state RIA news agency \"until the exchange takes place.\" But the lawyer, Arkady Bukh, was quoted by RIA as saying he'd been told by lawyers representing people imprisoned in Russia that they were \"en route.\"\n\nShrouded in secrecy\n\nRIA also reported that four Russians jailed in the United States had disappeared from a database of prisoners operated by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons. It named them as Vinnik, Maxim Marchenko, Vadim Konoshchenko and Vladislav Klyushin.\n\nThe U.S. is also holding at least two other Russian nationals, Vladimir Dunaev and Roman Seleznev, convicted of serious cybercrimes, who could also figure.\n\nThe Kremlin has declined to say whether an exchange is looming as has Russia's embassy in Washington, and there has been no comment from Western countries. Such exchanges are typically shrouded in secrecy until they happen.\n\nDissidents inside Russia whose supporters say they have been told that they have been suddenly moved in recent days include opposition politician Ilya Yashin, human rights activist Oleg Orlov and Daniil Krinari, who was convicted of secretly cooperating with foreign governments.\n\nOthers to have abruptly gone missing in the prison system include German-Russian citizen Kevin Lik, convicted of treason, opposition activists Liliya Chanysheva and Ksenia Fadeeva, and anti-war artist Sasha Skochilenko.\n\nIvan Pavlov, a prominent Russian human rights lawyer now living in Prague, said the disappearance of so many people with similar profiles suggested the authorities were gathering them, probably in Moscow, for the exchange.\n\nHe said President Vladimir Putin would need to pardon them before their exchange, a necessary formality.\n\nIn December 2022, Russia traded basketball star Brittney Griner, sentenced to nine years for having vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage, for arms dealer Viktor Bout, serving a 25-year sentence in the U.S.\n\nIn the West, the dissidents are seen by governments and activists as wrongfully detained political prisoners. All have, for different reasons, been designated by Moscow as dangerous extremists.\n\nThe exchange is also expected to include two journalists.\n\nOn July 19, American journalist Evan Gershkovich was convicted unusually swiftly on espionage charges that he denies. He was handed 16 years in jail and Russia has already confirmed talks about his possible exchange.\n\nAlsu Kurmasheva, a Russian-American journalist for U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, was also convicted in unusual haste in a secret trial the same day and sentenced to 6-1/2 years, accused of spreading false information about the Russian army. She denies wrongdoing.\n\nOther U.S. nationals behind bars in Russia include former schoolteacher Marc Fogel, convicted in 2022 for possessing marijuana, which he said he used for medical reasons.\n\nIn Belarus, meanwhile, President Alexander Lukashenko, a close Putin ally, on Tuesday pardoned Rico Krieger, a German sentenced to death on terrorism charges, again with unusual haste and state media coverage.\n\nAmong those Moscow has signalled it wants is Vadim Krasikov, a Russian serving life in Germany for murdering a former Chechen militant.\n\nA Slovenian court on Wednesday

Reuters could not immediately confirm that.\n\nMeanwhile, a lawyer for Alexander Vinnik, a Russian man held in the United States, declined to confirm the whereabouts of his client to the state RIA news agency \"until the exchange takes place.\" But the lawyer, Arkady Bukh, was quoted by RIA as saying he'd been told by lawyers representing people imprisoned in Russia that they were \"en route.\"\n\nRIA also reported that four Russians jailed in the United States had disappeared from a database of prisoners operated by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons. It named them as Vinnik, Maxim Marchenko, Vadim Konoshchenko and Vladislav Klyushin.\n\nThe U.S. is also holding at least two other Russian nationals, Vladimir Dunaev and Roman Seleznev, convicted of serious cybercrimes, who could also figure.\n\nThe Kremlin has declined to say whether an exchange is looming as has Russia's embassy in Washington, and there has been no comment from Western countries. Such exchanges are typically shrouded in secrecy until they happen.\n\nDissidents inside Russia whose supporters say they have been told that they have been suddenly moved in recent days include opposition politician Ilya Yashin, human rights activist Oleg Orlov and Daniil Krinari, who was convicted of secretly cooperating with foreign governments.\n\nOthers to have abruptly gone missing in the prison system include German-Russian citizen Kevin Lik, convicted of treason, opposition activists Liliya Chanysheva and Ksenia Fadeeva, and anti-war artist Sasha Skochilenko.\n\nIvan Pavlov, a prominent Russian human rights lawyer now living in Prague, said the disappearance of so many people with similar profiles suggested the authorities were gathering them, probably in Moscow, for the exchange.\n\nHe said President Vladimir Putin would need to pardon them before their exchange, a necessary formality.\n\nIn December 2022, Russia traded basketball star Brittney Griner, sentenced to nine years for having vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage, for arms dealer Viktor Bout, serving a 25-year sentence in the U.S.\n\nThe biggest prisoner swap since the Cold War took place in 2010, involving 14 people in total.\n\nWEST SEES DETAINEES AS POLITICAL PRISONERS\n\nIn the West, the dissidents are seen by governments and activists as wrongfully detained political prisoners. All have, for different reasons, been designated by Moscow as dangerous extremists.\n\nThe exchange is also expected to include two journalists.\n\nOn July 19, U.S. journalist Evan Gershkovich was convicted unusually swiftly on espionage charges that he denies. He was handed 16 years in jail and Russia has already confirmed talks about his possible exchange.\n\nAlsu Kurmasheva, a Russian-American journalist for U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, was also convicted in unusual haste in a secret trial the same day and sentenced to 6-1/2 years, accused of spreading false information about the Russian army. She denies wrongdoing.\n\nOther U.S. nationals behind bars in Russia include former schoolteacher Marc Fogel, convicted for possessing marijuana, which he said he used for medical reasons.\n\nIn Belarus, meanwhile, President Alexander Lukashenko, a close Putin ally, on Tuesday pardoned Rico Krieger, a German sentenced to death on terrorism charges, again with unusual haste and state media coverage.\n\nAmong those Moscow has signalled it wants is Vadim Krasikov, a Russian serving life in Germany for murdering a former Chechen militant.\n\nA Slovenian court on Wednesday sentenced two Russians to time served for espionage and using fake identities, and said they would be deported, the state news agency STA reported, a move a Slovenian TV channel said was part of the wider exchange.\n\nReuters could not independently confirm that.\n\n(Reporting by Andrew Osborn in Moscow and Filipp Lebedev and Lucy Papachristou in London; Writing by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Kevin

But Kara-Murza is at least the eighth jailed Russian dissident to have disappeared from view in three days. Others have been unexpectedly moved from their prisons.\n\nIn another possible harbinger of a swap, Olga Karlova, a lawyer for Paul Whelan, a former U.S. marine serving 16 years in Russia on espionage charges he denies, said she could not confirm his whereabouts.\n\nWashington has been demanding his release since his arrest in 2018.\n\nIvan Pavlov, a prominent Russian human rights lawyer now living in Prague, said the disappearance of so many people with similar profiles suggested the authorities were gathering them, probably in Moscow, for an exchange.\n\nHe said this could happen \"within days\" once President Vladimir Putin had pardoned those involved, a necessary formality.\n\nIn December 2022, Russia traded basketball star Brittney Griner, sentenced to nine years for having vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage, for arms dealer Viktor Bout, serving a 25-year sentence in the U.S.\n\nThe biggest prisoner swap since the Cold War took place in 2010, involving 14 people in total.\n\nOther dissidents whose supporters say they have been told that they have been suddenly moved are opposition politician Ilya Yashin, human rights activist Oleg Orlov and Daniil Krinari, convicted of secretly cooperating with foreign governments.\n\nOthers to have abruptly gone missing in the prison system include German-Russian citizen Kevin Lik, convicted of treason, opposition activists Liliya Chanysheva and Ksenia Fadeeva, and anti-war artist Sasha Skochilenko.\n\nWEST SEES DETAINEES AS POLITICAL PRISONERS\n\nIn the West, they are seen by governments and activists as wrongfully detained political prisoners. All have, for different reasons, been designated by Moscow as dangerous extremists.\n\nOn July 19, U.S. journalist Evan Gershkovich was convicted unusually swiftly on espionage charges that he denies. He was handed 16 years in jail and Russia has already confirmed talks about his possible exchange.\n\nAlsu Kurmasheva, a Russian-American journalist for U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, was also convicted in unusual haste in a secret trial the same day and sentenced to 6-1/2 years, accused of spreading false information about the Russian army. She denies wrongdoing.\n\nOther U.S. nationals behind bars in Russia include former schoolteacher Marc Fogel, convicted for possessing marijuana, which he said he used for medical reasons.\n\nIn Belarus, meanwhile, President Alexander Lukashenko, a close Putin ally, on Tuesday pardoned Rico Krieger, a German sentenced to death on terrorism charges, again with unusual haste and state media coverage.\n\nAmong those Moscow has signalled it wants is Vadim Krasikov, a Russian serving life in Germany for murdering a former Chechen militant - an exchange that would probably require Berlin to get someone considered broadly equivalent in return.\n\nThe U.S. is holding at least two Russian nationals, Vladimir Dunaev and Roman Seleznev, convicted of serious cybercrimes, who could also figure.\n\nA Slovenian court on Wednesday sentenced two Russians to time served for espionage and using fake identities, and said they would be deported, the state news agency STA reported.

But the lawyer, Arkady Bukh, was quoted by RIA as saying he'd been told by lawyers representing people imprisoned in Russia that they were \"en route\" to unknown locations.\n\nRIA also reported that four Russians jailed in the United States had disappeared from a database of prisoners operated by the US Federal Bureau of Prisons.

All have, for different reasons, been designated by Moscow as dangerous extremists.\n\nOn July 19, U.S. journalist Evan Gershkovich was convicted unusually swiftly on espionage charges that he denies. He was handed 16 years in jail and Russia has already confirmed talks about his possible exchange.\n\nAlsu Kurmasheva, a Russian-American journalist for U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, was also convicted in unusual haste in a secret trial the same day and sentenced to 6-1/2 years, accused of spreading false information about the Russian army. She denies wrongdoing.\n\nOther U.S. nationals behind bars in Russia include former schoolteacher Marc Fogel, convicted for possessing marijuana, which he said he used for medical reasons.\n\nIn Belarus, meanwhile, President Alexander Lukashenko, a close Putin ally, on Tuesday pardoned Rico Krieger, a German sentenced to death on terrorism charges, again with unusual haste and state media coverage.\n\nAmong those Moscow has signalled it wants is Vadim Krasikov, a Russian serving life in Germany for murdering a former Chechen militant - an exchange that would probably require Berlin to get someone considered broadly equivalent in return.\n\nThe U.S. is holding at least two Russian nationals, Vladimir Dunaev and Roman Seleznev, convicted of serious cybercrimes, who could also figure.\n\nA Slovenian court on Wednesday sentenced two Russians to time served for espionage and using fake identities, and said they would be deported, the state news agency STA reported.\n\n(Reporting by Andrew Osborn in Moscow and Filipp Lebedev and Lucy Papachristou in London; Writing by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Kevin Liffey)\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE",

Those detained had been jailed for criticizing the Kremlin or spreading what Moscow views as false information about the Russian military.\n\nAt the same time, legal action by Belarus and Slovenia on foreign nationals has added to speculation in Western media that a multicountry swap, potentially involving Russia, the United States and Germany, may be in the works.\n\nAmong those detained in Russia whose location is currently unknown are former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan; British Russian activist and journalist Vladimir Kara-Murza, who contributes to The Washington Post; and Liliya Chanysheva, who worked closely with late opposition leader Alexey Navalny.\n\nWhelan is serving a 16-year prison sentence on espionage charges that he denies. His lawyer told the Interfax news agency she cannot contact him, adding, \"There are rumors of a possible exchange.\"\n\nThe Post reported late Wednesday that prison officials had confirmed Kara-Murza had been moved from a prison colony but would not say where he was taken. The columnist is serving a 25-year prison sentence after being accused of treason because he criticized Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nWhile some analysts believe the disappearances may be a sign of an imminent prisoner swap, others, like Russia expert Keir Giles, are more skeptical.\n\n\"We need to bear in mind that the people that we see reported are only the tip of the iceberg, and there are so many others that don't get that worldwide media attention,\" Giles, who works at the British think tank Chatham House, told VOA.\n\n\"To be disappeared within the system for a period of days or weeks or even longer is not that unusual,\" Giles added. \"It's hard to tell what within the Russian prison system is deliberate cruelty and what is simply the result of inefficiency and incompetence, but the net effect, of course, on the victims is exactly the same.\"\n\nNavalny, for instance, was abruptly moved in secret from a prison in central Russia to one above the Arctic Circle in December 2023. The move took 20 days, Giles said. The opposition leader died at the prison in February.\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry and Washington embassy did not immediately reply to VOA's emails requesting comment for this story.\n\nOther political prisoners missing this past week include German Russian citizen Kevin Lik; opposition activist Ksenia Fadeeva; anti-war artist Sasha Skochilenko; and critical politician Ilya Yashin.\n\nThe online Russian media outlet Agenstvo reported that at least six special Russian government planes had flown to and from the regions where some of these prisoners were located. VOA could not immediately verify that.\n\nTheir disappearances come on the heels of other developments.\n\nIn Belarus on Tuesday, President Alexander Lukashenko unexpectedly pardoned Rico Krieger, a German who had been sentenced to death on terrorism charges. Belarus and Russia are close allies.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, a Slovenian court sentenced two Russians to time served for espionage and said they would be deported to Russia.\n\nSergei Davidis doesn't think the timing can be a coincidence. He is the head of the Political Prisoners Support Program and a member of the board at the Russian human rights group Memorial.\n\nMemorial's co-chair, Oleg Orlov, is among the political prisoners to recently vanish.\n\n\"It seems that there is no other reasonable explanation than expectations of some swap,\" Davidis told VOA from the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius.\n\nHe added that Russian President Vladimir Putin would need to pardon those involved in any potential swap as a formality.\n\nThe Daily Beast reported that the swap would take place in Ankara, Turkey, and that a \"second part\" would potentially occur in Doha.\n\nPutin has previously signaled he would be willing to trade Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich for a Russian man named Vadim Krasikov, who is serving a life sentence in Germany for killing a Chechen dissident in Berlin.\n\nGershkovich is one of two American journalists imprisoned in Russia. The other is Alsu Kurmasheva. Both were convicted in secret trials on July 19 on charges that are widely viewed as bogus.\n\nRussia state media, meanwhile, reported that four Russians jailed in the United States had disappeared from a database of prisoners that the U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons operates. It named them as Alexander Vinnik, Maxim Marchenko, Vadim Konoshchenko and Vladislav Klyushin.\n\nCommenting on remarks made by Putin earlier this year about a possible swap for Gershkovich, Giles said, \"It is not a process that is pretending particularly hard to be legitimate. It's just a straightforward extortion.\"\n\nThe United States and Russia have been engaging in prisoner swap negotiations for months.\n\n\"The United States continues to be focused on working around the clock to work to get our wrongfully detained American citizens home,\" State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told VOA at a Wednesday press briefing.\n\nWhen asked about any updates on a potential prisoner swap, Patel said he had no updates.\n\nPrisoner swaps are typically cloaked in secrecy.\n\nAlthough the U.S. government has previously faced criticism for exchanging legitimate Russian criminals for innocent Americans, hostage advocate Diane Foley maintained that it is Washington's duty to do everything it can to protect its citizens.\n\n\"They need to have the moral clarity to recognize that their citizen's life is their responsibility. It's their responsibility to do all they can to prioritize that life,\" Foley told VOA.\n\nFoley founded the Foley Foundation after the abduction and killing in Syria of her son, American journalist James Foley, in 2014. She says the U.S. has made some improvements in assisting families, but the burden still largely falls on relatives whose loved ones are unjustly held abroad.\n\nSince launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia has cracked down hard on anything perceived as criticism of the Kremlin, leading to the arrests of scores of activists and journalists. In late 2023, rights group Memorial estimated there were nearly 1,000 political prisoners jailed in Russia.\n\nThe biggest prisoner swap since the Cold War occurred in 2010 and included 14 people in total.", "source": {"uri": "globalsecurity.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "GlobalSecurity.org"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_pike@globalsecurity.org", "name": "John Pike", "type": "author",

Orlov from the organisation Memorial and the artist Alexandra Skochilenko.\n\nAll of them are critics of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and received long sentences.\n\nThe US and its allies have criticised the sentences as arbitrary and demanded the release of the prisoners.\n\nReports indicate that the former heads of the regional staff for Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, who died in February in Russian prison camp north of the Arctic circle, have also been moved to undisclosed locations.\n\nCurrently neither lawyers nor relatives have information on the whereabouts of Liliya Chanycheva and Xenia Fadeeva, both of whom worked for Navalny.\n\n\"It seems that we are facing a very big exchange with the Americans (and not only there),\" political scientist Tatyana Stanovaya wrote on her Telegram channel.\n\nShe did not elaborate on her statement but posted the message amid increasing news about the disappearance of imprisoned Kremlin opponents.\n\n\"We all hope that these are good signs,\" Ivan Pavlov, a prominent human rights activist who fled Russia and is now based in Prague, told Reuters.\n\n\"We hope that they (the authorities) have probably taken them all out of their prisons to gather them together in one place in preparation for an exchange.\"\n\nPavlov, whom Russian authorities have designated \"a foreign agent\", said the prisoners were most likely to have been taken to Moscow's Lefortovo Prison.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin would then need to formally pardon them before they were put on a plane to a destination in Europe, which Pavlov said could be in Germany.\n\nPutin, who has been criticised for using political prisoners as hostages to free Russians from foreign prisons, has recently repeatedly declared his willingness to make an exchange.\n\nThe Kremlin declined to comment on the possibility of a prisoner swap involving Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich.\n\nRussia said last month that contacts had taken place with the US over a possible prisoner exchange involving Gershkovich but that the talks should take place far from the media.\n\nA Russian court found Gershkovich guilty of espionage on July 19 and sentenced him to 16 years in jail.\n\nHe denies the charges against him and the Wall Street Journal branded the sentence \"a disgraceful sham conviction\".", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz",

Signs of an approaching prisoner swap have been reported by independent Russian media as well as international press.\n\nGershkovich, a reporter for the Wall Street Journal arrested in March 2023 on allegations of espionage, was sentenced earlier this month to 16 years in a maximum security prison. He, his employer, and the United States government vehemently deny the charges.\n\nSecurity experts have long considered a prisoner swap to be the best bet for returning Gershkovich to the United States. Senior officials at the Kremlin have said that talks over a swap that would include his release are underway. Advertisement\n\nSince he was arrested more than a year ago, Gershkovich's cause has been taken up by Jewish organizations and activists. In an echo of the Cold War-era movement to free Soviet Jewry, activists have turned to Jewish holiday rituals to raise awareness of his imprisonment, leaving an empty seat for him at the Passover seder, and sending him greeting cards ahead of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year.\n\nDuring the past week, a number of political prisoners in Russia have reportedly been moved from the penal colonies where they are being held. That has prompted speculation that a prisoner swap -- with Russia and Belarus on one side and the United States, Germany, Slovenia and Britain on the other -- may be underway. It could involve between 20 and 30 political prisoners, according to a story published on Wednesday in the independent newsletter the Kozlov Paper that was reprinted in the Moscow Times.\n\nRussian media has also reported at least six Russian government planes flying to and from the regions where the prisoners are held, according to Reuters, adding to speculation of an impending exchange.\n\nWhich prisoners could be swapped?\n\nAmong the prisoners in Russia who could be involved in the swap are Kara-Murza, a Russian-British activist and journalist sentenced on charges of treason who was recently moved from his Siberian prison; opposition politician Ilya Yashin; Lilia Chanysheva and Ksenia Fadeeva, former regional directors for the offices of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny; human rights activist Oleg Orlov; 19-year-old dual Russian-German citizen Kevin Lik, the youngest person ever convicted of treason in Russia; artist and activist Daniil Krinari; and artist Alexandra Skochilenko.\n\nA lawyer for Paul Whelan, the US Marine who has been held in a Russian prison since 2018, said she was unaware of his location and unable to contact him. Advertisement\n\n\"There are rumors about a possible exchange,\" the lawyer, Olga Karlova said. \"I sent a request to the colony administration, but they are not responding.\"\n\nNeither American nor Russian officials confirmed that the prisoner movements were connected to a prisoner exchange, the Washington Post and Reuters reported, which is not unusual ahead of prisoner swaps. The largest swap since the Cold War came in 2010 and involved 14 people across both sides.", "source": {"uri": "m.jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post | JPost.com"}, "authors":

If confirmed, would mark the most extensive prisoner swap since the Cold War's conclusion.\n\nThe list of prisoners includes high-profile dissidents such as Vladimir Kara-Murza, Oleg Orlov, and former Moscow city councilman Ilya Yashin. Rico Krieger, who was sentenced to death in Belarus, but pardoned by Lukashenko on July 30, was included in the exchange.\n\nIndependent Russian media have previously reported that around 10 high-profile detainees were being prepared for the exchange. Postnikov speculates that the Kremlin might try to pressure the likes of Yashin and Orlov into leaving Russia in the prisoner swap, threatening them with withdrawing the deal and keeping other prisoners if they refuse.\n\nThe Kremlin has made \"great efforts to keep the information inside Russia as much a secret as possible until the last moment,\" Politika.Kozlov reported as cited by the Moscow Times.\n\nThe supports and family of Kara-Murza, who was sentenced to 25 years in jail, will be especially happy to hear of his release, if confirmed, as his health was reportedly deteriorating fast and his family were concerned for his life. Kara-Murza nearly died in two separate poisoning incidents, blamed on the Kremlin.\n\nMany of the individuals being readied for exchange are reportedly connected to the late Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny who died in prison in February.\n\nAircraft from the special Rossiya Airlines detachment, which serves the Kremlin and the Russian government, were reportedly dispatched to various regions where political prisoners are held. Sources said that these aircraft transported detainees from remote areas to maintain secrecy.\n\nSlovenian broadcaster N1 Slovenija, citing anonymous sources, reported a major exchange involving the US, Germany, Russia, and Belarus was expected \"in the coming hours.\" This development coincided with a court decision in Ljubljana to deport a Russian couple convicted of espionage.\n\nFurther fuelling the speculation, records of four Russians imprisoned in the US on charges including cybercrime and money laundering were removed from the Federal Bureau of Inmates database. The White House, while acknowledging efforts to secure the return of detained Americans in Russia, declined to provide specifics. \"We do not negotiate in public,\" said White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.\n\nThe last significant prisoner exchange occurred in December 2022, when Russia released American basketball player Brittney Griner in exchange for arms dealer Viktor Bout. Following that exchange, US President Joe Biden expressed regret that former Marine Paul Whelan, imprisoned in Russia on espionage charges, was not included in the deal.\n\nIf the current exchange proceeds as anticipated, it would be the largest since the 2010 swap of 10 Russian spies in the US for four Russians held by Moscow. The international community closely watches these developments, which could have broader implications for diplomatic relations.", "source": {"uri": "intellinews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Signs of an approaching prisoner swap have been reported by independent Russian media as well as international press.\n\nGershkovich, a reporter for the Wall Street Journal arrested in March 2023 on allegations of espionage, was sentenced earlier this month to 16 years in a maximum security prison. He, his employer, and the United States government vehemently deny the charges.\n\nSecurity experts have long considered a prisoner swap to be the best bet for returning Gershkovich to the United States. Senior officials at the Kremlin have said that talks over a swap that would include his release are underway.\n\nSince he was arrested more than a year ago, Gershkovich's cause has been taken up by Jewish organizations and activists. In an echo of the Cold War-era movement to free Soviet Jewry, activists have turned to Jewish holiday rituals to raise awareness of his imprisonment, leaving an empty seat for him at the Passover seder, and sending him greeting cards ahead of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year.\n\nDuring the past week, a number of political prisoners in Russia have reportedly been moved from the penal colonies where they are being held. That has prompted speculation that a prisoner swap -- with Russia and Belarus on one side and the United States, Germany, Slovenia and Britain on the other -- may be underway. It could involve between 20 and 30 political prisoners, according to a story published on Wednesday in the independent newsletter the Kozlov Paper that was reprinted in the Moscow Times.\n\nRussian media has also reported at least six Russian government planes flying to and from the regions where the prisoners are held, according to Reuters, adding to speculation of an impending exchange.\n\nAmong the prisoners in Russia who could be involved in the swap are Kara-Murza, a Russian-British activist and journalist sentenced on charges of treason who was recently moved from his Siberian prison; opposition politician Ilya Yashin; Lilia Chanysheva and Ksenia Fadeeva, former regional directors for the offices of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny; human rights activist Oleg Orlov; 19-year-old dual Russian-German citizen Kevin Lik, the youngest person ever convicted of treason in Russia; artist and activist Daniil Krinari; and artist Alexandra Skochilenko.\n\nA lawyer for Paul Whelan, the U.S. Marine who has been held in a Russian prison since 2018, said she was unaware of his location and unable to contact him.\n\n\"There are rumors about a possible exchange,\" the lawyer, Olga Karlova said. \"I sent a request to the colony administration, but they are not responding.\"\n\nNeither American nor Russian officials confirmed that the prisoner movements were connected to a prisoner exchange, the Washington Post and Reuters reported, which is not unusual ahead of prisoner swaps. The largest swap since the Cold War came in 2010 and involved 14 people across both sides.", "source": {"uri": "jta.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish Telegraphic Agency"}, "authors": [{"uri":

On Tuesday, the Kremlin declined to comment to Reuters on the possibility of a swap involving the journalist. A spokesperson for The Wall Street Journal did not immediately return a request for comment on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nBut two sources involved in the negotiations -- investigative journalists Christo Grozev and Roman Dobrokhotov -- confirmed to The Daily Beast that the swap was on.\n\nGrozev, a former investigator with the open-source intelligence outlet Bellingcat, said the swap would take place in Ankara, Turkey, with a \"second part\" possibly set to take place in Doha, Qatar. The exchange was negotiated between Russia, Belarus, the U.S., and Germany.\n\nGrozev said that more than a dozen political prisoners being held in Russia would be swapped for Vadim Krasikov, a Russian assassin jailed in Germany whom President Vladimir Putin has openly said he wants freed. Dobrokhotov estimated at least seven prisoners would be exchanged for Krasikov.\n\nWho these prisoners might be remained unconfirmed on Wednesday evening. But lawyers for Paul Whelan, a former U.S. marine, and Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Russian-British dissident, confirmed to Reuters hours earlier that both men had vanished from view, a sign they'd been moved. Whelan's lawyer told the Interfax news agency that she'd been unable to get in contact with him or prison administrators.\n\nThe pair's disappearance follows the reported transfer of at least nine other high-profile prisoners on Tuesday, including Ilya Yashin, a prominent Kremlin critic, and several associates of Alexei Navalny, the late Russian opposition leader who died in a remote Arctic penal colony under mysterious circumstances earlier this year.\n\nThe moved Navalny allies include human rights activist Oleg Orlov, artist Alexandra Skochilenko, and former Navalny regional coordinators Lilia Chanysheva and Ksenia Fadeyeva, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\"Given the number, we understand that a swap is expected,\" lawyer Ivan Pavlov told the wire.\n\nA columnist for The Moscow Times, an independent newspaper, reported on Wednesday that Russia may be readying to exchange between 20 and 30 political prisoners. Russian media previously reported that around 10 high-profile detainees could be freed.\n\nA source familiar with the matter told the Times that it was his understanding that Gershkovich was among those on the list to be swapped.\n\nA lawyer for one of the moved prisoners told The Washington Post on Tuesday that, though they hadn't officially been informed of any impending swap, \"everything looks very unusual and extraordinary; something very unusual is going on.\n\n\"I don't believe in coincidences; it looks like well-coordinated actions,\" the lawyer added.\n\nThe White House demurred on the subject of a possible prisoner swap when asked by reporters on Wednesday. John Kirby, the White House's national security spokesperson, told Puck News that he was unable to comment on the issue.\n\nRussia Bans The Moscow Times But the Newspaper's Staff Won't Back Down\n\n\"I can't,\" he said. \"I think you can understand we wouldn't want to mess anything up to prevent there from being a positive result.\"\n\nBesides Krasikov, who Moscow might demand back remains similarly unconfirmed. But in another major clue, Politico noted on Wednesday that at least five high-profile Russians held in U.S. prisons appeared to have been removed from the American federal prisoner database.\n\nOne of the missing prisoners is Alexander Vinnik, a Russian cryptocurrency operator who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering in May. His lawyer told Russian state news agency RIA Novosti that he could not comment on the existence of a possible prisoner swap \"until it takes place.\"\n\nGrozev told The Daily Beast that any prisoner swap would be \"bittersweet,\" and would not take place without lasting consequences for international relations.\n\n\"It's all very bittersweet -- on the one hand this deal ensures the freedom of more than a dozen people, including Russian and American journalists, who were rotting away in Russian prisons on insane charges,\" he said.\n\n\"On the other hand, it rewards Putin's belief that the West is transactional and as long as he hoards 'swap capital' he will always be able to get his killers, hackers, and spies back. And as long as he gets them back home, he can count on a continuing stream of killers and spies continuing to accept missions to terrorize the world with a sense of impunity.\"\n\nThat's particularly true for Krasikov, who in addition to being a hit man is a high-ranking colonel within the Russian secret service FSB. He has served four years of a life sentence for the 2019 \"state-ordered murder\" of a Kremlin critic and registered asylum seeker in Berlin.\n\n\"He will go home to a hero's welcome,\" Grozev said.\n\nRussia's last prisoner swap with the U.S. took place in December 2022, when it exchanged American basketball player Brittney Griner for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout.

June 26. (Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nA prisoner swap involving as many as 30 people held by Russia, possibly including jailed Jewish American journalist Evan Gershkovich and Jewish dissident Vladimir Kara-Murza, could be underway.\n\nIf it comes to pass, the exchange would be the largest prisoner swap between Russia and the United States since the end of the Cold War. Signs of an approaching prisoner swap have been reported by independent Russian media as well as international press.\n\nGershkovich, a reporter for the Wall Street Journal arrested in March 2023 on allegations of espionage, was sentenced earlier this month to 16 years in a maximum security prison. He, his employer, and the United States government vehemently deny the charges.\n\nSecurity experts have long considered a prisoner swap to be the best bet for returning Gershkovich to the United States. Senior officials at the Kremlin have said that talks over a swap that would include his release are underway.\n\nSince he was arrested more than a year ago, Gershkovich's cause has been taken up by Jewish organizations and activists. In an echo of the Cold War-era movement to free Soviet Jewry, activists have turned to Jewish holiday rituals to raise awareness of his imprisonment, leaving an empty seat for him at the Passover seder, and sending him greeting cards ahead of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year.\n\nDuring the past week, a number of political prisoners in Russia have reportedly been moved from the penal colonies where they are being held. That has prompted speculation that a prisoner swap -- with Russia and Belarus on one side and the United States, Germany, Slovenia and Britain on the other -- may be underway. It could involve between 20 and 30 political prisoners, according to a story published on Wednesday in the independent newsletter the Kozlov Paper that was reprinted in the Moscow Times.\n\nRussian media has also reported at least six Russian government planes flying to and from the regions where the prisoners are held, according to Reuters, adding to speculation of an impending exchange.\n\nAmong the prisoners in Russia who could be involved in the swap are Kara-Murza, a Russian-British activist and journalist sentenced on charges of treason who was recently moved from his Siberian prison; opposition politician Ilya Yashin; Lilia Chanysheva and Ksenia Fadeeva, former regional directors for the offices of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny; human rights activist Oleg Orlov; 19-year-old dual Russian-German citizen Kevin Lik, the youngest person ever convicted of treason in Russia; artist and activist Daniil Krinari; and artist Alexandra Skochilenko.\n\nA lawyer for Paul Whelan, the U.S. Marine who has been held in a Russian prison since 2018, said she was unaware of his location and unable to contact him.\n\n\"There are rumors about a possible exchange,\" the lawyer, Olga Karlova said. \"I sent a request to the colony administration, but they are not responding.\"\n\nNeither American nor Russian officials confirmed that the prisoner movements were connected to a prisoner exchange, the Washington Post and Reuters reported, which is not unusual ahead of prisoner swaps. The largest swap since the Cold War came in 2010 and involved 14 people across both sides.", "source": {"uri": "jta.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish Telegraphic Agency"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He would not say who else may be involved in the potential exchange.\n\nThe report comes as a plane used in the 2022 exchange of businessman Viktor Bout and American basketballer Brittney Griner was spotted flying from Moscow to Kaliningrad, according to Flightradar24, a tracking website.\n\nMeanwhile, the Slovenian outlet N1 issued a report about a looming \"larger exchange of prisoners\" to take place soon between Russia, the US, Germany and Belarus. It claimed that it could involve the Russian couple Artem and Anna Dulcevs, accused of espionage by Slovenia.\n\nMeanwhile, Reuters has noted that \"[the] signs of [an] imminent prisoner exchange between Russia and the West multiply,\" alluding both to the Fox News report and Flightradar24 data. Citing rights activists and lawyers, the news agency said that several people who vehemently opposed Russia's military campaign in Ukraine and received jail time on different charges had apparently become unreachable.\n\nThe lawyer for Paul Whelan, a former US Marine arrested in Moscow in 2018 on espionage charges and later sentenced to 16 years in a Russian labor prison, also said he had been unable to establish his client's whereabouts.\n\nGershkovich, a son of Soviet emigres, had built a career focused largely on Russia and Eastern Europe. He was detained in March 2023 in Ekaterinburg, central Russia and charged with espionage. Russian authorities have said he tried to collect classified information on a Russian defense enterprise, and that he had been \"caught red-handed.\"\n\nThe journalist and his paper have vehemently denied charges, with the US State Department declaring him \"wrongfully detained.\" Last month, Gershkovich was sentenced to 16 years in prison in a closed-door trial.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin confirmed last year in an interview with conservative US journalist Tucker Carlson that Washington and Moscow were in contact about a possible prisoner swap, calling the dialogue \"not easy\". The Kremlin, however, has consistently refrained from releasing details of such talks, saying that such sensitive matters \"love silence.\"\n\nGershkovich became the first American journalist detained on espionage charges since the end of the Cold War, highlighting current geopolitical tensions between Moscow and Washington on numerous issues, including the Ukraine conflict. The last major prisoner swap took place in December 2022, with the US releasing Russian businessman Viktor Bout in exchange for Brittney Griner, a basketball player convicted on drug charges in Moscow.", "source": {"uri": "europesun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "europesun.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Gershkovich", "type": "wiki",

The Kremlin previously said there could be no exchange involving Mr Gershkovich until after he received a criminal sentence, which was handed down by a court last month.\n\nHis trial was condemned as a sham by Western politicians, including Joe Biden, who has repeatedly said he hopes to secure the journalist's release.\n\nFocus, a German newspaper, reported that one of the opposition figures who had been moved from his cell in recent days is Kevin Lik, 18, a Russian-German who was jailed in December by Russia for emailing images to \"representatives of a foreign state\" on the eve of the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIf the prisoners are exchanged, it is thought that Russia could be given Vadim Krasikov, the \"bicycle assassin\" who is serving a life-sentence for the murder of an opponent of Mr Putin's regime in Berlin, Alexander Vinnik, who is serving time on money laundering charges, and Vladislav Klyushin, who was found guilty of involvement in hacking and data trafficking.\n\nData on a number of Russian prisoners held in the United States has reportedly disappeared from the US federal prisons database, prompting speculation they will be released.\n\nThey include Alexander Vinnik, Maxim Marchenko, Vadim Konoshchenok, and Roman Seleznyov. The Russian spies Anna and Artem Dultsev were also reported in Slovenian media as possible Western prisoners who could be swapped.\n\nA potential exchange could take place as early as Wednesday evening in Berlin, sources suggested.\n\nThe investigative news outlet Agentstvo reported that at least eight aircraft from the Russian presidential fleet have visited locations where the missing prisoners were located in the last week.\n\nSpeculation of an imminent prisoner swap started on Monday when Alexander Lukashenko, the leader of Belarus, pardoned a German citizen who had been sentenced to death.\n\nRico Krieger was found guilty in October by a court in Belarus of planting explosives on a train line, although his sentence was only reported by Belarusian media in July.\n\nGerman media and the Ukrainian military unit that he was supposed to have served with denied the charges and instead said that Krieger had been lured to Belarus under false pretences and then framed.\n\nEven so, the sudden focus on Krieger, his sentence and his equally sudden pardon by Lukashenko sparked speculation from analysts that this could allow for a wider prisoner exchange.\n\nThe foreign ministries of both Belarus and Germany both confirmed later on Monday that they were in \"talks\" about a prisoner swap.\n\nGerman officials from the foreign ministry and Chancellery did not respond when asked about speculation that there had been a breakthrough on Tuesday.\n\nDecision 'only after US election'\n\nReports from various Russian and eastern European outlets do not agree on which prisoners would be involved in a possible swap.\n\nMr Whelan's lawyer told the Kremlin-linked Moscow-based Izvestia newspaper that he did not think that his client was being considered for a prisoner release deal even though he had disappeared. \"He can spend six months in one zone and then reappear in another zone,\" he said.\n\n\"The issue of exchange is not being decided now. This decision can only be made after the election of a new US president.\"\n\nNor did Kremlin-linked Russian media mention Mr Gershkovich, or Radio Free Europe journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, a Russian-US citizen sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison.\n\nBut the exiled Russian political scientist Tatyana Stanovaya wrote in a post on Telegram: \"It seems we are facing a large-scale prisoner exchange.\"\n\nSergei Markov, a former Kremlin strategist and supporter of Putin's invasion of Ukraine, said: \"There is likely to be a large exchange of political agents with Russia, the US, Germany, Belarus and Slovenia participating.\"\n\n\"Ukraine has nothing to do with it. Yashin and Kara-Murza, I think, yes, Kagarlitsky no. So far so good. Perhaps we will find out everything later today.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tony_diver@aol.co.uk", "name": "Tony Diver",

Those detained had been jailed for criticizing the Kremlin or spreading what Moscow views as false information about the Russian military.\n\nAt the same time, legal action by Belarus and Slovenia on foreign nationals has added to speculation in Western media that a multicountry swap, potentially involving Russia, the United States and Germany, may be in the works.\n\nAmong those detained in Russia whose location is currently unknown are former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan; British Russian activist and journalist Vladimir Kara-Murza, who contributes to The Washington Post; and Liliya Chanysheva, who worked closely with late opposition leader Alexey Navalny.\n\nWhelan is serving a 16-year prison sentence on espionage charges that he denies. His lawyer told the Interfax news agency she cannot contact him, adding, \"There are rumors of a possible exchange.\"\n\nThe Post reported late Wednesday that prison officials had confirmed Kara-Murza had been moved from a prison colony but would not say where he was taken. The columnist is serving a 25-year prison sentence after being accused of treason because he criticized Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nWhile some analysts believe the disappearances may be a sign of an imminent prisoner swap, others, like Russia expert Keir Giles, are more skeptical.\n\n\"We need to bear in mind that the people that we see reported are only the tip of the iceberg, and there are so many others that don't get that worldwide media attention,\" Giles, who works at the British think tank Chatham House, told VOA.\n\n\"To be disappeared within the system for a period of days or weeks or even longer is not that unusual,\" Giles added. \"It's hard to tell what within the Russian prison system is deliberate cruelty and what is simply the result of inefficiency and incompetence, but the net effect, of course, on the victims is exactly the same.\"\n\nNavalny, for instance, was abruptly moved in secret from a prison in central Russia to one above the Arctic Circle in December 2023. The move took 20 days, Giles said. The opposition leader died at the prison in February.\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry and Washington embassy did not immediately reply to VOA's emails requesting comment for this story.\n\nOther political prisoners missing this past week include German Russian citizen Kevin Lik; opposition activist Ksenia Fadeeva; anti-war artist Sasha Skochilenko; and critical politician Ilya Yashin.\n\nTheir disappearances come on the heels of other developments.\n\nIn Belarus on Tuesday, President Alexander Lukashenko unexpectedly pardoned Rico Krieger, a German who had been sentenced to death on terrorism charges. Belarus and Russia are close allies.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, a Slovenian court sentenced two Russians to time served for espionage and said they would be deported to Russia.\n\nSergei Davidis doesn't think the timing can be a coincidence. He is the head of the Political Prisoners Support Program and a member of the board at the Russian human rights group Memorial.\n\nMemorial's cochair, Oleg Orlov, is among the political prisoners to recently vanish.\n\n\"It seems that there is no other reasonable explanation than expectations of some swap,\" Davidis told VOA from the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius.\n\nHe added that Russian President Vladimir Putin would need to pardon those involved in any potential swap as a formality.\n\nPutin has previously signaled he would be willing to trade Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich for a Russian man named Vadim Krasikov, who is serving a life sentence in Germany for killing a Chechen dissident in Berlin.\n\nGershkovich is one of two American journalists imprisoned in Russia. The other is Alsu Kurmasheva. Both were convicted in secret trials on July 19 on charges that are widely viewed as bogus.\n\nCommenting on remarks made by Putin earlier this year about a possible swap for Gershkovich, Giles said, \"It is not a process that is pretending particularly hard to be legitimate. It's just a straightforward extortion.\"\n\nThe United States and Russia have been engaging in prisoner swap negotiations for months.\n\n\"The United States continues to be focused on working around the clock to work to get our wrongfully detained American citizens home,\" State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told VOA at a Wednesday press briefing.\n\nWhen asked about any updates on a potential prisoner swap, Patel said he had no updates.\n\nPrisoner swaps are typically cloaked in secrecy.\n\nAlthough the U.S. government has previously faced criticism for exchanging legitimate Russian criminals for innocent Americans, hostage advocate Diane Foley maintained that it is Washington's duty to do everything it can to protect its citizens.\n\n\"They need to have the moral clarity to recognize that their citizen's life is their responsibility. It's their responsibility to do all they can to prioritize that life,\" Foley told VOA.\n\nFoley founded the Foley Foundation after the abduction and killing in Syria of her son, American journalist James Foley, in 2014. She says the U.S. has made some improvements in assisting families, but the burden still largely falls on relatives whose loved ones are unjustly held abroad.\n\nSince launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia has cracked down hard on anything perceived as criticism of the Kremlin, leading to the arrests of scores of activists and journalists. In late 2023, rights group Memorial estimated there were nearly 1,000 political prisoners jailed in Russia.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of America"},

On Tuesday, the Kremlin declined to comment to Reuters on the possibility of a swap involving the journalist. A spokesperson for The Wall Street Journal did not immediately return a request for comment on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nBut two sources involved in the negotiations -- investigative journalists Christo Grozev and Roman Dobrokhotov -- confirmed to The Daily Beast that the swap was on.\n\nGrozev, a former investigator with the open-source intelligence outlet Bellingcat, said the swap would take place in Ankara, Turkey, with a \"second part\" possibly set to take place in Doha, Qatar. The exchange was negotiated between Russia, Belarus, the U.S., and Germany.\n\nGrozev said that more than a dozen political prisoners being held in Russia would be swapped for Vadim Krasikov, a Russian assassin jailed in Germany whom President Vladimir Putin has openly said he wants freed. Dobrokhotov estimated at least seven prisoners would be exchanged for Krasikov.\n\nWho these prisoners might be remained unconfirmed on Wednesday evening. But lawyers for Paul Whelan, a former U.S. marine, and Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Russian-British dissident, confirmed to Reuters hours earlier that both men had vanished from view, a sign they'd been moved. Whelan's lawyer told the Interfax news agency that she'd been unable to get in contact with him or prison administrators.\n\nThe pair's disappearance follows the reported transfer of at least nine other high-profile prisoners on Tuesday, including Ilya Yashin, a prominent Kremlin critic, and several associates of Alexei Navalny, the late Russian opposition leader who died in a remote Arctic penal colony under mysterious circumstances earlier this year.\n\nThe moved Navalny allies include human rights activist Oleg Orlov, artist Alexandra Skochilenko, and former Navalny regional coordinators Lilia Chanysheva and Ksenia Fadeyeva, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\"Given the number, we understand that a swap is expected,\" lawyer Ivan Pavlov told the wire.\n\nA columnist for The Moscow Times, an independent newspaper, reported on Wednesday that Russia may be readying to exchange between 20 and 30 political prisoners. Russian media previously reported that around 10 high-profile detainees could be freed.\n\nA source familiar with the matter told the Times that it was his understanding that Gershkovich was among those on the list to be swapped.\n\nA lawyer for one of the moved prisoners told The Washington Post on Tuesday that, though they hadn't officially been informed of any impending swap, \"everything looks very unusual and extraordinary; something very unusual is going on.\n\n\"I don't believe in coincidences; it looks like well-coordinated actions,\" the lawyer added.\n\nThe White House demurred on the subject of a possible prisoner swap when asked by reporters on Wednesday. John Kirby, the White House's national security spokesperson, told Puck News that he was unable to comment on the issue.\n\n\"I can't,\" he said. \"I think you can understand we wouldn't want to mess anything up to prevent there from being a positive result.\"\n\nBesides Krasikov, who Moscow might demand back remains similarly unconfirmed. But in another major clue, Politico noted on Wednesday that at least five high-profile Russians held in U.S. prisons appeared to have been removed from the American federal prisoner database.\n\nOne of the missing prisoners is Alexander Vinnik, a Russian cryptocurrency operator who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering in May. His lawyer told Russian state news agency RIA Novosti that he could not comment on the existence of a possible prisoner swap \"until it takes place.\"\n\nGrozev told The Daily Beast that any prisoner swap would be \"bittersweet,\" and would not take place without lasting consequences for international relations.\n\n\"It's all very bittersweet -- on the one hand this deal ensures the freedom of more than a dozen people, including Russian and American journalists, who were rotting away in Russian prisons on insane charges,\" he said.\n\n\"On the other hand, it rewards Putin's belief that the West is transactional and as long as he hoards 'swap capital' he will always be able to get his killers, hackers, and spies back. And as long as he gets them back home, he can count on a continuing stream of killers and spies continuing to accept missions to terrorize the world with a sense of impunity.\"\n\nThat's particularly true for Krasikov, who in addition to being a hit man is a high-ranking colonel within the Russian secret service FSB. He has served four years of a life sentence for the 2019 \"state-ordered murder\" of a Kremlin critic and registered asylum seeker in Berlin.\n\n\"He will go home to a hero's welcome,\" Grozev said.\n\nRussia's last prisoner swap with the U.S. took place in December 2022, when it exchanged American basketball player Brittney Griner for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. The largest swap between the two nations occurred in 2010, when 10 alleged Moscow sleeper agents were quietly flown to Vienna and exchanged for four people convicted of spying for the U.S.", "source":

The Kremlin previously said there could be no exchange involving Mr Gershkovich until after he received a criminal sentence, which was handed down by a court last month.\n\nHis trial was condemned as a sham by Western politicians, including Joe Biden, who has repeatedly said he hopes to secure the journalist's release.\n\nKarine Jean Pierre, the White House press secretary, said on Wednesday that Mr Biden had \"made it a priority to get home wrongfully detained Americans back to their families\", but declined to comment on any specific negotiations with Russia.\n\n\"We cannot negotiate in public because we want to make sure that we get this job done, get this work done,\" she said.\n\nFocus, a German newspaper, reported that one of the opposition figures who had been moved from his cell in recent days is Kevin Lik, 18, a Russian-German who was jailed in December by Russia for emailing images to \"representatives of a foreign state\" on the eve of the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIf the prisoners are exchanged, it is thought that Russia could be given Vadim Krasikov, the \"bicycle assassin\" who is serving a life-sentence for the murder of an opponent of Mr Putin's regime in Berlin, Alexander Vinnik, who is serving time on money laundering charges, and Vladislav Klyushin, who was found guilty of involvement in hacking and data trafficking.\n\nData on a number of Russian prisoners held in the United States has reportedly disappeared from the US federal prisons database, prompting speculation they will be released.\n\nThey include Alexander Vinnik, Maxim Marchenko, Vadim Konoshchenok, and Roman Seleznyov. The Russian spies Anna and Artem Dultsev were also reported in Slovenian media as possible Western prisoners who could be swapped.\n\nA potential exchange could take place as early as Wednesday evening in Berlin, sources suggested.\n\nThe investigative news outlet Agentstvo reported that at least eight aircraft from the Russian presidential fleet have visited locations where the missing prisoners were located in the last week.\n\nSpeculation of an imminent prisoner swap started on Monday when Alexander Lukashenko, the leader of Belarus, pardoned a German citizen who had been sentenced to death.\n\nRico Krieger was found guilty in October by a court in Belarus of planting explosives on a train line, although his sentence was only reported by Belarusian media in July.\n\nGerman media and the Ukrainian military unit that he was supposed to have served with denied the charges and instead said that Krieger had been lured to Belarus under false pretences and then framed.\n\nEven so, the sudden focus on Krieger, his sentence and his equally sudden pardon by Lukashenko sparked speculation from analysts that this could allow for a wider prisoner exchange.\n\nThe foreign ministries of both Belarus and Germany both confirmed later on Monday that they were in \"talks\" about a prisoner swap.\n\nGerman officials from the foreign ministry and Chancellery did not respond when asked about speculation that there had been a breakthrough on Tuesday.\n\nReports from various Russian and eastern European outlets do not agree on which prisoners would be involved in a possible swap.\n\nMr Whelan's lawyer told the Kremlin-linked Moscow-based Izvestia newspaper that he did not think that his client was being considered for a prisoner release deal even though he had disappeared. \"He can spend six months in one zone and then reappear in another zone,\" he said.\n\n\"The issue of exchange is not being decided now. This decision can only be made after the election of a new US president.\"\n\nNor did Kremlin-linked Russian media mention Mr Gershkovich, or Radio Free Europe journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, a Russian-US citizen sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison.\n\nBut the exiled Russian political scientist Tatyana Stanovaya wrote in a post on Telegram: \"It seems we are facing a large-scale prisoner exchange.\"\n\nSergei Markov, a former Kremlin strategist and supporter of Putin's invasion of Ukraine, said: \"There is likely to be a large exchange of political agents with Russia, the US, Germany, Belarus and Slovenia participating.\"\n\n\"Ukraine has nothing to do with it. Yashin and Kara-Murza, I think, yes, Kagarlitsky no. So far so good. Perhaps we will find out everything later today.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He would not say who else may be involved in the potential exchange.\n\nThe report comes as a plane used in the 2022 exchange of businessman Viktor Bout and American basketballer Brittney Griner was spotted flying from Moscow to Kaliningrad, according to Flightradar24, a tracking website.\n\nMeanwhile, the Slovenian outlet N1 issued a report about a looming \"larger exchange of prisoners\" to take place soon between Russia, the US, Germany and Belarus. It claimed that it could involve the Russian couple Artem and Anna Dulcevs, accused of espionage by Slovenia.\n\nGershkovich, a son of Soviet emigres, had built a career focused largely on Russia and Eastern Europe. He was detained in March 2023 in Ekaterinburg, central Russia and charged with espionage. Russian authorities have said he tried to collect classified information on a Russian defense enterprise, and that he had been \"caught red-handed.\"\n\nThe journalist and his paper have vehemently denied charges, with the US State Department declaring him \"wrongfully detained.\" Last month, Gershkovich was sentenced to 16 years in prison in a closed-door trial.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin confirmed last year in an interview with conservative US journalist Tucker Carlson that Washington and Moscow were in contact about a possible prisoner swap, calling the dialogue \"not easy\". The Kremlin, however, has consistently refrained from releasing details of such talks, saying that such sensitive matters \"love silence.\"\n\nGershkovich became the first American journalist detained on espionage charges since the end of the Cold War, highlighting current geopolitical tensions between Moscow and Washington on numerous issues, including the Ukraine conflict. The last major prisoner swap took place in December 2022, with the US releasing Russian businessman Viktor Bout in exchange for Brittney Griner, a basketball player convicted on drug charges in Moscow.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia still has another American citizen in custody - Paul Whelan, a former US Marine who was arrested in Moscow in 2018, also on espionage charges. Whelan was arrested after accepting a flash drive that contained classified documents from an undercover officer of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB). In 2020, he was sentenced to 16 years in a Russian labor prison.

The channel did not disclose its sources but called them reliable.\n\nIf confirmed, it would be the largest prisoner exchange between the U.S. and Russia since the end of the Cold War.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked about a possible prisoner exchange during Wednesday's briefing.\n\n\"I just can't get into specifics here,\" she said. \"You have to understand what we're trying to do on behalf of Americans detained, the president is committed, and he will continue to do everything he can to get Americans home to their loved ones. ... I'm not going to get into specifics. I'm not going to get into details. I can't confirm anything from here.\"\n\nGershkovich is serving a 16-year prison sentence in Russia after being convicted July 19 on espionage charges. Russia never provided evidence of his alleged espionage, only announcing that he was caught at work. The Biden administration and the Journal have repeatedly claimed that Gershkovich was unjustly detained and that he was only doing journalistic work in Russia.\n\nPrevious reporting by independent Russian media suggested that up to 10 high-profile political prisoners were being readied for the rumored exchange, the Times reported. A number of Russian dissidents and people convicted for their opposition to Moscow's war in Ukraine reportedly have disappeared from Russian prisons in recent days in what rights activists said is a possible sign that a prisoner swap with the West might be close.\n\nN1 stated that two Russians convicted in Slovenia in an espionage case, Artem and Anna Dultsev, will be returned to Russia as \"part of a larger exchange.\"\n\nN1 also reported that Vadim Krasikov, a high-ranking colonel in the Russian secret service FSB who is serving a life sentence in a German jail for the 2019 assassination of Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, an opponent of the Russian regime, could be part of the exchange.\n\nKrasikov could be exchanged for German Rico Krieger, who was sentenced to death on terrorism charges in mid-June but pardoned Tuesday by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, according to N1.\n\nMeanwhile, data on Russians Alexander Vinnik, Maxim Marchenko, Vadim Konoshchenko, Vladislav Klyushin, Roman Seleznev, and Vladimir Dunayev have disappeared from the U.S. prison database, N1 reported.\n\nThe channel reported that Vinnik's attorney told Russian state-owned news outlet RIA Novosti that he cannot comment on speculation about a prisoner exchange between Russia and the U.S. \"until it happens.\"\n\nThe Moscow Times and N1 reported other prisoners that could be part of the deal include people linked to Alexei Navalny, the political opponent of Vladimir Putin who was found dead in a Russian prison camp in February.\n\nDmitry Peskov, the press secretary for Putin, when asked by N1 about the exchange, said: \"We do not comment on this topic.\"\n\nGerman and Belarusian authorities also did not comment to N1.\n\nRussia last exchanged prisoners with the U.S. in December 2022 when it freed women's basketball star Brittney Griner for notorious arms dealer Viktor Bout, who had been held in a U.S. prison for 12 years.\n\nMichael Katz \u2709\n\nMichael Katz is a Newsmax reporter

But there are reasons why Putin, a pragmatist pur sang, would be interested in conducting the exchange now.\n\nWith its own citizens behind bars in various Western countries, the process of getting them released is complex and sensitive -- and one the Kremlin might be loathe to entrust to Republican candidate Donald Trump, with his bull-in-a-china-shop approach to deal-making.\n\n\"Putin was also interested in a pre-election deal, since after then, the extremely painstaking preparatory work, involving several countries, could have been undone,\" political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya speculated.\n\nTrump has repeatedly bragged about his plans to secure Gershkovich's release if he were elected, writing in May that \"Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, will do that for me, but not for anyone else, and WE WILL BE PAYING NOTHING!\"\n\nIt wouldn't be surprising if the Kremlin considered \"nothing\" a rather bad offer.\n\nAside from the mysterious disappearances, a number of other, seemingly separate events over the past days have fuelled suspicion that something important is brewing.\n\nOn Tuesday, Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko, in a surprise move, pardoned Rico Krieger, a German citizen and the first Westerner to receive a death sentence.\n\nA day later, on Wednesday, Slovenia convicted a Russian couple of espionage, and ordered them to be expelled.\n\nIn a third notable event, a number of high-profile Russian citizens held in U.S. prisons, many of them linked to the Russian government, appeared to have been removed from the American federal prisoner database.\n\nAmong them were Maxim Marchenko, Vadim Konoshchenok, Vladislav Klyushin, Roman Seleznev, and Alexander Vinnik, who are all serving time in U.S. prisons on various serious charges.\n\nSpeaking to Russia's state news agency RIA Novosti, Vinnik's lawyer neither confirmed nor denied the possibility of a prisoner swap involving his client, saying he could not comment on it \"until it takes place.\"\n\nThough expressing hope at the prospect some of Russia's most famous political prisoners might walk free, many critics of Putin also voiced caution that the disappearances could be part of a Kremlin ruse.\n\nBut, with Russian state media and propagandists jumping on the news on Wednesday, all the signs appear to be pointing the opposite way.\n\nWithout providing evidence, Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin analyst, speculated on Telegram the swap would involve the United States, Germany, Belarus and Slovenia. The Slovenian website N1 reported that same information on an impending deal.\n\nIf so, the swap would be unique in its geographical scope and, presumably, in the number of political prisoners exchanged simultaneously with the West.\n\n\"In the modern history of Russia this has never happened before,\" wrote \u0415va Merkacheva, a prominent Russian prison expert on Tuesday.", "source":

other charges.\n\nOn August 1, a group of Russian lawyers and rights defenders known as Pervy Otdel posted a message on Telegram noting the flight track of a Antonov plane that had been previously involved in other prisoner exchanges.\n\n\"An An-148 plane, which was allegedly used for the previous exchange of political prisoners, took off from Kaliningrad to Moscow [on August 1],\" Pervy Otdel said.\n\nThe plane, with the tail number RA-61727, then took off back to Moscow, the group said, which \"may indicate that the exchange of political prisoners took place on the border with Poland.\"\n\nData from the flight-tracking site Flightradar24 confirmed the plane's movements, while the Russian media outlet Agenstvo has reported that several special Russian government planes in recent days have traveled to and from regions where prisons holding dissidents are being held.\n\nMeanwhile, four Russians have been charged or jailed in the United States have disappeared from a database of inmates operated by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\nAmong the four as Vladislav Klyushin, a Kremlin-connected IT entrepeneur serving a multiyear sentence on insider trading charges, and Aleksandr Vinnik, who recently pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges and has been free pending sentencing.\n\nThe largest prisoner swap since the Cold War occurred in 2010 and involved a total of 14 people.", "source": {"uri": "rferl.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type":

He would not say who else may be involved in the potential exchange.\n\nThe report comes as a plane used in the 2022 exchange of businessman Viktor Bout and American basketballer Brittney Griner was spotted flying from Moscow to Kaliningrad, according to Flightradar24, a tracking website.\n\nMeanwhile, the Slovenian outlet N1 issued a report about a looming \"larger exchange of prisoners\" to take place soon between Russia, the US, Germany and Belarus. It claimed that it could involve the Russian couple Artem and Anna Dulcevs, accused of espionage by Slovenia.\n\nGershkovich, a son of Soviet emigres, had built a career focused largely on Russia and Eastern Europe. He was detained in March 2023 in Ekaterinburg, central Russia and charged with espionage. Russian authorities have said he tried to collect classified information on a Russian defense enterprise, and that he had been \"caught red-handed.\"\n\nThe journalist and his paper have vehemently denied charges, with the US State Department declaring him \"wrongfully detained.\" Last month, Gershkovich was sentenced to 16 years in prison in a closed-door trial.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin confirmed last year in an interview with conservative US journalist Tucker Carlson that Washington and Moscow were in contact about a possible prisoner swap, calling the dialogue \"not easy\". The Kremlin, however, has consistently refrained from releasing details of such talks, saying that such sensitive matters \"love silence.\"\n\nGershkovich became the first American journalist detained on espionage charges since the end of the Cold War, highlighting current geopolitical tensions between Moscow and Washington on numerous issues, including the Ukraine conflict. The last major prisoner swap took place in December 2022, with the US releasing Russian businessman Viktor Bout in exchange for Brittney Griner, a basketball player convicted on drug charges in Moscow.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia still has another American citizen in custody - Paul Whelan, a former US Marine who was arrested in Moscow in 2018, also on espionage charges. Whelan was arrested after accepting a flash drive that contained classified documents from an undercover officer of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB). In 2020, he was sentenced to 16 years in a Russian labor prison.

The verdict was read at the District Court in Ljubljana, where two Russian spies were also present. If the court accepts their plea agreement with the prosecution, and it is expected that it will, the two Russian spies will not serve their sentences in Slovenia. According to reliable information, they are part of a larger exchange of prisoners that should take place in the coming hours between Russia, the United States (U.S.), Germany and Belarus. It seems that Putin, in addition to the illegals arrested in Slovenia, will also return the killer of the Russian secret service FSB after years of efforts.\n\nAna Valerievna Dulceva and Artem Viktorovic Dulcev have been in custody since December 5th, 2022, when the police arrested a Russian spy in the presence of Sova in Ljubljana's Crnuce. She on Igo, he on Povsetova. According to information, they remained silent during the interrogation, for which they were trained as illegals of the Russian intelligence service SVR. As was revelaed yesterday, during the arrest they were caught \"with their fingers in a jam\", most likely while they were sending information to Moscow.\n\nIn the Russian intelligence apparatus, illegals are those spies who first train for years in their homeland, then leave Russia, and in turn must also renounce contact with family members, because nothing must connect them to Russia.\n\nWhat happens after the verdict?\n\nAs it was reported, the two Russian spies will be part of a larger exchange of prisoners that should take place between Russia, the U.S., Germany and Belarus yesterday. After several years of efforts, Putin allegedly even managed to return the liquidator of the Russian secret service FSB, Vadim Krasikov, who in August 2019, in broad daylight, liquidated the former Chechen commander Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, who fought against Russia in the second Chechen war, in a Berlin park, and Russian authorities were convinced that he also led an attack in Ingushetia in 2004 that killed dozens of Russian policemen.\n\nKrasikov arrived in the Berlin park by bicycle. He first shot Kangosvili, who had come there from the mosque, in the back, and then got off his bicycle and shot him twice in the head at close range. At the time of the liquidation, there were also many children in the Berlin park. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in Germany.\n\nPressure on the West to include Krasikov imprisoned in Germany in the exchange of prisoners, which Western countries resisted for a long time, according to information, came a few days ago from Belarus, which is economically and militarily completely dependent on Russia.\n\nAn American journalist from the Wall Street Journal is said to be part of the exchange\n\nIt is also expected that Wall Street Journal journalist, American citizen Evan Gershkovich, who was sentenced to 16 years in prison in Russia on July 19th of this year, will be able to return from a Russian prison to the U.S. as part of this exchange. The trial was extremely quick, with only three hearings, and he was convicted on charges that his journalistic expedition to Yekaterinburg in March 2023 was not for journalistic work, but to gather information about the Russian tank manufacturer Uralvagonzavod for the needs of the U.S. secret intelligence agency. service. Moscow never provided evidence of his alleged espionage, only announcing that he had been caught red-handed.\n\nNegotiations on the exchange of prisoners lasted for a long time\n\nVojko Volk, State Secretary for International Affairs and National Security in the Office of the Prime Minister, came to the pre-election meeting ahead of the European elections with Vladimir Prebilic in June, accompanied by the team and camera of the American Wall Street Journal.\n\n\"It is about recording archival documentary material about the story that Slovenia entered in December 2022. It is about the arrest of two Russian spies in Slovenia, about a big story that is slowly unfolding,\" explained Volk at the time.\n\nWhen asked if negotiations were underway to exchange a Russian spy for Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich who was arrested in Russia in March 2023, Volk replied in June: \"All options are open, they are always being worked on, but what we are doing in the area of national security, I can say at most a percentage of everything we do\", N1 writes.\n\nE.Dz.", "source": {"uri": "sarajevotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sarajevo Times"}, "authors":

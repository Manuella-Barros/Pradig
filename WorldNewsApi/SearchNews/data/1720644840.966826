{"id": 231283922, "title": "$500M of taxpayer dough wasted? Hochul, MTA lack Plan B for NYC congestion pricing infrastructure", "text": "The Hochul administration is staring at the grim prospect of having to flush a half-billion dollars in taxpayer money down the toilet over the botched congestion pricing scheme. The boondoggle could\u2019ve been avoided had Gov. Kathy Hochul and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority seriously studied what the economic impact on New York residents and businesses would be by charging drivers $15 to enter parts of Manhattan, critics said. \u201cOne-hundred percent they should\u2019ve done an economic analysis,\u201d said Staten Island Borough President Vito Fosella, a plaintiff in one of many pending lawsuits trying to permanently kill the tolling plan. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t wait until all the T\u2019s were crossed and I\u2019s were dotted,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s just emblematic of the arrogance and desire to push this through, and look what happened? Not only are they not getting their money \u2014 but they wasted a half-billion dollars.\u201d E-Z Pass readers, license plate-scanning cameras and other infrastructure needed for the program are already mounted on traffic poles at 110 locatons south of 60th Street. TransCore, a Nashville, Tenn.-based company, completed the bulk of the work the past year as part of a six-year, $507 million contract the MTA awarded in 2019 to design, build and operate the wildly unpopular program. Hochul on Wednesday shockingly slammed the brakes on the program\u2019s June 30 rollout, saying she\u2019s pausing it \u201cindefinitely\u201d because it\u2019s not the right time with New Yorkers facing a cost-of-living crisis. The governor\u2019s sudden flip-flop left the MTA\u2019s budget in limbo: the cash-strapped agency was banking on the new tolls to raise another $1 billion in yearly revenues to help fund $15 billion in capital projects for NYC\u2019s dilapidated transit system. The move raises serious questions about what to do with the sensors and other infrastructure TransCore installed. \u201cIn their rush to jam through this war-on-cars cash grab, the Biden Administration rubber-stamped it and issued a \u2018Finding of No Significant Impact\u2019 allowing MTA to bypass a full and thorough study of the environmental, social and economic impact of congestion pricing,\u201d said Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-Staten Island), who also joined a lawsuit fighting the plan. \u201cLikewise, in their rush to grab more money from hardworking New Yorkers, the governor and MTA put up these sensors. When it comes to actual capital improvements, the MTA is always delayed and over schedule, but when it comes to tolling infrastructure, all of a sudden they can get things done in record time.\u201d Reps for the MTA and Hochul refused to say if they have contingency plans for the new infrastructure, and both TransCore and NYC Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 office deferred all questions on the matter to the MTA and governor. Sources said the deafening silence is in part due to state and city leaders having no idea what to do with the infrastructure \u2014 which for now amounts to a very expensive municipal art project. Councilman Keith Powers (D-Manhattan), who supports congestion pricing and represents part of the targeted tolling zone, said the equipment could be used to expand the city\u2019s red-light and speed camera programs. He also said it could potentially be used to help track down owners of vehicles using obstructed or \u201cghost\u201d plates to avoid tolls and tickets \u2014 and to install newly approved \u201cnoise cameras\u201d that detect souped-up cars. \u201c[The state] certainly should take advantage of this very expensive infrastructure in Midtown,\u201d said Powers, who drafted the legislation creating the new noise camera program. Andrew Albert, an MTA board member who represents riders, also said the existing tech should be used to track down drivers with covered or fake plates \u2013 provided they have an E-Z Pass to scan. Fossella on Friday wrote MTA boss Janno Lieber a letter demanding the new toll readers be taken down immediately \u201cif congestion pricing is truly shelved.\u201d The GOPer claimed many commuters are \u201cconcerned\u201d Hochul\u2019s change of heart is politically motivated to help Democrats and that the tolls will implemented \u201cfollowing this year\u2019s [presidential] election.\u201d Both he and Council Minority Leader Joe Borelli (R-Staten Island) said they wouldn\u2019t mind using the tech to catch rogue drivers with obstructed or \u201cghost\u201d plates \u2014 but the more likely scenario is the high-priced equipment being sold off at bargain-basement rates. \u201cThese are brand new machines,\u201d Borelli said. \u201cPut them on the government version of Facebook Marketplace and try to convince some dope in California to buy them. \u201cThe problem is they\u2019re selling them selling second-hand, so no one is going to pay the bloated price the MTA seems to pay for everything.\u201d", "summary": "The Hochul administration is staring at the grim prospect of having to flush more than a half-billion dollars in taxpayer money down the toilet over the botched congestion pricing scheme.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/gov-hochul-mta-lack-plan-b-for-nyc-congestion-pricing-infrastructure/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/workers-seen-installing-ez-pass-83407063.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ecv9Exyn-RyIcpnTz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:44:49", "author": "Rich Calder", "authors": ["Rich Calder"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.44}

The ongoing negotiations between AEW and WBD have been a hot topic of conversation for well over a year now. Tony Khan stated on the Forbidden Door Media Call that they\u2019re in the \u201cred zone\u201d and are about to score a touchdown. In an update from Dave Meltzer in the Wrestling Observer Newsletter, the expectation is that AEW\u2019s new media rights deal will be announced imminently. Meltzer would state that it might even be announced before the exclusivity negotiation window expires at some point in July. If Warner Bros Discovery allows negotiations with Tony Khan and All Elite Wrestling to extend past their exclusive negotiation window, it would allow other suitors to bid on their programming. If Meltzer\u2019s report is correct, other suitors won\u2019t factor into this equation. Stay tuned to WrestleZone for more information on this deal as it becomes available.

{"id": 243304110, "title": "Robotinho predicts the result of every round of 16 match at Euro 2024", "text": "Prediction: Germany 3-1 DenmarkGermany has been dominant in the group stages, especially with their commanding win over Scotland. Under [coach Julian] Nagelsmann they have shown attacking prowess. Denmark, despite solid draws against Slovenia and England, lacks the firepower to withstand Germany\u2019s aggressive play. England vs Slovakia Prediction: England 2-0 SlovakiaEngland\u2019s strong defence and disciplined play, highlighted by their draws and a win against Serbia, make them favourites. Slovakia, with their unexpected win over Belgium, will put up a fight, but England\u2019s superior squad depth and organisation should secure them a comfortable victory. Spain vs Georgia Prediction: Spain 2-0 GeorgiaSpain has been efficient, winning all their group matches without conceding. Georgia, despite their impressive win against Portugal, is likely to struggle against Spain\u2019s possession-based game and tactical discipline. Spain\u2019s control in midfield and solid defence will likely see them through. France vs Belgium Prediction: France 2-1 BelgiumFrance, with their star-studded squad and consistent performance, including a draw against the Netherlands, are favourites. Belgium, despite their struggles, showed resilience in drawing with Ukraine. France\u2019s superior individual talent, particularly in attack, should help them narrowly win.", "summary": "Spain thrilled, Austria surprised and England, predictably, stank the place out during the group stage.

Their last eight wickets fell for the addition of just 38 runs as they went south from 109 for 2 in the tenth over\n\nThe Sangakkara-Simmons act put Jamaica on the road to victory after that, but Kevon Cooper and Sunil Narine combined to bring Trinbago back in the match with a flurry of wickets, till useful contributions from Rovman Powell, Shakib Al Hasan and especially Jonathan Foo helped Jamaica go over the line with four balls in hand.\n\nSangakkara found some form after a couple of poor outings, scoring 47 in 41 balls with seven fours and hanging around till the 17 over. He was fortunate too, top-edging a sweep to Denesh Ramdin behind the stumps off Narine only for the Trinbago celebrations to be clipped when they spotted the umpire's no-ball signal.\n\nThe early impetus came from the other end, where Simmons, the highest run-getter in the tournament after the first seven games, smashed an 18-ball 38 with four fours and three sixes. His fall to Shadab Khan in the sixth over, however, led to a turn in the tide, with Narine sending back Andre McCarthy and the scoring rate going down. Powell couldn't quite get going but played his part in a 29-run stand with Sangakkara, as did Shakib, whose 16 runs took 22 balls, but helped Sangakkara add another 30 runs to the total. It got a bit too close for comfort when Sangakkara and Shakib were sent back soon after each other by Dwayne Bravo and Cooper respectively, but Foo smashed a four and a six in his 11-ball 19 to swing the game decisively Jamaica's way. Foo fell to Cooper with the scores level, and it was over to Imad Wasim to complete the job after that.\n\nEarlier, much like in the second half of the game, there was some big hitting up front and then a serious slowdown, combined with a rush of wickets. Unlike in Jamaica's case, however, Trinbago didn't get the Foo-like effort down below to make a serious dent.\n\nBrendon McCullum and Narine brought out the big shots against Santokie and Wasim, motoring to 33 in the third over before Williams accounted for McCullum, and in his next over - the fifth - with the total already past 50, he sent back Narine. Colin Munro, with a 25-ball 41, and Darren Bravo, who scored 33 in 25 balls, kept the scoreboard moving at a fair clip, but once they were dismissed by Santokie and Mohammad Sami respectively, the Trinbago fight ended, the last eight wickets going down for next to nothing.\n\nThis was Trinbago's first loss in three games and kept them on the top of the six-team table, while Jamaica, with a similar 2-1 win-loss record, climbed to third place, with St Kitts & Nevis Patriots, with a 2-0 record at this stage, were at No. 2.\n\nBrief scores: Trinbago Knight Riders 147 in 19.5 overs (Colin Munro 41, Darren Bravo 33; Krishmar Santokie 2-30, Kesrick Williams 3-26, Odean Smith 3-20) lost to Jamaica Tallawahs 148/6 in 19.2 overs (Kumar Sangakkara 47, Lendl Simmons 38; Kevon Cooper 2-25, Sunil Narine 2-21) by 4 wickets.", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textEnd": 413, "amb": false, "date": "2017-08-09", "textStart": 405, "freq": 2}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3350586", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-10T07:10:00Z", "sim": 0.7960784435272217, "source": {"uri": "msn.com", "title": "msn.com", "id": "152"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "07:10:00", "url": "http://www.msn.com/en-in/sports/other/williams-sets-up-narrow-win-for-jamaica/ar-AApNNoQ?srcref=rss", "storyUri": "eng-3350586", "id": "8337479", "image": "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AApNKNw.img?h=100&amp;w=100&amp;m=6&amp;q=60&amp;o=f&amp;l=f&amp;x=258&amp;y=73", "date": "2017-08-10", "time": "07:10:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-10"}

2017 Hero CPL on Wednesday night, when they went under to the Jamaica Tallawahs by four wickets at the Queen's Park Oval in Port-of-Spain. The Knights were on top for a quarter of the match and lost their way in front of a good crowd on hand.\n\nWith over 12,000 fans decked in red making themselves heard, the Knight Riders did not disappoint for the first eight overs. They reached the dizzy heights of 100 for two. However, Kesrick Williams used his medium pace bowling to good effect, to shock the locals from a position of strength to one of despair. On an Oval pitch that was offering good pace and bounce, the ball came on nicely for the batsmen and Knight Riders ran away, racing to the century of just eight overs.\n\nBrendan McCullum (16), Sunil Narine (23), Colin Munroe (41) and Darren Bravo (33), were all brutal but never looked as if they wanted to go to the end with a big one. Williams ended with three wickets and Odean Smith another three to stifle the free flowing batsmen, which led to injudicious strokes and their eventual downfall.\n\nThe Tallawahs -- like the Knight Riders before them -- made an excellent start to their innings, finding the new ball easier to hit. Lendl Simmons and Kumar Sangakkara's 61-run opening partnership came in just 5.3 overs.\n\nWhen Simmons and then Andre McCarthy were dismissed in quick succession the match threatened to take another turn as Knight Riders spin-twins, Narine and Shadab Khan, were deployed in the middle overs. However, after Sangakkara was dismissed off a no ball against Narine he put on 59 for the next two wickets with Rovman Powell and Shakib Al Hasan to keep the Tallawahs in control.\n\nThe increasingly softer ball meant that boundaries were hard to come by and even with a run-a-ball needed it seemed that a series of dots could turn the match. When Sangakkara was caught at long off with the Tallawahs still 25 shy of the target the Knight Riders, buoyed by vocal home support, seemed to believe that they could still win.\n\nWhile boundaries were indeed harder to come by they were not impossible to find and when Jonathan Foo inside edged a four and then slammed a six over long-on that was parried over the rope by Shadab Khan the Tallawahs finally got home. Despite the loss the TKR still leads the standings in net run rate, and will look to get back on track when they battle the Guyana Amazon Warriors at the Oval from 9pm tonight. There are likely to be changes to be made by the home side for that clash, and those changes may have nothing to do with the fact that they lost their last game yesterday to the Tallawahs but more to do with the 9pm start.\n\nCoach of the team Simon Katich said that the dew did play a factor in the loss to Tallawahs because the spinners could not grip the ball well. When asked about changes he hinted by saying, \"It's a quick turnaround between the matches but when we sit down to decide on the team the discussion about the dew and the personnel we used must come on for discussion.\" Therefore the Knight Riders may opt to go with that extra seamer instead of spinner Khary Pierre.\n\nThe TKR coach added that the loss in the last game had to do with batsmen not taking time to adjust, he said \"When the ball gets softer it is harder to score and this is when the batsmen have to apply themselves differently. Hopefully the guys would have learnt a lot from the last game and will take that into this one,\" Katich concluded.\n\nMeanwhile, Guyana captain Martin Guptill wants his team to get their first win of the campaign, as the Guyanese franchise have lost both matches to date, \"We just want to go out there and start winning matches. The guys know what they have to do and they have been preparing well.\n\n\"We always have tough matches against Trinbago and we are looking to go out there and defeat them at home.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3350586", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T03:19:00Z", "sim": 0.7921568751335144, "source": {"uri": "guardian.co.tt", "title": "The Trinidad Guardian Newspaper", "id": "2839"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:19:00", "url": "http://www.guardian.co.tt/sports/2017-08-10/tkr-looks-get-back-winning-ways", "storyUri": "eng-3350586", "id": "8528086", "image": "http://www.guardian.co.tt/sites/default/files/field/image/CPL_2017_0.png", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "03:19:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

with Brendon McCullum leading the line, and Jamaica Tallawahs will depend on Pakistan's Imad Wasim and Mohammad Sami to stop the run flow.\n\nTrinbago Knight Riders have been the best team in the ongoing Caribbean Premier League 2017, winning both their matches so far in the competition. They will be eager to continue that unbeaten streak as they face Jamaica Tallawahs at Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad on Wednesday.\n\nTaking one look at the batting line-up of the Knight Riders will make us realise that they are not one of those teams who can be beaten in CPL 2017. After Brendon McCullum and Sunil Narine as openers, they have Colin Munro, Darren Bravo, Dwayne Bravo, Denesh Ramdin to follow, which makes it for an exciting and dangerous batting order.\n\nMcCullum showed his dangerous form in their opening match, scoring 27-ball 58, including seven massive sixes. It is such a big-hitting ability, which makes him a dangerous batsman.\n\nHowever, their strength does not lie in the batting department alone. Though Sunil Narine may no longer be the kind of threat he was a couple of years ago, one cannot underestimate his immaculate line and length, which can trouble opponents. He can stifle batsmen at one end, and his fellow bowlers at the other end can take advantage of that scenario.\n\nBesides Narine, Khary Pierre, Shabad Khan and Dwayne Bravo can be more than handy with their white ball skills.\n\nReuters\n\nOn paper, Trinbago Knight Riders look a solid side, but they are also aware of the fact that their opponents Jamaica Tallawahs cannot be taken lightly. After losing the opening match, Jamaica looked better in their last outing against Barbodas Tridents, which will give them the confidence to perform to their best standards against Trinbago Knight Riders.\n\nTallawahs stars including Lendl Simmons, Kumar Sangakkara and Shakib Al Hasan will hold the key to their team's chances to beat the Knight Riders. Pakistan's Imad Wasim and Mohammad Sami have a tough job in their hand in the bowling department to stop the big hitters of Knight Riders from scoring quick runs. The duo has a huge role to play for Jamaica Tallawahs on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, they cannot just depend on their big players, all of them have to play as a collective unit on Wednesday to emerge as winners.\n\nWhen is the match and how to watch it live\n\nThe seventh match of CPL 2017 between Trinbago and Jamaica will start at 8 pm local time, 5:30 am IST, 12 am GMT.\n\nLive streaming and TV coverage information\n\nIndia: TV: Sony Six, Sony ESPN.

Simmons was severe on both Khary Pierre and Kevon Cooper as he crunched three sixes and two fours in the first four overs. Sangakkara himself collected three consecutive boundaries off Jevon Searles.\n\nAt a crucial stage of the match, Shadab Khan struck in the sixth over to remove Simmons. Sunil Narine, his spin partner, then prised out Andre McCarthy LBW. Narine also dislodged Rovman Powell (18) in the 11th over to lift Trinbago. But the experienced duo of Sangakkara and Shakib Al Hasan (16) almost closed the window of opportunity for Trinbago with a stand of 30 for the fourth wicket.\n\nDwayne Bravo and Cooper then picked up the scalps of Sangakkara and Shakib in successive overs to create a few flutters in the Tallawahs camp. Jonathan Foo, though, collected a six and a boundary off Bravo's final over to level the scores. Even though, Foo was dismissed in the last over, Tallawahs won with four balls to spare. The story could have been different for Trinbago as Shadab fluffed a chance at long-on to give Foo a reprieve in the 19th over. To make matters worse, the ball crossed the boundary rope for a six.\n\nTrinbago also would rue the fact that they lost their last eight wickets for just 38 runs. Colin Munro (41) and Darren Bravo (33) had provided Trinbago the platform to compile a substantial total, with a third-wicket stand of 57 in 35 balls. Bravo (jnr), in particular, played with a sense of fearlessness. His aggressive batting can be capsulised by how he thumped Imad Wasim for successive sixes in the seventh over.\n\nIt was Krishmar Santoke, who eventually took the key scalp of Munro in the 10th over. Despite Sangakkara dropping Denesh Ramdin in the very next over, Trinbago lost a slew of wickets. With Bravo (jnr) in the middle, the hosts would have still hoped for a sizeable total. However, he cracked a drive off Mohammad Sami straight to the fielder stationed at extra cover and was dismissed in the 14th over.\n\nShadab, Bravo (snr), Searles, Cooper and Pierre couldn't last long as they were bundled out in the final over. Santokie, Smith, Sami, Williams and Imad were all among the wickets for Tallawahs.\n\nBoth Tallawahs and Trinbago have now won two of their three matches.\n\nBrief scores: Trinbago Knight Riders 147 in 19.5 overs (Colin Munro 41, Darren Bravo 33; Odean Smith 3-20) lost to Jamaica Tallawahs 148/6 in 19.2 overs (Kumar Sangakkara 47; Sunil Narine 2-21) by 4 wickets.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-10", "textEnd": 272, "textStart": 263}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3350586", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-10T04:25:00Z", "sim": 0.7647058963775635, "source": {"uri": "cricbuzz.com", "title": "Cricbuzz", "id": "2529"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "04:25:00", "url": "http://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/96367/all-round-tallawahs-register-hard-fought-win?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%253A%2BCricbuzzFeed%2B%2528Cricbuzz%253A%2BCricket%2BScores%2Band%2BNews%2529", "storyUri": "eng-3350586", "id": "8318176", "image": "https://i.cricketcb.com/i/news/stories/2017/aug/10//prv_1502338221.jpeg", "date": "2017-08-10", "time": "04:25:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-10"}

Tallawahs consigned hosts Trinbago Knight Riders to their first loss in CPL 2017 with a four-wicket win at Queen's Park Oval. Knight Riders stormed out of the gates courtesy blistering cameos from Sunil Narine, Brendon McCullum and Colin Munro to reach 101 for 2 in eight overs, but could only manage 147 from there. Tallawahs rode a strong start from Lendl Simmons before Kumar Sangakkara's steady 47 overcome a late wobble. Victory was achieved with four balls to spare.\n\nWilliams' slow burn\n\nKesrick Williams' variations denied Knight Riders a turbocharge in the second half of their innings. Williams came into bowl in the third over. He cramped Brendon McCullum for room with his first legal delivery. He then followed that up with a wide slower ball that resulted in McCullum lobbing a gentle catch to mid-off.\n\nOff the first ball of his next over, he had Narine miscuing one to midwicket. Three deliveries later, Williams nearly had a hat-trick of slower-ball wickets when Munro, on 11, dragged one off his legs to Jonathan Foo at backward square leg. The opportunity was fluffed. He came back at the death to pick up a third wicket - with another slower ball - as Javon Searles top-edged a slog to Imad Wsim at cover. His figures of 3 for 26 also earned him the Man of the Match award.\n\nSix and out\n\nWith Knight Riders losing momentum at 124 for 5 in 14 overs, Dwayne Bravo, the captain, needed someone to stick around. Shadab Khan, who showed his capability in the previous game - he made an unbeaten 30 in a tense chase - started with a six, but was consumed by a rush of blood when an ungainly heave resulted in his dismissal.\n\nThird time's a charm for debutant Odean Smith\n\nTallawahs opted for the pace of debutant Odean Smith, instead OF Garey Mathurin. He should've had a wicket off his second ball, but for a missed opportunity by Kumar Sangakkara that gave Darren Bravo a reprieve on 19. Sangakkara muffed another chance off Smith in the 11th over when Denesh Ramdin gloved a pull down the leg side.\n\nPersistence paid off, though, as Smith eventually nabbed Ramdin when he miscued a flick to Shakib Al Hasan at midwicket. Smith's return at the death was impressive too. He rattled the stumps twice with full and straight deliveries to knock over the tail, denying desperately needed lower order runs to finish with 3 for 20.\n\nNo, Narine\n\nSunil Narine took two wickets, but a third, negated by a no-ball, drew greater attention. Sangakkara was on 21, with Tallawahs racing to 44 without loss in five overs, when he slogged one against the turn. Ramdin ran behind the skier and completed a tough catch at square leg. The joy subsided as Narine had overstepped. Simmons punished the free hit to raise the half-century in just 4.3 overs.\n\nCaptain cool\n\nAfter Shadab had Lendl Simmons bowled off his pads for a 17-ball 38 in the sixth over, Narine removed Andre McCarthy and Rovman Powell to cause a flutter in the Tallawahs camp. But Simmons' early charge allowed Sangakkara to drop anchor at the other end.\n\nGiven a second chance off the Narine no ball, Sangakkara played risk-free cricket. The equation was down to a run a ball by the time Sangakkara was dismissed by Dwayne Bravo in the 17th over. Foo then arrived and clipped 19 off 11 to help knock off the rest of the runs required.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3350586", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-10T04:49:00Z", "sim": 0.7607843279838562, "source": {"uri": "espncricinfo.com", "title": "Cricinfo", "id": "1873"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "04:49:00", "url": "http://www.espncricinfo.com/caribbean-premier-league-2017/content/story/1115907.html", "storyUri": "eng-3350586", "id": "8320648", "image": "http://www.espncricinfo.com/db/PICTURES/CMS/266800/266821.3.jpg", "date": "2017-08-10", "time": "04:49:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-10"}

the Queen's Park Oval, Tallawahs got home with four balls remaining to notch their second win in four days, following their opening loss to Barbados Tridents in Florida last weekend.\n\nTallawahs were guided by Sri Lankan star and captain Kumar Sangakkara, who top-scored with 47 while opening partner Lendl Simmons struck 38.\n\nChampion off-spinner Sunil Narine (2-21) and seamer Kevon Cooper (2-25) grabbed two wickets apiece.\n\nNew Zealander Colin Munro had earlier top-scored with 41 as TKR, sent in, were dismissed for 147 with a ball to spare.\n\nLeft-hander Darren Bravo punched 33, while opener Narine blasted 23, but seamers Odean Smith (3-20) and Kesrick Williams (2-36) snatched three wickets apiece to retard TKR's progress.\n\nIn fact, the hosts were cruising at 109 for two in the 10th over before suffering a dramatic collapse, losing their last eight wickets for a mere 38 runs.\n\nNarine had given the innings an energetic start, smacking a pair of fours and sixes in an\n\n11-ball cameo, adding 33 for the first wicket with New Zealander Brendon McCullum (16).\n\nWhen Narine perished in the fifth over caught at midwicket by Simmons off Man of the Match Williams, Munro and Bravo put TKR on top with a 57-run third wicket stand.\n\nMunro struck five fours and two sixes off 25 balls, while Bravo also faced 25 deliveries and counted two fours and two sixes.\n\nOnce Munro holed out in the deep at the end of the 10th, however, the innings slumped into terminal decline.\n\nTallawahs' run chase was given an immediate boost when Sangakkara and Simmons put on 61 off 33 balls for the first wicket.\n\nWhile the left-handed Sangakkara was measured in his 41-ball knock which included seven fours, Simmons played with abandon, carving out four fours and three sixes off just 18 balls.\n\nSimmons was one of three wickets to fall for 32 runs in the space of 30 balls when he was bowled by Pakistan leg-spinner Shadab Khan in the sixth over but Tallawahs

games each and the results have gone as was expected with the only real upset being the two victories recorded by the St Kitts & Nevis Patriots (SNP) over the Guyana Amazon Warriors.\n\nOne has to give a lot of credit to the Trinbago Knight Riders (TKR) as they were mightily impressive in their two performances thus far. Their bowling was absolutely first class in both games with Skipper Dwayne Bravo having seemingly endless attacking options to choose from. I predicted in my previous article, the boy wonder Shadab Khan would cause immense problems for the batsmen and together with ace spinner Sunil Narine, the pair will continue to be a handful.\n\nFrom a batting perspective the Knight Riders will certainly miss Hashim Amla more so at the top of the order but interestingly they will continue to use Narine tactically which will keep their opponents guessing. Amla's absence will put more pressure on the New Zealand pair of Brendon Mc Callum and Chris Munroe but they can be dangerous and with Darren Bravo the Knight Riders are going to take some beating. Having said that, however, their batting was atrocious in the second game against the St Lucia Stars showing that the batting line up can be vulnerable. Boy Wonder Shadab again showed what a talented cricketer he is, this time with the bat (30 n.o) and together with Searles ( 27n.o.) they showed great maturity as well as the depth of batting that the Knight Riders have at their disposal .\n\nThe Patriots won two 'nail biters' against the Guyana Amazon Warriors and I did predict that this could be a turnaround year for the Patriots. Carlos \"Remember the name \" Brathwaite finally came good with bat and ball and basically was instrumental in their victories. In the first game Brathwaite came in with the the patriots struggling at 57 for 5 after 10.4 overs and made a quick fire 31 off of 19 balls to set up the victory. In their second game he bowled the last over with eight runs needed having been clobbered for 38 runs from his first three, Chris Gayle took the gamble, trusting in Brathwaite's ability and he was duly rewarded as only three runs were conceded. The turning point of this game however, came when Fabien Allen took one of the best catches I have seen on a cricket field to dismiss Jason Mohammed who would have won the game for the Warriors were it not for that moment of brilliance.\n\nFor the Warriors Rashid Khan has to be more effective with the ball and they will improve as I thought their bowling was effective. . They will get better as they are a good allround unit and will be hard to beat at home.\n\nThe Barbados Tridents and the Jamaica Tallawahs shared a game each, but I must admit I was disappointed with the batting of the Tridents. It's as clear why they have Kane Williamson opening the batting . They may as well try with Nicholas Pooran in that position and allow Williamson to bat at his favoured No 3 Shoaib Kieron at 4 Pollard at 5 and after that it doesn't matter. I still maintain when the Tridents get going they will be tough to beat . I was disappointed in Wayne Parnell he is a much better cricketer than he showed at the weekend.\n\nThe Tallawahs are a fighting unit under skipper Kumar Sangakkara and this showed. Lendl Simmons is a welcome addition at the top of the order but was careless with his running in the first match and that lapse in judgement contributed to the downfall of the Tallawahs. He has to maintain his form to give the Tallawahs bowlers something to defend as Imad Wasim and Shakib Al Hasan are going to be steady and difficult to score off of. The skipper however, has to show his class with the bat for the Tallawahs to get big totals. They were a bit lucky to get victory over the Tridents as the latter batted poorly Malick was run out stupidly and Dwayne Smith looked a shadow of himself and outside of skipper Pollard the others were AWOL ..\n\nThe biggest disappointment thus far apart from some poor fielding leading to several dropped catches has been the Stars but as Darren Sammy said every team has a bad game and he put the Stars first game down to that . I am not surprised that they lost both games as their squad is not as talented as the Knight Riders and even though they bowled well in the second game they would have all had to click in all departments of the game to really topple the Knight Riders but again I expect them to improve and as the tournament moves along they will cause an upset or two because they do possess some excellent players that can turn a game around .\n\nThe CPL has bowled off with the usual party atmosphere, thrills and excitement and on the pitch its already shaping up to be a fight to the finish.\n\nBefore I close the most unpredictable, competitive, thrilling and most viewed league kicks off tomorrow, that is, the English Premier league and in a subsequent column I will give you my predictions for the season.

in which he scored 369 runs at an average of 46 and strike-rate of 143.\n\nHe made his New Zealand debut in the Twenty20 International series against South Africa in February in which he scored just five runs in the only game he featured in Auckland.\n\nTallawahs assistant coach Mark O'Donnell, who also is in charge of the Aces believes Phillips can provide a lot of flexibility to the squad.\n\n\"Glenn is valuable to any team he joins as he can turn a game on its head with his batting.\n\n\"He is also handy behind the stumps so to have him as a keeping option is also helpful for the Tallawahs,\" he said.\n\nJamaica Tallawahs are currently positioned third in the table with two wins from three games in the ongoing season.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false,

The nature of his innings belied the stability it offered the Knight Riders who lost regular wickets but Narine's boundary-hitting ability ensured they stayed on top of the rate.\n\nThe Knight Riders' run chase got off to a bad start with Brendon McCullum, bowled fourth ball by a Wayne Parnell yorker. Things got worse shortly after when Colin Munro was caught on the boundary off Shoaib Malik, leaving the Knight Riders 28 for 2 after 3.3 overs.\n\nA partnership of 47 off 39 balls between Darren Bravo and Narine arrested the Knight Riders' slide but when Bravo was dismissed on the cusp of the drinks break by Wahab Riaz and Denesh Ramdin was caught in the deep immediately after it the Tridents moved into the ascendency once more.\n\nThrough all of this Narine endured; batting deeper into the innings than in any match in which he had opened the batting. Between ball 6.2 and 13.2 Narine faced 19 balls and only failed to score off one of them. He regularly found the boundary during his innings, hitting five sixes and six fours; 54 of his runs came on the leg side. Single-handedly, despite wickets falling at the other end, he hauled his team to the total.\n\nWhen he was finally dismissed, caught off a top edge at mid-wicket, the Knight Riders were just eight shy of their target with 11 balls remaining. Despite another wicket falling, which reduced the Knight Riders to eight wickets down, Kevon Cooper drove a four to seal the match with five balls to spare.\n\nEarlier in the evening, after being put into bat, the Tridents innings got off to a frenetic start with Dwayne Smith and pinch-hitter Wayne Parnell both dismissed inside the first two overs with 19 runs scored.\n\nThe wicket of Parnell meant Malik joined Kane Williamson at the crease and together the pair combined in a busy partnership of 71 off 61 balls. Against the excellent bowling of Shadab Khan, Narine, Kevon Cooper and Dwayne Bravo the experienced pair rotated the strike expertly - at one stage going 23 deliveries without a dot ball.\n\nWhen Williamson was dismissed - top edging a sweep off Shadab - for 30 off 35 balls he and Malik had laid a platform for the lower order to capitalise on.\n\nHowever, Pollard struggled where Malik and Williamson thrived. Immediately after the wicket, Pollard faced 11 of the 18 remaining balls from Shadab and Narine, scoring just four runs. The pressure on him to make up for a cautious start was palpable.\n\nAfter moving past 7 000 career T20 runs Malik was dismissed for 51 off 38 balls as he looked to kick on, caught at mid-off against Beaton, leaving the Tridents 102 for 3 after 15.3 overs.\n\nMalik's demise brought Nicolas Pooran to the crease who assumed Pollard's role as he himself struggled to, by hitting back to back sixes and a four off Cooper to finally accelerate the innings before holing out when attempting to hit a fourth.\n\nA superb eighteenth over from Beaton saw the run out of Christopher Barnwell and just five runs conceded, leaving the Tridents looking short at 128 for 6 with 12 balls remaining. Four lusty blows - one from Shamar Springer, one from Pollard and two from Akeal Hosein helped propel the Tridents beyond 150. With the final ball of the innings Bravo bowled Pollard with a perfect yorker, dismissing him for 14 off 22 balls. Despite the late boundaries the Tridents had struggled to accelerate.\n\nThe next match is today at 6 p.m. when the St Lucia Stars take on the Guyana Amazon Warriors at the Darren Sammy Cricket Ground in St Lucia.

It's the things he does with a bat in his hands.\n\nLast night his adoring fans saw first hand how Narine is reinventing his cricketing self.\n\nHitting with typical freedom and accepting the generosity of the Barbados Tridents fielders, the man with the licence to smash virtually took the Trinbago Knight Riders to a two-wicket victory, their fourth in five in this season's Hero Caribbean Premier League.\n\nThere could be no other Man-of-the-Match once Narine had batted through to the start of the 19th over when the Tridents finally accepted a catch from him on the fourth attempt. But by the time Wayne Parnell did the business at deep cover to give seamer Shamar Springer the second of his three late wickets, only eight runs were needed for victory and Narine had smashed/stroked his way to a T20-best 79 off 45 balls. And although Javon Searles played on to Springer in that same over, Kevon Cooper finished things off with a boundary at the start of the final over to make it two wins out of three for the TKR at home in the Queen's Park Oval.\n\nNarine's elevation to opener had started in the Indian Premier League. And given the opportunity to remain in the role in the CPL, he has continued to relish the challenge and to blossom. But he had help last night. Lots of it.\n\nThree times when he was eight, 35 and 63, Tino Best, Springer and Christopher Barnwell grassed chances that the giant scoreboard to the west of the ground kept replaying. It was as if the TV people didn't want them to forget their glaring slip-ups. For in the end, those let-offs were probably the difference between the teams.\n\nThe early dismissal of Narine would have created a top-order crisis for TKR, since they lost Brendon McCullum fourth ball of the innings to a Wayne Parnell yorker and Friday's Man-of-the-Match Colin Munro in the fourth to Shoaib Malik. But at 28 for two, Darren Bravo (25, 23 balls) got together with Narine to add 47 for the third wicket. And after Denesh Ramdin fell two balls later, skipper Dwayne Bravo kept him company while another 63 were added. All the while Narine kept doing his thing, going low and high, through off-side and leg-side, not discriminating between sixes (five) and fours (six).\n\nBut while rich entertainment for another full house, it must have been high frustration for visiting captain Kieron Pollard.\n\nHis Tridents were as awful with their catching as the Knight Riders were excellent with theirs. For as was the case against the Guyana Amazon Warriors, dazzling out-cricket again distinguished TKR's work in the field.\n\nBrendon McCullum set the standard when he tumbled to his right at short cover to snare Parnell (five) in the second over as the left-hander pushed at Ronsford Beaton in the second over. But in the first bowled by Khary Pierre, Darren Bravo had already pouched Dwayne Smith, who having hit the left-arm spinner for a four and six in succession, swung to Bravo on the midwicket boundary.\n\nThat sequence of a flurry of boundaries followed by a wicket or two would repeat itself again in a Trident innings that ebbed and flowed; brilliant TKR ground fielding backing up bowlers who combined to stifle runs and take wickets.\n\nThe spin twins Shadab Khan (4-0-20-1) and Narine (4-0-17-0) commanded so much respect that between them they conceded just 37 runs as first Kane Williamson and Malik and then Malik and Pollard opted to play them out and then look to accelerate.\n\nWilliamson (30, 35 balls) didn't get the chance to see that plan through though, as at the end of the 12th over, the opener was caught behind keeper Denesh Ramdin by Narine as he top-edged an attempted slog-sweep of Shadab.\n\nPollard then came to the crease to as deafening an ovation given any Knight Rider. But while he bided his time, the explosion that felled the St Lucia stars in midweek never came. As the Tridents tried to up the tempo against the seamers, they kept losing wickets.\n\nBeaton, dropped for the previous two games, came back in for Robert Frylinck and showed why he was worthy of keeping his place, bowling with accuracy and some calculated aggression to be rewarded with the figures of 4-0-24-2.\n\nBeaton it was who finally got rid of Malik. Having got to 51 off 38 balls, playing with as steady a rhythm as the one being kept by former Olympic quarter-miler Ian Morris and his rhythm section crew, the Pakistani ace miscued a drive that skipper Bravo moved to mid-off to take in the 16thover. He would have been happy to see the set Malik go, for the Tridents now had to up the tempo with fresh batsmen.\n\nIn fact the visitors had only just passed the century mark by that stage at 102 for four. But as has been their style, they put bat to ball in the final four overs, getting 47 at better than 10 an over. Pollard only managed 14 off 22 before good friend Bravo yorked him to end the innings, having also dismissed Akeal Hosein (12, two sixes) the previous ball. Nicholas Pooran also contributed a four and two sweetly hit maximums in his 18 as the Tridents closed on 15 for nine.\n\nThey were about 20 runs short of safety. And Narine made them pay.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3350586", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T11:21:00Z", "sim": 0.5843137502670288, "source": {"uri": "trinidadexpress.com", "title": "", "id": "4359"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "11:21:00", "url": "http://www.trinidadexpress.com/20170813/sports/narine-hammers-tridents", "storyUri": "eng-3350586", "id": "8907637", "image": "http://www.trinidadexpress.comhttp://www.trinidadexpress.com/storyimage/TT/20170813/LOCAL/170819841/AR/0/AR-170819841.jpg&MaxW=400", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "11:21:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Aug. 11, 2017: Legendary triple Olympian, Jamaica's Usain St. Leo Bolt, will run for the last time tomorrow, Sat. August 12th.\n\nBolt, who many had hoped to end his solo career with a 12 gold medal, fell short to the US' Justin Gatlin last Saturday. Bolt is now hoping to redeem that for his fans and country tomorrow when he runs for Jamaica in the 4x100m relay at the IAAF 2017 World Championships in London.\n\nHeats for the 4x100m will take place also on Saturday. NBC will show the race to its US fans between 3 and 5 p.m. on Sat. afternoon, Aug. 12.\n\nBolt is keen to bring his experience, despite feeling a little sore after his efforts in the individual event.\n\n'Physically I am alright, there is a little bit of pain, but nothing a massage can't cure, I'm taking it easy,' Bolt said of his condition two days after clocking a season's best equaling 9.95 seconds in the 100-m final.\n\nBut he added: \"We'll see, we haven't done any baton changes as yet with the guys, but I feel we are ready.\"\n\nThe race comes as Jamaican track and field legends Merlene Ottey and Bolt shared an iconic moment in London this week, when the 'sprint queen' visited with local athletes at the World Championships.\n\nThe two legends took a photo together which was shared by Bolt on social media on Wednesday, attracting hundreds of likes, shares and comments.\n\nCARIBBEAN MEDAL COUNT AT IAAF\n\nThe Caribbean's medal count at the IAAF World Championship yesterday ticked to six with two bronze wins by two Caribbean athletes yesterday, Aug. 10, 2017.\n\nTwenty-three-year-old Jereem Richards of Trinidad and Tobago won bronze in the men's 200-m finals. Richards medaled in a time of 20.107 behind South Africa's Wayde Van Niekerk who was beaten into second by Turkish runner, 27-year-old Ramil Guliyev.\n\nRichards, however, complained that his race had been undermined when he slipped coming out of his blocks. \"I tried my best not to let it affect me too much,\" he said. \"At the turn I wasn't in contention really, so to get a medal from there is a great achievement.\" It was the first global men's 100 or 200m final since 2003 not to feature a US or Jamaican medalist.\n\nMeanwhile, Ristananna Tracey also won a bronze for Jamaica in the women's 400-m hurdles finals. She was beaten into third by the US' Koris Carter who took the gold and Dalilah Muhammad, also of the US, who was second.\n\n\"This season has been full of setbacks and it has taken a lot of mental strength to get into this position,\" said Tracey, who smashed her previous best of 54.15 set in the Rio final last year where she finished fifth. \"It was a very strong race and I kept telling myself not to panic. Off the last hurdle I gave everything and threw myself for a dip just in case.\"\n\nJamaica now leads the Caribbean with three medals -two bronze and one gold, while Cuba, The Bahamas and Trinidad & Tobago have one each.\n\nCPL 2017 Continues\n\nTrinbago Knight Riders, fresh from a loss to the Jamaica Tallawahs will have to face the Guyana Amazon Warriors today.\n\nThe two sides will clash at Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad at 9:00 PM tonight. So far this season, the battle seems to be between the Tallawahs, The St. Kitts & Nevis Patriots and the Knight Riders. All have four points to date with seven matches played so far this season and have each won two of their matches.\n\nBut the real battle continues to be between the Riders and the Tallawahs. The highest scorers continue to be a battle between the Tallawahs Lendl Simmons and the Knight Riders Colin Munro.\n\nHowever, it is Knight Riders' Kevon Cooper who has bagged the most wickets so far this season compared to the Tallawahs Kebrick Williams. The highest individual scorer so far this year is The Riders Colin Munro, not Tallawahs' Chris Gayle while the maximum sixes so far has been hit by Riders' Brendon McCullum. Still Tallawahs Gayle is holding on strong to the highest individual score this season - 66.\n\nThe CPL T20 2017 Schedule For The Rest of The Week is as follows:\n\nAug 12, Sat. - St Lucia Stars vs St Kitts and Nevis Patriots, 10th Match, Darren Sammy National Cricket Stadium, Gros Islet, St Lucia - 5:00 PM\n\nTrinbago Knight Riders vs Barbados Tridents, 11th Match - Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad - 9:00 PM (Aug 12)\n\nAug 13, Sun. - St Lucia Stars vs Guyana Amazon Warriors, 12th Match, Darren Sammy National Cricket Stadium, Gros Islet, St Lucia - 6:00 PM\n\nAug 14, Mon. - Trinbago Knight Riders vs St Kitts and Nevis Patriots, 13th Match, Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad - 7:59 PM\n\nAug 15, Tues. - St Lucia Stars vs Jamaica Tallawahs, 14th Match, Darren Sammy National Cricket Stadium, Gros Islet, St Lucia - 6:00 PM\n\nAug 17, Thurs. - Guyana Amazon Warriors vs Jamaica Tallawahs, 15th Match, Providence Stadium, Guyana - 6:00 PM\n\nAug 18, Fri. - St Kitts and Nevis Patriots vs Barbados Tridents, 16th Match, Warner Park, Basseterre, St Kitts - 9:00 PM (Aug 18)", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-11", "textEnd": 47, "textStart": 34}, {"imp": true, "textEnd": 159, "amb": false, "date": "2017-08-12", "textStart": 148, "freq": 4}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-10", "textEnd": 1561, "textStart": 1548}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-13", "textEnd": 4305, "textStart": 4299}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-14", "textEnd": 4445, "textStart": 4439}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-15", "textEnd": 4581, "textStart": 4575}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-17", "textEnd": 4717, "textStart": 4711}, {"imp": true, "textEnd": 4829, "amb": false, "date": "2017-08-18", "textStart": 4823, "freq": 2}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3350586", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-10T23:42:00Z", "sim": 0.5764706134796143, "source": {"uri": "newsamericasnow.com", "title": "newsamericasnow.com", "id": "12994"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "23:42:00", "url": "http://www.newsamericasnow.com/caribbean-sports-usain-bolt-to-run-final-race-of-his-career-saturday/", "storyUri": "eng-3350586", "id": "8507150", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "time": "23:42:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-10"}

Caribbean Premier League (CPL) debut was continued as he did not featur for Trinbago Knight Riders in Wednesday's match against Jamaica Tallawahs -- Shakib Al Hasan's team -- at the Queen's Park Oval in Port of Spain, Trinidad.\n\nAfter an impressive all-round performance in the previous game, Shakib was also off colour in the match but still his side, led by Sri Lanka legend Kumar Sangakkara, posted a four-wicket victory.\n\nShakib bowled only one over and conceded 12 runs, before scoring 16 off 22 balls in Jamaica's successful chase of 148.\n\nMehedi Hasan's Trinbago Knight Riders will play their next game against Guyana Amazon at the same venue at 7:00am (Bangladesh time) tomorrow while Shakib's Jamaica Tallawahs will take on St Lucia Stars in their next match on the morning of August 16 (Bangladesh time).\n\nBoth the players are likely to get two more matches before returning home for the two-match Test series against Australia. Australia will arrive in Dhaka on August 18 to play two Tests in Mirpur and Chittagong.\n\nWhile Shakib is a veteran of T20 leagues around the world, Mehedi's stint with the Knight Riders is his first experience of playing in a foreign league. He has however been restricted to the reserve bench so far, and with the Knight Riders leading the six-team table, there might not be a reason to ring in the changes before Mehedi returns.\n\nThe rest of the Bangladesh players are currently engaged in a training camp in Chittagong, ahead of the two Test series which will begin with the first Test at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur on August 27, before shifting to Chittagong's Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium for the second Test from September 4.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-16", "textEnd": 879, "textStart": 870}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-18", "textEnd": 1066, "textStart": 1057}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-27", "textEnd": 1672, "textStart": 1663}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-09-04", "textEnd": 1772, "textStart": 1761}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3350586", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-10T19:12:00Z", "sim": 0.5607843399047852, "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net", "title": "The Daily Star", "id": "4566"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "19:12:00", "url": "http://www.thedailystar.net/sports/cricket/mehedi-the-bench-jamaica-win-1446814", "storyUri": "eng-3350586", "id": "8470343", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "time": "19:12:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-10"}

After restricting Barbados Tridents batsmen with some tight bowling, the southpaw unleashed his all-out attack approach on the visiting bowlers and scored a 45-ball 79 and took the side to a two-wicket win. In one of the most effective showcase of pinch hitting, Narine slammed six fours and five sixes in his innings.\n\nIn what proved to be a near single-handed effort in the chase, Narine led the carnage and carried that on for more than 18 overs in the chase to ensure the 153-run target was chased down despite a below-par show by the other batsmen. Nine other players, who walked out to bat, combined to score only 76 runs off 70 balls. Barring Narine, the Bravo brothers - Dwayne (20-ball 18) and Darren (23-ball 25) were the only ones to register double-digit scores as Wayne Parnell and Shamar Springer ensured the chase wouldn't be as easy despite Narine's onslaught.\n\nTrinbago's innings didn't start off on a good note as Parnell's yorker managed to sneak past McCullum's bat and uproot the off stump. It could've just gotten worse when Narine miscued a pull off Wahab Riaz, but Tino Best dropped a sitter. As it proved in the end, the drop was much costlier than what both the sides would have imagined. Narine, who had already started off that over with consecutive boundaries, finished it off with a six over third man.\n\nIn many ways, while Narine's stand with Darren Bravo got the innings going, it was the partnership with Dwayne which more or less sealed the chase for the hosts. While Narine was playing his slogs, the latter was content with picking the easy runs. Together, they added 47 runs in 38 balls and set the tone, before another period of two quick wickets helped Trident get back on top. Narine, who had played the second fiddle in the earlier partnership, took the centrestage and helped turn the tables.\n\nNarine reserved special treatment for Kieron Pollard and hammered him for two sixes and a boundary in the 13th over. The sub-par standard of fielding didn't help Tridents' cause much either. In the 14th over, Narine was dropped again. Two balls later Dwayne Bravo also got a reprieve. There wasn't any dearth of misfields either. What seemed to have become an easy chase by then, got complicated a bit towards the end with a flurry of wickets falling.\n\nKevon Cooper, nonetheless, held his nerves and took the side over the line, with two wickets in hand and five balls to spare.\n\nEarlier in the day, Tridents, who were put into bat, began in an approach they have adopted right through the tournament: Dwayne Smith went on the offensive while Kane Williamson was watchful. But two quick wickets didn't allow the visitors to break away the way they would have wanted in the powerplay. Smith's stay lasted only five balls, while promoting Wayne Parnell to No 3 didn't work out too well either. Within the first two overs, both the batsmen were back in the pavilion.\n\nIt was in the company of Shoaib Malik, that Williamson found an able ally to resurrect Tridents' innings. Even as his innings lacked the usual fluency, with Malik scoring rather freely, their stand didn't put much pressure on the scoreboard. The spin duo of Shadab Khan and Narine strangled the batsmen for runs in the middle overs. In their combined eight overs, they conceded only 37 runs and no boundaries.\n\nEven as Malik and Williamson's experience ensured there was no urgency in the middle for the big shots, the latter departed in the 12th over after top edging a sweep outside off to the short third man fielder.\n\nMalik, soon after notching up his 42nd T20 fifty, looked to send Beaton out of the park but ended up finding Dwayne Bravo at long off. Wickets fell regularly in the last few overs, but Nicholas Pooran and Akeal Hosein's big hits gave the scoreboard a much needed push and helped them go past the 150-run mark.\n\nBrief Scores: Barbados Tridents 152/9 in 50 overs (Shoaib Malik 51, Kane Williamson 30; Ronsford Beaton 2-24, Dwayne Bravo 2-27) lost to Trinbago Knight Riders 155/8 in 19.1 overs (Sunil Narine 79, Darren Bravo 25; Shamar Springer 3-32, Wayne Parnell 2-26) by 2 wickets", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-12", "textEnd": 160, "textStart": 151}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3350586", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T05:58:00Z", "sim": 0.4941176474094391, "source": {"uri": "cricbuzz.com", "title": "Cricbuzz", "id": "2529"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "06:21:00", "url": "http://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/96421/narines-all-round-brilliance-powers-trinbago-to-win?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%253A%2BCricbuzzFeed%2B%2528Cricbuzz%253A%2BCricket%2BScores%2Band%2BNews%2529", "storyUri": "eng-3350586", "id": "8879175", "image": "https://i.cricketcb.com/i/news/stories/2017/aug/13//prv_1502603911.jpeg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "05:58:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

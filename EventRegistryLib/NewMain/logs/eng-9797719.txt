In the annual report of Reliance Industries, it was disclosed that Mukesh Ambani has not taken any salary since the COVID-19 pandemic began. His salary has been zero since the financial year 2020-21. Despite not taking a salary, Ambani does not sell his shares either. So, how does he manage his expenses?\n\nMukesh Ambani's major source of income is dividends. A dividend is a portion of a company's profit distributed to its shareholders. For instance, if Reliance Industries earns a profit of \u20b91,000 crore, it might reinvest \u20b9500 crore into the company and distribute the remaining \u20b9500 crore among its shareholders. As a significant shareholder, Ambani receives a substantial portion of these dividends.\n\nAmbani and his family own a 50.39% stake in Reliance Industries. Specifically, Mukesh Ambani holds 0.12% of the shares, equating to 80 lakh shares. His family, including his mother Kokilaben Ambani, wife Nita Ambani, and children Akash, Isha, and Anant Ambani, also hold significant shares. Reliance typically distributes dividends ranging from \u20b96.30 to \u20b910 per share annually. Therefore, even a conservative estimate suggests Ambani's earnings from dividends alone are substantial.\n\nIn addition to dividends, Ambani earns from other ventures. He owns the IPL team Mumbai Indians, which generates significant revenue. Furthermore, he has personal investments in various private firms, adding to his income streams.\n\nFor example, in the fourth quarter of FY24, Reliance Industries declared a dividend of \u20b910 per share. With 80 lakh shares, Ambani personally earned \u20b98 crore from this dividend alone. Including the earnings from the entire promoter group, the Ambani family's income from dividends in 2023-24 was approximately \u20b93,322 crore. This demonstrates how Ambani manages to earn billions without taking a salary.\n\nMukesh Ambani's financial strategy highlights the power of dividends and diversified investments. Despite not taking a salary or selling shares, he effectively manages his expenses and maintains his wealth through smart financial planning and investment. This approach not only secures his financial stability but also exemplifies a model of wealth management in the corporate world.", "source": {"uri": "dnaindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhirubhai_Ambani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dhirubhai Ambani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliance_Industries", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reliance Industries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukesh_Ambani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mukesh Ambani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nita_Ambani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nita Ambani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_promoter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corporate promoter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai Indians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wealth management"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Money_Managers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Money Managers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2024/08/06/2644664-work-74.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797719", "eventUri": "eng-9797719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Is his salary more than Isha Ambani?", "body": "In the shadow of the towering fortunes of the Ambani family, a new question looms large: How much does Mukesh and Nita Ambani's youngest son, Anant, actually earn? Known for his low-key lifestyle and understated presence, Anant Ambani's financial prowess is now coming under the spotlight, revealing a competitive edge that rivals even his elder sister Isha.\n\nMukesh Ambani, Asia's richest individual, and his wife, Nita, have meticulously groomed their three children -- Akash, Isha, and Anant -- into the realm of high-stakes business. Each has made notable strides in their respective roles within the sprawling empire of Reliance Industries.\n\nBorn on April 10, 1995, Anant Ambani is 29 years old and has pursued a prestigious education. His academic journey began at Dhirubhai International School and culminated at Brown University in the United States. Currently, Anant is heavily involved in global operations related to green and renewable energy, a sector pivotal to Reliance's future ambitions. His role in expanding the new energy business is significant, and his responsibilities extend to the boards of Reliance Retail, Jio Platforms Limited, and Reliance Retail Ventures Limited. Despite his youth, Anant's influence within the company is notable.\n\nThe financials are equally striking. Reports indicate that Anant Ambani earns an annual salary of Rs 4.2 crore, aligning closely with his elder sister Isha Ambani's earnings. However, Anant's net worth dwarfs many, standing at an impressive $40 billion (approximately Rs 335770 crore).\n\nFor comparison, Isha Ambani, born on October 23, 1991, holds executive roles in Reliance Retail, Reliance Jio, and the Reliance Foundation, alongside her responsibilities at Dhirubhai Ambani International School. Her annual salary mirrors Anant's at Rs 4.2 crore. However, her net worth is reported to be $100 million (around Rs 831 crore), significantly less than Anant's but still substantial.\n\nAnant's elder brother Akash Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Jio Infocomm and director at Reliance Retail Ventures and Jio Platforms Limited, commands a higher salary of approximately Rs 5.4 crore annually.", "source": {"uri": "dnaindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhirubhai_Ambani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dhirubhai Ambani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukesh_Ambani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mukesh Ambani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nita_Ambani", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nita Ambani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliance_Retail", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reliance Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliance_Industries", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reliance Industries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jio_Platforms", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jio Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliance_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reliance Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jio", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhirubhai_Ambani_International_School", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dhirubhai Ambani International School"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Small_Business", "label": "dmoz/Business/Small Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2024/08/07/2644711-work-79.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797719", "eventUri": "eng-9797719", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1995-04-10", "textStart": 655, "textEnd": 669}, {"amb": false, "date": "1991-10-23", "textStart": 1587, "textEnd": 1603}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

during the peak of the Covid crisis in 2020, continues to draw no salary from the conglomerate for the fourth year in a row.\n\nRIL's latest annual report shows that Ambani did not take any salary from the company in his capacity as the Chairman and Managing Director.\n\nIn June 2020, Ambani voluntarily decided to forego his entire remuneration including salary, allowances, perquisites, retiral benefits as well as any commissions for the year 2020-21 in light of the COVID-19 outbreak in India, which exacted a huge toll on the societal, economic and industrial health of the nation.\n\nHe continued to forgo his entire remuneration in 2021-22, 2022-23, and now in 2023-24 as well.\n\nBefore that, Ambani had his remuneration capped at Rs 15 crore since 2008-09 to set a personal example of moderation in managerial compensation levels.\n\nPut together, the Ambani family owns over 50% stake in India's most valued company and the only one to have crossed the Rs 20 lakh crore in market capitalization.\n\nThe 61-year-old business tycoon's net worth is estimated to be about $109 billion and is the 11th richest person in the world, behind the likes of Warren Buffett, Google cofounders Sergey Brin, and Larry Page.\n\nHaving consolidated its balance sheet after the previous round of capital expenditure, RIL is now ready for the next level of growth. \"Our constant endeavor to find

Notable highlights include enhancements in agricultural livelihoods for 2.6 million people and reaching 3.7 million with advisories to transform their lives.

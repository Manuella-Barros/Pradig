M I Khan reports from Patna.\n\nBihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Thursday recommended a Central Bureau off Investigation probe into the Rs 1,000-crore Srijan scam in Bhagalpur district, allegedly involving Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi and other senior Bharatiya Janata Party leaders and top officers.\n\nAccording to the Chief Minister's Office in Patna, Kumar has directed the state chief secretary and director general of Police to hand over the case to the CBI.\n\nOpposition Rashtriya Janata Dal, including leader of opposition Tejashwi Yadav, has repeatedly demanded a CBI probe into the alleged scam.\n\n\"It is high time chief minister recommended a CBI probe into the Srijan scam as he has been repeatedly claiming of zero tolerance against corruption,\" Tejashwi, who is in Bhagalpur in connection with his ongoing Janadesh Apman Yatra, said.\n\nTejashwi said he was not allowed to hold a meeting in Bhagalpur since Wednesday as the state government has directed the district administration to impose Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\n\"The government is afraid of me exposing involvement of their leaders in the scam. Deputy Chief Minister Sushill Kumar Modi was state finance minister when crores of rupees were looted. No one but Modi is responsible for it,\" he said.\n\nIn Patna, senior RJD leader and former minister Jagdanand Singh earlier on Thursday demanded a CBI probe into the scam.\n\n\"The state government should recommend a CBI probe within a week and the RJD will not allow Nitish Kumar to save some senior BJP leaders, including Sushil Modi, who are involved in it,\" Singh said.\n\nSingh said the RJD will launch an agitation on the streets if Nitish Kumar failed to order a CBI probe into it.\n\nRJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, who is in Ranchi to appear before a CBI court in connection with the fodder scam, demanded the Bihar CM to sack his deputy and lodge a case against him and arrest him for his 'direct involvement in Rs 1,000-crore' scam.\n\nHe had also demanded a CBI probe into the scam allegedly involving the deputy CM and an NGO, where funds were illegally transferred to private accounts between 2005 and 2013.\n\nLalu said, \"Nitish Kumar should sack Modi from his ministry immediately if he has zero tolerance against the corruption and lodge an FIR against him and arrest him. There are solid evidences of Modi's involvement in the scam when he was the finance minister.\"\n\nLalu said Modi is not the only senior BJP leader behind this scam, which is bigger than the fodder scam that surfaced in mid 90s.\n\n\"Modi and other BJP leaders, including BJP MP Ashwani Kumar Choubey, Manoj Tiwari and former Union minister Shahnawaz Hussain are involved in the scam,\" Lalu said.\n\nModi holds the finance portfolio in the current dispensation also.\n\nLalu said he doesn't have faith in the ongoing probe into the scam by a state agency.\n\n\"Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi should take cognisance of the scam and order a CBI probe into it because the state government agency is not reliable to investigate as Sushil Kumar Modi is involved in it,\" Lalu said.\n\nAfter days of investigations, a Special Investigation Team of Bihar Police's Economic Offence Unit said at least Rs 700 crore was diverted from bank accounts of different departments including Mukhyamantri Shahari Vikas Yojna in Bhagalpur district.\n\n\"Now it has crossed Rs 700 crore and it may increase in coming days with the probe still on,\" an official of the SIT said.\n\nSo far, eight people have been arrested -- including Prem Kumar, PA of Bhagalpur district magistrate, on Friday -- in connection with the scam in the last three days.\n\nSIT officials said an FIR was lodged on Tuesday evening at Tilkamanjhi police station in connection with fraudulent withdrawal of Rs 10.26 crore funds of the Mukhyamantri Shahari Vikas Yojana, against board members of Srijan Sahayog Mahila Vikas Samiti, a Sabour-based NGO and officials of the Indian Bank.\n\nTwo more FIRs were lodged on Wednesday in connection with fraudulent withdrawal of funds of the land acquisition department.\n\nA public interest litigation was filed in the Patna high court on Wednesday seeking a CBI probe into the scam.\n\nThe petition was filed by Manibhusan Pratap, an advocate of Patna high court.\n\nThe petitioner has informed the court that Srijan scam is of over Rs 1,000 crore involving top political leaders and officers.\n\n\"I have demanded the court to intervene and order a CBI probe into this scam,\" Pratap said.\n\nHe said a CBI probe is necessary for transparency in the probe into the scam.\n\nIt is first such case when serious corruption allegations have been levelled against the Nitishh Kumar-led government in Bihar.", "id": "9744190", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Nitish recommends CBI probe in scam which RJD alleged involves Sushil Modi", "image":

None but Modi is responsible for it\".\n\nLalu Prasad, who is appearing before a CBI court in Ranchi in connection with fodder scam, said: \"Nitish Kumar should sack Modi immediately if he has zero tolerance against corruption, and arrest him. There are solid evidences of Modi's involvement in the scam.\"\n\nClaiming that Sushil Kumar Modi is not the only senior BJP leader involved in the scam, he also alleged that other party leaders including MP Ashwani Kumar Choubey, Manoj Tiwari and former Union Minister Shahnawaz Hussain are also implicated.\n\nUrging Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take cognizance of the scam and order a CBI probe, he said the state government agency, probing the scam, is not reliable as Sushil Kumar Modi is involved in it.\n\nIn Patna, senior RJD leader and former Minister Jagda Nand Singh said the party will launch an agitation if Nitish Kumar failed to recommend a CBI probe.\n\n\"The state government should recommend a CBI probe within a week and RJD will not allow Nitish Kumar to save and protect some senior BJP leaders, including Modi, involved in it,\" he said.\n\nA public interest litigation was also filed in the Patna High Court on Wednesday by advocate Manibhusan Pratap, seeking a CBI probe into the scam.\n\nAfter days of investigation, a Special Investigation Team said crores were diverted from the bank accounts of different departments, including Mukhyamantri Shahari Vikas Yojna in Bhagalpur district, with the help of NGO Srijan Sahayog Mahila Vikas Samiti.\n\nSo far, eight people have been arrested, including Prem Kumar, an aide of the Bhagalpur District Magistrate, in

Protesting the district administration's action, Yadav, who reached Bhagalpur at 1 am, sat on dharna for close to two hours at the Ambedkar roundabout near the Bhagalpur railway station.\n\nPresident of the Bhagalpur district of the RJD, Tirupati Nath, said the district administration had rejected its request after the RJD procured permission from the school managing committee to hold the meeting on its campus.\n\nRJD town president Salauddin Ahsan said that the party had applied for permission on August 14, but the denial came at the eleventh hour.\n\nDefending the decision, Sabour sub-divisional officer Roshan Kushwaha said, \"Yadav's rally coincided with the Bishari puja, a local festival. Citing law and order issues, the police station concerned had expressed its inability to manage the two programmes efficiently.\"\n\nThe RJD workers were also sore that Yadav, who is leader of the opposition in the Bihar legislative assembly, was not accommodated at the circuit house in Bhagalpur. Arrangements for Yadav's stay had been made at the guest house of the Rajendra Agriculture University in Sabour. Yadav, however, preferred to stay at a private hotel.\n\nYadav had on August 9 embarked on a statewide 'Janadesh Apman Yatra' -- a campaign against chief minister Nitish's JD(U) for betrayal of public mandate -- from Motihari. He is in Bhagalpur to expose the multi-crore government fund transfer scam, involving an NGO.\n\nWorking in cahoots with bankers and treasury officials, the Srijan Mahila Sahyog Samiti, an NGO, used to surreptitiously divert government funds into its accounts by writing its account number on the reverse side of cheques, issued by district treasuries to different government departments. The NGO also allegedly fudged bank passbooks and escaped government audit between 2007 and 2014 and continued to earn interest on principal amount.\n\nChief minister Nitish Kumar had unraveled the scam early this month. Since then, there has been a flurry of accusations, with RJD leader Lalu Prasad alleging a nexus between the NGO founder Manorama Devi, since dead, and the BJP. Prasad had also shown photographs of some top BJP leaders with Devi.\n\nThe RJD leader, who has been demanding a CBI probe in the scam, dared the Prime Minister to take action against deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi, who was the finance minister of Bihar during the period of the scam. Prasad even alleged that the fodder scam, in which he has been convicted, was 'peanuts' given the magnitude of the government fund transfer scam, which, he said, ran into thousands of crores of rupees.\n\nEleven persons have so far been arrested in the Rs 700-crore scam.", "id": "9638324", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Denied nod to hold public meeting at Bhagalpur, Tejashwi sits on midnight dharna", "image": "http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2017/08/17/Pictures/floor-test-in-bihar_e9c51844-830a-11e7-aa81-8a4dce36eef3.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 1199, "date": "2017-08-14", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1208}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 1872, "date": "2017-08-09", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1880}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "State of Bih\u0101r"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "55084", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar", "label": {"eng": "State of Bih\u0101r"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bh\u0101galpur"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55172", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagalpur_district", "label": {"eng": "Bh\u0101galpur"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}, "id": "309647", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party"}, {"label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}, "id": "309893", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rashtriya Janata Dal"}, "id": "323552", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashtriya_Janata_Dal"}, {"label": {"eng": "Yadav"}, "id": "323553", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yadav"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nitish Kumar"}, "id": "324696", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitish_Kumar"}, {"label": {"eng": "Janata Dal (United)"}, "id": "324697", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janata_Dal_(United)"}, {"location": null, "score": 5, "id": "324719", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagalpur", "label": {"eng": "Bhagalpur"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sushil Kumar Modi"}, "id": "384876", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushil_Kumar_Modi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dharna"}, "id": "396684", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharna"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lalu Prasad Yadav"}, "id": "527333", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalu_Prasad_Yadav"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 654, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The Americas", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/The_Americas"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 993, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud"}], "time": "08:06:00"}

According to IANS, the scam could be worth over Rs 1000-crore, while The Indian Express reported on August 15 that the scam is suspected to be worth over Rs 700 crore.\n\nModus Operandi\n\nOn August 14, Hindustan Times published the modus operandi of the scamsters unraveled by investigators probing into the case. According to the report, the NGO was working in cahoots with bankers and treasury officials to secretly divert government funds into its account and earn interest on the principal amount, while leaving it as it is. For this, the NGO used to write its account number on the reverse side of cheques issued by district treasuries to several government departments. The scamsters had also developed a system to generate fake e-statement of the bank to avoid getting caught. These fake statements were regularly sent to government offices for record keeping.\n\nMoreover, the NGO also used to allegedly offer loans to people at very high rates of interest.\n\nThe NGO also prepared fake passbooks and escaped government audit between 2007-14, according to HT. The investigators have seized the laptop, which was used for running the fake banking software, printer, pen drives and alleged copies of bank e-statements. Nine people have also been arrested in connection with the case.\n\nThe details of the scam were exposed after officials seized the laptop from the possession of one of the accused.\n\nThe investigators are surprised as to how the NGO managed to carryout the fraud without getting noticed. Even the government departments failed to notice when fake e-statements continued to arrive despite no one asking for it. Bihar chief secretary Anjani Kumar Singh told HT that the fake e-statements didn't even bear the signature of bank officials.\n\nThe investigators suspect the involvement of some government officials as well.\n\nAccording to IE, the government funds were apparently transferred to Srijan's accounts in Bhagalpur branch of Indian Bank and branches of Bank of Baroda.\n\nA senior police officer explained the Modus Operandi to The Telegraph like this: When the district magistrate used to issue cheque to the bank concerned to transfer funds from the treasury, staff member in his office used to stamp a fake signature at the back of the cheque with instruction to deposit the money in the NGO's account. The officer told the daily that when the DM issued a new cheque for government expenses, the money was sent back to the account of the district administration from Srijan's account. This is how the DM's cheque never bounced and no body noticed the fraud. Further, the NGO also used to print fake e-statements at its office and provide to the DM's office when required.\n\nWhy Nitish Kumar and Sushil Kumar Modi are under fire from the opposition\n\nNitish Kumar has ruled the state since 2005, while Modi was the state finance minister for most of the time when the alleged fraud took place. RJD chief Lalu Prasad has demanded a CBI probe into the matter and demanded the resignation of Modi. A PIL demanding CBI probe into the case has also been filed in the Patna High Court by advocate Manibhushan Pratap Sengar.\n\nSengar has alleged that this is a scam worth over Rs 1000 crore and top politicians and officials may be involved in the scam.\n\nOn Thursday, Lalu leveled allegations against Kumar, BJP leaders Sushil Modi, Shahnawaz Hussain, Giriraj Kishore, Nishikant Dubey and Vipin Bihari. Lalu alleged that Nitish has joined hands with BJP to save himself from the probe into the scam.", "id": "9667554", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Rs 1000-crore Srijan Scam rocks Bihar: Nitish Kumar, Sushil Modi under fire; all you need to know about the case", "image": "http://images.financialexpress.com/2017/08/nitish-kumar-sushul-kumar-modi-pti.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 1093, "date": "2017-08-15", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1102}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 1181, "date": "2017-08-14", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1190}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "State of Bih\u0101r"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "55084", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar", "label": {"eng": "State of Bih\u0101r"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Bh\u0101galpur"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "55172", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagalpur_district", "label": {"eng": "Bh\u0101galpur"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Government"}, "id": "303023", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government"}, {"label": {"eng": "Crore"}, "id": "306102", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore"}, {"label": {"eng": "Forgery"}, "id": "309122", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgery"}, {"label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}, "id": "309893", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Indian Express"}, "id": "312253", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indian_Express"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rashtriya Janata Dal"}, "id": "323552", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashtriya_Janata_Dal"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nitish Kumar"}, "id": "324696", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitish_Kumar"}, {"location": null, "score": 5, "id": "324719", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagalpur", "label": {"eng": "Bhagalpur"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bank of Baroda"}, "id": "358935", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Baroda"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hindustan Times"}, "id": "381132", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Times"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sushil Kumar Modi"}, "id": "384876", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushil_Kumar_Modi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Indian Bank"}, "id": "455683", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Bank"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lalu Prasad Yadav"}, "id": "527333", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalu_Prasad_Yadav"}, {"label": {"eng": "Government of Bihar"}, "id": "589888", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Bihar"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 268, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 325, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 993, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud"}], "time": "10:51:00"}

The tenure of nine district magistrates is also under the scanner.\n\nThe case pertains to alleged illegal transfer of government funds under various heads to the accounts of Bhagalpur-based cooperative society Srijan Mahila Vikas Sahyog Samiti Limited. The accounts were in two banks -- Bank of Baroda and Indian Bank -- where the government too has accounts.\n\nThe alleged swindling began in 2006 and continued till the death of Srijan founder-secretary Manorama Devi in February 2017.

Tejashwi sat on a dharna for over two hours till 3 am before SSP Manoj Kumar convinced him to call it off. While denying permission to Tejashwi, citing security reasons, the district administration had also imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144, which prevents assemblage of more than four persons in the area. Prohibitory orders were clamped in view of the 'Bishari Puja', a local festival of the district. According to party sources, the rejection came late Wednesday evening, when the former deputy CM was on way to Bhagalpur by road.\n\nAddressing a gathering here, the former deputy CM said, \"Srijan scam is bigger than the 'Vyapam ghotala' in Madhya Pradesh and the state government now wants to cover it up.

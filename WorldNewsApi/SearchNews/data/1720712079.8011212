Each morning will feature a Golf Talk Today, where the crew will discuss various elements throughout the PGA Tour, LPGA, LIV Golf, and more. In this second installment, let\u2019s discuss Scottie Scheffler's round on Saturday at the Memorial Tournament and how some melted on Moving Day. So brew a pot of coffee, grab some breakfast, and settle in as we discuss the top stories in professional golf. First, let\u2019s take a look at the leaderboard after 36 holes. 1. Scottie Scheffler: -10 T2. Collin Morikawa: -6T2: Sepp Straka: -6 T2: Adam Hadwin: -6T5: Xander Schauffele: -4T5: Ludvig \u00c5berg: -4T7: Victor Perez: -3T7: Sahith Theegala: -3T7: Nick Dunlap: -3T7: Christian Bezuidenhout: -3 Scheffler holds a comfortable 5-stroke lead over Adam Hadwin, Collin Morikawa and Sepp Straka. Moving Day was a struggle for Viktor Hovland, who shot a 5-over 77. He fell down the leaderboard, and his meltdown on the back nine ended any hope of defending his title at Muirfield Village. However, Scheffler was far from perfect on Saturday. A horrendous triple on the par-4 9th made him look human, which caused thoughts to creep in on how the former Texas Longhorn could not win after April. Scheffler did not let that mishap affect him, though. He added three more birdies and a bogey on 18 to sign for a 1-under 71. At this point, the heater that Scheffler is on is his to lose. With a five-shot lead heading into the final day of play, the world could see him take home a win at Jack\u2019s Place. This leaderboard has a little of everything: The No.1 player in the world with a hefty lead, a two-time major champion in Morikawa, the reigning PGA Championship winner, and a few guys looking to take home their first Signature Event victory. Let this stat sink in on what Scheffler is historically doing on the PGA Tour right now. \u201cHe\u2019s far and above the No. 1 player in the world, I believe, especially after watching today,\u201d Adam Hadwin said about Scheffler. \u201cI don\u2019t expect him to lose this golf tournament, so one of us is going to have to make a run tomorrow.\u201d \u201cI think more people are playing the game. I think people would rather play the game than sit and watch us play,\u201d Rory McIlroy said, explaining why he thinks TV ratings are down for the PGA Tour. \u201cRounds of golf are up. Golf is thriving. I think there\u2019s never been a bigger disconnect between recreational and professional golf, and that\u2019s a big part of the reason.\u201d The women are playing on the Bay Course at the renowned Seaview Resort outside of Atlantic City, New Jersey, for the Shoprite LPGA Classic. After the second round, Jenny Shin leads the pack at 10-under. However, the day's news was that six-time LPGA winner Nasa Hataoka had been disqualified. She took too long to find her ball and did not follow the rules correctly. Even Jenny Shin used social media to express her distaste for the ruling. Ernie Els fired off an 8-under 64 to shoot up 21 spots to sit at 9-under and tied for the lead alongside Steve Stricker, who signed for a 6-under 66. David Duval is in solo third at 7-under. Jerry Kelly and Tim O\u2019Neal are at 6-under. Stricker is eying his first Champions Tour victory of the season after such a tremendous 2023. LIV Houston saw a few players pulled out of the tournament on Saturday at The Golf Club of Houston. Jon Rahm and Louis Oosthuizen withdrew because of injuries. Day two saw some movement on both the individual and team leaderboards. Sergio Garcia\u2019s Fireballs GC sits at 26-under for the teams to lead the Torque GC by four shots. Bryson DeChambeau\u2019s Crusher GC, the Cleeks and the 4Aces are tied in third at 21-under. Brooks Koepka\u2019s Smash and Cam Smith\u2019s Ripper GC are next on the leaderboard at 17-under. On the individual side, Paul Casey, Carlos Ortiz, Adrian Meronk and David Puig all sit at 10-under to lead the pack heading into the final day of play.

Gopalakrishna discovered in 1984 that water spontaneously appeared before a shrine to the god when he walked around the perimeter of the temple's sanctum 11 times.\n\nWord spread and people began visiting the temple to offer wishes for happy marriages, children, or successfully navigating the cut-throat admissions process to India's top colleges.\n\n- 'Blind belief' -\n\nOver the decades, devotees came to believe the shrine was particularly effective helping Indians seeking to leave the country -- so much so that it came to be locally known as the \"visa temple\".\n\nPilgrims emulate Gopalakrishna's 11 laps around the temple sanctum, returning later if their wishes are filled to circumnavigate it a further 108 times as an expression of gratitude.\n\nThe ritual demands precision.

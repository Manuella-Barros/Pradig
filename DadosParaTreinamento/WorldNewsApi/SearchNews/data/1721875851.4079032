ACCI\u2019s President, Emeka Obegolu (SAN), said the situation is also affecting small-scale businesses adversely, adding that basic meals are becoming unaffordable to most citizens nationwide. \u201cThe Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry expresses deep concern over the persistent rise in commodity prices, which is adversely affecting small-scale business owners and escalating poverty levels in the country. \u201cThe surge in prices of essential food items such as rice, beans, cassava flour, tomatoes, pepper, onions, and others has aggravated the plight of the average citizen, rendering basic meals increasingly unaffordable for many households,\u201d Obegolu said in a statement issued in Abuja. The chamber\u2019s president said official records from the National Bureau of Statistics indicate a staggering 35.41 per cent food inflation rate in May 2024. \u201cHowever, on-ground observations suggest that the true food inflation rate exceeds 50 per cent, highlighting the severity of the situation and its dire impact on livelihoods. \u201cExperts attribute this economic hardship to the drastic depreciation of the national currency, the naira, which has significantly eroded citizens\u2019 purchasing power. The resulting exchange rate volatility has disrupted businesses, increased production costs, and thwarted projections for economic growth,\u201d Obegolu added. The chamber stated that the Chief Executive Officer of Araba Technology, Segun Olugbile, had urged the ACCI to initiate business actions against the food crisis and hunger in the Federal Capital Territory. Olugbile, according to ACCI, said the food crisis is becoming a serious issue due to multifaceted challenges affecting farmers, herders, climate change, and the current high inflation. He said the ACCI stands at a critical juncture as the Federal Capital Territory faces an escalating food crisis and hunger emergency due to challenges impacting food production and supply chains. With an estimated 24.7 million individuals affected by food and nutrition insecurity across 26 states, including the FCT, urgent action is imperative, the expert explained. Olugbile emphasised the pivotal role that ACCI could play in collaboration with government and stakeholders to avert a worsening crisis and bolster food security in the region. Reacting to this, Obegolu said ACCI provides support services in the area of training and advocacy to help local businesses navigate challenges and seize opportunities in the food sector to impact its members. The NBS in one of its reports in 2023, stated that Nigeria already had 133 million people living in multidimensional poverty before the recent economic challenges. However, there are growing concerns that this number has swelled over the past eight months. In the past, staple foods like cassava flour (garri) and beans served as affordable options for the common man. However, the current scenario paints a starkly different picture, with prices skyrocketing beyond the reach of the average citizen. Obegolu emphasised the urgent need for government intervention to address the escalating food crisis warning that failure to act promptly could lead to a state of malnutrition and further aggravate the nation\u2019s socio-economic challenges. \u201cFood is a fundamental necessity of life, and its affordability directly impacts the well-being of citizens. The escalating food inflation crisis poses a severe threat to food security and exacerbates poverty levels. The government must take decisive action to mitigate this crisis and alleviate the suffering of the populace,\u201d he noted.", "summary": "<p>The persistent hike in food prices is currently worsening poverty levels across the country, the Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry declared on Saturday.

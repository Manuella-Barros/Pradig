The Charlotte Hornets have named Charles Lee as their next head coach. The 39-year-old Lee joins the Hornets after serving as the Boston Celtics top assistant coach. Lee will complete the Celtics' playoff run before joining the Hornets on a full-time basis.\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The Charlotte Hornets named Charles Lee as their head coach on Thursday, hoping he'll turn around the long-struggling NBA franchise.\n\nThe 39-year-old Lee joins the Hornets after serving as the Boston Celtics top assistant coach. Lee will complete the Celtics' playoff run before joining the Hornets on a full-time basis. Lee spent five seasons under Mike Budenholzer before joining the Celtics last summer.\n\nLee received a four-year deal from the Hornets, according to a person familiar with the situation.\n\nThe person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because terms of the deal were not made public.\n\nLee replaces Steve Clifford, who announced before the end of the regular season that he was stepping down as Hornets coach after two seasons in his second stint with the club. The Hornets finished 21-61 this season, tied with the Portland Trail Blazers for the league's third-worst record.\n\n\"The Hornets have a talented young core of players and I'm excited about our future and what we can build here,\" Lee said. \"There are few places as passionate about basketball as the Carolinas, and I look forward to coming to Charlotte and getting to work.\"\n\nLee is well respected in NBA circles as a potential rising star in the coaching ranks.\n\nHe led the Milwaukee Bucks to the 2020-21 NBA championship as an associate head coach. Throughout his 10 NBA seasons, Lee's teams have accumulated a 510-291 (.637) regular-season record, reached the playoffs nine times, captured seven division titles and earned five Eastern Conference No. 1 seeds.\n\nIn four of the last six seasons, Lee has helped coach teams that have finished the regular season with the best record in the NBA.\n\nThis season the Celtics finished the regular season with the NBA's top record (64-18), marking the fourth-most wins in a season in franchise history. The Celtics led the NBA in offensive rating and net rating while finishing third in defensive rating.\n\nIn Charlotte, Lee will inherit a team that hasn't been to the playoffs in the last eight seasons, the longest drought in the league. Charlotte hasn't won a playoff series in 22 years, a stretch that included more than a decade with NBA great Michael Jordan as the owner.\n\nJordan sold the Hornets to Rick Schnall and Gabe Plotkin last year. The co-owners have been busy since, replacing general manager Mitch Kupchak -- who also stepped down -- with Jeff Peterson.\n\nLee will work alongside Peterson to oversee a rebuild.\n\n\"His high character and his ability to connect with players while also instilling a culture of accountability will serve us well as we construct a competitive team built for long-term success,\" Peterson said in a release. \"Charles possesses a championship pedigree with a wide range of basketball knowledge and NBA experience, has a tremendous work ethic and is a great communicator. He shares our vision for this organization, and I look forward to partnering with him in building something special here in the Carolinas.\"\n\nThe Hornets traded Gordon Hayward to Oklahoma City, Terry Rozier to Miami and P.J. Washington to Dallas before the deadline in moves that brought Tre Mann, Vasa Micic, Grant Williams, Seth Curry and Davis Bertans to Charlotte.\n\nThe Hornets have some young talent to build around, including last year's No. 2 overall pick Brandon Miller, 2022 All-Star point guard LaMelo Ball and center Mark Williams, although the latter two have struggled to stay on the court because of injuries. Miller averaged 17.3 points per game as a rookie while shooting 37% from 3-point range.\n\nLee got his start in coaching at his alma mater, Bucknell University, where he was an assistant for two seasons (2012-14). During his time as a player, he led the Bison to two Patriot League titles and the only two NCAA Tournament victories in school history, including a win over No. 3 Kansas as a No. 14 seed in 2005. He was inducted into the Bucknell Athletics Hall of Fame in 2017. He went on to play four professional seasons overseas in Israel, Belgium and Germany.\n\nThe Hornets said Lee will be introduced at a news conference after the Celtics playoff run.\n\nAP NBA:

(AP) -- The Charlotte Hornets named Charles Lee as their head coach on Thursday, hoping he'll turn around the long-struggling NBA franchise.\n\nThe 39-year-old Lee joins the Hornets after serving as the Boston Celtics top assistant coach. Lee will complete the Celtics' playoff run before joining the Hornets on a full-time basis. Lee spent five seasons under Mike Budenholzer before joining the Celtics last summer.\n\nLee received a four-year deal from the Hornets, according to a person familiar with the situation.\n\nThe person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because terms of the deal were not made public.\n\nLee replaces Steve Clifford, who announced before the end of the regular season that he was stepping down as Hornets coach after two seasons in his second stint with the club. The Hornets finished 21-61 this season, tied with the Portland Trail Blazers for the league's third-worst record.\n\n\"The Hornets have a talented young core of players and I'm excited about our future and what we can build here,\" Lee said. \"There are few places as passionate about basketball as the Carolinas, and I look forward to coming to Charlotte and getting to work.\"\n\nLee is well respected in NBA circles as a potential rising star in the coaching ranks.\n\nHe led the Milwaukee Bucks to the 2020-21 NBA championship as an associate head coach. Throughout his 10 NBA seasons, Lee's teams have accumulated a 510-291 (.637) regular-season record, reached the playoffs nine times, captured seven division titles and earned five Eastern Conference No. 1 seeds.\n\nIn four of the last six seasons, Lee has helped coach teams that have finished the regular season with the best record in the NBA.\n\nThis season the Celtics finished the regular season with the NBA's top record (64-18), marking the fourth-most wins in a season in franchise history. The Celtics led the NBA in offensive rating and net rating while finishing third in defensive rating.\n\nIn Charlotte, Lee will inherit a team that hasn't been to the playoffs in the last eight seasons, the longest drought in the league. Charlotte hasn't won a playoff series in 22 years, a stretch that included more than a decade with NBA great Michael Jordan as the owner.\n\nJordan sold the Hornets to Rick Schnall and Gabe Plotkin last year. The co-owners have been busy since, replacing general manager Mitch Kupchak -- who also stepped down -- with Jeff Peterson.\n\nLee will work alongside Peterson to oversee a rebuild.\n\n\"His high character and his ability to connect with players while also instilling a culture of accountability will serve us well as we construct a competitive team built for long-term success,\" Peterson said in a release. \"Charles possesses a championship pedigree with a wide range of basketball knowledge and NBA experience, has a tremendous work ethic and is a great communicator. He shares our vision for this organization, and I look forward to partnering with him in building something special here in the Carolinas.\"\n\nThe Hornets traded Gordon Hayward to Oklahoma City, Terry Rozier to Miami and P.J. Washington to Dallas before the deadline in moves that brought Tre Mann, Vasa Micic, Grant Williams, Seth Curry and Davis Bertans to Charlotte.\n\nThe Hornets have some young talent to build around, including last year's No. 2 overall pick Brandon Miller, 2022 All-Star point guard LaMelo Ball and center Mark Williams, although the latter two have struggled to stay on the court because of injuries. Miller averaged 17.3 points per game as a rookie while shooting 37% from 3-point range.\n\nLee got his start in coaching at his alma mater, Bucknell University, where he was an assistant for two seasons (2012-14). During his time as a player, he led the Bison to two Patriot League titles and the only two NCAA Tournament victories in school history, including a win over No. 3 Kansas as a No. 14 seed in 2005. He was inducted into the Bucknell Athletics Hall of Fame in 2017. He went on to play four professional seasons overseas in Israel, Belgium and Germany.\n\nThe Hornets said Lee will be introduced at a news conference after the Celtics playoff run.\n\nAP NBA:

Lee will complete the Celtics' playoff run before joining the Hornets on a full-time basis. Lee spent five seasons under Mike Budenholzer before joining the Celtics last summer.\n\nLee received a four-year deal from the Hornets, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because terms of the deal were not made public.\n\nLee replaces Steve Clifford, who announced before the end of the regular season that he was stepping down as Hornets coach after two seasons in his second stint with the club. The Hornets finished 21-61 this season, tied with the Portland Trail Blazers for the league's third-worst record.\n\n\"The Hornets have a talented young core of players and I'm excited about our future and what we can build here,\" Lee said. \"There are few places as passionate about basketball as the Carolinas, and I look forward to coming to Charlotte and getting to work.\"\n\nLee is well respected in NBA circles as a potential rising star in the coaching ranks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe led the Milwaukee Bucks to the 2020-21 NBA championship as an associate head coach. Throughout his 10 NBA seasons, Lee's teams have accumulated a 510-291 (.637) regular-season record, reached the playoffs nine times, captured seven division titles and earned five Eastern Conference No. 1 seeds.\n\nIn four of the last six seasons, Lee has helped coach teams that have finished the regular season with the best record in the NBA.\n\nThis season the Celtics finished the regular season with the NBA's top record (64-18), marking the fourth-most wins in a season in franchise history. The Celtics led the NBA in offensive rating and net rating while finishing third in defensive rating.\n\nIn Charlotte, Lee will inherit a team that hasn't been to the playoffs in the last eight seasons, the longest drought in the league. Charlotte hasn't won a playoff series in 22 years, a stretch that included more than a decade with NBA great Michael Jordan as the owner.\n\nJordan sold the Hornets to Rick Schnall and Gabe Plotkin last year. The co-owners have been busy since, replacing general manager Mitch Kupchak - who also stepped down - with Jeff Peterson.\n\nLee will work alongside Peterson to oversee a rebuild.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"His high character and his ability to connect with players while also instilling a culture of accountability will serve us well as we construct a competitive team built for long-term success,\" Peterson said in a release. \"Charles possesses a championship pedigree with a wide range of basketball knowledge and NBA experience, has a tremendous work ethic and is a great communicator. He shares our vision for this organization, and I look forward to partnering with him in building something special here in the Carolinas.\"\n\nThe Hornets traded Gordon Hayward to Oklahoma City, Terry Rozier to Miami and P.J. Washington to Dallas before the deadline in moves that brought Tre Mann, Vasa Micic, Grant Williams, Seth Curry and Davis Bertans to Charlotte.\n\nThe Hornets have some young talent to build around, including last year's No. 2 overall pick Brandon Miller, 2022 All-Star point guard LaMelo Ball and center Mark Williams, although the latter two have struggled to stay on the court because of injuries. Miller averaged 17.3 points per game as a rookie while shooting 37% from 3-point range.\n\nLee got his start in coaching at his alma mater, Bucknell University, where he was an assistant for two seasons (2012-14). During his time as a player, he led the Bison to two Patriot League titles and the only two NCAA Tournament victories in school history, including a win over No. 3 Kansas as a No. 14 seed in 2005. He was inducted into the Bucknell Athletics Hall of Fame in 2017. He went on to play four professional seasons overseas in Israel, Belgium and Germany.\n\nThe Hornets said Lee will be introduced at a news conference after the Celtics playoff run.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

Boston, a favorite to represent the Eastern Conference in the NBA Finals next month, is currently matched up with Cleveland in the semifinals.\n\n\"The opportunity to be the head coach of the Charlotte Hornets is a dream come true,\" Lee said in a statement. \"I want to thank Rick Schnall, Gabe Plotkin and Jeff Peterson for the trust they are placing in me to lead this team.\n\n\"The Hornets have a talented young core of players and I'm excited about our future and what we can build here. There are few places as passionate about basketball as the Carolinas, and I look forward to coming to Charlotte and getting to work.\"\n\nLee, 39, has slowly risen up the coaching ranks, and being a part of multiple staffs makes him knowledgeable about the ins and outs of compiling a roster of coaches, which is going to be key as he formulates his with the Hornets. He also understands what it takes to develop talent and that's a necessary ingredient for the head coach of a continuously lottery-bound franchise.\n\nPrior to joining the Celtics this past season, Lee spent five seasons as an assistant coach for Milwaukee. He was an integral part of the Bucks winning the NBA title in 2020-21, serving as Mike Budenholzer's right hand man.\n\nLee's NBA career as an assistant coach started in Atlanta, where he was on the Hawks' staff for four seasons. It's where he initially met Peterson, the Hornets' vice president of basketball operations. That familiarity put Lee in the driver's seat for the Hornets' gig, and now the two thirtysomethings are reunited in Charlotte trying to dig the franchise out of its losing rut.\n\nLee beat out JJ Redick, among others, for the job. And he'll be tasked with getting the Hornets back to respectability and helping the franchise snap the league's longest playoff drought.\n\n\"We are excited to welcome Charles Lee as the head coach of Charlotte Hornets,\" Peterson said in a statement. \"His high character and his ability to connect with players while also instilling a culture of accountability will serve us well as we construct a competitive team built for long-term success.\n\n\"Charles possesses a championship pedigree with a wide range of basketball knowledge and NBA experience, has a tremendous work ethic and is a great communicator. He shares our vision for this organization, and I look forward to partnering with him in building something special here in the Carolinas. I can't wait for our Hornets community to meet Charles, his wife Lindsey and his beautiful daughters, and feel Charles' passion for the game and the intensity of his desire to win.\"", "source": {"uri": "thestate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The State"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Hornets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Schnall", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rick Schnall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.charlotteobserver.com/latest-news/4ia5eb/picture287351310/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Charles%20Lee.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553256", "eventUri": "eng-9553256", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

Clifford led the Hornets to a 27-55 mark in 2022-23. The Hornets went 138-163 in four seasons under former coach James Borrego, who was fired in 2022.\n\nNBA legend Michael Jordan sold his majority ownership stake in the Hornets in August.

Lee also served as an assistant for the Milwaukee Bucks from 2018 to 2023, before joining the Celtics staff last off-season.\n\nLee was on the Bucks' staff when they won a franchise-record 60 games in 2018-19 and for their 2020-21 NBA Finals winning campaign.

He averaged career-highs in points (21) and rebounds (7.3), while also dishing out 3.3 assists per game over 69 appearances.\n\nForward Brandon Miller, who joined the Hornets as the No. 2 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft, also was a key contributor.

This sent the Hornets front office into a deep dive, searching for their next head coach who could take a young roster brimming with potential and shape them into a contender.\n\nNow, just weeks after their coaching search officially tipped off, the Hornets have made their hire.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the Charlotte Hornets have hired top Boston Celtics assistant Charles Lee to be their next head coach. Lee has agreed to a four-year deal.\n\nInterestingly, Lee, 39, re-joins executive president of basketball operations Jeff Peterson, who worked with Lee in Atlanta.\n\nBut the two went their separate ways as they ascended in their basketball careers elsewhere. Now, they're both at the head of the proverbial snake, this time in Charlotte.\n\nWhile Lee's Celtics are still going strong in their chase to win the franchise's 18th NBA Championship, he won't begin his duties with the Hornets until Boston's season is finished.\n\nLee originally joined the Celtics last summer, where he became Joe Mazzulla's top assistant after spending five years in the same role under Milwaukee's Mike Budenholzer, including their 2021 NBA Finals win.\n\nBeginning his career at Bucknell in 2012, Lee has since worked in Atlanta and Milwaukee, where he developed a reputation for being a rising star in the coaching industry.

He shares our vision for this organization, and I look forward to partnering with him in building something special here in the Carolinas.\"\n\nThe Hornets traded Gordon Hayward to Oklahoma City, Terry Rozier to Miami and P.J. Washington to Dallas before the deadline in moves that brought Tre Mann, Vasa Micic, Grant Williams, Seth Curry and Davis Bertans to Charlotte.\n\nThe Hornets have some young talent to build around, including last year's No. 2 overall pick Brandon Miller, 2022 All-Star point guard LaMelo Ball and center Mark Williams, although the latter two have struggled to stay on the court because of injuries. Miller averaged 17.3 points per game as a rookie while shooting 37% from 3-point range.\n\nLee got his start in coaching at his alma mater, Bucknell University, where he was an assistant for two seasons (2012-14). During his time as a player, he led the Bison to two Patriot League titles and the only two NCAA Tournament victories in school history, including a win over No. 3 Kansas as a No. 14 seed in 2005. He was inducted into the Bucknell Athletics Hall of Fame in 2017. He went on to play four professional seasons overseas in Israel, Belgium and Germany.\n\nThe Hornets said Lee will be introduced at a news conference after the Celtics playoff run.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

I can't wait for our Hornets community to meet Charles, his wife Lindsey and his beautiful daughters, and feel Charles' passion for the game and the intensity of his desire to win.\"\n\nPrior to his time in Boston, Lee served five seasons (2018-2023) as an assistant coach for the Milwaukee Bucks, ascending to associate head coach and helping guide the team to the 2020-21 NBA championship. He started his NBA career as an assistant coach for four seasons (2014-2018) with the Atlanta Hawks. Throughout his 10 NBA seasons, Lee's teams have accumulated a 510-291 (.637) regular-season record, reached the playoffs nine times, captured seven division titles and earned five Eastern Conference No. 1 seeds. In four of the last six seasons, his teams have finished the regular season with the best record in the NBA.\n\n\"The opportunity to be the head coach of the Charlotte Hornets is a dream come true,\" said Lee. \"I want to thank Rick Schnall, Gabe Plotkin and Jeff Peterson for the trust they are placing in me to lead this team. The Hornets have a talented young core of players and I'm excited about our future and what we can build here. There are few places as passionate about basketball as the Carolinas, and I look forward to coming to Charlotte and getting to work.\"", "source": {"uri": "insidehoops.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InsideHoops.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Hornets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Schnall", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Schnall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553256", "eventUri": "eng-9553256", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Was it the right choice?", "body": "The Charlotte Hornets did the safe thing Thursday when they hired Boston Celtics assistant Charles Lee to be their new head coach.\n\nFrom the day that Steve Clifford stepped down and ended his second run as the Hornets' head, Lee has been thought to be the front-runner. He's got just about all the right qualifications: He had an exemplary career as an NBA assistant, helping to direct teams that won a championship in Milwaukee and may win another this year in Boston. He's young (39), a former star college player at Bucknell and, perhaps most importantly, had a deep connection already with new Hornets co-owner Rick Schnall, dating back to their days with the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nAnd that's the way the Hornets went, eschewing more out-of-the-box choices like former Duke star JJ Redick or G League head coach Lindsey Harding. They instead went for one of the most traditional paths of hiring a new coach in both the NBA and the NFL: Find a hot young assistant coach who's not yet been a head coach but who's already in the league and grab him. The Carolina Panthers did exactly the same thing in January, hiring Tampa Bay offensive coordinator Dave Canales (who's four years older than Lee, at 43).\n\nIn a hot-take world, everyone wants a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer to that. The real answer is \"maybe,\" depending on if LaMelo Ball ever plays a full season again, and if Brandon Miller becomes the all-star he could be, and if Mark Williams solves his back issues and on and on and on.\n\nBut if I had to pick one today, I'd say yes, it was the right choice. For all the headlines a hire like Redick or Harding would grab, if I'm co-owners Schnall and Gabe Plotkin and I've invested so much into this franchise Michael Jordan never could turn around before selling it, I'd go with the guy I knew really well and had seen do a good coaching job firsthand already.\n\nThere's so much uncertainty already around the Hornets. Redick -- who might end up as the L.A. Lakers' next head guy -- could be Steve Kerr as a head coach, but he also could be Magic Johnson as a head coach. There's just not a track record there.\n\nHarding would have been interesting, and certainly she could have done the job as she's the reigning G League Coach of the Year. But if the Hornets were going to hire a female coach, they should have broken the bank and hired Dawn Staley away from South Carolina -- one of the best coaches working today, regardless of gender.\n\nStaley, as I've written before, was my top choice. But if not her, Lee seems like a person who can get it done and certainly one who knows what a winning team looks like.\n\nLee wasn't available for interviews Thursday when the Hornets announced the news, and the team said he wouldn't be until the Celtics' playoff run concluded. That could be more than a month from now. If the Celtics win the Eastern Conference, the NBA Finals begin June 6 and could end as late as June 23 if there's a Game 7.\n\nSo Lee's inaugural press conference won't be for a while, and he'll get a late start on the draft-day and free-agent part of the Charlotte offseason. But as long as Lee doesn't pull a Kenny Atkinson here, none of that is a deal-breaker.\n\nAll we got directly from Lee on Thursday was one mundane quote in a statement by the Hornets, which read: \"The opportunity to be the head coach of the Charlotte Hornets is a dream come true. I want to thank Rick Schnall, Gabe Plotkin and Jeff Peterson for the trust they are placing in me to lead this team. The Hornets have a talented young core of players and I'm excited about our future and what we can build here. There are few places as passionate about basketball as the Carolinas, and I look forward to coming to Charlotte and getting to work.\"\n\nWith Lee and new Hornets basketball decision-maker Peterson, also in his 30s, the Hornets now have a young front-office nucleus to match the young team in front of them. And that youthful energy is going to be needed as Charlotte, which went 21-61 last season, tries to break the NBA's longest playoff drought (they haven't made it since 2016).\n\nLee is used to working into May and June every season, because he's been involved in the NBA postseason nine times in his 10 years as an NBA assistant.\n\nThe Hornets? They check out in mid-April every season and by this time of year, their last game seems more like a year ago than a month ago.", "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com", "dataType": "news",

Clifford led the Hornets to a 27-55 mark in 2022-23. The Hornets went 138-163 in four seasons under former coach James Borrego, who was fired in 2022.\n\nNBA legend Michael Jordan sold his majority ownership stake in the Hornets in August. The team has just three playoff appearances over the last 20 years and hasn't advanced past the first round since 2001-02.\n\nLee, 39, started his coaching career in 2012 as an assistant at Bucknell. He joined the NBA ranks in 2014, working as an assistant for the Atlanta Hawks. Lee also served as an assistant for the Milwaukee Bucks from 2018 to 2023, before joining the Celtics staff last off-season.\n\nLee was on the Bucks' staff when they won a franchise-record 60 games in 2018-19 and for their 2020-21 NBA Finals winning campaign. The Bucks led the NBA in points per game during both of those runs.\n\nThe Celtics won a league-high 64 games while scoring the second-most and allowing the fifth-fewest points per game during the 2023-24 regular season.\n\nThe 2023-24 Hornets scored the third-fewest points per game (106.6) and allowed the ninth-most points (116.8) per game this season.\n\nPoint guard LaMelo Ball, the No. 3 pick in the 2020 NBA Draft, led the Hornets with 23.9 points per game this season, but missed the majority of the campaign because of an ankle injury.\n\nThe Hornets traded guard Terry Rozier, their second-leading scorer, to the Miami Heat in January.\n\nVeteran forward Miles Bridges, who missed the entire 2022-23 campaign because of legal issues and the early part of 2023-24 because of a suspension, turned in the best season of his career. He averaged career-highs in points (21) and rebounds (7.3), while also dishing out 3.3 assists per game over 69 appearances.\n\nForward Brandon Miller, who joined the Hornets as the No. 2 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft, also was a key contributor. He averaged 17.3 points, 4.3 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game during his rookie campaign.\n\n\"The Hornets have a talented young core of players and I'm excited about our future and what we can build here,\" Lee said. \"There are few places as passionate about basketball as the Carolinas, and I look forward to coming to Charlotte and getting to work.\"\n\nBall is set to receive a $35.5 million salary next season and is under contract through 2028-29. Forward Grant Williams and guard Seth Curry, who joined the Hornets in a February trade, are among the other players who remain under contract with the Hornets through next season.\n\nBridges is set to hit free agency.\n\n\"We are excited to welcome Charles Lee as the head coach of Charlotte Hornets,\" Hornets executive vice president of basketball operations Jeff Peterson said.\n\n\"His high character and his ability to connect with players while also instilling a culture of accountability will serve us well as we construct a competitive team built for long-term success.\n\n\"Charles possesses a championship pedigree with a wide range of basketball knowledge and NBA experience, has a tremendous work ethic and is a great communicator. He shares our vision for this organization, and I look forward to partnering with him in building something special here in the Carolinas.\"", "source": {"uri": "upi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Borrego", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Borrego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Clifford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Clifford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Hornets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaMelo_Ball", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LaMelo Ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Bridges", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miles Bridges"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Rozier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terry Rozier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Williams_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grant Williams (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seth Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/1141715260084/2024/upi_com/97bc2b5d476d310742f914664a21ef90/v2.1/Charlotte-Hornets-hire-Boston-Celtics-top-assistant-Charles-Lee-as-new-coach.jpg?lg=4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553256", "eventUri": "eng-9553256", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

After a cup of coffee with the Spurs summer league team and pre-season in 2006, Lee carved out a multi-year playing career in overseas. Lee's playing career took him from Israel to Belgium, before finishing up in the German league in 2010.\n\nIn 2012 at the age of 28, Lee returned to his Alma Mater as a college assistant coach at Bucknell. That was until Atlanta Hawks Head Coach Mike Budenholzer noticed his talents and added him to his staff in 2014. Lee followed Budenholzer to Milwaukee, becoming the Associate Head Coach in 2022 after Darvin Ham took the LA Lakers head coach position. Every summer when the NBA coaching carousel started, Lee's name was floating around as a hot candidate. He finished runner up to Willie Green in New Orleans and Wes Unseld in Washington, as well as being interviewed by the Hornets before they hired James Borrego.\n\nAfter the 2023 season, Lee moved left Milwaukee after the Bucks parted ways with mentor Mike Budenholzer. Lee remained a strong candidate on the head coaching market, receiving consideration from Phoenix, Detroit and Toronto in the 2023 off-season. Ultimately, Lee had to settle for another assistant role, but landed one of the top jobs on the market bolstering Joe Mazzulla's staff as the Associate Head Coach for the Boston Celtics.\n\nCharles Lee has strong links with Hornets VP of Basketball Operations Jeff Peterson from the time they overlapped in Atlanta. Between 2014-18, both Peterson and Lee were experiencing their first roles in the NBA and reportedly established a good relationship and have remained in touch. Lee also overlapped with current co-owner Rick Schnall who was a minority owner with the Atlanta Hawks at the time.\n\nWherever Charles Lee has coached, the team has found success. In his 10 seasons as an assistant he has amassed an impressive 508-289 record (64% winning percentage). Lee has been part of well-rounded teams, with both the Hawks, Bucks and Celtics achieving a top 10 offense and defense multiple times in his coaching career. He coaches both ends of the floor and has avoided being labelled as a defensive or offensive specialist.\n\nAs a former point guard, he has focused on working with perimeter players in his role as an assistant. He could provide valuable mentorship for LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller who could make up Charlotte's starting back-court next season.\n\nAt just 38 years of age, Lee is young enough to relate to NBA players but with already a decade of coaching in the league in three different franchises has a wealth of experience to draw on. He appears to be in the \"Sweetspot\" to successfully manage relationships with modern day NBA players while also having the experience and character to hold them too account.\n\nSome may argue Lee has benefitted from great situations in his coaching journey so far. How would he fair working with an NBA bottom dweller like the Charlotte Hornets? Coaching a team with multiple all-stars and playoff expectations is a different type of challenge from coaching a young rebuilding team.\n\nNo matter the amount of experience, going from an assistant to head coach is a challenging jump. It's a different challenge being the leading voice, carrying the weight of the fans, players and dealing with the media on a daily basis. Look at former Bucks assistant coach Adrian Griffin, he didn't last his first full season despite 16 years' experience as an assistant and a winning record. There is always a risk when appointing someone with no previous head coaching experience for the first time.\n\nWhy has Lee not been appointed elsewhere already? His reputation has managed to get him a lot of interviews, but he has failed to convince decision makers so far he's the right man for the job. His youth is the most likely answer, There are only three head coaches in the NBA right now that are younger than Lee, two years ago there weren't any. The good news, some of the best coaches currently in the NBA such as Utah's Will Hardy (34), Boston's Joe Mazzulla (34) and Oklahoma's Mark Daigneault (37) are all on the younger side.\n\nOverall, Lee has as strong a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as you can have without having previous NBA head coach experience. Not only does his strong track record speak volumes of his impact, but his prior relationship with ownership and the Hornets front office make him a sensible appointment.", "source": {"uri": "si.com",

(AP) -- The Charlotte Hornets have named Charles Lee as their next head coach.\n\nThe 39-year-old Lee joins the Hornets after serving as the Boston Celtics top assistant coach. Lee will complete the Celtics' playoff run before joining the Hornets on a full-time basis. Lee spent five seasons under Mike Budenholzer before joining the Celtics last summer.\n\nLee replaces Steve Clifford, who announced before the end of the regular season that he was stepping down as Hornets coach after two seasons in his second stint with the club. The Hornets finished 21-61 this season, tied with the Portland Trail Blazers for the league's third-worst record.\n\n\"The Hornets have a talented young core of players and I'm excited about our future and what we can build here,\" Lee said. \"There are few places as passionate about basketball as the Carolinas, and I look forward to coming to Charlotte and getting to work.\"\n\nLee inherits a team that hasn't been to the playoffs in the last eight seasons, the longest drought in the league. Charlotte hasn't won a playoff series in 22 years, a stretch that included more than a decade with NBA great Michael Jordan as the owner.\n\nJordan sold the Hornets to Rick Schnall and Gabe Plotkin last year.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe co-owners have been busy since, replacing general manager Mitch Kupchak -- who also stepped down -- with Jeff Peterson.\n\nLee will work alongside Peterson to oversee a rebuild.\n\n\"His high character and his ability to connect with players while also instilling a culture of accountability will serve us well as we construct a competitive team built for long-term success,\" Peterson said in a release. \"Charles possesses a championship pedigree with a wide range of basketball knowledge and NBA experience, has a tremendous work ethic and is a great communicator. He shares our vision for this organization, and I look forward to partnering with him in building something special here in the Carolinas.\"\n\nThe Hornets traded Gordon Hayward to Oklahoma City, Terry Rozier to Miami and P.J. Washington to Dallas before the deadline in moves that brought Tre Mann, Vasa Micic, Grant Williams, Seth Curry and Davis Bertans to Charlotte.\n\nThe Hornets have some young talent to build around, including last year's No. 2 overall pick Brandon Miller, 2022 All-Star point guard LaMelo Ball and center Mark Williams, although the latter two have struggled to stay on the court because of injuries. Miller averaged 17.3 points per game as a rookie while shooting 37% from 3-point range.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Before that, he was an assistant with the Milwaukee Bucks (2018-23) and Atlanta Hawks (2014-18), serving with former Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer in both Milwaukee and Atlanta. He has no previous experience leading his own team.\n\nHornets' outlook: Charlotte was looking for a new coach since early April when Steve Clifford announced this would be his final season at the helm with the team. He left the Hornets as the winningest coach in franchise history, coaching a team-record 577 games and amassing 244 wins. He expects to remain with the franchise as an advisor as the team looks to improve upon its recent difficulties.\n\nThe Hornets were 21-61 in 2023-24 and were 27-55 the season before that and have not finished above .500 since the 2015-16 season (which was also Charlotte's last playoff appearance). The Hornets were without star guard LaMelo Ball for most of last season as ankle issues limited him to 22 games.

After a cup of coffee with the Spurs summer league team and pre-season in 2006, Lee carved out a multi-year playing career in overseas. Lee's playing career took him from Israel to Belgium, before finishing up in the German league in 2010.\n\nIn 2012 at the age of 28, Lee returned to his Alma Mater as a college assistant coach at Bucknell. That was until Atlanta Hawks Head Coach Mike Budenholzer noticed his talents and added him to his staff in 2014. Lee followed Budenholzer to Milwaukee, becoming the Associate Head Coach in 2022 after Darvin Ham took the LA Lakers head coach position. Every summer when the NBA coaching carousel started, Lee's name was floating around as a hot candidate. He finished runner up to Willie Green in New Orleans and Wes Unseld in Washington, as well as being interviewed by the Hornets before they hired James Borrego.\n\nAfter the 2023 season, Lee moved left Milwaukee after the Bucks parted ways with mentor Mike Budenholzer. Lee remained a strong candidate on the head coaching market, receiving consideration from Phoenix, Detroit and Toronto in the 2023 off-season. Ultimately, Lee had to settle for another assistant role, but landed one of the top jobs on the market bolstering Joe Mazzulla's staff as the Associate Head Coach for the Boston Celtics.\n\nCharles Lee has strong links with Hornets VP of Basketball Operations Jeff Peterson from the time they overlapped in Atlanta. Between 2014-18, both Peterson and Lee were experiencing their first roles in the NBA and reportedly established a good relationship and have remained in touch. Lee also overlapped with current co-owner Rick Schnall who was a minority owner with the Atlanta Hawks at the time. The nature of that relationship is unclear, but if it wasn't in a good place you wouldn't expect Lee to be drawing interest from the Hornets for their coaching vacancy.\n\nWherever Charles Lee has coached, the team has found success. In his 10 seasons as an assistant he has amassed an impressive 508-289 record (64% winning percentage). Lee has been part of well-rounded teams, with both the Hawks, Bucks and Celtics achieving a top 10 offense and defense multiple times in his coaching career. He coaches both ends of the floor and has avoided being labelled as a defensive or offensive specialist.\n\nAs a former point guard, he has focused on working with perimeter players in his role as an assistant. He could provide valuable mentorship for LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller who could make up Charlotte's starting back-court next season.\n\nAt just 38 years of age, Lee is young enough to relate to NBA players but with already a decade of coaching in the league in three different franchises has a wealth of experience to draw on. He appears to be in the \"Sweetspot\" to successfully manage relationships with modern day NBA players while also having the experience and character to hold them too account.\n\nSome may argue Lee has benefitted from great situations in his coaching journey so far. How would he fair working with an NBA bottom dweller like the Charlotte Hornets? Coaching a team with multiple all-stars and playoff expectations is a different type of challenge from coaching a young rebuilding team.\n\nNo matter the amount of experience, going from an assistant to head coach is a challenging jump. It's a different challenge being the leading voice, carrying the weight of the fans, players and dealing with the media on a daily basis. Look at former Bucks assistant coach Adrian Griffin, he didn't last his first full season despite 16 years' experience as an assistant and a winning record. There is always a risk when appointing someone with no previous head coaching experience for the first time.\n\nWhy has Lee not been appointed elsewhere already? His reputation has managed to get him a lot of interviews, but he has failed to convince decision makers so far he's the right man for the job. His youth is the most likely answer, There are only three head coaches in the NBA right now that are younger than Lee, two years ago there weren't any. The good news, some of the best coaches currently in the NBA such as Utah's Will Hardy (34), Boston's Joe Mazzulla (34) and Oklahoma's Mark Daigneault (37) are all on the younger side.\n\nOverall, Lee has as strong a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as you can have without having previous NBA head coach experience. Not only does his strong track record speak volumes of his impact, but his prior relationship with ownership and the Hornets front office make him a very strong candidate for the Hornets Head Coaching vacancy.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Budenholzer", "type": "person",

Lee, 39, spent this season on the Celtics' coaching staff after a decade on Mike Budenholzer's staffs with the Milwaukee Bucks and Atlanta Hawks.\n\nLee will replace former Hornets coach Steve Clifford, who stepped down from the role at the end of the season. Other candidates considered for the role included Miami Heat assistant Chris Quinn, former NBA player and current broadcaster JJ Redick, and Lindsey Harding, the coach of the G League's Stockton Kings.\n\nThe Hornets went 21-61 this season and will likely get a top-five pick in the NBA Draft on June 26. The draft lottery is Sunday.\n\nThe hire is the latest in an organization-wide transformation over the last year. The franchise got new owners last summer when Rick Schnall and Gabe Plotkin bought the team from Michael Jordan. The Hornets hired Jeff Peterson to head basketball operations in February, and he has slowly filled out his front office.\n\nLee marks Peterson's biggest decision yet. The two were together in the Hawks organization roughly a decade ago, where Lee was an assistant on Budenholzer's staff, Peterson was a rising executive, and Schnall was a minority owner.\n\nLee has been a head-coaching candidate for several years and was a finalist for the Washington Wizards job in 2021. He's a Budenholzer disciple but spent this season on the bench in Boston as the Celtics ran up the best record in the NBA.\n\nHe tried to be pragmatic even in rejection as he sought previous jobs, he said, as he took the feedback from teams who chose someone else.\n\n\"What am I going to have to do to grow so that one day I can be in the seat of being a head coach for one of these organizations?\" Lee said in 2022 of what he took from the interview cycles. \"There are only 30 of them and it was kind of tough to keep hearing no. But after self-reflection, you take the feedback, and now it's just my responsibility to keep trying to grow in those areas that they think that I can show some improvement in.\"\n\nHe'll take over what should be a mostly revamped roster.

He was a longtime assistant of Mike Budenholzer, first with the Atlanta Hawks and then the Milwaukee Bucks. Following Budenholzer's ouster in Milwaukee, he took a job on the Celtics' coaching staff ahead of the 2022-23 season.\n\nThe search for a new coach began on April 3, when Steve Clifford announced he was stepping down effective at the end of the 2023-24 season.\n\nBeyond the fact the Hornets went 21-61 and finished 13th in the Eastern Conference, Clifford watched as a new ownership regime was installed and general manager Mitch Kupchak vacated his role. He could've seen the writing on the wall when it came to his future.\n\nThis offseason presented the first real opportunity for Rick Schnall and Gabe Plotkin to execute the plan they laid out when they obtained control of the organization last August.\n\n\"Our vision is to take the Hornets to the next level, both on and off the court,\" they said at the time. \"We will look to build a highly competitive basketball team, develop innovative business practices, give back to our community and connect with our fans.\n\n\"We plan to further invest in the team, the facilities and the fan experience, with the goal of delivering a winner to our fans throughout the Carolinas. We are confident that our successful business backgrounds and our previous experience as NBA minority owners will be beneficial as we shape the future of the franchise as a best-in-class organization.\"\n\nLee will have a lot of work ahead to turn around a team riding an eight-year playoff drought.\n\nThe Hornets have paid dearly for a series of misfires in free agency and the NBA draft. They've experienced plenty of bad luck, too, with LaMelo Ball the most obvious example.\n\nCharlotte made Ball the cornerstone of its future when it signed him to a five-year, $204.5 million extension. The deal was certainly defensible because a small-market franchise has to hold onto its homegrown stars, and the dynamic guard averaged 18.3 points, 6.4 rebounds and 7.0 assists through his first two years.\n\nBut now Ball is coming off a 2023-24 campaign that saw him appear in just 22 games due to an ankle injury. A right ankle fracture also limited him to 36 appearances in 2022-23.\n\nThe Hornets need the 22-year-old to not only stay healthy but also get back to his best if they want to contend with this current core.\n\nThe development of 2023 first-round draft pick Brandon Miller will be pivotal as well. The early returns on the 6'9\" forward were promising as he averaged 17.2 points on 44.0 percent shooting, including 37.3 percent on threes, along with 4.3 rebounds and 2.4 assists.\n\nMiller didn't wow fans like the San Antonio Spurs' Victor Wembanyama and Oklahoma City Thunder's Chet Holmgren is, but the potential within his game is obvious.\n\nBetween Ball and Miller, Charlotte could have the nucleus for a playoff team. It's a better starting point than some other teams have had when starting a full rebuild.\n\nThere's still a lot the ownership and the front office will have to get right in the ensuing years, starting with hiring the right coach.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_zucker@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Joseph Zucker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Hornets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Clifford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Clifford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Budenholzer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Budenholzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Kupchak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Kupchak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Wembanyama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victor Wembanyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chet_Holmgren", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chet Holmgren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaMelo_Ball", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LaMelo Ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/x_0,y_492,w_1800,h_1200,c_crop/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1715258405/buwvjyybhwblmpkve0s0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553256", "eventUri": "eng-9553256", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-03", "textStart": 589, "textEnd": 596}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

With young stars like Ball and Miller, Hornets aim to improve and become playoff contenders in the Eastern Conference. Despite low initial expectations for Lee, the Hornets have a chance to build a winning culture and return to relevancy.\n\nAfter Steve Clifford stepped down as the Charlotte Hornets head coach at the end of their season, speculation ran amok about who would take the reigns for Charlotte. The Hornets have been in the dredges of the NBA standings, missing the playoffs in each of the last eight seasons and not making it past the first round since 2001.\n\nWith emerging high-profile youngsters Brandon Miller and LaMelo Ball on the roster, there was some rumors speculating that the Hornets would make a splash for JJ Redick, who also appears to be in the running for the Los Angeles Lakers head coaching job.\n\nInstead of bringing in a candidate with no coaching experience, Charlotte took the safe route and hired Charles Lee, who has ten years of experience as an assistant coach.\n\nLee spent four seasons as an assistant for the Atlanta Hawks, five with the Milwaukee Bucks, and helped Joe Mazzula and the Boston Celtics this season.\n\nHe played four years at Bucknell University, and was the 2005-06 Patriot League Player of the Year.\n\nWhat's Next in Charlotte The Hornets have a new coach and emerging young stars\n\nBetween Miller, Ball, Tre Mann, and Mark Williams, the Hornets have a decent young core. They are years away from true contention, but in a weak Eastern Conference they could be playoff contenders. Ball is an All-Star, and Miller was a finalist for Rookie of the Year this season. By bringing in a first-time head coach with championship experience (Bucks, 2021), the Hornets can lay the groundwork to develop their existing talent and finally stop the roster construction phase.\n\nSince Ball was injured for much of this season, next year will be an experimental season. Do they need to add more veteran talent? Do they need to shore up their front court? Who plays well together? Whose team is it? All of these questions will be answered throughout the season, and as the front office and coaching staff addresses them, there should be massive improvement seen in CHarlotte for the first time since the Kemba Walker days.\n\nAs the NBA shifts to the next generation and there have been several passing of the torch moments, the stage is set for the Hornets to return to (find?) relevancy or a place in the postseason picture. The expectations in year one for Lee will be relatively low, but there is hope that he can build a winning culture around the young players already in town.\n\nRelated Tyrese Haliburton Refuses to Blame Officiating for Game 2 Loss to Knicks The Pacers didn't have enough to take down the Knicks on Wednesday night.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Hornets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Clifford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Clifford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tre_Mann", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tre Mann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaMelo_Ball", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LaMelo Ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucknell_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bucknell University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patriot League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemba_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kemba Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mixcollage-09-may-2024-10-07-am-6312.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553256", "eventUri": "eng-9553256", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

The Celtics are in the middle of their second round playoff series against the Cleveland Cavaliers and are the favorites to take home their first NBA title since 2008.\n\nLee, 39, is still young compared to some of his coaching counterparts, but he boasts immense experience to pair with his youthful exuberance. In a recent interview with the Charlotte Hornets VP of Digital Media Matt Rochinski, Lee listed the Hornets' young core as one of his reasons for taking his talents to the Queen City.\n\n\"First things first it's a talent rich roster. I look at the young core that we have and it excites me. All of potential we have there, and the growth opportunities that there are on the team...\"\n\nLee has extensive experience both playing and coaching in the backcourt, and his beam when Rochinski brought up the Hornets guards LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller was palpable.\n\n\"...it does excite me. You watch those young guys right now and they're still trying to find their way, and who they are in the NBA. I think first things first, we have to come with the right approach. That every day we have the opportunity to get better. Whatever that consists of for every player, we have to attack it and be obsessed with daily improvement. I think from what I've seen from those guys, they have that DNA. That's why the Hornets decided to draft Brandon, and draft LaMelo, because they're the type of guys that you want to build around.\"\n\nIf Lee's bite matches his bark, the young guard duo in Charlotte should take a huge leap in 2024-25. A leap that could propel the Hornets up the standings into an area that Lee is familiar with. In his last 10 seasons as an assistant coach, Lee's teams have amassed a ridiculous 508-289 record, winning 64% of their games.\n\nCharlotte's new coach has plenty of experience coaching against the Hornets. Spending his entire coaching career in the Eastern Conference (some of it in the Southeast Division specifically) has allowed Lee to become familiar with Charlotte basketball's ongoings. Rochinski asked Lee about what has impressed him when scouting the Hornets over the years.\n\n\"I see a group that just plays with a lot of energy, a lot of passion. I think that on the defensive end we have to create an identity of who we want to be. I think on the offensive end, continuing to play with pace, play together, play with the pass, and also try to give us a little identity on that side of the ball too. The biggest thing it's going to come down to I think, is how competitive are we going to be? That's a mental competitiveness, a physical competitiveness, and then also the component of how much are we going to do this for one another.\"\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets have done the hard work of stockpiling the top of the roster with talented players. The 'big three' of LaMelo Ball, Brandon Miller, and Mark Williams have all of the potential in the world to rise up the ranks in the East. Young teams like the Thunder, the Timberwolves, and the Knicks have taken massive leaps in recent years due to hitting on draft picks and landing the right coach. Each of their coaches (Mark Daigneault, Chris Finch, and Tom Thibodeau) bring different skillsets, experience levels, and philosophies to the table, but each have led their programs to previously unimagined heights.\n\nFor a Charlotte team that has never reached a conference final, that has a new coach, a new general manager, and new owners, the Hornets can allow themselves to believe that the ceiling is much higher than the roof they've been limited to for decades.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Here what our staff thinks.\n\nMatt Alquiza: A+\n\nCongruency between the front office, ownership, and the coaching staff that doesn't involve the owner hiring his college buddies? It's a new era in Charlotte, folks. Lee has been a part of some top class coaching staffs in Atlanta, Milwaukee, and now Boston, and that experience should translate into one heck of a head coach. His vast experience at only 39 years old make him seasoned and relatable, a combination that should mesh well with the Hornets' young core of LaMelo Ball, Brandon Miller, and Mark Williams.\n\nDesmond Johnson: A-\n\nLee won a title in Milwaukee in 2021 as an assistant coach and he's all of 39 years old. Watching the NBA playoffs and seeing the young cores for Minnesota, OKC, New York, Orlando, etc. should give Hornets fans hope going forward. If they can keep LaMelo Ball on the court, along with Mark Williams, re-sign Miles Bridges and Brandon Miller continues to develop? Man...Plus, the Hornets hold a potential top four pick in the 2024 NBA Draft. The future looks bright in Charlotte.\n\nJames Plowright: A-\n\nLee has just about as strong a coaching resume as possible for a 39 year old assistant coach. He's experienced success everywhere he's gone and has long been tipped as a future head coach. My concern during this cycle is he would turn down the role in hope of a job with a more successful team or to stay with the championship contending Celtics. I can only give this an A- as there is always an element of the \"unknown\" with an assistant stepping up to become head coach. Maybe he's the next Mark Daigneault, hopefully not the next Adrian Griffin.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaMelo_Ball", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LaMelo Ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Hornets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Daigneault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Daigneault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Bridges", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miles Bridges"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Griffin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Griffin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4643,h_2611,x_0,y_222/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_hornets/01hxf3kcbjg4bkazbc2w.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553256", "eventUri": "eng-9553256", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-10-11", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 12}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Lee has a winning percentage of 63% in the regular season, reached the playoffs nine times, captured seven division titles and earned five Eastern Conference No. 1 seeds. In four of the last six seasons, his teams have finished the regular season with the best record in the NBA.\n\nComing from winning cultures should hopefully birth another one in Charlotte for the Hornets' sake.\n\nLaMelo Ball, Brandon Miller are perfect young stars for Charles Lee\n\nLee won't have to come into scenario where it's a bunch of inexperienced players on the roster or guys without potential. Having LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller in Charlotte is what made the job appealing in the first place. No Ball and Miller aren't eight year veterans, but they do have the All-Star potential. Giving Lee a lead guard who's 6'7 and could play on and off the ball with a two-way wing player is a great place to start.\n\nLee has been around a few All-Stars in his career already, including Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford, Jaylen Brown, and more. That's plenty of experience dealing with different superstar personalities. Throwing in two other guys with the potential to make multiple All-Star games won't be anything new for Lee.\n\nRelatability is the biggest factor here\n\nLee is only 39 years old. That already makes him one of the youngest coaches in the NBA. The Hornets have one of the youngest rosters in the league, which makes this a hand-in-glove fit already. A younger voice might appeal to a younger crowd in a lot of situations. No disrespect to Steve Clifford of course, these guys raved about him and loved him. Still, Lee should be able to make a connection right away.\n\nThrow in Mark Williams and whoever will join this team from the 2024 NBA Draft class, this core will be one of the best young teams in the league. This is the perfect hire for a team rebuilding in the weaker Eastern Conference.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jerry_donatien@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jerry Donatien", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Clifford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Clifford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Hornets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaMelo_Ball", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LaMelo Ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winning percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/3-big-takeaways-from-Charles-Lee-being-named-Hornets-next-head-coach.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553256", "eventUri": "eng-9553256", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Who will be the next head coach of this historic franchise? The likes of JJ Redick, Ty Lue, and Budenholzer stepped up. However, they weren't the only team looking for a new culture. The Charlotte Hornets also had that spot vacant. Until recently, when they announced their replacement for 10-year-long head coach Steve Clifford.\n\nThe Hornets named Boston Celtics' assistant coach Charles Lee will take the helm in Charlotte. He will complete the playoffs with the Shamrock this season before navigating to his next job. Lee has a history of successful ventures as an assistant coach. His coaching career began in 2014 with the Atlanta Hawks. Lee's most notable achievement came under Mike Budenholzr in 2021 when he helped the Milwaukee Bucks lift a championship.\n\nOver his 10-year reign as assistant coach, Lee has a record of 50-291. \"The opportunity to be the head coach of the Charlotte Hornets is a dream come true. I want to thank Rick Schnall, Gabe Plotkin, and Jeff Peterson for the trust they are placing in me to lead this team. The Hornets have a talented young core of players and I'm excited about our future and what we can build here. There are few places as passionate about basketball as the Carolinas, and I look forward to coming to Charlotte and getting to work,\" Lee said in his statement.\n\nThe decision to hire Charles Lee doesn't just delight fans of the Charlotte Hornets. The Lakers also rode off the celebrations as their prime target still remains on the market.\n\nJJ Reddick is bound to become the Lakers HC?\n\nHam's stint with the Lakers was eventful, to say the least. He led them to the Western Conference Finals last season before crashing out in the first round this year. There were also reports suggesting discourse in the locker room between Ham and several other players, D'Angelo Russell being one of them.\n\nUnderstandingly, parting ways seemed to be the right choice for both parties. With the Hornets hiring Lee, it gives the Lakers a free run to pitch to all their shortlisted candidates - Reddick being amongst them. JJ Redick has garnered heaps of support to assume control of the Lakers since his ascension as a broadcaster.\n\nHe sees the game from an analytical point of view. It correlates perfectly with none other than LeBron James. The two view basketball from an eerily similar lens. Their love for the game extended to the point they began a podcast together called 'Mind the Game'. It's well-documented how the Lakers consult the Akron Hammer when making decisions based on the team.\n\nHis and Redick's blossoming friendships could well turn into the latter becoming the next head coach of the Lakers. The 15-year veteran has shown flashes of having what it takes to manage such a high-profile team with future HOFers. But it's a whole new experience actually being on the floor and having to take accountability for results.\n\nDo you think JJ Redick should take on this role?

maybe a bullet dodged for Mr Charles Lee and maybe a bullet dodge for Charles Lee because this is gonna be like a very from my understanding and all my conversations with the guys there like this is no new owner syndrome, trading everything to go compete right now.Like they know they're in a rebuild, you know, they, you saw that front office with the kind of transitioning Mitch Kupchak situation with, you know, a lot of direction from this ownership group pull a pretty rebuild.The TM move at move after move at the trade deadline with Terry Rozier and getting a really a pretty good first round

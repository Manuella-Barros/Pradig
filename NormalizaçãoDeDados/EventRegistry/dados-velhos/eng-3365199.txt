There's nobody in charge. This man (Trump) has the nuclear codes,\" Moore, 63, told Reuters Television in an interview yesterday.\n\n\"I'm hoping somebody in the Pentagon is protecting us. Like, whatever's in that nuclear briefcase it's just some girlfriend's phone number or something. I'm just hoping that it's not the real numbers because we're in desperate shape here,\" said Moore, a longtime liberal and a harsh critic of Trump.\n\nMoore's show varies each night.\n\nOn Tuesday, he invited the audience to board buses and join him after the performance in a wider protest under way outside Trump Tower on nearby Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, where the president had arrived a day earlier to stay at his high-rise home for the first time since taking office in January.\n\nMoore, who won an Oscar in 2003 for his gun violence documentary Bowling for Columbine, said he had always wanted to bring the ideas from his films to a live theater audience.\n\n\"By the end of this run, 100,000 people would have seen the show. And each of them will tell 10 people things I said or did here tonight. That's a million people I've reached through a Broadway show,\" he said.\n\nMoore said that far from being depressed by the actions of Trump and events in Washington in the two weeks since starting the show, he has drawn strength from his appearances.\n\n\"Every night, when I leave here, I feel like my soul has been healed a little, that I have less despair, that I'm a little bit more hopeful that we're going to figure this out,\" he said.\n\nThe Terms of My Surrender is scheduled to run at the Belasco Theatre in New York until October 22. -- Reuters", "id": "9794771", "details": {},

I was just saying to my producer that I am in the middle of my next film and when I'm done with this run, we're going to have a different film because what this thing, this live theatre, of being in a room with 1,000 other people every night, what that's already done to me in just these first couple of weeks of previews, I can't put it into words right now.

There's nobody in charge. This man (Trump) has the nuclear codes,\" Moore, 63, told Reuters Television in an interview on Thursday.\n\n\"I'm hoping somebody in the Pentagon is protecting us. Like, whatever's in that nuclear briefcase it's just some girlfriend's phone number or something. I'm just hoping that it's not the real numbers because we're in desperate shape here,\" said Moore, a longtime liberal and a harsh critic of Trump.\n\nMoore's show varies each night. On Tuesday, he invited the audience to board buses and join him after the performance in a wider protest under way outside Trump Tower on nearby Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, where the president had arrived a day earlier to stay at his high-rise home for the first time since taking office in January.\n\nMoore, who won an Oscar in 2003 for his gun violence documentary \"Bowling for Columbine,\" said he had always wanted to bring the ideas from his films to a live theater audience.\n\n\"By the end of this run, 100,000 people would have seen the show. And each of them will tell 10 people things I said or did here tonight. That's a million people I've reached through a Broadway show,\" he said.\n\nMoore said that far from being depressed by the actions of Trump and events in Washington in the two weeks since starting the show, he has drawn strength from his appearances.\n\n\"Every night, when I leave here, I feel like my soul has been healed a little, that I have less despair, that I'm a little bit more hopeful that we're going to figure this out,\" he said.\n\n\"The Terms of My Surrender\" is scheduled to run at the Belasco Theatre in New York until Oct. 22.", "id": "9793894", "details": {}, "date":

Lee.\n\nHeather Heyer, 32, was killed when a man plowed his car into a crowd of counter-protesters.\n\nOutside Trump Tower Tuesday night, Moore and others held a candlelight vigil and urged the crowd to never forget Heyer and make sure she didn't \"die in vain.\"", "id": "9526502", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Michael Moore leads audience of Broadway play to Trump Tower protest", "image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4249443.1502897850!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/trump-protest.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "242096", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Academy Award"}, "id": "303648", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award"}, {"label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}, "id": "303910", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Presidency of Barack Obama"}, "id": "304051", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trump Tower (New York City)"}, "id": "304759", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_(New_York_City)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "id": "305262", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}, "id": "305377", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "id": "305960", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Michael Moore"}, "id": "306814", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moore"}, {"label": {"eng": "Broadway theatre"}, "id": "307392", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fascism"}, "id": "308371", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Marisa Tomei"}, "id": "309418", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marisa_Tomei"}, {"label": {"eng": "Demonstration (protest)"}, "id": "312931", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstration_(protest)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ku Klux Klan"}, "id": "318256", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mark Ruffalo"}, "id": "349436", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Ruffalo"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert E.

Ruffalo was a special guest at Moore's performance on Tuesday night.\n\nMoore and Ruffalo expressed outrage at President Trump's comments on Tuesday at a news conference in which he spread some of the blame for Saturday's horrifying display of bigotry and violence to what he called \"alt-left\" activists in addition to the rally organizers.\n\nOlivia Wilde, currently appearing on Broadway in \"1984,\" and actress-writer Zoe Kazan were also among the familiar faces at the rally.\n\nIn an Instagram video posted Tuesday night, Ruffalo said he was spearheading the vigil with Moore to send a message to Trump, who has been staying at his former home in Trump Tower since Monday.\n\n\"I want him to hear us,\" Ruffalo said. \"I want him to know that an American killed on an American soil by a Nazi is not acceptable.\"\n\nTrump's initial comments after Saturday's deadly encounters and his remarks at Tuesday's press conference have spurred widespread outrage. Many have expressed shock after the President's suggestion on Tuesday that there were some \"very fine people\" in the crowd at the Charlottesville rally and that there was blame to be ascribed to the activists who turned out to oppose the white supremacists, some of whom went so far as to carry Nazi flags and iconography.\n\n\"There is no equivalency. There's no 'many sides,'\" Ruffalo said. \"There's two sides to this: People who fight Nazis and Nazis. That's it. We can't allow Nazis to be a normal part of our society. We have to fight.\"\n\nCrowds of protesters -- some chanting \"New York hates you\" -- have swelled around the Trump Tower area since the President arrived back in his hometown. Police presence has been heavy throughout Midtown, and streets around Trump Tower have been closed. Trump is expected to leave the city on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nMoore's show, which focuses on the nation's volatile political climate, opened Aug. 10 and will run through Oct. 23.\n\nSpontaneous protests have always been a possible element of Moore's loosely structured show, which launched with a PR campaign that asked, \"Can a Broadway show bring down a sitting president?\" In the run-up to the production's first performance, Moore had noted that Trump Tower isn't too far from the midtown location of his Broadway show.\n\nSome observers have noted that in bringing his show to left-leaning Broadway audiences, Moore is preaching his political message to the choir. But the activist-documentarian thinks of it as galvanizing liberals dispirited after the election, he told Variety after the production's Aug. 10 opening. \"This choir needs a song to sing,\" he said. \"This choir's been depressed since November.\"\n\nRuffalo was on Broadway earlier this year in a much-praised production of Arthur Miller's \"The Price.\"\n\nMoore and Ruffalo previously led a protest on the eve of Trump's inauguration outside the Trump International Hotel.", "id": "9486038", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Mark Ruffalo, Michael Moore lead protest vigil outside Trump Tower", "image": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/michaelmoore-markruffalo.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 2114, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2121, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-10"}, {"textStart": 2143, "date": "-10-23", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2150}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "218051", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nazism"}, "id": "302813", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Instagram"}, "id": "303287", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trump Tower (New York City)"}, "id": "304759", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_(New_York_City)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fifth Avenue"}, "id": "304764", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Avenue"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}, "id": "306262", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film"}, {"label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}, "id": "307384", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Broadway theatre"}, "id": "307392", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mark Ruffalo"}, "id": "349436", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Ruffalo"}, {"label": {"eng": "Iconography"}, "id": "355036", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconography"}, {"label": {"eng": "Olivia Wilde"}, "id": "368188", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Wilde"}, {"label": {"eng": "Belasco Theatre"}, "id": "518528", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belasco_Theatre"}, {"label": {"eng": "Overthrow of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107"}, "id": "599500", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overthrow_of_Slobodan_Milo\u0161evi\u0107"}, {"label": {"eng": "Zoe Kazan"}, "id": "662947", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoe_Kazan"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 322, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Construction, Installation, and Maintenance", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Construction,_Installation,_and_Maintenance"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 393, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 596, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats"}], "time": "13:27:00"}

There's nobody in charge. This man (Trump) has the nuclear codes,\" Moore, 63, told Reuters Television in an interview on Thursday.\n\n\"I'm hoping somebody in the Pentagon is protecting us. Like, whatever's in that nuclear briefcase it's just some girlfriend's phone number or something. I'm just hoping that it's not the real numbers because we're in desperate shape here,\" said Moore, a longtime liberal and a harsh critic of Trump.\n\nMoore's show varies each night. On Tuesday, he invited the audience to board buses and join him after the performance in a wider protest under way outside Trump Tower on nearby Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, where the president had arrived a day earlier to stay at his high-rise home for the first time since taking office in January.\n\nMoore, who won an Oscar in 2003 for his gun violence documentary \"Bowling for Columbine,\" said he had always wanted to bring the ideas from his films to a live theater audience.\n\n\"By the end of this run, 100,000 people would have seen the show. And each of them will tell 10 people things I said or did here tonight. That's a million people I've reached through a Broadway show,\" he said. Moore said that far from being depressed by the actions of Trump and events in Washington in the two weeks since starting the show, he has drawn strength from his appearances.\n\n\"Every night, when I leave here, I feel like my soul has been healed a little, that I have less despair, that I'm a little bit more hopeful that we're going to figure this out,\" he said.\n\n\"The Terms of My Surrender\" is scheduled to run at the Belasco Theatre in New York until Oct. 22.

Since opening on August 10 Moore said his soul has healed and he has less despair. Moore won an Oscar in 2003 with his film \"Bowling for Columbine\" about gun violence and was awarded the prestigious Palme D'Or at the Cannes film festival in 2004 for his anti-George W.

This movement goes beyond celebrities parodying Trump, which has been a growing trend. The President of the free world held a press conference and said that there were \"good people on both sides,\" implying or rather, out right saying that some neo-Nazis and white supremacist's were good people.\n\nMark Ruffalo was on hand in front of Trump Tower for the unwelcoming home coming for Donald Trump. The actor took to social media to share images and video from the protest along with Olivia Wilde and Marisa Tomei. Ruffalo's Instagram account posted a video of the actor talking about Nazis. Ruffalo said this.\n\n\"There's two sides of this: people who fight Nazis, and Nazis, and that's it,\"\n\nMichael Moore was shown wearing a hat that read: NO SURRENDER while Ruffalo continued. He had this to say.\n\n\"We want him to hear us. We want him to know that an American killed on American soil by a Nazi is not acceptable.\"\n\nThe protest also doubled as a candlelight vigil for 32-year old Heather Heyer, the woman who was murdered over the weekend while protesting at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Trump's delayed and laid-back approach to responding to the situation in Charlottesville lead to Hollywood and the United States railing against Trump like never before. Former Republican Presidents George W. Bush and Bush Senior along with many of the Republican Party released statements condemning the acts of white supremacy and neo-Nazis, which Trump has yet to do in a meaningful way without calling mainstream news outlets fake news.\n\nZoe Kazan showed up when the outrage kicked off the previous night, along with Anna Baryshnikov. Both returned on Tuesday, this time along with Marisa Tomei. Stealing the show, though, was definitely Olivia Wilde, who eventually met up to march with Moore and Ruffalo, carrying a giant sign emblazoned with the hashtag \"#RESIST,\" which makes perfect sense for an actress who starred in an adaptation of George Orwell's dystopian 1984. Wilde started a chant: \"Trump is not a legitimate President\" while stating that, \"we reject fascism\" and \"we reject white supremacy.\" As the night progressed, Ruffalo shared more of his thoughts with the crowd.

Leading the protest along with him were actors Mark Ruffalo, Olivia Wilde, and Zoe Kazan who lead chants denouncing fascism, nazism, and racism.\n\nTo make sure everyone had a chance to have their voices heard, Moore and Ruffalo physically bussed their audience to Trump Tower.\n\nRuffalo made it a point to say the name of the woman who was tragically killed during the protests by chanting, \"Say her name: Heather Heyer!\" as the rest of the crowd joined in, loud enough for Trump to hear.\n\n\"We're here today to commemorate a life of an American that was killed by a Nazi on American soil,\" Ruffalo says. \"Let's say her name so Donald Trump can hear what's happened here -- he's allowed these people, he's allowed fascism, he's allowed the KK, he's allowed Nazis to show their ugly face, and we're here to remind him there's a cost for that. Americans have died because of that. Say her name: Heather Heyer!\"\n\nBefore the protest, Ruffalo addressed the audience by calling them \"the Avengers,\" and commented on Trump's press conference.\n\n\"It was very disconcerting. ... Basically our president today backed up and supported the Nazi, alt-right, KKK, and equated the left to the Nazis, as if there's two sides. Back when we fought World War II and there were two sides, it was the Nazis and the rest of the world trying to stop them, and that's where we find ourselves in America today, sadly. But we have a president that instead of standing up against them, actually [is] making excuses for them. I'm actually really heartbroken, since this death and this violence and this whole new political paradigm that we find ourselves in where Nazis are actually out in the open without their hoods and without hiding, killing Americans -- I'm really sad. I'm really scared. If you're losing hope, you're not doing enough.\"\n\nNext to join in was Olivia Wilde, who lead a heartfelt chant as the crowd echoed her sentiment, \"Trump is not America!\"\n\nActress Zoe Kazan also had a message from Trump, ending her speech with, \"We have power! We have voices! We will not be silenced!\"\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, the speech portion of the protest lasted for 15 minutes and took place two hours after the end of Moore's show.\n\nSeeing celebrities using their power to stand up for what's right is one of our favorite things.", "id": "9507270", "details": {"gpCnt": 4}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Mark Ruffalo and Olivia Wilde joined the huge protest outside of Trump Tower last night", "image": "https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/BA39IeHRDe6P2DYtYN3jORKBmh0=/640x360/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F54341%2F16b8007b-703b-4497-91a5-21cf87019114.png", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "218049", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nazism"}, "id": "302813", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Politics"}, "id": "302948", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "id": "303819", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trump Tower (New York City)"}, "id": "304759", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_(New_York_City)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "id": "305262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "George W.

He informed the attendees of the one-man show -- which Moore describes as a \"12-step meeting for the Democratic Party\" and runs through Oct. 22 -- that 200 of them would be driven the few blocks uptown on double-decker buses to Trump Tower, where president Donald Trump is staying during his brief visit (Moore encouraged the rest of the audience to walk over as well). The demonstration -- which doubled as a candlelight vigil for Charlottesville victim Heather Heyer -- followed the rally that took place the day before, when Trump first arrived in NYC. It was further fueled by Trump's divisive defense of the weekend's White Nationalist Rally, which was broadcasted a few hours before the play began.\n\nAfter a short bus ride up 6th Avenue, Moore addressed the crowd outside Trump Tower. \"He's in there right now,\" he said, pointing up to Trump's penthouse. \"We are here to perform a citizen's arrest -- well, there's lots of police here, maybe they'll do it for us! It'd be easier, right?\"\n\nRuffalo kicked off the chants with a brief speech. \"We're here today to commemorate a life of an American that was killed by a Nazi on American soil. Let's say her name so Donald Trump can hear what's happened here -- he's allowed these people, he's allowed fascism, he's allowed the KK, he's allowed Nazis to show their ugly face, and we're here to remind him there's a cost for that. Americans have died because of that. Say her name: Heather Heyer!\"\n\nOlivia Wilde and Tom Sturridge, currently starring in the Broadway play 1984 next door to Moore, joined the demonstration immediately after their own performance. Wildewas spontaneously asked to lead a chant: \"Stand up for justice! Stand up for America! Trump is not a legitimate president! Trump is not America!\" Zoe Kazan, wearing a tee that read \"Choose Love,\" also led one: \"We reject fascism! We reject white supremacy! We reject Neo-Nazis! We will not accept white supremacy in the White House!\n\nalongside @MMFlint and @MarkRuffalo, @oliviawilde leads a spontaneous, heartfelt mic check. https://t.co/PFfJ08I54a #TrumpTowerProtest pic.twitter.com/IbOSUOeDmx -- Ashley Lee (@cashleelee)\n\nAugust 16, 2017\n\nBefore the rally, Ruffalo referred to the audience as \"the Avengers\" and commented on Trump's press conference. \"It was very disconcerting. ... Basically our president today backed up and supported the Nazi, alt-right, KKK, and equated the left to the Nazis, as if there's two sides. Back when we fought World War II and there were two sides, it was the Nazis and the rest of the world trying to stop them, and that's where we find ourselves in America today, sadly. But we have a president that instead of standing up against them, actually [is] making excuses for them,\" he said. \"I'm actually really heartbroken, since this death and this violence and this whole new political paradigm that we find ourselves in where Nazis are actually out in the open without their hoods and without hiding, killing Americans -- I'm really sad. I'm really scared.\" Still, he added a bit of advice: \"If you're losing hope, you're not doing enough.\"\n\nMoore also addressed Trump's defense of the Charlottesville rally at the top of the show, when he usually discusses the latest headlines. \"None of us can remember when an American president defended white nationalists. ... After it was over, I had tears in my eyes, because it really showed me that this guy is not just crazy -- he has an agenda, and he's mad that he said what they made him say, and he walked it all back.\" He closed the opening section with a joke: \"When they finally indict him, when they finally arrest him, my only real question is, do they try him as an adult?\"\n\nThough the post-show protests were initially teased when the new production was announced in May, Tuesday night's demonstration was the first time the plan was executed during the show's Broadway run. \"There might be some impromptu excursions after the show to places that might be nearby.

Earlier this evening after his Broadway one-man show The Terms of My Surrender, he invited the audience to join him in a protest at Trump Tower in New York.\n\nMoore teased the field trip in a tweet earlier in the day along with a special surprise guest on his show.\n\nHe later tweeted and directly said he was going to visit 45.\n\nPrevious guests on Moore's show included Bryan Cranston, Gloria Steinem, Maxine Waters and Morgan Spurlock. It's assumed that the surprise guest he was referring to was Mark Ruffalo as the civic-minded actor who has been very vocal about Trump joined him and the audience on a trip to Trump Tower.\n\nAfter the show, buses took audience members who were provided with show-sponsored signs for the demonstration. Also joining Moore and Ruffalo was actress Olivia Wilde who is currently starring in the Broadway play 1984, which is in playing in the neighboring Hudson Theatre. Ruffalo posted a video of him and Moore right before the event while Wilde posted a photo of her and her 1984 castmate Tom Sturridge with \"#RESIST\" signs. The demonstration was also a candlelight vigil for Heather Heyer who died amidst the violence of the Charlottesville rally.\n\nDuring a press conference today, Trump addressed questions in regards to Charlottesville saying \"There is blame on both sides. ... I have no doubt about it - and you don't have any doubt about it either.\" Moore, along with many others reacted to his comments that were in line with those he made after the events where he put the blame \"on many sides.\"\n\nMoore's debut Broadway show The Terms of My Surrender is currently play at the Belasco Theatre and runs through October 22. True to Moore's brand, the show is a one-man show where the polarizing filmmaker unapologetically uses satirical humor to make commentary about America and its politics.", "id": "9398459", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Michael Moore Leads Audience In Trump Tower Protest After His Broadway Show", "image": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/michael-moore-in-the-terms-of-my-surrender-photo-by-joan-marcus.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1884, "date": "-10-22", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1894}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "218051", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Social media"}, "id": "302545", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Actor"}, "id": "302943", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Audience"}, "id": "303527", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trump Tower (New York City)"}, "id": "304759", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_(New_York_City)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "id": "305262", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Michael Moore"}, "id": "306814", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moore"}, {"label": {"eng": "Broadway theatre"}, "id": "307392", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre"}, {"label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}, "id": "309129", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking"}, {"label": {"eng": "Candlelight vigil"}, "id": "313193", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlelight_vigil"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mark Ruffalo"}, "id": "349436", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Ruffalo"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bryan Cranston"}, "id": "366043", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Cranston"}, {"label": {"eng": "Olivia Wilde"}, "id": "368188", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Wilde"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gloria Steinem"}, "id": "385868", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Steinem"}, {"label": {"eng": "Morgan Spurlock"}, "id": "432773", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Spurlock"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tom Sturridge"}, "id": "518007", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Sturridge"}, {"label": {"eng": "Belasco Theatre"}, "id": "518528", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belasco_Theatre"}, {"label": {"eng": "Maxine Waters"}, "id": "519663", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxine_Waters"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hudson Theatre"}, "id": "651779", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Theatre"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 596, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 974, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Comedy", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Comedy"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1038, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Magic", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Magic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Hypnotism", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Hypnotism"}], "time": "03:55:00"}

He informed the attendees of the one-man show -- which Moore describes as a \"12-step meeting for the Democratic Party\" and runs through Oct. 22 -- that 200 of them would be driven the few blocks uptown on double-decker buses to Trump Tower, where president Donald Trump is staying during his brief visit (Moore encouraged the rest of the audience to walk over as well).\n\nThe demonstration -- which doubled as a candlelight vigil for Charlottesville victim Heather Heyer -- followed the rally that took place the day before, when Trump first arrived in NYC. It was further fueled by Trump's divisive defense of the weekend's White Nationalist Rally, which was broadcast a few hours before the play began.\n\n.@MMFlint and @MarkRuffalo are leading a Trump Tower protest with #1984Play's Olivia Wilde and Tom Sturridge in tow https://t.co/PFfJ08I54a pic.twitter.com/rqf62i5qwS -- Ashley Lee (@cashleelee)\n\nAugust 16, 2017\n\nAfter a short bus ride up 6th Avenue, Moore addressed the crowd outside Trump Tower. \"He's in there right now,\" he said, pointing up to Trump's penthouse. \"We are here to perform a citizen's arrest -- well, there's lots of police here, maybe they'll do it for us! It'd be easier, right?\"\n\nRuffalo kicked off the chants with a brief speech. \"We're here today to commemorate a life of an American that was killed by a Nazi on American soil. Let's say her name so Donald Trump can hear what's happened here -- he's allowed these people, he's allowed fascism, he's allowed the KK, he's allowed Nazis to show their ugly face, and we're here to remind him there's a cost for that. Americans have died because of that. Say her name: Heather Heyer!\"\n\nOlivia Wilde and Tom Sturridge, currently starring in the Broadway play 1984 next door to Moore, joined the demonstration immediately after their own performance. Wilde was spontaneously asked to lead a chant: \"Stand up for justice! Stand up for America! Trump is not a legitimate president! Trump is not America!\" Zoe Kazan, wearing a tee that read \"Choose Love,\" also led one: \"We reject fascism! We reject white supremacy! We reject Neo-Nazis! We will not accept white supremacy in the White House!\n\nalongside @MMFlint and @MarkRuffalo, @oliviawilde leads a spontaneous, heartfelt mic check. https://t.co/PFfJ08I54a #TrumpTowerProtest pic.twitter.com/IbOSUOeDmx -- Ashley Lee (@cashleelee)\n\nAugust 16, 2017\n\nBefore the rally, Ruffalo referred to the audience as \"the Avengers\" and commented on Trump's press conference. \"It was very disconcerting. ... Basically our president today backed up and supported the Nazi, alt-right, KKK, and equated the left to the Nazis, as if there's two sides. Back when we fought World War II and there were two sides, it was the Nazis and the rest of the world trying to stop them, and that's where we find ourselves in America today, sadly. But we have a president that instead of standing up against them, actually [is] making excuses for them,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm actually really heartbroken, since this death and this violence and this whole new political paradigm that we find ourselves in where Nazis are actually out in the open without their hoods and without hiding, killing Americans -- I'm really sad. I'm really scared.\" Still, he added a bit of advice: \"If you're losing hope, you're not doing enough.\"\n\nMoore also addressed Trump's defense of the Charlottesville rally at the top of the show, when he usually discusses the latest headlines. \"None of us can remember when an American president defended white nationalists. ... After it was over, I had tears in my eyes, because it really showed me that this guy is not just crazy -- he has an agenda, and he's mad that he said what they made him say, and he walked it all back.\" He closed the opening section with a joke: \"When they finally indict him, when they finally arrest him, my only real question is, do they try him as an adult?\"\n\nThough the post-show protests were initially teased when the new production was announced in May, Tuesday night's demonstration was the first time the plan was executed during the show's Broadway run. \"There might be some impromptu excursions after the show to places that might be nearby.

Back when we fought World War II and there were two sides, it was the Nazis and the rest of the world trying to stop them, and that's where we find ourselves in America today, sadly. But we have a president that instead of standing up against them, actually [is] making excuses for them,\n\nContinued Ruffalo: \"I'm actually really heartbroken, since this death and this violence and this whole new political paradigm that we find ourselves in where Nazis are actually out in the open without their hoods and without hiding, killing Americans -- I'm really sad. I'm really scared.\"\n\nHe added: \"If you're losing hope, you're not doing enough.\"\n\nIn addition, Moore explicitly addressed Trump's press conference at the start of Tuesday's performance.\n\nREAD MORE: 6 highlights from Donald Trump's derailed press conference\n\n\"None of us can remember when an American president defended white nationalists,\" Moore told the audience. \"After it was over, I had tears in my eyes, because it really showed me that this guy is not just crazy -- he has an agenda, and he's mad that he said what they made him say, and he walked it all back.\"\n\nMoore, as is his nature, offered a joke.\n\n\"When they finally indict [Trump], when they finally arrest him, my only real question is, do they try him as an adult?\"", "id": "9394767", "details": {"pinCnt": 7}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Michael Moore, Mark Ruffalo lead theatregoers to protest at Trump Tower following Broadway performance", "image": "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/mike-moore.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=720&h=480&crop=1", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1477, "date": "2017-08-16", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1492}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nazism"}, "id": "302813", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Academy Award"}, "id": "303648", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award"}, {"label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "id": "303819", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II"}, {"label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}, "id": "304126", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Film producer"}, "id": "304353", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trump Tower (New York City)"}, "id": "304759", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_(New_York_City)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fifth Avenue"}, "id": "304764", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Avenue"}, {"label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}, "id": "305262", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}, "id": "305377", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "George W.

The 49-year-old actor decided to protest following US President Donald Trump's response to the violence against the counterprotesters of a rally organised by white nationalists. Trump had said that \"there is blame on both sides\" for the demonstration that turned violent on August 12. Ruffalo posted a video on Instagram to inform his fans and followers about the protest. \"We want him to hear us. We want him to know that an American killed on American soil by a Nazi is not acceptable. That there is no equivalence, there is no many sides. \"There's two sides to this. People who fight Nazis and Nazis and that's it. We cannot allow Nazis to be a normal part of our society. We have to fight,\" he said in the video. \"The Avengers\" star was supported by filmmaker Micheal Moore, who interrupted his own Broadway show, 'The Terms of My Surrender' to sit beside Ruffalo on top of a double-decker bus he arranged for the public.\n\nThe vigil was also joined by actor Olivia Wilde, who led chants of \"Trump is not a legitimate president! Trump is not America! We love America!\" outside the tower.\n\nAccording to Entertainment Weekly, \"The Big Sick\" actor Zoe Kazan also came forward to raise slogans such as, \"We reject fascism! We reject white supremacy! We reject Neo- Nazis! We will not accept white supremacy in the White House!\" Some celebrities took to social media to register their protest.\n\nHeading to Trump Tower for a candle light vigil for Heather Heyer who was murdered by an Alt Right American Nazi.\n\nA post shared by Mark Ruffalo (@markruffalo) on Aug 15, 2017 at 7:01pm PDT\n\nTV host Jimmy Kimmel wrote on Twitter, \"I haven't seen anything that crazy since Tyson bit Holyfield @realDonaldTrump.\" Author JK Rowling tweeted, \"One good thing about that abomination of a speech: it's now impossible for any Trump supporter to pretend they don't know what he is.\" Veteran actress Barbra Streisand said Trump said what he really believes without a prepared statement. \"Equating neo-Nazis to those protecting civil rights is disgraceful and crazy,\" she continued.\n\n\"Captain America\" star Chris Evans tweeted, \"Is anyone else watching this?!?

Theatergoers crammed onto a pair of double-decker buses en route to a candlelight vigil for Heather Heyer, the 32-year-old killed Saturday in Charlottesville, Virginia after a car slammed into demonstrators protesting the \"Unite the Right\" white supremacist rally.\n\nMoore shuttled the audience outside to the protest roughly 90 minutes into the show, The New York Times reports. Mark Ruffalo, Marisa Tomei and Fisher Stevens joined on the upper level of one bus, helping him navigate to Trump Tower. Olivia Wilde and Tom Sturridge were also onboard, Gothamist reports.\n\nA Facebook livestream of the protest showed Ruffalo leading a series of chants, including \"No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA\" and \"Hey hey, ho, ho, neo-Nazis got to go.\" After the bus arrived, Moore announced to the growing crowd, \"We are here to perform a citizen's arrest!\" The actor also started a lengthy chant on Fifth Avenue outlining his \"hurt\" over the weekend's events.\n\n\"Something's dying in America,\" Ruffalo said. \"The soul of America. The dream of America. The hope of America is languishing today, is hurting today and it's not going to stop until Donald Trump is stopped. Until [Sebastian] Gorka is stopped. Until Steve Bannon is stopped. Until Stephen Miller is stopped. We're decent people. We're a multicultural country. We all come from someplace else. What's beautiful about us is our differences. Whiteness is nothing without the rest of the rainbow. It's nothing without black. It's nothing without yellow. It's nothing without red. It's nothing without brown. It's nothing without LGBT people. It's nothing without trans people. It's nothing without our lovely, beautiful mothers and women. It's nothing without our diversity. We are all colors. We are America. We love America.\"\n\nUpon announcing The Terms of My Surrender in May, Moore described the one-man-show as a \"ride through the United States of Insanity, explaining once and for all how the fuck we got here and where best to dine before crossing with the Von Trapp family over the Canadian border.\"\n\nMoore recently told Rolling Stone his show targets \"self-hating liberals.\"\n\n\"They're the liberals who weren't paying attention to what needed to happen last year to stop Trump,\" he said the day after opening night. \"Trying to break through that bubble was very difficult. Trying to warn them what was going to happen, it was an impossible task. This show is for them. It's why I'm glad I'm doing it here in New York, right now, rather than in Atlanta or some other place. ... Unless you have the attitude that you're in the French Resistance at this point, I don't know how we're going to defeat this.

Once he arrived at Trump Tower, Moore joked that they were there \"to perform a citizen's arrest.\" (Note: The following video contains graphic language.)\n\n\"Avengers\" and \"Spotlight\" star Mark Ruffalo was among those audience members who boarded the bus to protest the president.\n\n\"We want him to hear us,\" Ruffalo said in a video posted on his Instagram account. \"We want him to know that an American killed on American soil by a Nazi is not acceptable. That there is no equivalence. There's no 'many sides.' There's two sides in this: People who fight Nazis and Nazis. And that's it. We can't allow Nazis to be a normal part of our society. We have to fight.\"\n\nOther celebrities in Moore's audience who joined the chorus were Marisa Tomei, Fisher Stevens, Olivia Wilde, Tom Sturridge and Zoe Kazan.\n\nLatest updates Copyright \u00a9

The \"little field trip\" as Ruffalo called it, brought 200 of the guests of Moore's one-man show uptown for the demonstration and candlelight vigil for Heather Heyer, who was killed counter-protesting the alt-right \"Unite the Right\" rally on Saturday, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nRuffalo was the latest progressive figure (joining the ranks of Bryan Cranston, Keith Olbermann, Maxine Waters, and Gloria Steinem) to appear as a guest at Moore's show. And, considering Trump is actually home and had just made some particularly troubling off-the-cuff comments about Charlottesville, they decided to urge their crowd to head over to the rally and take some action. Per The Hollywood Reporter, Ruffalo said:\n\nMoore had hinted back in May that \"impromptu excursions\" post-show weren't out of the question given the proximity of Broadway to Trump Tower. As The Hollywood Reporter noted, he said at the time that folks could \"do the math\" and assume there'd be some kind of action.\n\nHowever, this first excursion was particularly meaningful following the events in Charlottesville. Moore, who usually unpacks weekly headlines at the start of each show, anchored the expected jokes with a devastating emotional center at the realities of an \"agenda\" that doesn't renounce or condemn white nationalism.\n\n\"None of us can remember when an American president defended white nationalists,\" Moore said. \"After it was over, I had tears in my eyes, because it really showed me that this guy is not just crazy -- he has an agenda, and he's mad that he said what they made him say, and he walked it all back.\"\n\nAnd, Ruffalo, who has always had a way with words in tough times, offered up some really good advice: \"If you're losing hope, you're not doing enough.\"\n\nConsidering Moore's track history -- and the high-profile activists and celebrities he has on his side -- it's safe to assume that this isn't the last field trip he'll be taking.", "id": "9425165", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Michael Moore & Mark Ruffalo Take Broadway Audiences On A \"Field Trip\" To Trump Tower", "image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/uploads/getty/2017/8/16/49d55dc6-2415-4f19-bb22-934680925ad2-getty-829637136.jpg?w=1200&h=630&auto=format&fm=jpg&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trump Tower (New York City)"}, "id": "304759", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_(New_York_City)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Michael Moore"}, "id": "306814", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moore"}, {"label": {"eng": "Broadway theatre"}, "id": "307392", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}, "id": "308296", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Candlelight vigil"}, "id": "313193", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlelight_vigil"}, {"label": {"eng": "Excursion"}, "id": "326756", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excursion"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mark Ruffalo"}, "id": "349436", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Ruffalo"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bryan Cranston"}, "id": "366043", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Cranston"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gloria Steinem"}, "id": "385868", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Steinem"}, {"label": {"eng": "White nationalism"}, "id": "394340", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Unite the Right"}, "id": "515460", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right"}, {"label": {"eng": "Maxine Waters"}, "id": "519663", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxine_Waters"}, {"label": {"eng": "Keith Olbermann"}, "id": "572067", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Olbermann"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alt-right"}, "id": "1268917", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 393, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 596, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1038, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Magic", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Magic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Hypnotism", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Hypnotism"}], "time": "02:44:00"}

Do they have any semblance of guilt?'\n\nThe conference quickly descended into chaos, and instead of avoiding questions about the weekend, Trump went on a rant blasting 'fake news' and defended his initial statement, which was criticised for not being more unequivocal in its condemnation, branding it 'very fine' and saying that he could not have elaborated any more at the time because he did not

According to The New York Times, Moore even provided the surprised playgoers with pre-made placards, printed with slogans like \"Resist\" and \"We shall overcomb.\"\n\nTrump was in New York this week for the first time in months, as he comes to the end of a distressingly active working vacation. The president gave a press conference earlier today from Trump Tower, in which he doubled down on his \"Hey, who can say?\" rhetoric from Saturday's violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, offering up a bunch of Fox News-supplied talking points about how \"both sides\" engaged in the violence that left one woman -- liberal protester Heather Heyer, who was killed when a member of the white supremacist rally hit her and several other people with his car -- dead. (Trump managed to resist expressing his sympathy for the car, damaged by so many \"alt-left agitators\" attacking it with their bruised and broken bones, but not by much.)\n\nA few hundred people ended up taking Moore up on his offer, and they all piled into the buses to go chant outside Trump's home.

Moore was joined by several celebrities including Mark Ruffalo and Olivia Wilde, center left, in the Oprah-style surprise involving chartered open-air buses and pre-made signs, both comedic and serious.\n\nNEW YORK >> About an hour and a half into his Broadway performance on Aug. 15, Michael Moore paused his rumpled, moralistic ire to offer the audience an Oprah-style surprise. Two double-decker buses were waiting outside, he said, to whisk theatergoers to Fifth Avenue in a ready-made protest delivered straight to the doorstep of President Donald Trump, the chief target of Moore's solo show.\n\nThere were so many cheers from the audience -- who hissed at each mention of the president the way theatergoers once might have booed a vaudeville villain -- that Moore checked himself.\n\n\"We might need four buses,\" he said.\n\nLike any Broadway spectacle, the excursion was a splice of authentic emotion and fabrication. It seemed equal part an earnest bid to get people off the sidelines and into a picket line and equal part showbiz hoopla aimed at bolstering a show that opened last week to mixed reviews and that has not yet caught fire with ticket buyers.\n\nThe buses (and the electric votive candles on each seat) were paid for by Moore's show, \"The Terms of My Surrender.\" The production also furnished protest signs, a mix of serious messages like \"resist\" and comedic jabs at the president. \"We shall overcomb\" one read, beside a Trump-like silhouette.\n\nThe signs were handed out to audience members after they signed a waiver and climbed aboard. And though the field trip called to mind a similar expedition by Andy Kaufman, who took his audience from Carnegie Hall one night in 1979 on charter buses for a snack of milk and cookies, it lacked its originality. The nuance of Moore's early projects like \"Roger & Me\" seemed to have given way, both on the bus as well as on the stage, to fire-breathing liberalism that speaks mostly to fellow progressives.\n\nSeated in the open air of the buses' upper decks as they whizzed up the Avenue of the Americas toward Trump Tower, what had minutes before been a Broadway audience buying overpriced snacks and drinking wine in plastic sippy cups swiftly evolved into a fired-up rally.\n\n\"I've only done what he said we shouldn't do, which is watch 'Rachel Maddow' and sign online petitions,\" said Alan Denzer, 66, a retired stockbroker from Bronxville, New York, referring to Moore's excoriation of armchair resistance that permeates the show, as he sat on the bus. It was Denzer's first time protesting since the Vietnam War, he said. \"He makes you feel guilty a little bit for sitting on your duff,\" he said. Today he realized: \"I could be more useful.\"\n\nThe protest came at a politically charged moment, hours after Trump made comments at a news conference blaming both sides, rather than neo-Nazis and white supremacists, for the deadly violence Saturday in Charlottesville, Virginia. The president's words were addressed in Moore's show, where he appeared almost pained at the retelling. Many of those who followed Moore to Trump Tower said that if Moore's buses had not taken them to the streets, Trump's words that afternoon would have led them to anyway.\n\nAs the buses trundled uptown toward Trump's penthouse, sparks of political passion emerged. Pedestrians on the street joined in chants over a megaphone by actor Mark Ruffalo from atop the lead bus. He had been a special guest on Moore's stage that night. Even a police officer danced beside the buses, giving two thumbs-up, before a colleague gestured for her to stop.\n\nIn his Red Line Tours uniform, Ronald Haynie, 48, a professional New York City guide from the Bronx who had been hired along with the bus for the evening, punched his fist in the air in a joyful Black Power salute. \"1968 this!\" he said referring to the famed protest gesture at the Mexico City Summer Olympics that year.\n\nAt 58th Street and the Avenue of the Americas, the police slid back steel barricades blocking off the street, which were an extra security measure while Trump was in town, and let the buses head east. They drew to a stop by Bergdorf Goodman, where Moore and Ruffalo hung over the front of the bus shouting encouragement at the theatergoers-turned-protesters headed toward Trump Tower at 725 Fifth Avenue. Some paused in their march to ask actress Olivia Wilde, who had joined in the procession, for her autograph.\n\n\"This is a way better-looking group than most protesters,\" Jason Trentylon, a street promoter who was not part of the bused-in group, said to a friend.\n\nThe protest itself was brief. Behind a police cordon just north of Tiffany's at 57th Street, the protesters chanted and took pictures of one another for about 45 minutes before the group fractured. At one point Ruffalo attempted to lead the crowd to another street corner where he said counterprotesters were assembled, but confronted with security blockades, most went home.\n\nOn Fifth Avenue at 58th Street, as the evening wrapped up, Moore stood beside Pulitzer Fountain past 10 p.m., signing autographs, surrounded by news camera crews. How would he respond to any criticism, or critiques of his audience-participation-protest as a stunt?\n\n\"Who would say something like that?\" he said sharply, before turning and walking away. He climbed into a waiting SUV and left.", "id": "9562326", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Moore takes Broadway audience to protest Trump", "image":

Let's say her name so Donald Trump can hear what's happened here - he's allowed these people, he's allowed fascism, he's allowed the KKK, he's allowed Nazis to show their ugly face, and we're here to remind him there's a cost for that. Americans have died because of it. Say her name: Heather Heyer!\"\n\nThey were joined by Olivia and her 1984 co-star Tom Sturridge, who got on the bus after they finished performing in the stage play.

Watch Olivia Wilde and more activists gather in NYC.\n\nActivist and filmmaker Michael Moore, 63, is currently doing a one-man show on Broadway, and threw a curveball during his August 15 performance. He led the audience of his show in New York City out of the theater and marched them all down to the Trump Tower! Michael had a few celebrity guests in the audience that night, including Olivia Wilde, Mark Ruffalo, and Zoe Kazan. They were all more than happy to lead a loud and proud protest in front of President Donald Trump's home and business headquarters. Some of their fellow protestors documented the massive event that night on Twitter.\n\nActivists have gathered outside the Trump Tower in New York City for days now to let the president know they won't stand for him being easy on white supremacists. Trump returned to his NYC home on Monday, August 14, for the first time since taking office, and protestors were there waiting for him. They held signs, led chants, and demanded accountability from the president after he failed to adequately address the horrific clash in Charlottesville over the weekend. Trump gave a weak statement about the abhorrent incident, in which white supremacists descended upon the UVA campus to protest the removal of a Confederate statue. Some protestors identified themselves as alt-right (aka white supremacists), some as members of the KKK, and some were openly neo-Nazis -- some wearing Nazi armbands and some with swastika tattoos.\n\nThe protest turned to tragedy when a man drove through a crowd of left counter-protestors, killing Heather Heyer, 32, and injuring 19 others. The president made a statement later that day and failed to mention Heather by name, and failed to denounce the neo-Nazis that took over UVA. He instead said there were problems \"on many sides,\" seemingly blaming the counter-protestors for violence, as well. In a subsequent speech, he condemned white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and the KKK and gave his condolences to Heather's family. In another speech, he undid that thoughtfulness and seemed to defend the white supremacists, saying that there were \"good people on both sides.\"\n\nThe protest attended by the celebrities on August 15 was led by Michael and Mark, who shouted \"No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA.\" Olivia chanted with the crowd, yelling \"Stand up for justice, stand up for America. Trump is not a legitimate president. Trump is not America. We love America.\" Zoe was filmed chanting, \"We reject fascism. We reject white supremacy. We reject neo-Nazis. We will not accept white supremacy in the White House. We will not accept violence towards black and brown people. We will not accept Nazi rhetoric in 2017. We have power, we we have voices, we will not silenced.\"\n\nHollywoodLifers, were you at the Trump Tower protests on August 15, or on August 14?

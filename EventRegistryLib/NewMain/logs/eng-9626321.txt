King Charles III and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Biden will on Thursday remember the heroism of the Allied troops who gave their lives often far from home in the landings on June 6, 1944 to free Europe from Nazi occupation.\n\nFor King Charles, it will be his first overseas visit since his cancer diagnosis.\n\nWhile the sacrifice of Allied soldiers will be centre stage, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian President Sergio Mattarella will also be present as a sign of international post-World-War-II reconciliation.\n\nFlying aboard Air Force One, Biden touched down at Paris Orly airport and was welcomed by Prime Minister Gabriel Attal.\n\nBiden was also expected to promote America as a defender of democracy and international alliances during his state visit that will last to Sunday, contrasting himself against election rival Donald Trump.\n\nBut the war that has raged in Ukraine since Russia's February 24, 2022 invasion, will take centre stage with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also attending and scheduled to meet with Biden, according to the White House.\n\nNo official from Russia has been invited, after Paris reversed plans to host lower-level representatives in recognition of the Soviet Union's immense contribution in World War II.\n\nThe most honoured guests will be the surviving veterans: some 200 are expected, a number that is dwindling every year with most at least in their late 90s and some over 100.\n\n- 'We won the war' -\n\nBiden, Macron and Zelensky are coming together at a critical moment in the Ukraine conflict, with Kyiv warning that Russia risks gaining the upper hand without a significant increase in Western help.\n\nMacron has already sought to break taboos by refusing to rule out sending troops to Ukraine, a position that unsettled some EU allies.\n\nBut there have been shifts in recent weeks, with the West showing readiness to allow Ukraine to use Western-provided weapons to strike targets in Russia and France pushing for the deployment of European military instructors in Ukraine.\n\nMacron, who once sought to build a relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, has repeatedly warned about the existential nature of the Ukraine conflict for Europe, saying in a speech in April: \"Our Europe is mortal, it can die.\"\n\nWelcoming veterans as they arrived by air in Normandy, the French leader's wife Brigitte Macron expressed France's \"deepest respect and deepest love\", in a video posted on Macron's X account.\n\n\"I am glad we won the war,\" one told her. \"Oh yes we did\" she replied in English, clasping his hand fervently.\n\n- 'The longest day' -\n\nThe landings by Allied forces, backed by airborne operations that parachuted troops directly onto occupied soil, were the biggest naval operation ever in terms of the number of ships deployed and the troops involved.\n\nBy the end of what became known as \"the longest day\", 156,000 Allied troops with 20,000 vehicles had landed in Nazi-occupied northern France despite facing a hail of bullets, artillery and aircraft fire.\n\nThe landings marked the beginning of the end of the Nazi occupation of Europe, although months of intense and bloody fighting still lay ahead before victory over the regime of Adolf Hitler.\n\nThree days of ceremonies will see Macron pay tribute to French victims of Nazi occupation, including 70 members of the French Resistance executed by the Germans at Caen prison in Normandy on D-Day.\n\nThe 80th anniversary Thursday will see leaders attend national ceremonies at the vast war cemeteries on the Normandy coast, with an international ceremony attended by all the main guests at Omaha.\n\nOn Friday, Biden will give a speech at the Pointe du Hoc -- a clifftop promontory whose German bunkers were attacked by US troops in a daring assault during the landings -- on defending freedom and democracy.\n\nMacron will also give a keynote speech in Bayeux, the first French town to be liberated.\n\nBiden will continue the trip in Paris Saturday with the first state visit of his presidency to France, giving him and Macron a critical chance to push for peace in Ukraine and also the conflict in Gaza in talks at the Elysee Palace, before leaving France for the United States on Sunday.\n\nsjw/ah/jm\n\nMore from this section\n\nBiden and Trump win Democratic, Republican elections in

One, Biden touched down at Paris Orly airport and was welcomed by Prime Minister Gabriel Attal.\n\nBiden was also expected to promote America as a defender of democracy and international alliances

strike targets in Russia and France pushing for the deployment of European military instructors in Ukraine.\n\nMacron, who once sought to build a relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, has repeatedly warned about the existential nature of the Ukraine conflict for Europe, saying in a speech in April: \"Our Europe is mortal, it can die.\"\n\nWelcoming veterans as they arrived by air

Thursday will see leaders attend national ceremonies at the vast war cemeteries on the Normandy coast, with an international ceremony attended by all the main guests at Omaha.\n\nOn Friday, Biden will

"title": "Macron lauds 'spirit of sacrifice' as D-Day marked under Ukraine shadow", "body": "The landings marked the beginning of the end of the Nazi occupation of Europe\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday hailed the \"spirit of sacrifice\" of the soldiers who liberated Europe from Nazi occupation, as he prepared to join US President Joe Biden and King Charles III to mark 80 years since the World War II D-Day landings.\n\nThe three days of events in France, which will peak Thursday with ceremonies attended by world leaders on the Normandy beaches where the landings took place, are haunted by the new war shadowing Europe as Ukraine battles Russia's invasion.\n\nMacron will host Biden, King Charles III and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, representing the World War II Allied powers, to remember the heroism of the troops who gave their lives in the landings on June 6, 1944, to free Europe from Nazi occupation.\n\nThe most honoured guests will be the surviving veterans: Around 200 are expected, a number that is dwindling every year with most at least in their late 90s and some older than 100.\n\nBut with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky joining the Western leaders in Normandy, the ceremonies will provide a hugely symbolic backdrop to talks on how Ukraine can gain back ground after Russian advances.\n\nStrikingly, no Russian official has been invited, underlining Moscow's pariah status in the West after the invasion of Ukraine despite the massive USSR contribution to defeating Nazism in World War II.\n\n- 'Cherish those who served' -\n\nKicking off events with a ceremony in neighbouring Brittany to remember French resistance fighters who landed in occupied France as D-Day got under way, Macron said he was sure today's youth was \"ready for the same spirit of sacrifice as its elders\".\n\n\"As the dangers mount... you remind us that we are ready to consent to the same sacrifices to defend what is most dear to us,\" Macron said.\n\nKing Charles, whose visit to Normandy on Thursday will be his first overseas trip since his cancer diagnosis, led a day of commemorations in the English port city of Portsmouth, a key hub as Allied troops prepared for D-Day.\n\n\"As we give thanks for all those who gave so much to win the victory whose fruits we still enjoy to this day, let us once again commit ourselves always to remember, cherish and honour those who served that day,\" he said.\n\nWhile the sacrifice of Allied soldiers will be centre stage, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian President Sergio Mattarella will also be present in Normandy on Thursday as a sign of international post-World War II reconciliation.\n\nWelcoming veterans as they arrived by air in Normandy, the French leader's wife Brigitte Macron expressed France's \"deepest respect and deepest love\", in a video posted on Macron's X account.\n\n\"I am glad we won the war,\" one told her.\n\n\"Oh yes we did,\" she replied in English, clasping his hand fervently.\n\n- 'Deepen Ukraine support' -\n\nBiden, who touched down in Paris earlier Wednesday, was also expected to promote the United States as a defender of democracy and international alliances, contrasting himself against election rival Donald Trump during a state visit that will last until Sunday.\n\nOn Friday, Biden will give a speech on defending freedom and democracy at the Pointe du Hoc, a clifftop promontory whose German bunkers were attacked by US troops in a daring assault during the landings.\n\nUS National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters travelling to Paris that Biden would tell Zelensky \"how we can continue and deepen our support for Ukraine\".\n\nMacron has already sought to break taboos by refusing to rule out sending troops to Ukraine, a position that unsettled some EU allies.\n\nBut there have been shifts in recent weeks, with the West showing readiness to allow Ukraine to use Western-provided weapons to strike targets in Russia, and France pushing for the deployment of European military instructors in Ukraine.\n\nThe landings by Allied forces, backed by airborne operations that parachuted troops directly onto occupied soil, were the biggest naval operation ever in terms of the number of ships deployed and the troops involved.\n\nBy the end of what became known as \"the longest day\", 156,000 Allied troops with 20,000 vehicles had landed in Nazi-occupied northern France despite facing a hail of bullets, artillery and aircraft fire.\n\nThe landings marked the beginning of the end of the Nazi occupation of Europe, though months of intense and bloody fighting still lay ahead before victory over the regime of Adolf Hitler.\n\nsjw-ah/js\n\nMore from this section\n\nTim Sheehy wins Republican

remember the heroism of the Allied troops who gave their lives often far from home in the landings on June 6, 1944 to free Europe from Nazi occupation.\n\nFor King Charles, it will be his first overseas visit since his cancer diagnosis.\n\nWhile the sacrifice of Allied soldiers will be centre stage, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian President Sergio Mattarella will also be present as a sign of international post-World-War-II reconciliation.\n\nFlying aboard Air Force One, Biden touched down at Paris Orly airport and was welcomed by Prime Minister Gabriel Attal.\n\nBiden was also expected to promote America as a defender of democracy and international alliances during his state visit that will last to Sunday, contrasting himself against election rival Donald Trump.\n\nBut the war that has raged in Ukraine since Russia's February 24, 2022 invasion, will take centre stage with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also attending and scheduled to meet with Biden, according to the White House.\n\nNo official from Russia has been invited, after Paris reversed plans to host lower-level representatives in recognition of the Soviet Union's immense contribution in World War II.\n\nThe most honoured guests will be the surviving veterans: some 200 are expected, a number that is dwindling every year with most at least in their late 90s and some over 100.\n\n'We won the war'\n\nBiden, Macron and Zelensky are coming together at a critical moment in the Ukraine conflict, with Kyiv warning that Russia risks gaining the upper hand without a significant increase in Western help.\n\nMacron has already sought to break taboos by refusing to rule out sending troops to Ukraine, a position that unsettled some EU allies.\n\nBut there have been shifts in recent weeks, with the West showing readiness to allow Ukraine to use Western-provided weapons to strike targets in Russia and France pushing for the deployment of European military instructors in Ukraine.\n\nMacron, who once sought to build a relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, has repeatedly warned about the existential nature of the Ukraine conflict for Europe, saying in a speech in April: \"Our Europe is mortal, it can die.\"\n\nWelcoming veterans as they arrived by air in Normandy, the French leader's wife Brigitte Macron expressed France's \"deepest respect and deepest love\", in a video posted on Macron's X account.\n\n\"I am glad we won the war,\" one told her. \"Oh yes we did\" she replied in English, clasping his hand fervently.\n\n'The longest

bullets, artillery and aircraft fire.\n\nThe landings marked the beginning of the end of the Nazi occupation of Europe, although months of intense and bloody fighting still lay ahead before victory over the regime of Adolf Hitler.\n\nThree days of ceremonies will see Macron pay tribute to French victims of Nazi occupation, including 70 members of the French Resistance executed by the Germans at Caen prison in Normandy on D-Day.\n\nThe 80th anniversary Thursday will see leaders attend national ceremonies at the vast war cemeteries on the Normandy coast, with an international ceremony attended by all the main guests at Omaha.\n\nOn Friday, Biden will give a speech at the Pointe du Hoc -- a clifftop promontory whose German bunkers were attacked by US troops in a daring assault during the landings -- on defending freedom and democracy.\n\nMacron will also give a keynote speech in Bayeux, the first French town to be liberated.\n\nBiden will continue the trip in Paris Saturday with the first state visit of his presidency to France, giving him and Macron a critical chance to push for peace in Ukraine and also the conflict in Gaza in talks at the Elysee Palace, before leaving France for the United States on Sunday.", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type":

prepared to join US President Joe Biden and King Charles III to mark 80 years since the World War II D-Day landings.\n\nThe three days of events in France, which will peak Thursday with ceremonies attended by world leaders on the Normandy beaches where the landings took place, are haunted by the new war shadowing Europe as Ukraine battles Russia's invasion.\n\nMacron will host Biden, King Charles III and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, representing the World War II Allied powers, to remember the heroism of the troops who gave their lives in the landings on June 6, 1944, to free Europe from Nazi occupation.\n\nThe most honoured guests will be the surviving veterans: Around 200 are expected, a number that is dwindling every year with most at least in their late 90s and some older than 100.\n\nBut with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky joining the Western leaders in Normandy, the ceremonies will provide a hugely symbolic backdrop to talks on how Ukraine can gain back ground after Russian advances.\n\nStrikingly, no Russian official has been invited, underlining Moscow's pariah status in the West after the invasion of Ukraine despite the massive USSR contribution to defeating Nazism in World War II.\n\n- 'Cherish those who served' -\n\nKicking off events with a ceremony in neighbouring Brittany to remember French resistance fighters who landed in occupied France as D-Day got under way, Macron said he was sure today's youth was \"ready for the same spirit of sacrifice as its elders\".\n\n\"As the dangers mount... you remind us that we are ready to consent to the same sacrifices to defend what is most dear to us,\" Macron said.\n\nKing Charles, whose visit to Normandy on Thursday will be his first overseas trip since his cancer diagnosis, led a day of commemorations in the English port city of Portsmouth, a key hub as Allied troops prepared for D-Day.\n\n\"As we give thanks for all those who gave so much to win the victory whose fruits we still enjoy to this day, let us once again commit ourselves always to remember, cherish and honour those who served that day,\" he said.\n\nWhile the sacrifice of Allied soldiers will be centre stage, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian President Sergio Mattarella will also be present in Normandy on Thursday as a sign of international post-World War II reconciliation.\n\nWelcoming veterans as they arrived by air in Normandy, the French leader's wife Brigitte Macron expressed France's \"deepest respect and deepest love\", in a video posted on Macron's X account.\n\n\"I am glad we won the war,\" one told her.\n\n\"Oh yes we did,\" she replied in English, clasping his hand fervently.\n\n- 'Deepen Ukraine support' -\n\nBiden, who touched down in Paris earlier Wednesday, was also expected to promote the United States as a defender of democracy and international alliances, contrasting himself against election rival Donald Trump during a state visit that will last until Sunday.\n\nOn Friday, Biden will give a speech on defending freedom and democracy at the Pointe du Hoc, a clifftop promontory whose German bunkers were attacked by US troops in a daring assault during the landings.\n\nUS National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters travelling to Paris that Biden would tell Zelensky \"how we can continue and deepen our support for Ukraine\".\n\nMacron has already sought to break taboos by refusing to rule out sending troops to Ukraine, a position that unsettled some EU allies.\n\nBut there have been shifts in recent weeks, with the West showing readiness to allow Ukraine to use Western-provided weapons to strike targets in Russia, and France pushing for the deployment of European military instructors in Ukraine.\n\nThe landings by Allied forces, backed by airborne operations that parachuted troops directly onto occupied soil, were the biggest naval operation ever in terms of the number of ships deployed and the troops involved.\n\nBy the end of what became known as \"the longest day\", 156,000 Allied troops with 20,000 vehicles had landed in Nazi-occupied northern France despite facing a hail of bullets, artillery and aircraft fire.\n\nThe landings marked the beginning of the end of the Nazi occupation of Europe, though months of intense and bloody fighting still lay ahead before victory over the regime of Adolf

"Biden in France to mark D-Day anniversary under Ukraine shadow", "body": "US President Joe Biden on Wednesday began a state visit to France marking 80 years since the World War II D-Day landings, with a new war shadowing Europe as Ukraine battles Russian invasion.\n\nAlong with French President Emmanuel Macron, British King Charles III and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Biden will on Thursday remember the heroism of the Allied troops who gave their lives often far from home in the landings on June 6, 1944 to free Europe from Nazi occupation.\n\nFor King Charles, it will be his first overseas visit since his cancer diagnosis.\n\nWhile the sacrifice of Allied soldiers will be centre stage, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian President Sergio Mattarella will also be present as a sign of international post-World-War-II reconciliation.\n\nFlying aboard Air Force One, Biden touched down at Paris Orly airport and was welcomed by Prime Minister Gabriel Attal.\n\nBiden was also expected to promote America as a defender of democracy and international alliances during his state visit that will last to Sunday, contrasting himself against election rival Donald Trump.\n\nBut the war that has raged in Ukraine since Russia's February 24, 2022 invasion, will take centre stage with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also attending and scheduled to meet with Biden, according to the White House.\n\nNo official from Russia has been invited, after Paris reversed plans to host lower-level representatives in recognition of the Soviet Union's immense contribution in World War II.\n\nThe most honoured guests will be the surviving veterans: some 200 are expected, a number that is dwindling every year with most at least in their late 90s and some over 100.\n\n- 'We won the war' -\n\nBiden, Macron and Zelensky are coming together at a critical moment in the Ukraine conflict, with Kyiv warning that Russia risks gaining the upper hand without a significant increase in Western help.\n\nMacron has already sought to break taboos by refusing to rule out sending troops to Ukraine, a position that unsettled some EU allies.\n\nBut there have been shifts in recent weeks, with the West showing readiness to allow Ukraine to use Western-provided weapons to strike targets in Russia and France pushing for the deployment of European military instructors in Ukraine.\n\nMore from this section 'Undermining Integrity Of India's Electoral Process'- Piyush Goyal Slams Opposition If this is the immigration election, who do you trust?, asks Patrick Christys Subway trains of Tokyu Oimachi line in Setagaya City, Tokyo - 4 Jun 2024 - 53717163\n\nMacron, who once sought to build a relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, has repeatedly warned about the existential nature of the Ukraine conflict for Europe, saying in a speech in April: \"Our Europe is mortal, it can die.\"\n\nWelcoming veterans as they arrived by air in Normandy, the French leader's wife Brigitte Macron expressed France's \"deepest respect and deepest love\", in a video posted on Macron's X account.\n\n\"I am glad we won the war,\" one told her. \"Oh yes we did\" she replied in English, clasping his hand fervently.\n\n- 'The longest day' -\n\nThe landings by Allied forces, backed by airborne operations that parachuted troops directly onto occupied soil, were the biggest naval operation ever in terms of the number of ships deployed and the troops involved.\n\nBy the end of what became known as \"the longest day\", 156,000 Allied troops with 20,000 vehicles had landed in Nazi-occupied northern France despite facing a hail of bullets, artillery and aircraft fire.\n\nThe landings marked the beginning of the end of the Nazi occupation of Europe, although months of intense and bloody fighting still lay ahead before victory over the regime of Adolf Hitler.\n\nThree days of ceremonies will see Macron pay tribute to French victims of Nazi occupation, including 70 members of the French Resistance executed by the Germans at Caen prison in Normandy on D-Day.\n\nThe 80th anniversary Thursday will see leaders attend national ceremonies at the vast war cemeteries on the Normandy coast, with an international ceremony attended by all the main guests at Omaha.\n\nOn Friday, Biden will give a speech at the Pointe du Hoc -- a clifftop promontory whose German bunkers were attacked by US troops in a daring assault during the landings -- on defending freedom and democracy.\n\nMacron will also give a keynote speech in Bayeux, the first French town to be liberated.\n\nBiden will continue the trip in Paris Saturday with the first state visit of his presidency to France, giving him and Macron a critical chance to push for peace in Ukraine and also the conflict in Gaza in talks at the Elysee Palace, before leaving France for the United States on Sunday.\n\nsjw/ah/jm", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news",

"title": "Macron lauds 'spirit of sacrifice' as D-Day marked under Ukraine shadow", "body": "The landings marked the beginning of the end of the Nazi occupation of Europe\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday hailed the \"spirit of sacrifice\" of the soldiers who liberated Europe from Nazi occupation, as he prepared to join US President Joe Biden and King Charles III to mark 80 years since the World War II D-Day landings.\n\nThe three days of events in France, which will peak Thursday with ceremonies attended by world leaders on the Normandy beaches where the landings took place, are haunted by the new war shadowing Europe as Ukraine battles Russia's invasion.\n\nMacron will host Biden, King Charles III and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, representing the World War II Allied powers, to remember the heroism of the troops who gave their lives in the landings on June 6, 1944, to free Europe from Nazi occupation.\n\nThe most honoured guests will be the surviving veterans: Around 200 are expected, a number that is dwindling every year with most at least in their late 90s and some older than 100.\n\nBut with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky joining the Western leaders in Normandy, the ceremonies will provide a hugely symbolic backdrop to talks on how Ukraine can gain back ground after Russian advances.\n\nStrikingly, no Russian official has been invited, underlining Moscow's pariah status in the West after the invasion of Ukraine despite the massive USSR contribution to defeating Nazism in World War II.\n\n- 'Cherish those who served' -\n\nKicking off events with a ceremony in neighbouring Brittany to remember French resistance fighters who landed in occupied France as D-Day got under way, Macron said he was sure today's youth was \"ready for the same spirit of sacrifice as its elders\".\n\n\"As the dangers mount... you remind us that we are ready to consent to the same sacrifices to defend what is most dear to us,\" Macron said.\n\nKing Charles, whose visit to Normandy on Thursday will be his first overseas trip since his cancer diagnosis, led a day of commemorations in the English port city of Portsmouth, a key hub as Allied troops prepared for D-Day.\n\n\"As we give thanks for all those who gave so much to win the victory whose fruits we still enjoy to this day, let us once again commit ourselves always to

will also be present in Normandy on Thursday as a sign of international post-World War II reconciliation.\n\nWelcoming veterans as they arrived by air in Normandy, the French leader's wife Brigitte Macron expressed France's \"deepest respect and deepest love\", in a video posted on Macron's X account.\n\nMore from this section Federal Firearm Trial Against Hunter Biden Opens in Delaware US:

Around 200 are expected, a number that is dwindling every year with most at least in their late 90s and some older than 100. This may be the final major anniversary where they are present.\n\n\"If I could go again, I would go again. I'm glad we sacrificed so that others (could) have a good life,\" John Mines, 99, who was among the first wave of soldiers on D-Day, told AFP on the ferry crossing the Channel to the events.\n\n\"It wasn't me, they're all heroes.\"\n\nBut with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky joining the Western leaders in Normandy, the ceremonies will provide a hugely symbolic backdrop to talks on how Ukraine can gain back ground after Russian advances.\n\nStrikingly, no Russian official has been invited, underlining Moscow's pariah status in the West after the invasion of Ukraine despite the massive Soviet contribution to defeating Nazism in World War II.\n\n- 'Cherish those who served' -\n\nKicking off events with a ceremony in the neighboring Brittany region to remember French resistance fighters who landed in occupied France as D-Day got under way, Macron said he was sure today's youth was \"ready for the same spirit of sacrifice as its elders\".\n\n\"As the dangers mount... you remind us that we are ready to consent to the same sacrifices to defend what is most dear to us,\" Macron said.\n\nCommitted to remembering all aspects of World War II, Macron later visited the Normandy town of Saint-Lo which was virtually flattened by Allied bombings during the night of 6-7 June leaving some 400 dead.\n\n\"We must bring this memory into the light with sadness and clarity,\" he said. Between 50,000 and 70,000 civilians are believed to have been killed in France by Allied bombardment.\n\nKing Charles, whose visit to Normandy on Thursday will be his first overseas trip since his cancer diagnosis, led a day of commemorations in the English port city of Portsmouth, a key hub as Allied troops prepared for D-Day.\n\n\"As we give thanks for all those who gave so much to win the victory whose fruits we still enjoy to this day, let us once again commit ourselves always to remember, cherish and honour those who served that day,\" he said.\n\n- 'Deepen Ukraine support' -\n\nBiden, who touched down in Paris earlier Wednesday, was also expected to promote the United States as a defender of democracy and international alliances, contrasting himself against election rival Donald Trump during a state visit that will last until Sunday.\n\nUS National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters traveling to Paris that Biden would tell Zelensky \"how we can continue and deepen our support for Ukraine\".\n\nMacron has already sought to break taboos by refusing to rule out sending troops to Ukraine, a position that unsettled some EU allies.\n\nBut there have been shifts in recent weeks, with the West showing readiness to allow Ukraine to use Western-provided weapons to strike targets in Russia, and France pushing for the deployment of European military instructors in Ukraine.\n\nThe landings by Allied forces, backed by airborne operations that parachuted troops directly onto occupied soil, were the biggest naval operation ever in terms of the number of ships deployed and the troops involved.\n\nBy the end of what became known as \"the longest day\", 156,000 Allied troops with 20,000 vehicles had landed in Nazi-occupied northern France despite facing a hail of bullets, artillery and aircraft fire.\n\nThe landings marked the beginning of the end of the Nazi occupation of Western Europe, though months of intense and bloody fighting

Ukraine Shadow", "body": "US President Joe Biden on Wednesday began a state visit to France marking 80 years since the World War II D-Day landings, with a new war shadowing Europe as Ukraine battles Russian invasion.\n\nAlong with French President Emmanuel Macron, British King Charles III and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Biden will on Thursday remember the heroism of the Allied troops who gave their lives often far from home in the landings on June 6, 1944 to free Europe from Nazi occupation.\n\nFor King Charles, it will be his first overseas visit since his cancer diagnosis.\n\nWhile the sacrifice of Allied soldiers will be centre stage, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian President Sergio Mattarella will also be present as a sign of international post-World-War-II reconciliation.\n\nFlying aboard Air Force One, Biden touched down at Paris Orly airport and was welcomed by Prime Minister Gabriel Attal.\n\nBiden was also expected to promote America as a defender of democracy and international alliances during his state visit that will last to Sunday, contrasting himself against election rival Donald Trump.\n\nBut the war that has raged in Ukraine since Russia's February 24, 2022 invasion, will take centre stage with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also attending and scheduled to meet with Biden, according to the White House.\n\nNo official from Russia has been invited, after Paris reversed plans to host lower-level representatives in recognition of the Soviet Union's immense contribution in World War II.\n\nThe most honoured guests will be the surviving veterans: some 200 are expected, a number that is dwindling every year with most at least in their late 90s and some over 100.\n\nBiden, Macron and Zelensky are coming together at a critical moment in the Ukraine conflict, with Kyiv warning that Russia risks gaining the upper hand without a significant increase in Western help.\n\nMacron has already sought to break taboos by refusing to rule out sending troops to Ukraine, a position that unsettled some EU allies.\n\nBut there have been shifts in recent weeks, with the West showing readiness to allow Ukraine to use Western-provided weapons to strike targets in Russia and France pushing for the deployment of European military instructors in Ukraine.\n\nMacron, who once sought to build a relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, has repeatedly warned about the existential nature of the Ukraine conflict for Europe, saying in a speech in April: \"Our Europe is mortal, it can die.\"\n\nWelcoming veterans as they arrived by air in Normandy, the French leader's wife Brigitte Macron expressed France's \"deepest respect and deepest love\", in a video posted on Macron's X account.\n\n\"I am glad we won the war,\" one told her. \"Oh yes we did\" she replied in English, clasping his hand fervently.\n\nThe landings by Allied forces, backed by airborne operations that parachuted troops directly onto occupied soil, were the biggest naval operation ever in terms of the number of ships deployed and the troops involved.\n\nBy the end of what became known as \"the longest day\", 156,000 Allied troops with 20,000 vehicles had landed in Nazi-occupied northern France despite facing a hail of bullets, artillery and aircraft fire.\n\nThe landings marked the beginning of the end of the Nazi occupation of Europe, although months of intense and bloody fighting still lay ahead before victory over the regime of Adolf Hitler.\n\nThree days of ceremonies will see Macron pay tribute to French victims of Nazi occupation, including 70 members of the French Resistance executed by the Germans at Caen prison in Normandy on D-Day.\n\nThe 80th anniversary Thursday will see leaders attend national ceremonies at the vast war cemeteries on the Normandy coast, with an international ceremony attended by all the main guests at Omaha.\n\nOn Friday, Biden will give a speech at the Pointe du Hoc -- a clifftop promontory whose German bunkers were attacked by US troops in a daring assault during the landings -- on defending freedom and democracy.\n\nMacron will also give a keynote speech in Bayeux, the first French town to be liberated.\n\nBiden will continue the trip in Paris Saturday with the first state visit of his presidency to France, giving him and Macron a critical chance to push for peace in Ukraine and also the conflict in Gaza in talks at the Elysee Palace, before leaving France for the United States on Sunday.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com.au",

Around 200 are expected, a number that is dwindling every year with most at least in their late 90s and some older than 100. This may be the final major anniversary where they are present.\n\n\"If I could go again, I would go again. I'm glad we sacrificed so that others (could) have a good life,\" John Mines, 99, who was among the first wave of soldiers on D-Day, told AFP on the ferry crossing the Channel to the events.\n\n\"They're all heroes.\"\n\nKicking off events with a ceremony in the neighbouring Brittany region to remember French resistance fighters who landed in occupied France as D-Day got under way, Macron said he was sure today's youth was \"ready for the same spirit of sacrifice as its elders\".\n\n\"As the dangers mount... you remind us that we are ready to consent to the same sacrifices to defend what is most dear to us,\" Macron said.\n\nKing Charles, whose visit to Normandy on Thursday will be his first overseas trip since his cancer diagnosis, led a day of commemorations in the English port city of Portsmouth, a key hub as Allied troops prepared for D-Day.\n\n\"As we give thanks for all those who gave so much to win the victory whose fruits we still enjoy to this day, let us once again commit ourselves always to remember, cherish and honour those who served that day,\" he said.\n\nIn an operation kept secret from the Germans, the Allies landed on five beaches spread across the Normandy coast: Omaha and Utah for the Americans, Gold and Sword for the British and Juno for the British and Canadians.\n\nSeparate national ceremonies will be held before most of the leaders come together for an international ceremony from 1400 GMT at Omaha joined by Zelensky and also German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\n\nBiden, who touched down in Paris earlier Wednesday, was also expected to promote the United States as a defender of democracy and international alliances, contrasting himself against election rival Donald Trump during a state visit that will last until Sunday.\n\nUS National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters travelling to Paris that Biden would tell Zelensky \"how we can continue and deepen our support for Ukraine\".\n\nMacron has already sought to break taboos by refusing to rule out sending troops to Ukraine, a position that unsettled some EU allies.\n\nBut there have been shifts in recent weeks, with the West showing

occupied France as D-Day got under way, Macron said he was sure today's youth was \"ready for the same spirit of sacrifice as its elders\".\n\n\"As the dangers mount... you remind us that we are ready to consent to the same sacrifices to defend what is most dear to us,\" Macron said.\n\nKing Charles, whose visit to Normandy on Thursday will be his first overseas trip since his cancer diagnosis, led a day of commemorations in the English port city of Portsmouth, a key hub as Allied troops prepared for D-Day.\n\nMore from this section Record highs expected to fall as Southwest US bakes in first

victory whose fruits we still enjoy to this day, let us once again commit ourselves always to remember, cherish and honour those who served that day,\" he said.\n\nIn an operation kept secret from the Germans, the Allies landed on five beaches spread across the Normandy coast: Omaha and Utah for the Americans, Gold and Sword for the British and Juno for the British and Canadians.\n\nSeparate national ceremonies will be held before most of the leaders come together for an international ceremony from 1400 GMT at Omaha joined by Zelensky and also German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\n\n- 'Deepen Ukraine support' -\n\nBiden, who touched down in Paris earlier Wednesday, was also expected to promote the United States as a defender of democracy and international alliances, contrasting himself against election rival Donald Trump during a state visit that will last until Sunday.\n\nUS National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters travelling to Paris that Biden would tell Zelensky \"how we can continue and deepen our support for Ukraine\".\n\nMacron has already sought to break taboos by refusing to rule out sending troops to Ukraine, a position that unsettled some EU allies.\n\nBut there have been shifts in recent weeks, with the West showing readiness to allow Ukraine to use Western-provided weapons to strike targets in Russia, and France pushing for the deployment of European military instructors in Ukraine.\n\nThe landings by Allied forces, backed by airborne operations that parachuted troops directly onto occupied soil, were the biggest naval operation ever in terms of the number of ships deployed and the troops involved.\n\nBy the end of what became known as \"the longest day\", 156,000 Allied troops with 20,000 vehicles had landed in Nazi-occupied northern France despite facing a hail of bullets, artillery and aircraft fire.\n\nThe landings marked the beginning of the end of the Nazi occupation of Western Europe, though months of

a day of commemorations in the English port city of Portsmouth, a key hub as Allied troops prepared for D-Day.\n\n\"As we give thanks for all those who gave so much to win the victory whose fruits we

rival Donald Trump during a state visit that will last until Sunday.\n\nUS National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters travelling to Paris that Biden would tell Zelensky \"how we can continue and deepen our support for Ukraine\".\n\nMacron has already sought to break taboos by refusing to rule out sending troops to Ukraine, a position that unsettled some EU allies.\n\nBut there have been shifts in recent weeks, with the West showing readiness to allow Ukraine to use Western-provided weapons to strike targets in Russia, and France pushing for the deployment of European military instructors in Ukraine.\n\nThe landings by Allied forces, backed by airborne operations that parachuted troops directly onto occupied soil, were the biggest naval operation ever in terms of

least in their late 90s and some older than 100.\n\nBut with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky joining the Western leaders in Normandy, the ceremonies will provide a hugely symbolic backdrop to talks on how Ukraine can gain back ground after Russian advances.\n\nStrikingly, no Russian official has been invited, underlining Moscow's pariah status in the West after the invasion of Ukraine despite the massive USSR contribution to defeating Nazism in World War II.\n\n'Cherish those who served'\n\nKicking off events with a ceremony in neighbouring Brittany to remember French resistance fighters who landed in occupied France as D-Day got under way, Macron said he was sure today's youth was \"ready for the same spirit of sacrifice as its elders\".\n\n\"As the dangers mount... you remind us that we are ready to consent to the same sacrifices to defend what is most dear to us,\" Macron said.\n\nKing Charles, whose visit to Normandy on Thursday will be his first overseas trip since his cancer diagnosis, led a day of commemorations in the English port city of Portsmouth, a key hub as Allied troops prepared for D-Day.\n\n\"As we give thanks for all those who gave so much to win the victory whose fruits we still enjoy to this day, let us once again commit ourselves always to remember, cherish and honour those who served that day,\" he said.\n\nWhile the sacrifice of Allied soldiers will be centre stage, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian President Sergio Mattarella will also be present in Normandy on Thursday as a sign of international post-World War II reconciliation.\n\nWelcoming veterans as they arrived by air in Normandy, the French leader's wife Brigitte Macron expressed France's \"deepest respect and deepest love\", in a video posted on Macron's X account.\n\n\"I am glad we won the war,\" one told her.\n\n\"Oh yes we did,\" she replied in English, clasping his hand fervently.\n\n'Deepen Ukraine support'\n\nBiden, who touched down in Paris earlier Wednesday, was also expected to promote the United States as a defender of democracy and international alliances, contrasting himself against election rival Donald Trump during a state visit that will last until Sunday.\n\nOn Friday, Biden will give a speech on defending freedom and democracy at the Pointe du Hoc, a clifftop promontory whose German bunkers were attacked by US troops in a daring assault during the landings.\n\nUS National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters travelling to Paris that Biden would tell Zelensky \"how we can continue and deepen our support for Ukraine\".\n\nMacron has already sought to break taboos by refusing to rule out sending troops to Ukraine, a position that unsettled some EU allies.\n\nBut there have been shifts in recent weeks, with the West showing readiness to allow Ukraine to use Western-provided weapons to strike targets in Russia, and France pushing for the deployment of European military instructors in Ukraine.\n\nThe landings by Allied forces, backed by airborne operations that parachuted troops directly onto occupied soil, were the biggest naval operation ever in terms of the number of ships deployed and the troops involved.\n\nRead moreHow D-Day commemorations became the stage for diplomacy and geopolitics\n\nBy the end of what became known as \"the longest day\", 156,000 Allied troops with 20,000 vehicles had landed in Nazi-occupied northern France despite facing a hail of bullets, artillery and aircraft fire.\n\nThe landings marked the beginning of the end of the Nazi occupation of Europe,

It is threatened by aggressors who want to redraw borders,\" he said at the Canadian ceremony in nearby Courseulles-Sur-Mer. \"Our way of life did not happen by accident, and it won't continue without effort.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Obligation to remember'\n\nWith Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy joining the Western leaders in Normandy for an international ceremony, the events provided a hugely symbolic backdrop to talks on how Kyiv can gain back ground after Russian advances.\n\nNo Russian official has been invited, underlining Moscow's pariah status in the West after the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, despite the decisive Soviet contribution to defeating Nazism in World War II.\n\nThe most honored guests are surviving veterans. About 200 are expected -- a number that is dwindling every year, with most at least in their late 90s and some older than 100. This may be the final major anniversary where they are present.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBritish veteran Cecil Newton, who spoke to Agence France-Presse (AFP) at the British Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer, said he was upset that so many young men were killed.\n\n\"All those who were in action will always be with me, with us. I can see them now,\" said Newton, 100.\n\nKing Charles noted that veterans were becoming ever fewer in number, but added: \"Our obligation to remember them, what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, attending the British ceremony, said: \"Nobody here in France can forget your sacrifice.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden meets veterans\n\nBiden, born in 1942 during World War II, was expected to promote the US as a defender of democracy and international alliances, contrasting himself against predecessor and election rival Donald Trump during a state visit that will last until Sunday.\n\nHe was meeting surviving American veterans one by one at the American memorial to its victims.\n\nMacron has already sought to break taboos by refusing to rule out sending troops to Ukraine, a position that unsettled some European Union allies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there have been shifts in recent weeks, with the West showing readiness to allow Ukraine to use Western-provided weapons to strike targets in Russia, and France pushing for the deployment of European military instructors in Ukraine.\n\nThe landings by Allied forces, backed by airborne operations that parachuted troops directly onto occupied soil, were the biggest naval operation ever in terms of the number of ships deployed and the troops involved.\n\nIn an operation kept secret from the Germans, the Allies landed on five beaches spread across the Normandy coast: Omaha and Utah for the Americans, Gold and Sword for the British, and Juno for the British and Canadians.\n\nBy the end of what became known as \"the longest day,\" 156,000 Allied troops with 20,000 vehicles had landed in Nazi-occupied northern France despite facing a hail of bullets, artillery and aircraft fire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe landings marked the beginning of the end of the Nazi occupation of Western Europe, though months of intense and bloody fighting still lay ahead before victory over the regime of Adolf Hitler.", "source": {"uri": "manilatimes.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Manila times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

without effort.\"\n\nBiden, born in 1942 during World War II, was expected to promote the United States as a defender of democracy and international alliances, contrasting himself against election rival Donald Trump during a state visit that will last until Sunday.\n\nHe met surviving American veterans at the American memorial. \"The greatest generation ever, man,\" he told one veteran, adding he could not believe he was 102.\n\nIn an operation kept secret from the Germans, the Allies landed on five beaches spread across the Normandy coast: Omaha and Utah for the Americans, Gold and Sword for the British and Juno for the British and Canadians.\n\nBy the end of what became known as \"the longest day\", 156,000 Allied troops with 20,000 vehicles had landed in Nazi-occupied northern France despite facing a hail of bullets, artillery and aircraft fire.\n\nThe landings marked the beginning of the end of the Nazi occupation of Western Europe, though months of intense and bloody

It is threatened by aggressors who want to redraw borders,\" he said at the Canadian ceremony in nearby Courseulles-Sur-Mer.\n\n\"Our way of life did not happen by accident, and it won't continue without effort.\"\n\n'Obligation to remember'\n\nWith Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky joining the Western leaders in Normandy for an international ceremony, the events will provide a hugely symbolic backdrop to talks on how Ukraine can gain back ground after Russian advances.\n\nNo Russian official has been invited, underlining Moscow's pariah status in the West after the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 despite the decisive Soviet contribution to defeating Nazism in World War II.\n\nThe most honored guests are surviving veterans. Around 200 are expected, a number that is dwindling every year with most at least in their late 90s and some older than 100. This may be the final major anniversary where they are present.\n\nBritish veteran Cecil Newton, who spoke to AFP at the British Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer, said he was upset that so many young men were killed.\n\n\"All those who were in action will always be with me, with us. I can see them now,\" Newton, 100, said.\n\nKing Charles noted that veterans were becoming ever fewer in number but added: \"Our obligation to remember them, what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, attending the British ceremony, added: \"Nobody here in France can forget your sacrifice.\"\n\n'Shying away'\n\nBiden, born in 1942 during World War II, was expected to promote the United States as a defender of democracy and international alliances, contrasting himself against election rival Donald Trump during a state visit that will last until Sunday.\n\nHe was meeting surviving American veterans one-by-one at the American memorial to its victims.\n\nMacron has already sought to break taboos by refusing to rule out sending troops to Ukraine, a position that unsettled some EU allies.\n\nBut there have been shifts in recent weeks, with the West showing readiness to allow Ukraine to use Western-provided weapons to strike targets in Russia, and France pushing for the deployment of European military instructors in Ukraine.\n\nDuring a meeting with foreign news outlets in Saint Petersburg on Wednesday evening, Putin shrugged off the lack of an invitation for Russia, saying \"let them celebrate without us.\"\n\n\"They are shying away from inviting Russia, which is the legal successor of the Soviet Union, which has sustained such huge losses,\" he said, stressing that the Soviet Union lost around 27 million civilians and soldiers in World War II.\n\nThe landings by Allied forces, backed by airborne operations that parachuted troops directly onto occupied soil, were the biggest naval operation ever in terms of the number of ships deployed and the troops involved.\n\nIn an operation kept secret from the Germans, the Allies landed on five beaches spread across the Normandy coast: Omaha and Utah for the Americans, Gold and Sword for the British and Juno for the British and Canadians.\n\nBy the end of what became known as \"the longest day\", 156,000 Allied troops with 20,000 vehicles had landed in Nazi-occupied northern France despite facing a hail of bullets, artillery and aircraft fire.\n\nThe landings marked the beginning of the end of the Nazi occupation of Western Europe, though months of intense and bloody fighting still lay ahead before victory over the regime of Adolf Hitler.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of America"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type":

It is threatened by aggressors who want to redraw borders,\" he said at the Canadian ceremony in nearby Courseulles-Sur-Mer.\n\n\"Our way of life did not happen by accident, and it won't continue without effort.\"\n\n- 'Obligation to remember' -\n\nWith Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky joining the Western leaders in Normandy for an international ceremony, the events will provide a hugely symbolic backdrop to talks on how Ukraine can gain back ground after Russian advances.\n\nNo Russian official has been invited, underlining Moscow's pariah status in the West after the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 despite the decisive Soviet contribution to defeating Nazism in World War II.\n\nThe most honoured guests are surviving veterans. Around 200 are expected, a number that is dwindling every year with most at least in their late 90s and some older than 100. This may be the final major anniversary where they are present.\n\nBritish veteran Cecil Newton, who spoke to AFP at the British Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer, said he was upset that so many young men were killed.\n\n\"All those who were in action will always be with me, with us. I can see them now,\" Newton, 100, said.\n\nMore from this section China: Woman Enjoys Hot Pot In The Midst Of Torrential Rainstorm In Chongqing 'We have to take action': Texas mayor on Biden asylum restrictions for migrants at US border Bronx officials to address community feedback on future of Cross Bronx Expressway\n\nKing Charles noted that veterans were becoming ever fewer in number but added: \"Our obligation to remember them, what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, attending the British ceremony, added: \"Nobody here in France can forget your sacrifice.\"\n\n- 'Shying away' -\n\nBiden, born in 1942 during World War II, was expected to promote the United States as a defender of democracy and international alliances, contrasting himself against election rival Donald Trump during a state visit that will last until Sunday.\n\nHe was meeting surviving American veterans one-by-one at the American memorial to its victims.\n\nMacron has already sought to break taboos by refusing to rule out sending troops to Ukraine, a position that unsettled some EU allies.\n\nBut there have been shifts in recent weeks, with the West showing readiness to allow Ukraine to use Western-provided weapons to strike targets in Russia, and France pushing for the deployment of European military instructors in Ukraine.\n\nDuring a meeting with foreign news outlets in Saint Petersburg on Wednesday evening, Putin shrugged off the lack of an invitation for Russia, saying \"let them celebrate without us\".\n\n\"They are shying away from inviting Russia, which is the legal successor of the Soviet Union, which has sustained such huge losses,\" he said, stressing that the Soviet Union lost around 27 million civilians and soldiers in World War II.\n\nThe landings by Allied forces, backed by airborne operations that parachuted troops directly onto occupied soil, were the biggest naval operation ever in terms of the number of ships deployed and the troops involved.\n\nIn an operation kept secret from the Germans, the Allies landed on five beaches spread across the Normandy coast: Omaha and Utah for the Americans, Gold and Sword for the British and Juno for the British and Canadians.\n\nBy the end of what became known as \"the longest day\", 156,000 Allied troops with 20,000 vehicles had landed in Nazi-occupied northern France despite facing a hail of bullets, artillery and aircraft fire.\n\nThe landings marked the beginning of the end of the Nazi occupation of Western Europe, though months of intense and bloody fighting still lay ahead before victory over the regime of Adolf Hitler.\n\nbur-sjw/as", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It is threatened by aggressors who want to redraw borders,\" he said at the Canadian ceremony in nearby Courseulles-Sur-Mer.\n\n\"Our way of life did not happen by accident, and it won't continue without effort.\"\n\nWith Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky joining the Western leaders in Normandy for an international ceremony, the events will provide a hugely symbolic backdrop to talks on how Ukraine can gain back ground after Russian advances.\n\nNo Russian official has been invited, underlining Moscow's pariah status in the West after the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 despite the decisive Soviet contribution to defeating Nazism in World War II.\n\nThe most honoured guests are surviving veterans. Around 200 are expected, a number that is dwindling every year with most at least in their late 90s and some older than 100. This may be the final major anniversary where they are present.\n\nBritish veteran Cecil Newton, who spoke to AFP at the British Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer, said he was upset that so many young men were killed.\n\n\"All those who were in action will always be with me, with us. I can see them now,\" Newton, 100, said.\n\nKing Charles noted that veterans were becoming ever fewer in number but added: \"Our obligation to remember them, what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, attending the British ceremony, added: \"Nobody here in France can forget your sacrifice.\"\n\nMacron has already sought to break taboos by refusing to rule out sending troops to Ukraine, a position that unsettled some EU allies.\n\nBut there have been shifts in recent weeks, with the West showing readiness to allow Ukraine to use Western-provided weapons to strike targets in Russia, and France pushing for the deployment of European military instructors in Ukraine.\n\nDuring a meeting with foreign news outlets in Saint Petersburg on Wednesday evening, Putin shrugged off the lack of an invitation for Russia, saying \"let them celebrate without us\".\n\n\"They are shying away from inviting Russia, which is the legal successor of the Soviet Union, which has sustained such huge losses,\" he said, stressing that the Soviet Union lost around 27 million civilians and soldiers in World War II.\n\nThe landings by Allied forces, backed by airborne operations that parachuted troops directly onto occupied soil, were the biggest naval operation ever in terms of the number of ships deployed and the troops involved.\n\nIn an operation kept secret from the Germans, the Allies landed on five beaches spread across the Normandy coast: Omaha and Utah for the Americans, Gold and Sword for the British and Juno for the British and Canadians.\n\nBy the end of what became known as \"the longest day\", 156,000 Allied troops with 20,000 vehicles had landed in Nazi-occupied northern France despite facing a hail of bullets, artillery and aircraft fire.\n\nThe landings marked the beginning of the end of the Nazi occupation of Western Europe, though months of intense and bloody fighting still lay ahead before victory over

I can see them now,\" Newton, 100, said.\n\nKing Charles noted that veterans were becoming fewer, adding: \"Our obligation to remember them, what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, attending the British ceremony, added: \"Nobody here in France can forget your sacrifice.\"\n\nAt the US ceremony attended by Macron and Biden, a number of veterans managed to rise from their wheelchairs to salute the colours, with help from their carers.\n\nBut the events also provide a hugely symbolic backdrop to talks on how Ukraine can gain back ground after Russian advances.\n\n\"This event and day serve as a reminder of the courage and determination demonstrated in the pursuit of freedom and democracy. Allies defended Europe's freedom then, and Ukrainians do so now. Unity prevailed then, and true unity can prevail today,\" Zelensky said in a post on X, announcing his arrival.\n\nMore from this section US health experts vote against MDMA as treatment for PTSD Libertarian presidential candidate makes his case for the White House NYPD officers with ties to LI return home after being shot in the line of duty\n\nMacron has already sought to break taboos by refusing to rule out sending troops to Ukraine, a position that unsettled some European Union allies.\n\nBut there have been shifts in recent weeks, with the West showing readiness to allow Ukraine to use weapons provided by them to strike targets in Russia, and France pushing for the deployment of European military instructors in Ukraine.\n\nNo Russian official has been invited, underlining Moscow's current pariah status despite the decisive Soviet contribution to defeating Nazism in World War II.\n\nDuring a meeting with foreign news outlets in Saint Petersburg on Wednesday evening, President Vladimir Putin shrugged off the lack of an invitation for Russia, saying \"let them celebrate without us\".\n\n- 'The greatest generation ever' -\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the world must continue to stand up for democracy.\n\n\"Democracy is still under threat today. It is threatened by aggressors who want to redraw borders,\" he said at the Canadian ceremony in nearby Courseulles-Sur-Mer.\n\n\"Our way of life did not happen by accident, and it won't continue without effort.\"\n\nBiden, born in 1942 during World War II, was expected to promote the United States as a defender of democracy and international alliances, contrasting himself against election rival Donald Trump during a state visit that will last until Sunday.\n\nHe met surviving American veterans at the American memorial. \"The greatest generation ever, man,\" he told one veteran, adding he could not believe he was 102.\n\nIn an operation kept secret from the Germans, the Allies landed on five beaches spread across the Normandy coast: Omaha and Utah for the Americans, Gold and Sword for the British and Juno for the British and Canadians.\n\nBy the end of what became known as \"the longest day\", 156,000 Allied troops with 20,000 vehicles had landed in Nazi-occupied northern France despite facing a hail of bullets, artillery and aircraft fire.\n\nThe landings marked the beginning of the end of the Nazi occupation of Western Europe, though months of intense and bloody fighting still lay ahead before victory over the regime of Adolf Hitler.\n\nbur-sjw/as/ach", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Unity prevailed then, and true unity can prevail today,\" he said in a post on X.\n\nThe biggest guests of honour were some 200 surviving veterans in their late 90s or even over 100, some in wheelchairs, huddled in blankets as they gazed over the shores.\n\n\"We recall the lesson that comes to us, again and again, across the decades: free nations must stand together to oppose tyranny,\" King Charles III said at the British memorial at Ver-sur-Mer that overlooks Gold beach, one of the landing sites for British troops.\n\n\"Let us pray such sacrifice need never be made again,\" he said.\n\nHe also noted that veterans were becoming fewer, adding: \"Our obligation to remember them, what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nThe events also provide a hugely symbolic backdrop to talks on how Ukraine can gain back ground after Russian advances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMacron has already sought to break taboos by refusing to rule out sending troops to Ukraine, a position that unsettled some European Union allies.\n\nBut there have been shifts in recent weeks, with the West showing readiness to allow Ukraine to use weapons provided by them to strike targets in Russia, and France pushing for the deployment of European military instructors in Ukraine.\n\nNo Russian official has been invited, underlining Moscow's current pariah status despite the decisive Soviet contribution to defeating Nazism in World War II.\n\nDuring a meeting with foreign news outlets in Saint Petersburg on Wednesday evening, President Vladimir Putin shrugged off the lack of an invitation for Russia, saying \"let them celebrate without us\".\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the world must continue to stand up for democracy.\n\n\"Democracy is still under threat today. It is threatened by aggressors who want to redraw borders,\" he said at the Canadian ceremony in nearby Courseulles-Sur-Mer.\n\n\"Our way of life did not happen by accident, and it won't continue without effort.\"\n\nBiden, born in 1942 during World War II, was expected to promote the United States as a defender of democracy and international alliances, contrasting himself against election rival Donald Trump during a state visit that will last until Sunday.\n\nHe met surviving American veterans at the American memorial. \"The greatest generation ever, man,\" he told one veteran, adding he could not believe he was 102.\n\nIn an operation kept secret from the Germans, the Allies landed on five beaches spread across the Normandy coast: Omaha and Utah for the Americans, Gold and Sword for the British and Juno for the British and Canadians.\n\nBy the end of what became known as \"the longest day\", 156,000 Allied troops with 20,000 vehicles had landed in Nazi-occupied northern France despite facing a hail of bullets, artillery and aircraft fire.\n\nThe landings marked the beginning of the end of the Nazi occupation of Western Europe, though months of intense and bloody fighting still lay ahead before victory over the regime of Adolf Hitler.", "source": {"uri": "thejournal.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheJournal.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri":

recognition of the Soviet Union's immense contribution in World War II.\n\nBiden's trip is also designed to underscore his commitment to US allies in Europe and contrast his vision of democracy with his 2024 political opponent Donald Trump.\n\nHe will mark the first state visit of his presidency to France on Saturday during talks at the Elys\u00e9e Palace with Macron, before leaving on Sunday.",

Commemorations as Ukraine Shadow Looms Large", "body": "The sacrifice of Allied soldiers will be centre stage however German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian President Sergio Mattarella will attend as a sign of international post-World-War-II reconciliation, the AFP report details.\n\nAs the great and the good honor those who paid the highest price for freedom 80 years ago, the war that has raged in Ukraine since Russia's February 24, 2022 invasion will take centre stage with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also attending and scheduled to meet with Biden, according to the White House.\n\nNo official from Russia has been invited, after Paris reversed plans to host lower-level representatives in recognition of the Soviet Union's immense contribution in World War II.\n\nThe most honoured guests will be the surviving veterans: some 200 are expected, a number that is dwindling every year with most at least in their late 90s and some over 100.\n\nThe 80th anniversary Thursday will see leaders attend national ceremonies at the vast war cemeteries on the Normandy coast, with an international ceremony attended by all the main guests at Omaha.\n\nOn Friday, Biden will give a speech at the Pointe du Hoc -- a clifftop promontory whose German bunkers were attacked by U.S. troops in a daring assault during the landings -- on defending freedom and democracy, as Breitbart News reports.\n\nBiden's address will focus on Russia at a moment when U.S. weapons could be used, for the first time, by Ukrainian forces to attack targets inside Russian territory -- an escalation that could widen the war beyond its current frontier.\n\nIn 2021, his first year in the Oval Office, President Biden failed to mention D-Day, spotlighting the Tulsa Race Riots instead, as Joel Pollak of Breitbart News noted.\n\nMacron will also give a keynote speech in Bayeux, the first French town to be liberated.\n\nBiden will continue the trip in Paris Saturday with the first state visit of his presidency to France, giving him and Macron a critical chance to push for peace in Ukraine and also the conflict in Gaza in talks at the Elysee Palace.\n\nBiden departs France for the United States on Sunday.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_kent@breitbart.com", "name": "Simon Kent", "type": "author",

Unity prevailed then, and true unity can prevail today,\" Zelensky said in a post on X.\n\nArriving at the ceremony he shook hands with wheelchair-bound veterans, bowing down in respect to them.\n\n- 'Oppose tyranny' -\n\nCanada's Trudeau said democracy was \"threatened by aggressors who want to redraw borders\".\n\n\"Our way of life did not happen by accident,\" he said at the Canadian ceremony.\n\nThe biggest guests of honour were some 180 surviving veterans in their late 90s or even over 100, some in wheelchairs and huddled in blankets as they gazed over the shores.\n\nMacron attended the British ceremony\n\nMacron awarded a dozen of them France's highest honour, the Legion d'Honneur.\n\nKing Charles III at the British memorial at Ver-sur-Mer that overlooks Gold beach, one of the landing sites for British troops, said: \"Our gratitude is unfailing and our admiration eternal.\"\n\n\"Free nations must stand together to oppose tyranny,\" he said. \"Let us pray such sacrifice need never be made again.\"\n\n- 'Can never diminish' -\n\nBritish veteran Cecil Newton said he was upset that so many young men were killed.\n\n\"All those who were in action will always be with me, with us. I can see them now,\" Newton, 100, said.\n\nBritain's Queen Camilla and King Charles III at the ceremony\n\nKing Charles noted that veterans were becoming fewer, adding: \"Our obligation to remember them, what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nTwo veterans were unable to make it to France.\n\nWilliam Cameron, a 100-year-old Canadian veteran, had packed his bags weeks in advance but died just before he was to return to France, while 102-year-old Robert Persichitti from the United States died on a ship en route to the ceremony.\n\nCeremonies were also sprinkled with stardust with film director Steven Spielberg and actor Tom Hanks present in acknowledgement of their classic 1998 film \"Saving Private Ryan\" about D-Day.\n\nFor the British ceremony, veteran crooner Tom Jones and popular folk singer and actor Johnny Flynn provided music.\n\nNo Russian official has been invited, underlining Moscow's current pariah status despite the decisive Soviet contribution to defeating Nazism in World War II.\n\nZelensky's presence was a potent symbol\n\nDuring a meeting with foreign news outlets in Saint Petersburg late Wednesday, Putin shrugged off the lack of an invitation for Russia, saying \"let them celebrate without us\".", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Russia, as a former ally against Nazi Germany, was not invited because of the war in Ukraine.\n\nAbout four thousand people attend the commemoration, among them more than 200 veterans - Americans, British, Canadians and French - the last surviving witnesses of that era, which will probably be the last major ceremony in Normandy in their presence.\n\nMore than 150,000 Allied troops launched the air, sea and land landings in Normandy on June 6, 1944, an operation that ultimately led to the liberation of Western Europe from Nazi Germany.\n\nGreat Britain also marked D-Day in Portsmouth, which was the main departure point for the five thousand ships that headed for Normandy 80 years ago.", "source": {"uri": "b92.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "B92"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_Scholz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olaf Scholz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Normandy"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Normandy"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portsmouth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portsmouth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Fascism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Fascism", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Undeveloped_or_Vacant", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Undeveloped or Vacant", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://www.b92.net/data/images/2024-03-01/1804_102418375065759ef926045899549097-v4-big_f.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626321", "eventUri": "eng-9626321", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

It laid the foundations for the Allied victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, with Biden calling it a \"powerful illustration of how alliances, real alliances make us stronger.\"\n\nBritain's King Charles III and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also attended the memorials in Normandy, representing the major Allied powers that took part in the military operation.\n\n\"We recall the lesson that comes to us, again and again, across the decades: free nations must stand together to oppose tyranny,\" Charles said.\n\nThey were joined by around 200 surviving veterans.\n\nBiden used the opportunity to underscore Washington's support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression.\n\n\"We will not walk away because if we do Ukraine will be subjugated and it will not end there,\" Biden said.\n\n\"Ukraine's neighbors will be threatened, all of Europe will be threatened.\"\n\nBiden described Russian President Vladimir Putin as a \"tyrant bent on domination.\"\n\n\"To surrender to bullies, to bow down to dictators, is simply unthinkable,\" he added.\n\n\"If we were to do that, it means we'd be forgetting what happened here on these hallowed beaches.\"\n\nWorld leaders attended a number of other events held on both sides of the English Channel to honor those who sacrificed their lives 80 years ago.\n\nAt a ceremony for Canadian soldiers held on Juno Beach in Normandy, French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said his country's gratitude was \"eternal.\"\n\n\"France will never forget those who died for her,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron awarded 11 US veterans and one British veteran with France's highest distinction, the Legion of Honor.\n\n\"You are back here today at home, if I may say,\" he said in English to the veterans, who are now aged between 98 and 104 years old.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the soldiers' courage paved the way for freedom and democracy in his own country.\n\n\"Their courage gave us Germans the chance of a

If you want to know the price of freedom, come here to Normandy,\" President Biden said during a three-hour ceremony honoring those killed in the Normandy invasion as well as living veterans.\n\n\"Democracy is never guaranteed. Every generation must preserve it, defend it, and fight for it. That's the test of the ages,\" President Biden said. \"In memory of those who fought here, died here, and literally saved the world here, let us be worthy of their sacrifice.\"\n\nDuring his speech, President Biden underscored the value of strong alliances and partnerships, including NATO.\n\n\"Isolation was not the answer 80 years ago, and is not the answer today,\" he said.\n\nThe president was accompanied by First Lady Jill Biden as well as French President Emmanuel Macron and First Lady Brigitte Macron.\n\nFollowing the ceremony at the Normandy American Cemetery, the president is scheduled to attend an international ceremony joining nearly 15 world leaders, including Mr. Macron, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\n\nPresident Biden arrived in France on June 5, kicking off a five-day trip. Following the ceremonies in Normandy on June 6-7, the president will participate in a state visit hosted by Mr. Macron.\n\nThe president will give another speech on June 7 at Pointe du Hoc, France, underscoring the significance of safeguarding freedom and democracy. The president is expected to use the D-Day commemorations as an opportunity to target former President Donald Trump during a contentious election year.\n\nOn June 6, 1944, Allied forces launched a naval, air, and land assault on Nazi-occupied France during World War II. The massive operation marked the beginning of the end of Nazi Germany.\n\nOn the morning of D-Day, two naval task forces landed roughly 133,000 ground troops on five beaches, including more than 70,000 Americans who landed at Utah and Omaha beaches.\n\nTwo months after the D-Day operation, the Allied forces reached Paris and liberated the French capital from Nazi occupation. On May 7, 1945, Germany unconditionally surrendered in Reims, France.\n\nNearly 16.4 million Americans served in World War II but less than one percent (fewer than 100,000) are expected to be alive as of September 2024, according to data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nAccording to estimates, nearly 170 U.S. World War II veterans, ranging in age from 98 to 103, attended the ceremony at the Normandy American Cemetery. Among them is WWII veteran Casimer \"Casey\" Bukowski, who recently turned 100.\n\nMr. Bukowski joined the U.S. Army Air Corps following the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. He was trained as a waist gunner on the B-17 Flying Fortress, the most well-known American heavy bomber of WWII.\n\nMr. Bukowski was a member of the Eighth Air Force.\n\n\"Our crew was shot down over Germany on the 16th mission and only four of us survived,\" he told The Epoch Times. \"I spent 14 months in the German prison camp.\"\n\nMr. Bukowski was forced to move from one prison camp to another, enduring a grueling 82-day forced march in the midst of one of the coldest winters in German history. The conditions were so severe that he dropped to less than 100 lbs. Mr. Bukowski was liberated by General Patton's 3rd Army in April 1945.\n\nThis was his second visit to Normandy, but the first to commemorate D-Day.\n\n\"I'm excited and honored that I was asked to participate in the ceremony this year. I'm very very humbled and proud that I can still do it. I love it.\"\n\nGiven the importance of the 80th anniversary this year, numerous companies and organizations participated in this year's commemoration.\n\nUnited Airlines participated in the event by flying four U.S. WWII veterans, including Mr. Bukowski, to France.\n\n\"They are the greatest generation and we're honored to be able to at least contribute by flying four of these American heroes over to Europe,\" Scott Seeberger, Airbus captain at United Airlines told The Epoch Times\n\n\"It's going to be a great trip, a memorable trip for both the veterans and their families.\"", "source":

The operation, given the codename OVERLORD, turned out to be a significant turning point in the war, leading to the defeat of Nazi Germany.\n\nAround 156,000 Allied troops with 20,000 vehicles landed in Nazi-occupied northern France by the end of what became known as \"the longest day\". The troops faced a hail of bullets, artillery and aircraft fire as they marched into France by sea and air to drive out the Nazis. Many lost their lives.\n\nAlso read: American Airlines flight attendants reject latest contract proposal\n\nOn Thursday, world leaders including US President Joe Biden and British monarch King Charles III commemorated D-Day's 80th anniversary and expressed a \"profound sense of gratitude\" to veterans who fought during the Normandy landings.\n\n\"How fortunate we were, and the entire free world, that a generation of men and women in the United Kingdom and other Allied nations did not flinch when the moment came to face that test,\" said King Charles.\n\n\"It is with the most profound sense of gratitude that we remember them, and all those who served at that critical time. We recall the lesson that comes to us, again and again, across the decades: free Nations must stand together to oppose tyranny,\" the monarch added.\n\nAlso read: Israelis raise 'Death to Arabs' slogan in Jerusalem Day Flag March\n\nGermany feared an Allied invasion of occupied Europe and was ready with everything it had to stop it, with Adolf Hitler even ordering in 1942 the building of a 5,000-kilometre coastal defence system studded with bunkers, gun emplacements, tank traps and other obstacles.\n\nGermany used more than 20 million cubic metres of concrete and 1.2 million tonnes of steel to build thousands of fortifications linked by barbed wire along the Atlantic and North Sea coasts. It stretched from France to Belgium, the Netherlands, and Denmark to Norway.\n\nTowards the end of World War II, Germany faced significant shortages of critical resources such as oil, food, and raw materials. Meanwhile, the US and Soviet Union's industrial capacity played a significant role in producing vast quantities of weapons, vehicles, and other supplies necessary for a sustained war effort.\n\nThis year's D-day commemoration is happening amid global worries of a Third World War.\n\nAmid the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has the potential to spread to other parts of Europe, the question should be asked about the lessons from WWII.\n\nAs King Charles marked 80 years since the landings in Normandy, he called for unity. Meanwhile, Pope Francis regretted that the lessons had not been learned, warning against the threat of the new widespread conflict.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron is hosting US President Joe Biden, King Charles and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will join the Western leaders in Normandy, northern France.\n\nBut notably, no Russian officials have been invited because of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine at a ceremony. Allies that once fought together, are now at odds, which can be seen as a precipice of a greater war.", "source": {"uri": "wionews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WION"}, "authors": [],

If you want to know the price of freedom, come here to Normandy,\" President Biden said during a three-hour ceremony honoring those killed in the Normandy invasion as well as living veterans.\n\n\"Democracy is never guaranteed. Every generation must preserve it, defend it, and fight for it. That's the test of the ages,\" President Biden said. \"In memory of those who fought here, died here, and literally saved the world here, let us be worthy of their sacrifice.\"\n\nDuring his speech, President Biden underscored the value of strong alliances and partnerships, including NATO.\n\n\"Isolation was not the answer 80 years ago, and is not the answer today,\" he said.\n\nThe president was accompanied by First Lady Jill Biden as well as French President Emmanuel Macron and First Lady Brigitte Macron.\n\nFollowing the ceremony at the Normandy American Cemetery, the president is scheduled to attend an international ceremony joining nearly 15 world leaders, including Mr. Macron, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\n\nPresident Biden arrived in France on June 5, kicking off a five-day trip. Following the ceremonies in Normandy on June 6-7, the president will participate in a state visit hosted by Mr. Macron.\n\nThe president will give another speech on June 7 at Pointe du Hoc, France, underscoring the significance of safeguarding freedom and democracy. The president is expected to use the D-Day commemorations as an opportunity to target former President Donald Trump during a contentious election year.\n\nOn June 6, 1944, Allied forces launched a naval, air, and land assault on Nazi-occupied France during World War II. The massive operation marked the beginning of the end of Nazi Germany.\n\nOn the morning of D-Day, two naval task forces landed roughly 133,000 ground troops on five beaches, including more than 70,000 Americans who landed at Utah and Omaha beaches.\n\nTwo months after the D-Day operation, the Allied forces reached Paris and liberated the French capital from Nazi occupation. On May 7, 1945, Germany unconditionally surrendered in Reims, France.\n\nMr. Bukowski joined the U.S. Army Air Corps following the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. He was trained as a waist gunner on the B-17 Flying Fortress, the most well-known American heavy bomber of WWII.\n\nMr. Bukowski was a member of the Eighth Air Force.\n\n\"Our crew was shot down over Germany on the 16th mission and only four of us survived,\" he told The Epoch Times. \"I spent 14 months in the German prison camp.\"\n\nMr. Bukowski was forced to move from one prison camp to another, enduring a grueling 82-day forced march in the midst of one of the coldest winters in German history. The conditions were so severe that he dropped to less than 100 lbs. Mr. Bukowski was liberated by General Patton's 3rd Army in April 1945.\n\nThis was his second visit to Normandy, but the first to commemorate D-Day.\n\n\"I'm excited and honored that I was asked to participate in the ceremony this year. I'm very very humbled and proud that I can still do it. I love it.\"\n\nGiven the importance of the 80th anniversary this year, numerous companies and organizations participated in this year's commemoration.\n\nUnited Airlines participated in the event by flying four U.S. WWII veterans, including Mr. Bukowski, to France.\n\n\"They are the greatest generation and we're honored to be able to at least contribute by flying four of these American heroes over to Europe,\" Scott Seeberger, Airbus captain at United Airlines told The Epoch Times\n\n\"It's going to be a great trip, a memorable trip for both the veterans and their families.\"", "source":

The ocean waters, as well as the beach, were also heavily mined by the Germans. -", "source": {"uri": "en.haberler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Haberler.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Normandy_Memorial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Normandy Memorial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Overlord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operation Overlord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Normandy"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Normandy"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ver-sur-Mer", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ver-sur-Mer"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ver-sur-Mer"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_people", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polish people"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha_Beach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Omaha Beach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_World_War_II_in_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "End of World War II in Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_of_Honour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legion of Honour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wehrmacht", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wehrmacht"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killed_in_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Killed in action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Undeveloped_or_Vacant", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Undeveloped or Vacant", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 60}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626321", "eventUri": "eng-9626321", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 2334, "textEnd": 2340}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

However, this year's 80th celebration comes amid a complex geopolitical situation.\n\nIn the early hours of 6 June 1944, more than 150,000 American, British, Canadian and other Allied nations' troops parachuted onto five beaches along the Normandy coastline, launching a massive invasion that was the first step towards the liberation of France and western Europe from Nazi occupation.\n\nThis Thursday, dozens of heads of state will attend the official commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the invasion, known as D-Day.\n\nHowever, Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and the upcoming European elections - where the far-right is expected to gain significant ground in France - have undermined President Emmanuel Macron's efforts to symbolically assert French unity in the face of adversity.\n\nRussia not invited\n\nMacron will welcome US President Joe Biden to Omaha Beach, along with King Charles III of Britain, and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, in a show of unity of western powers.\n\nThere is one notable absence - Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn previous years, Russia was invited to the commemorations to acknowledge the Soviet Union's key role in fighting the Nazis.\n\nHowever, because of its invasion of Ukraine, Russia was not invited this year's events.\n\nThe French presidency has insisted that the commemoration is not political, but memorials cannot avoid politics, as the presence of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Normandy attests.\n\nPolitics of commemoration\n\nBefore 1984, D-day commemorations were military affairs, but during the Cold War then President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand invited foreign heads of state, and turned it into a political event.\n\nAs president, Macron is fully invested in commemorations, marking many events of the Second World War since last year when he honoured the head of the resistance, Jean Moulin.\n\nDuring these ceremonies, Macron has spoken of French people's ability to come together in difficult times.\n\nHe pushed the same ideas of unity during commemorations of the end of the First World War, in 2018 - a symbolic message for a contemporary population divided - with a government unable to find a political majority in parliament.\n\nUnity in the face of adversity\n\nResistance is a strong theme in France's World War II commemorations, as it brings people together, though Macron has also evoked French collaboration with the German occupation.\n\n\"Let us also remember these French people, their choices and errors,\" he said mid-May at a ceremony honouring Reistance fighters on the Vercors plateau in the Alps.\n\n\"It was not just a time when French people did not love each other. It was also a time when some French people did not love France.\"\n\nThe three-day D-Day commemorations will be followed by a ceremony to mark the massacre a Oradour-sur-Glane, on Monday.\n\nIn August, Macron will preside over the commemoration of the Allied invasion of Provence on 15 August 1944, and the liberation of Paris four days later.", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news",

But they have already said he is going to discuss the international state of affairs.\n\n'Never would any of our neighbours have a head of state who summons all the media to carry out electoral propaganda with three polling days left,' he added.\n\nManon Aubry, head of the LFI, said it was 'embarrassing' that Macron would be afforded a prime-time campaigning slot.\n\nMacron launched the commemoration of the 80th anniversary of D-Day, the Normandy landings of Western Allied forces on 06 June 1944 that initiated the liberation of western Europe during World War II, by paying tribute to the French Resistance fighters\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron attends a ceremony to pay homage to the Saint Marcel maquis, a force of French Resistance fighters during World War II and the French SAS (Special Air Service) paratroopers, in Plumelec, Brittany\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron (C) and his wife Brigitte (not pictured) arrive at the ceremony in tribute to the civilian victims of World War II\n\nAll three parties will request that Valerie Hayer - the leading Renaissance candidate in this week's elections - be docked speaking time to make up for Macron's interview, which they claim is effectively free political campaigning.\n\nBut it should come as no surprise that Macron would seize such an opportunity, particularly at a pivotal moment when a day of remembrance of Europe's triumph over fascism coincides with elections expected to return a significant victory for a hard-right rival.\n\nThe French President's reputation as a lover of the limelight with a penchant for self-aggrandising PR has long been established.\n\nHe caused quite a stir at home and abroad in March when his personal photographer Soazig de la Moissonniere dropped delicately curated black-and-white snaps of him pummelling a punching bag.\n\nThe images, showing Macron sporting a steely grimace as chiselled biceps rippled from beneath his shirt, came just as he had reversed longstanding efforts to maintain relations with Vladimir Putin and refused to rule out sending French troops to Ukraine.\n\nThat cringeworthy photo-op was just one of many in a years-long campaign of staged shoots designed to portray the Elysee Palace chief as a dashing, capable and admirable representative of France and her interests.\n\nThe pictures were released by Macron's official photographer Sazig de la Moissonniere and show the French leader in a boxing gym yesterday, where he flexed his muscles as he hit a punching bag\n\nMacron's pugilistic photo-op was just one in a years-long campaign of staged shoots designed to portray the Elysee Palace chief as a dashing, capable and admirable representative of France\n\nMacron's PR drive seeks to portray the Head of State as the complete package\n\nUS President Joe Biden (C) is welcomed by France's Prime Minister Gabriel Attal upon arrival at Paris Orly airport near Paris, on June 5, 2024\n\nUS President Joe Biden disembarks from the 'Air Force One' as arrives at Paris Orly airport, near Paris, France, 05 June 2024. US President Biden arrived in France to attend the commemoration ceremonies on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of D-Day\n\nUS President Joe Biden, who will remain in France until Sunday for an uncharacteristically lengthy diplomatic visit, is also aiming to use the D-Day anniversary to drum up support across the pond.\n\nFrance and the US have been among Ukraine's foremost supporters as of late.\n\nWashington recently passed a $61 billion military aid bill that guaranteed continued material support for the war-weary defenders, and Biden last week gave the Ukrainian armed forces permission to strike targets on Russian territory with US weapons for the first time.\n\nParis meanwhile is holding talks with officials in Kyiv about the possibility of deploying French soldiers on Ukrainian soil to train new recruits.\n\nBoth Biden and Macron will unite alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in France for the D-Day commemoration, and the US President is keen to use the photo op to contrast himself against election rival Donald Trump.\n\nTrump has famously claimed he could end the Russia-Ukraine war in 24 hours and has cast doubt on Kyiv's expectations that the White House will provide continued aid in its fight against Moscow's forces should he be elected in November.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Join us in this fight.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky has arrived in France ahead of the commemorations of the 80th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy on June 6.\n\nThe event marks the day on June 6, 1944, when 7,000 boats carrying nearly 160,000 troops from eight Allied countries landed on five Normandy beaches. The landing was the starting point for the liberation of France, and eventually the rest of Western Europe, from Nazi Germany.\n\nZelensky will join French President Emmanuel Macron, U.S. President Joe Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, among other leaders and surviving veterans in attendance.\n\nZelensky said he was \"very honored to take part\" in the event, which serves as a \"reminder of the courage and determination shown for the sake of freedom and democracy.\"\n\nMacron is expected to preside over an international ceremony at 3 p.m. local time. World leaders will then gather in the nearby city of Caen for talks later in the day.\n\n\"As we reflect on the sacrifices made on D-Day, we are reminded that freedom is not free and it has never been guaranteed,\" Biden said in a statement ahead of the commemoration on June 4.\n\nAccording to Politico, France initially invited a representative from Russia to take part in the commemoration due to the Soviet Union's role in the war, but this invitation was revoked after the U.S., U.K., and \"two other World War II allies expressed concerns.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin attended the D-Day commorations in 2004 and again in 2014, months after Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and invasion of Donbas.\n\nDuring this year's commemoration, Macron is reportedly expected to make an announcement on support for Kyiv. News emerged at the end of May that Paris could soon send its military trainers to Ukraine.\n\nZelensky's attendance at the commemoration in France follows his visit to Qatar, a country that has acted as a mediator between Kyiv and Moscow to bring back Ukrainian children illegally held by Russia.\n\nZelensky's next international visit is expected to be to Italy for the Group of Seven (G7) summit on June 13, where he will likely call on Western partners to seize Russian assets to help fund Ukraine's defense and reconstruction.", "source": {"uri": "kyivindependent.com", "dataType": "news",

In his speech, Biden emphasized the enduring fight for democracy, stating, \"History tells us freedom is not free. If you want to know the price of freedom, come here to Normandy. Remember, the price of unchecked tyranny is the blood of the young and the brave.\"\n\nBiden drew direct parallels between the invasion led by Nazi Germany and the threats facing Western democracies today, particularly referencing the situation in Ukraine. \"Ukrainians are fighting with extraordinary courage, suffering great losses but never backing down,\" he said. \"The United States and NATO and a coalition of more than 50 countries are standing strong with Ukraine. We will not walk away.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron also paid tribute to the bravery of the Allied forces. \"You left everything, crossed the ocean, and landed on the coast of France eight decades ago. You left everything and risked everything for our independence, for our freedom. That we will never forget,\" Macron declared during his address at the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in Colleville-sur-Mer.\n\nThe ceremonies included re-enactments, military flyovers, and a giant picnic followed by a concert and fireworks display. The significant events were attended by over 25 heads of state, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who received a standing ovation upon his arrival. Zelensky called for \"true unity\" to prevail as it did during the D-Day operations, noting, \"Allies defended Europe's freedom then, and Ukrainians do so now. Unity prevailed then, and true unity can prevail today.\"\n\nUK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also participated in the commemorations, emphasizing the enduring importance of the cause the Allied forces fought for. \"The cause they fought for will never be taken for granted,\" Sunak asserted.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were also among the prominent leaders attending the ceremonies in Normandy, reflecting the broad international representation and the collective memory of this historic event.\n\nIn the UK, King Charles III and Queen Camilla paid tribute at the British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer. King Charles invoked the memory of his grandfather, George VI, describing the war as the \"supreme test.\" He honored the generation that faced the test without flinching, reflecting on their bravery and sacrifice.\n\nPrince William also attended the Canadian memorial event at Juno Beach alongside Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, showing the strong bonds between the allied nations.",

A total of 9,843 troops from the US, Britain, and Canada were killed in action on June 6 and in the few days thereafter.\n\nGerman troops were ready for the invasion, however, with guns placed at strategic high points around the nearly 10-kilometer (6-mile) beach as the forces landed.

This year's events take on special significance due to the war in Ukraine and the dwindling number of surviving veterans. Notable attendees include Joe Biden, King Charles, and Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nWorld leaders and veterans gather in Normandy on Thursday to mark the 80th anniversary of the June 6, 1944 D-Day landings, when more than 150,000 Allied soldiers invaded France in a major turning point of World War Two. Here is what you need to know about the events:\n\nWHY DO THE CEREMONIES MATTER? - With war raging on Europe's borders, in Ukraine, this anniversary's D-Day events carry special resonance. - The number of British, American, Canadian and French veterans still alive is dwindling fast. This is one of the last major ceremonies on Normandy's beaches to honour a significant number of survivors. WHO WILL BE THERE? - Around 4,500 guests are expected, including about 200 veterans, mostly from the U.S., Britain, Canada and France. Among them will be 101-year old U.S. Army veteran Jake Larson. - U.S. President Joe Biden will be there while on a state visit to France. - Russia will not be represented. President Vladimir Putin was never on the guest list due to the invasion of Ukraine. But France had initially invited Russia's ambassador in recognition of his country's massive sacrifices during World War Two, before rescinding the invitation. - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will take part \"in view of the historical resonance of the landing with the just fight that the Ukrainian nation is leading today,\" a French presidency source said. As for Russia, \"the conditions for its participation are not met, considering the war of aggression it launched in 2022,\" the source added. - Britain's King Charles, Queen Camilla and Prince William will be among the guests, along with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Canada's Justin Trudeau and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\n\n- Charles will take part in the morning British ceremony but will miss the international Omaha Beach ceremony on the advice of medical staff as he continues to recover from cancer. WHAT WILL THEY DO?\n\n- Ceremonies will kick off at around 0830 GMT at the British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer. Canada will hold its own ceremony at 0900 GMT, attended by Prince William. At around 1000 GMT, Biden will lead a U.S. ceremony in the presence of D-Day veterans.

Here in Europe, we see one stark example. Ukraine has been invaded by a tyrant. \u00e2\u20ac| Ukrainians are fighting with extraordinary courage, suffering great losses, but never backing down,\" Biden slammed.\n\nThe president vowed continuous support for Ukraine.\n\n\"We will not walk away. Because if we do, Ukraine will be subjugated and it will not end there. Ukraine's neighbors will be threatened. All of Europe will be threatened,\" he emphasized.\n\nDemocracy nowadays is at risk, and must be defended, Biden further said.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, for his part, hailed the fallen soldiers and the veterans.\n\n\"You left all behind and took all the risks, for our independence, for our freedom. This we do not forget. Thank you,\" he said.\n\n\"The free world needed each one of you, and you answered it,\" Macron added, and awarded the veterans the Legion of Honor, the country's highest award.\n\nMacron earlier held a binational ceremony with King Charles III to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day.\n\nHe will lead a third international ceremony on Omaha Beach.\n\nD-Day\n\nOn June 6, 1944, Allied forces stormed Omaha Beach to defeat Nazi forces who had taken hold in many towns and villages in the northern region. Some 160,000 troops in 7,000 boats landed there, as well as on the nearby beaches of Utah, Juno, Sword, and Gold, as they were dubbed in the Allies' plans.\n\nKnown officially as the Normandy Invasion, it left 4,414 troops killed on that day, including over 2,500 Americans, and some 5,000 wounded. A total of 9,843 troops from the US, Britain, and Canada were killed in action on June 6 and in the few days thereafter.\n\nGerman troops were ready for the invasion, however, with guns placed at strategic high points around the nearly 10-kilometer (6-mile) beach as the forces landed. The ocean waters, as well as the beach, were also heavily mined by the Germans. -", "source": {"uri": "en.haberler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Haberler.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Overlord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operation Overlord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colleville-sur-Mer", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colleville-sur-Mer"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colleville-sur-Mer"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolationism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Isolationism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dictatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha_Beach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Omaha Beach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_of_Honour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legion of Honour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wehrmacht", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wehrmacht"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killed_in_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Killed in action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626321", "eventUri": "eng-9626321", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 2524, "textEnd": 2530}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

But they have already said he is going to discuss the international state of affairs.\n\n'Never would any of our neighbours have a head of state who summons all the media to carry out electoral propaganda with three polling days left,' he added.\n\nManon Aubry, head of the LFI, said it was 'embarrassing' that Macron would be afforded a prime-time campaigning slot.\n\nMacron launched the commemoration of the 80th anniversary of D-Day, the Normandy landings of Western Allied forces on 06 June 1944 that initiated the liberation of western Europe during World War II, by paying tribute to the French Resistance fighters\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron attends a ceremony to pay homage to the Saint Marcel maquis, a force of French Resistance fighters during World War II and the French SAS (Special Air Service) paratroopers, in Plumelec, Brittany\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron (C) and his wife Brigitte (not pictured) arrive at the ceremony in tribute to the civilian victims of World War II\n\nAll three parties will request that Valerie Hayer - the leading Renaissance candidate in this week's elections - be docked speaking time to make up for Macron's interview, which they claim is effectively free political campaigning.\n\nBut it should come as no surprise that Macron would seize such an opportunity, particularly at a pivotal moment when a day of remembrance of Europe's triumph over fascism coincides with elections expected to return a significant victory for a hard-right rival.\n\nThe French President's reputation as a lover of the limelight with a penchant for self-aggrandising PR has long been established.\n\nHe caused quite a stir at home and abroad in March when his personal photographer Soazig de la Moissonniere dropped delicately curated black-and-white snaps of him pummelling a punching bag.\n\nThe images, showing Macron sporting a steely grimace as chiselled biceps rippled from beneath his shirt, came just as he had reversed longstanding efforts to maintain relations with Vladimir Putin and refused to rule out sending French troops to Ukraine.\n\nThat cringeworthy photo-op was just one of many in a years-long campaign of staged shoots designed to portray the Elysee Palace chief as a dashing, capable and admirable representative of France and her interests.\n\nThe pictures were released by Macron's official photographer Sazig de la Moissonniere and show the French leader in a boxing gym yesterday, where he flexed his muscles as he hit a punching bag\n\nMacron's pugilistic photo-op was just one in a years-long campaign of staged shoots designed to portray the Elysee Palace chief as a dashing, capable and admirable representative of France\n\nMacron's PR drive seeks to portray the Head of State as the complete package\n\nUS President Joe Biden (C) is welcomed by France's Prime Minister Gabriel Attal upon arrival at Paris Orly airport near Paris, on June 5, 2024\n\nUS President Joe Biden disembarks from the 'Air Force One' as arrives at Paris Orly airport, near Paris, France, 05 June 2024. US President Biden arrived in France to attend the commemoration ceremonies on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of D-Day\n\nUS President Joe Biden, who will remain in France until Sunday for an uncharacteristically lengthy diplomatic visit, is also aiming to use the D-Day anniversary to drum up support across the pond.\n\nFrance and the US have been among Ukraine's foremost supporters as of late.\n\nWashington recently passed a $61 billion military aid bill that guaranteed continued material support for the war-weary defenders, and Biden last week gave the Ukrainian armed forces permission to strike targets on Russian territory with US weapons for the first time.\n\nParis meanwhile is holding talks with officials in Kyiv about the possibility of deploying French soldiers on Ukrainian soil to train new recruits.\n\nBoth Biden and Macron will unite alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in France for the D-Day commemoration, and the US President is keen to use the photo op to contrast himself against election rival Donald Trump.\n\nTrump has famously claimed he could end the Russia-Ukraine war in 24 hours and has cast doubt on Kyiv's expectations that the White House will provide continued aid in its fight against Moscow's forces should he be elected in November.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

For decades, he said, \"the memory of the errors of the past\" had helped maintain the resolve to \"do everything possible to avoid another open world conflict\". But, he added: \"I note with sadness that this is no longer the case today and that men have a short memory. \"It is worrying... that the hypothesis of a generalized conflict is sometimes once again being seriously considered -- that people are little by little getting used to this unacceptable possibility.\" Pope Francis has regularly denounced the consequences of what he refers to as a \"piecemeal Third World War\".

The sheer scale was unprecedented, involving over 100,000 soldiers, tens of thousands of aircraft, and thousands of ships.\n\nThe majority of troops landing at the five beaches in Normandy were from the US, UK, and Canada. But military personnel from over 30 allied countries were also involved, including many from Nazi-occupied countries.\n\nMany came from further afield, like Gilbert Clarke from Jamaica, Karun Krishna 'Jumbo' Majumdar from India, and Lam Ping-yu from China, making the liberation of Europe a truly global effort.\n\nThousands of women also played vital roles in intelligence analysis, operational support, code-breaking, medical assistance, and combat as part of the French resistance.\n\nOf course, D-Day wasn't the only major military operation in Europe in 1944: Russians paid a terrible price fighting on the Eastern front. And thousands of Allied troops had already landed in Italy, fighting to liberate the country from Benito Mussolini's fascists and German troops.\n\nBut the importance of D-Day was that it marked the beginning of the end of Nazi tyranny across Europe.\n\nToday, leaders from across Europe and the world will be attending ceremonies in France, including US President Joe Biden and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nHowever, a notable exception will be Russian President Vladimir Putin: Given his country's invasion of Ukraine, it was hardly surprising that he was not invited. But he still casts a shadow over the proceedings.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, Biden, and Zelensky are all expected to make high-level speeches on the need to show similar unity as the Allies showed on D-Day to counter Putin.\n\nBiden may remind his fellow countrymen of the dangers of following an isolationist policy regarding Europe. Europeans are already bracing for another round of Donald Trump, Biden's Republican presidential rival, and his 'America first' policies, should he win November's elections.\n\nZelensky will try to remind allies of the legacy of international cooperation and sacrifice to fight oppression, to rally guarantees of more support for Ukraine to push out occupying Russian troops.\n\nWith voters heading to the polls in the European elections, the commemorations will highlight how solidarity and collaboration can be harnessed to tackle the myriad of current challenges Europe currently faces.\n\nThanks to the victories that followed that momentous day, democratic institutions including the EU emerged from the ruins of a devastated Europe.\n\nTherefore today is also an important reminder of the need to uphold democracy, freedom, justice, and human rights, particularly as fundamental values in Europe are being challenged or undermined by parties on the right, such as PiS in Poland and Viktor Orban's Fidesz party in Hungary.\n\nOf course, the most important people attending today's events are the small group of veterans, all in their late 90's and early 100s. They are the last of the generation who witnessed the events firsthand.\n\nAs Europeans enjoy the freedoms we take for granted today, like the freedom to vote, they must remember the people involved in D-Day.\n\nAnd they should also remember the words of the memorial to soldiers who fought in Asia during WW2 against another tyrannical force, the Japanese Imperial Army:\n\nFor your tomorrow, we gave our today.\n\nVoting has started in EU elections! Stay on top of all the latest developments with our election live blog. Also, make sure to check out our weekly EU Elections Decoded: D'Hondt worry, there's much more political game after the vote!\n\nOn the eve of the EU elections, Euractiv takes a look at those who are expected to be 'out' - and the possible 'ins' - of the next European Parliament Agriculture Committee (AGRI).\n\nThe top national delegations will reshape the Parliament's balance of powers while feeding new priorities into the legislative work, and with voting set to start on Thursday, Europe Elects' final projections for Euractiv lay out what could lie ahead.\n\nA more right-wing European Parliament could mean fewer regulatory initiatives in the area of tech, and a weakened push for market integration, but more support for defence tech, according to party manifestos and expert interviews.\n\nGermany wants to start deporting migrants who commit crimes on its territory to their home countries, including Afghanistan, following a suspected Islamist knife attack in late May, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Thursday as parties rush to quash security concerns ahead of the EU elections.\n\nUS President Joe Biden gave a heartfelt speech at Thursday's commemorations of the Normandy landings, comparing the \"dark forces\" of 80 years ago to those threatening Ukraine and the West today.\n\nDigital rights NGO Noyb has filed 11 complaints across Europe over changes in Meta's privacy policy that will allow the owner of Facebook and Instagram to use posts and images, among other things, to train its artificial intelligence (AI) model, according to a Thursday press release.\n\nReforms of the telecom sector are expected to be at the top of the policy agenda for the next EU mandate and a battle is already heating up over the need to deregulate it.\n\nPro-European Union parties are ceding political space to the Eurosceptic far-right in their election campaigns by failing to showcase the bloc's positive impact on citizens' lives, analysts said at an event on Wednesday.\n\nAs electric vehicle continue their rollout, Euractiv spoke with several French industry players looking at battery recycling to capture and re-use critical raw materials.\n\nAsked about Vladmir Putin's non-invitation to the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings, several French far-right National Rally (ID) leaders expressed divergent positions on Wednesday evening, and National Rally's long-standing leader Marine Le Pen could not make up her mind, fueling the confusion.", "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EurActiv.com"}, "authors": [],

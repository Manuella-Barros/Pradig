The Falkirk-based angler said: \u201cI\u2019ve been fishing since I was 11 and last year was the first I tried to qualify for the national team.\u201d And 60-year-old Campbell added: \u201cScotland won gold last year and it is a hard act to follow with world-class anglers against us, but we have a good team with experienced anglers in it.\u201d Also selected is Easthouses-based angler, Mike Kyle, who returns to the team which includes Bruce McLean from Stranraer. Campbell is joined by two other members of the East Fife club, David Cargill (Dundee) and Chris Horn (Kircaldy) the captain.

The opening ceremony will be held that day and the match is on Wednesday and Thursday from 10am with start times staggered for juniors, youth, ladies and men\u2019s teams. \u201dFlounders and dabs are likely to be the main species caught and warm weather is predicted until the match.\u201d Elsewhere, St Serfs have changed the venue for their shore league match on Sunday, June 30.

He urged all for patience at this hour of grief.\n\n- PTI\n\nNepal's aviation authority identified one of the passengers as a child named Adhiraj Sharma, who was the son of Manu Raj Sharma, a technician of Saurya Airlines.\n\nSharma's wife Priza Khatiwada and their four-year old son Adhiraj died in the crash.\n\nA statement issued by the airline said that Priza and her son were initially identified as employees of the company, but it was later revealed that they were passengers.\n\n- PTI\n\nSource Aviation Safety Report - 2023, Nepal.jpg\n\nAccording to local media reports, the deadly Saurya Airlines aircraft, which crashed during takeoff resulting in the death of 18 people, was on a test flight.\n\nThe flight, with call sign 9N-AME, was undergoing a C Check, which is a comprehensive test that a plane has to pass on a regular basis. The plane was headed to a hangar in the Pokhara International Airport for a part check-up, reported Nepali Times.\n\nIt is unclear why a test flight was carrying so many passengers, it added.\n\nIn the last three decades, over 50 flights have crashed in Nepal. The country ranks 33 out of the 207 countries ordered based on the number of plane crashes between 1990 and 2023 . With 1,578 plane crashes, the U.S. leads the list, followed by Russia (464) and Canada (369). India ranks 13, with 99 crashes in the period.\n\nClick here to read a detailed data analysis on the crashes that have plagued Nepal's aviation history\n\nA press statement issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal said the Saurya Airlines plane had taken off at 11:11 a.m. from Kathmandu and was heading to resort town of Pokhara.\n\nThe plane had already taken off and turned right before it crashed in the eastern section of the airport, the statement said.\n\nFootage from the spot showed dramatic scenes of the plane speeding down the runway before a fire breaks out with high flames and thick black smoke billowing from the wreckage.\n\n- Agencies\n\nThe Saurya Airlines aircraft which crashed today had just taken off from Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport.\n\nIn 2019, a Bangladeshi airliner crashed at Tribhuvan airport, killing 51 people while 20 on board survived. An investigation confirmed the plane was misaligned with the runway and its pilot was disoriented and tried to land in \"sheer desperation\" when the plane crashed.\n\nIn 2015, a Turkish Airlines jet landing in dense fog skidded off a slippery runway at the airport. The plane was carrying 238 people but there were no serious injuries.\n\nThe Kathmandu airport, the main airport serving Nepal, is located inside a valley surrounded by mountains on most sides. It is considered a challenging airport for pilots and bigger planes have to come through an opening on the mountain to land. It is right next to the city. The airport is surrounded by houses and neighborhoods.\n\n- Agencies\n\nA passenger plane carrying 19 people crashed during takeoff in Kathmandu on Wednesday with the pilot surviving but \"many\" others aboard dead, police in the Nepali capital\n\nThe Saurya Airlines flight was carrying two crew and 17 of the company's staff members, Nepali police spokesman Dan Bahadur Karki told AFP.\n\nEighteen Nepalis and one foreigner were aboard the flight, Gyanendra Bhul of Nepal's Civil Aviation Authority told AFP, adding he did not have any details on the latter's nationality.\n\n- AFP\n\nFollowing the fatal plane crash of Saurya Airlines which killed at least 18 passengers onboard, Nepal's Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu has temporarily shut down operations.\n\n- Reuters\n\nPolice say 18 bodies have been recovered after a plane carrying 19 people slipped off the runway at a Nepal airport\n\nNepal authorities inspect the wreckage of the crashed flight in Kathmandu on July 24, 2024. Photo: X/@NepalPoliceHQ\n\nNepal's air industry has boomed in recent years, carrying goods and people between hard-to-reach areas as well as foreign trekkers and climbers.\n\nBut it has been plagued by poor safety due to insufficient training and maintenance -- issues compounded by the mountainous republic's treacherous geography.\n\nThe European Union has banned all Nepali carriers from its airspace over safety concerns.\n\nThe Himalayan country has some of the world's trickiest runways to land on, flanked by snow-capped peaks with approaches that pose a challenge even for accomplished pilots.\n\nThe weather can also change quickly in the mountains, creating treacherous flying conditions.\n\nNepal's last major commercial flight accident was in January 2023, when a Yeti Airlines service crashed while landing at Pokhara, killing all 72 aboard.\n\nThat accident was Nepal's deadliest since 1992, when all 167 people aboard a Pakistan International Airlines plane died when it crashed on approach to Kathmandu airport.\n\nEarlier that year a Thai Airways aircraft had crashed near the same airport, killing 113 people.\n\n- AFP\n\nSmoke rises from the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, Nepal, Wednesday, July 24, 2024.

It was carrying two crew members and 17 technicians and was going for regular maintenance to the new airport in Pokhara, which opened in January and is equipped with aircraft maintenance hangars, they said.\n\n\"Shortly after takeoff ... the aircraft veered off to the right and crashed on the east side of the runway,\" the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal said in a statement.\n\nEighteen of those on board were Nepali citizens while one engineer was from Yemen, Saurya said.\n\n\"Only the captain was rescued alive and is receiving treatment at a hospital,\" said Tej Bahadur Poudyal, a spokesman for Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport.\n\nTelevision images showed firefighters trying to put out the blaze and thick black smoke rising into the sky. They also showed the plane flying a little above the runway and then tilting to its right before it crashed.\n\nOther visuals showed rescue workers rummaging through the charred remains of the plane, strewn in lush green fields, and bodies being carried to ambulances on stretchers as local residents looked on.\n\n\"The plane was scheduled to undergo maintenance for a month beginning Thursday. ...

Footage shows the Bombardier CRJ 200 plane flying low above the runway before suddenly tilting sideways and quickly sailing nose-first towards the ground.\n\nThe aircraft exploded into a fireball after it crashed, with black smoke billowing into the sky while horrified bystanders watched on from an airport shuttle bus. The plane operated by Saurya Airlines was travelling to the resort town of Pokhara when it skidded off the runway at the Tribhuvan International Airport in the capital Kathmandu during take-off at around 11am local time (6.15am UK time).\n\nThe plane was carrying two crew members and 17 technicians to Pokhara city to repair another aircraft, officials said. The pilot was the only one onboard to survive, as officials said that 18 people had died in the crash. Videos from the crash site show firefighters trying to put out the blaze and thick black smoke rising into the sky, with other footage showing rescue workers rummaging through the charred remains of the plane, strewn in lush green fields.\n\nBodies were carried to ambulances on stretchers as local residents looked on, local media footage showed. 'Only the captain was rescued alive and is receiving treatment at a hospital,' said Tej Bahadur Poudyal, the spokesman for Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport. The pilot of the plane has been taken to the Kathmandu Medical College Hospital for treatment, said a doctor at the hospital who was not authorised to speak to media.\n\nThe pilot has injuries to the eyes but his life is not in any danger, the doctor added. Tribhuvan International Airport, the main airport in Nepal for international and domestic flights, has been closed as emergency crews worked. It is monsoon rainy season in Kathmandu but was not raining at the time of the crash.\n\nVisibility was low across the capital, however, although it is not clear whether this contributed to the crash or why the plane skidded off the runway in the first place. Saurya Airlines operates two Bombardier CRJ 200 aircrafts on domestic routes - both are around 20 years old, according to Flight Radar 24. Nepal has been criticised for a poor air safety record, and nearly 350 people have died in plane or helicopter crashes in the Himalayan country since 2000.\n\nThe deadliest incident occurred in 1992, when a Pakistan International Airlines Airbus crashed into a hillside while approaching Kathmandu, killing 167 people. Most recently, on July 11, 2023, six people were killed in a helicopter crash in central Nepal. The chopper, which departed from Solukhunvhu district, home to Mount Everest and other high mountain peaks, had five Mexican nationals and one Nepali pilot on board.\n\nEarlier last year 72 people were killed in a Yeti airlines crash in January that was later attributed to the pilots mistakenly cutting off power. It was the worst air crash in the country since 1992. On March 12, 2018, 51 of 71 people on a Bangladeshi airliner operated by US-Bangla Airlines died when it crashed in cloudy weather as it came in to land at the Nepalese capital's hill-ringed airport.\n\nSeveral British citizens died in plane crashes in Nepal, most recently on September 28, 2012, when a small propeller-driven Dornier aircraft struck a bird and crashed shortly after takeoff from Kathmandu, killing 19 people, including seven British and five Chinese passengers.\n\nIt comes after more two years prior, on August 24, 2010, 14 people - including four Americans, a Japanese and British national - were killed when their small plane crashed in bad weather in Nepal. It was operated by privately held Agni Air.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

The incident has put the spotlight back on Nepal's poor safety record, as nearly 350 people have died in plane or helicopter crashes in the Himalayan country since 2000.\n\nThe plane was carrying two crew members and 17 technicians to Pokhara city for maintenance checks, Airport Security Chief Arjun Chand Thakuri said. According to the Civil Aviation Authority, the 9N-AME/CRJ 200 call sign aircraft of Saurya Air crashed at 11:11 am (local time) on Wednesday while taking off from Tribhuvan International Airport to Pokhara.\n\nThe plane belonged to local Saurya Airlines, which operates domestic flights in Nepal with two Bombardier CRJ-200 regional jets, both around 20 years old, according to Flight Radar 24. At least 18 passengers were killed as the plane burst into flames after the crash, but the pilot managed to survive with injuries in his eyes.\n\nNepal's poor aviation safety record has been attributed to multiple reasons - from the rough mountainous terrain, unpredictable weather, poor maintenance and aircraft training as well as lack of proper infrastructure and maintenance of aircraft. Furthermore, Nepal has some of the world's most strenuous and remote runways, which pose a challenge for even experienced pilots. This came to the limelight after a Yeti Airlines plane crashed in Pokhara in January 2023, killing all 72 passengers on board.\n\nThe mountainous country sees frequent fluctuations in the weather and it is difficult to operate a flight without a proper weather forecasting mechanism. The deadliest aviation incident occurred in 1992, when a Pakistan International Airlines Airbus crashed into a hillside while approaching Kathmandu, killing 167 people. There have been more than 20 crashes in the last decade alone.\n\nThe Kathmandu Airport, known as one of the riskiest airports in the world, is located right in the middle of the city inside a valley surrounded by mountains on most sides, which makes it a challenge even for experienced pilots and small planes to come through an opening and land safely. It is also surrounded by houses and has a single bumpy runway. Nepal, being a struggling economy, is unable to buy upgraded aircraft and infrastructure that it clearly needs to avert such disasters.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tribhuvan International Airport, which was closed following the crash of the Saurya Airlines plane, has now re-opened and flights operations have resumed, according to the Himalayan Times.\n\n(with inputs from Reuters)", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_CRJ100/200", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bombardier CRJ100/200"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribhuvan_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tribhuvan International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Runway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokhara", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thakuri", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thakuri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Aviation_Authority_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airport security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saurya_Airlines", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saurya Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_jet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Regional jet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Himalayas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeti_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yeti Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_International_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan International Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weather forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airbus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_accidents_and_incidents", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aviation accidents and incidents"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/07/nepalcrash-1721813419.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758495", "eventUri": "eng-9758495", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

A video capturing the exact moment of the plane crash has gone viral on social media.\n\nIn the incident, only the pilot survived the crash and is currently receiving medical treatment, according to police spokesman Dan Bahadur Karki.\n\nA dramatic video has emerged on social media, capturing the exact moment the Saurya Airlines plane crashed. The video clip shows the plane engulfed in flames shortly after it skidded off the runway.\n\nThe plane crashed at approximately 11:15 am local time (0530 GMT), as confirmed by Nepal's military in an official statement.\n\nAccording to local news outlet, the Kathmandu Post, the flight was carrying 19 passengers, including the aircrew, on its way to Pokhara, a major tourist destination in the Himalayan nation.\n\nKhabarhub, another local news portal, stated that the plane caught fire after skidding on the runway, releasing a plume of smoke.\n\nIt should be noted that the Saurya Airlines runs exclusively with Bombardier CRJ 200 jets, as mentioned on their website. Even as Nepal's aviation sector has grown recently, the expansion has been marred by poor safety standards, inadequate training, and maintenance issues.\n\nRecently, the European Union placed a blanket ban on all Nepali carriers from its airspace, because of the safety concerns. Notably, Nepal's challenging geography, with its high-altitude runways poses major challenges to most experienced pilots.\n\nThe plane was scheduled to leave for Pokhara from Kathmandu when the accident happened, The Himalayan Times reported. Only technical staff of the airline was on board during the take-off, The Himalayan Times reported, quoting Gyanendra Bhul, Information officer at the Tribhuvan International Airport.

State television in Nepal says a plane has slipped off the runway and crashed while trying to take off from the Kathmandu airport.\n\nKATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) -- A domestic plane crashed Wednesday just after taking off from the airport serving Nepal's capital, killing 18 people and injuring a pilot who was the lone survivor.\n\nPolice official Basanta Rajauri said authorities have pulled out all 18 bodies. The only survivor was the pilot, who was taken to Kathmandu Medical College Hospital for treatment, said a doctor at the hospital who was not authorized to speak to media.\n\nThe pilot has injuries to the eyes but is not in any danger, the doctor said.\n\nA press statement issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal said the Saurya Airlines plane had taken off at 11:11 a.m. from Kathmandu and was heading to resort town of Pokhara.\n\nThe plane had already taken off and turned right before it crashed in the eastern section of the airport, the statement said.\n\nThe bodies have been taken to the T.U. Teaching Hospital in Kathmandu for autopsy. The airline manifest showed there were two pilots and 17 passengers on board, among them there was only one female. The crew and 16 passengers were Nepali nationals with one identified as foreigner but no nationality was disclosed.\n\nTribhuvan International Airport, the main airport in Nepal for international and domestic flights, has been closed as emergency crew and investigators began their work.\n\nIt is monsoon rainy season in Kathmandu but was not raining at the time of the crash. Visibility was low across the capital, however.\n\nSaurya Airlines operates the Bombardier CRJ 200 on domestic routes.\n\nThe Kathmandu airport, the main airport serving Nepal, is located inside a valley surrounded by mountains on most sides. It is considered a challenging airport for pilots and bigger planes have to come through an opening on the mountain to land. It is right next to the city. The airport is surrounded by houses and neighborhoods.\n\nIn 2019, a Bangladeshi airliner crashed at Tribhuvan airport, killing 51 people while 20 on board survived. An investigation confirmed the plane was misaligned with the runway and its pilot was disoriented and tried to land in \"sheer desperation\" when the plane crashed.\n\nIn 2015, a Turkish Airlines jet landing in dense fog skidded off a slippery runway at the airport. The plane was carrying 238 people but there were no serious injuries.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@eagletribune.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "binaj_gurubacharya@eagletribune.com", "name": "Binaj Gurubacharya", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribhuvan_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tribhuvan International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saurya_Airlines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saurya Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu_Medical_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu Medical College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_accidents_and_incidents", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aviation accidents and incidents"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Aviation_Authority_of_Nepal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Runway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokhara", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_CRJ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bombardier CRJ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turkish Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wet season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monsoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eagletribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/6a/16adf4e0-f71c-5b8d-8559-93ed98e81b41/66a0a4b40f86e.image.jpg?crop=1662%2C873%2C0%2C187&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758495", "eventUri": "eng-9758495", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Only the pilot of the CRJ200 aircraft managed to survive the deadly incident.\n\nThe plane was carrying two crew members and 17 technicians to Pokhara city for maintenance checks, Airport Security Chief Arjun Chand Thakuri said. According to the Civil Aviation Authority, the 9N-AME/CRJ 200 call sign aircraft of Saurya Air crashed at 11:11 am (local time) on Wednesday while taking off from Tribhuvan International Airport to Pokhara.\n\nThe plane belonged to local Saurya Airlines, which operates domestic flights in Nepal with two Bombardier CRJ-200 regional jets, both around 20 years old, according to Flight Radar 24. According to eyewitnesses, the plane was taking off from the Southern end of the runway when it suddenly flipped with the wing tip hitting the ground.\n\nThe captain has been identified as Captain Manish Ratna Shakya, who is an airline pilot of the CRJ200 regional aircraft and also the Chief of Operations at Saurya Airlines, according to the official website of the airline. According to his LinkedIn profile, he has been working at Saurya Airlines for over nine years, after a nearly three-year tenure at Simrik Airlines. He has completed his education at St. Xavier's School.\n\nThe 37-year-old Captain Shakya rescued from the wreckage and taken to KMC Hospital, Sinamangal for treatment, according to the police. He is the lone survivor of the crash, as 18 out of 19 passengers aboard the aircraft have been confirmed killed. The pilot has injuries to the eyes but is not in any danger, said a doctor at the hospital.\n\nNepal has been criticised for its poor air safety record, with the deadliest incident occurring in 1992, when a Pakistan International Airlines Airbus crashed into a hillside while approaching Kathmandu, killing 167 people. In January 2023, a Yeti Airlines flight crashed near the central city of Pokhara, killing all 72 passengers on board, including five Indians.\n\nPrior to that, a Tara flight with 22 people on board, including four Indians from Thane, crashed in Nepal's mountainous Mustang district on May 29, 2022, killing all people on board. Bad weather seems to be the main factor behind plane crashes in Nepal. The mountainous country sees frequent fluctuations in the weather and it is difficult to operate a flight without a proper weather forecasting mechanism.

The pilot survived but sustained serious injuries. The Nepalese domestic flight, identified as N9AME and operated by Saurya Airlines, was en route to Pokhara for routine maintenance when the incident occurred at 11:11 a.m.\n\nThe Bombardier CRJ-200 aircraft \"suffered a runway excursion and burst into massive flames immediately\", the Search and Rescue Centre of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal said in a statement.\n\nAlso read: Caught on camera: Dramatic moment when out-of-control Saurya Airlines plane crashed in Kathmandu (WATCH)\n\nVideos posted online captured the plane engulfed in flames and smoke, prompting a swift response from fire engines and ambulances at the scene.\n\nThe victims included co-pilot S.

Users on various platforms are demanding answers and transparency, expressing concerns over the possible factors that led to the disaster.\n\n\"Pilot is going to jail straight,\" wrote on user on X, while another added, \"How come only the pilot survived?\"\n\nAnother user noted, \"18 people died in plane crash that happened earlier today at TIA, Nepal; however, pilot is the only person who survived. Isn't it a hack to investigate about the incident? Yes, it is because plane crashes in Nepal are not just accident but mass murder due to illegal commissions.\"\n\nHere's a look at some of the other reactions on X following the Nepal plane crash:\n\nNepal has faced criticism for its poor air safety record in recent years, with contributing factors including sudden weather changes, challenging airstrips in rocky terrains, and human error.\n\nAccording to Nepal's civil aviation authority, there have been 914 fatalities from air crashes in the country since the first recorded disaster in August 1955.\n\nIn January of the previous year, a Yeti Airlines aircraft crashed in the resort city of Pokhara, resulting in the deaths of all 72 people on board, including five Indians. The crash was attributed to human error.\n\nOn January 15, 2023, a Yeti Airlines ATR-72 aircraft, registered as 9N-ANC, crashed into the Seti River bank between the old and new airports just minutes before landing.

(AP Photo/Prabin Ranabhat)\n\nKATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) -- A plane crashed Wednesday just after taking off from Nepal's capital, killing 18 people and injuring a pilot who was the lone survivor.\n\nAll the people aboard the Saurya Airlines flight including the co-pilot were Nepali except for one passenger, who was a Yemeni national, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal said. Authorities have pulled all 18 bodies from the wreckage, police official Basanta Rajauri said.\n\nThe Bombardier CRJ 200 plane was heading to Nepal's second-most populous city of Pokhara for maintenance work and most of the passengers aboard were either mechanics or airline employees, airport officials said. They were speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters.\n\nThe pilot has injuries to his eyes but his life is not in any danger, said a doctor at Kathmandu Medical College Hospital, where the pilot is being treated. The doctor spoke on condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to speak to reporters.\n\nThe plane took off from the Kathmandu airport at 11:11 a.m. local time and turned right but crashed moments later in the eastern section of the airport, the Civil Aviation Authority said in a statement.\n\n\"I came out and saw a plane had crashed and there was huge smoke and fire coming out,\" said Ram Kumar Khatri Chetri, who own a car parts store barely 100 meters (330 feet) from the crash site. \"There was chaos and confusion.\"\n\n\"It was just horrible and there was no way that anyone could just go near the plane and help out when there was so much fire and even explosions,\" he said.\n\nIt is the monsoon rain season in Kathmandu but was not raining at the time of the crash. Visibility was low across the capital, however.\n\nThe Kathmandu airport, the main airport serving Nepal, is inside a valley surrounded by mountains that make takeoffs and landings challenging for pilots. The airport is right next to the city, and is surrounded by houses and neighborhoods.\n\nThe bodies have been taken to the T.U. Teaching Hospital in Kathmandu for autopsy. The airline manifest showed there were two pilots and 17 passengers on board.\n\nGrieving relatives gathered at the hospital forensics department to collect the bodies of their loved ones, though they are not likely to be released for a day or two.\n\nThe co-pilot Sasant Katuwal had been flying only for the past three years after completing training in France, his uncle Dhyan Bahadur Khadka said at the hospital. He had just received a visa to go to Germany for further training and was excited about that, Khadka said.\n\nKhadka said his nephew had a bright future in aviation. \"His parents are grieving the loss of their only child,\" Khadka said. \"He was unmarried. He was not just tall and handsome, but he was well behaved,\"\n\nTribhuvan International Airport, the main airport in Nepal for international and domestic flights, was closed for hours as emergency crew and investigators began their work.\n\nSaurya Airlines operates the Bombardier CRJ 200 on domestic routes.\n\nIn 2019, a Bangladeshi airliner crashed at Tribhuvan airport, killing 51 people while 20 on board survived. An investigation confirmed the plane was misaligned with the runway and its pilot was disoriented and tried to land in \"sheer desperation\" when the plane crashed.\n\nIn 2015, a Turkish Airlines jet landing in dense fog skidded off a slippery runway at the airport. The plane was carrying 238 people but there were no serious injuries.\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nPinterest\n\nLinkedin", "source": {"uri": "wccbcharlotte.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WCCB

It is unclear why it crashed,\" said Mukesh Khanal, marketing head of Saurya Airlines.

it has been plagued by poor safety due to insufficient training and maintenance -- issues compounded by the mountainous republic's treacherous geography.\n\nThe European Union has banned all Nepali carriers from its airspace over safety concerns.\n\nThe Himalayan country has some of the world's trickiest runways to land on, flanked by snow-capped peaks with approaches that pose a challenge even for accomplished pilots.\n\nThe weather can also change quickly in the mountains, creating treacherous flying conditions.\n\nNepal's last major commercial flight accident was in January 2023, when a Yeti Airlines service crashed while landing at Pokhara, killing all 72 aboard.\n\nThat accident was Nepal's deadliest since 1992, when all 167 people aboard a Pakistan International Airlines plane died when it crashed on approach to Kathmandu airport.\n\nEarlier that year a Thai Airways aircraft had crashed near the same airport, killing 113 people.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

The flight had 19 people on board, including crew members. The sole survivor, Captain MR Shakya, was rushed to the hospital for medical treatment, airport spokesperson Subash Jha told the outlet.\n\nNepal Police said the aircraft was on its way to Pokhara for maintenance and all passengers were airline staff, The Kathmandu Post reported. According to its website, Saurya Airlines only uses one aircraft, the Bombardier CRJ 200, which can carry up to 50 passengers.\n\nThe cause of the accident is still unknown, Newsweek contacted local authorities for comment.\n\nEmergency response teams, including police and firefighters, undertook rescue operations at the crash site.\n\nNepal's airports are considered some of the most dangerous in the world. Tribhuvan International Airport in particular faces challenging geography as it's surrounded by gorges and valleys, making it difficult to navigate, the Economic Times reported. Concerns over the safety record of Nepalese airlines led the European Union to ban them from traveling to EU countries in 2013.\n\nA 2019 safety report from Nepal's Civil Aviation Authority found that \"the diversity of weather patterns together with hostile topography are the main challenges surrounding aircraft operations in Nepal.\"\n\nThe terrain is especially difficult for helicopters and small aircraft, which have 19 seats or less, according to the report. Nepal is home to the most challenging airports on the planet, as reported by Forbes, with Tenzin-Hillary Airport in Lukla at number one. This is due to issues such as strong winds, low pressure due to high altitude, and shorter runways.\n\nIn January 2023, Nepal saw its worst domestic plane crash in history, according to The Kathmandu Post.

The only survivor was the pilot, who was taken to Kathmandu Medical College Hospital for treatment, said a doctor at the hospital who was not authorized to speak to media.\n\nThe pilot has injuries to the eyes but is not in any danger, the doctor said.\n\nThe Saurya Airlines plane was heading from Kathmandu to the resort town of Pokhara.\n\nIt was not clear how it slipped.\n\nLocal media images showed smoke rising and plane wreckage scattered all over a ditch. A fire has been brought under control.\n\nTribhuvan International Airport, the main airport in Nepal for international and domestic flights, has been closed as emergency crew worked.\n\nIt is monsoon rainy season in Kathmandu but was not raining at the time of the crash.

A rescue operation was immediately carried out to extinguish the flames an pull people from the wreckage.\n\nPolice official Basanta Rajauri said 18 bodies were recovered, adding that the pilot was the only survivor. The pilot was taken to Kathmandu Medical College Hospital for treatment, a doctor at the hospital who was not authorised to speak to media said.\n\nThe doctor added that the pilot had injuries to the eyes as a result of the crash but was not in any danger. The 19 aboard included technical staff members and two crew members.\n\nAll bodies have been taken to the T.U. Teaching Hospital in Kathmandu for autopsy. The airline manifest showed there were two pilots and 17 passengers on board. The crew and 16 passengers were Nepali nationals and one passenger was identified as a Yemeni national.\n\nWhile the country is currently in the midst of monsoon season, it was not raining at the time of the crash, although visibility was low. The exact reason for the plane skidding has yet to be clarified.\n\nA press statement issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal said the Saurya Airlines domestic plane, which was scheduled to head to the resort town of Pokhara, took off at 11:11am local time from Kathmandu airport and turned right but crashed moments later in the eastern section of the airport.\n\nNepal has a poor track record when it comes to aviation safety, with at least 72 people killed in a Yeti Airlines crash in Pokhara in January last year. Flight 691 was making its final approach to the town from Kathmandu when it crashed into a river bank.\n\nThose on board included British national Ruan Calum Crighton, 34, with the passengers' final moments broadcast in a chilling Facebook live stream.

Sharma Oli, visited the crash site and asked people to \"be patient\" in a social media post, without elaborating. An emergency cabinet meeting was called to form a panel to probe the crash, a government spokesman said.\n\nEighteen of those on board the crashed 50-seater CRJ-200 aircraft, with the registration 9N-AME, were Nepali citizens while one engineer was from Yemen, Saurya said.\n\n\"Only the captain was rescued alive and is receiving treatment at a hospital,\" said Tej Bahadur Poudyal, the spokesman for Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport.\n\nTelevision visuals showed fire fighters trying to put out the blaze and thick black smoke rising into the sky.

The pilot of the plane was the lone survivor, national aviation officials said. He was being treated for serious injuries at a local hospital.\n\nA fire broke out on the aircraft not long after it took off from Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport, and it quickly crashed to the ground near one of the runways. The incident happened at around 11:15 local time (12:30 a.m. Eastern), according to a statement by the country's civil aviation authority.\n\nThe statement said the plane \"crashed on the east side of the runway\" and that the fire that had engulfed the aircraft \"was brought under control and the rescue work started immediately.\"\n\nVideos posted online showed the plane flying into the ground at a sharp angle, with its left wing pointed almost straight up into the air, crashing to the ground and being enveloped in flames. Dozens of rescuers, fire engines and ambulances arrived at the crash site, videos showed.\n\nAccording to authorities, rescuers found 18 bodies at the crash site. All of the victims were Nepali nationals apart from one Yemeni.\n\nThe plane belonged to Nepal's Saurya Airlines, which operates domestic flights between the country's five primary airports.

Footage shows the Bombardier CRJ 200 plane flying low over the runway before abruptly tilting sideways and descending nose-first toward the ground.\n\nUpon crashing, the aircraft erupted into a fireball, sending black smoke into the sky as shocked bystanders looked on from an airport shuttle bus. The Saurya Airlines plane was headed to the resort town of Pokhara when it skidded off the runway at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu during take-off at 11 a.m. local time.\n\nKilled in No Time\n\nAccording to officials, the plane was carrying two crew members and 17 technicians who were traveling to Pokhara to repair another aircraft. The pilot was the only survivor, with officials reporting that 18 people died in the crash. Photos showed him being carried away from the wreckage.\n\nVideos from the crash site show firefighters working to extinguish the flames and thick black smoke billowing into the sky.\n\nOther footage shows rescue workers searching through the scorched debris of the plane, scattered across lush green fields.\n\nLocal media footage also shows bodies being transported to ambulances on stretchers, while nearby residents watched in shock.\n\n\"Only the captain was rescued alive and is receiving treatment at a hospital,\" said Tej Bahadur Poudyal, the spokesman for Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport.\n\nThe pilot has been transported to Kathmandu Medical College Hospital for treatment, according to a doctor at the hospital who requested anonymity.\n\nThe doctor said that the pilot has eye injuries but that his life is not in danger. Tribhuvan International Airport, Nepal's primary airport for both international and domestic flights, has been shut down while emergency crews respond to the incident.\n\nAlthough it is the monsoon season in Kathmandu, it was not raining at the time of the crash. However, visibility was poor throughout the capital, though it remains unclear if this factor or another issue caused the plane to skid off the runway.\n\nShocking Scenes\n\nSaurya Airlines operates two Bombardier CRJ 200 aircraft on domestic routes, both of which are around 20 years old, according to Flight Radar 24. Nepal has faced criticism for its poor air safety record, with nearly 350 fatalities resulting from plane or helicopter crashes in the Himalayan nation since 2000.\n\nThe deadliest incident occurred in 1992 when a Pakistan International Airlines Airbus crashed into a hillside while approaching Kathmandu, resulting in 167 deaths.\n\nThe most recent tragedy took place on July 11, 2023, when a helicopter crash in central Nepal killed six people. The helicopter, which had left Solukhumbu district -- home to Mount Everest and other high peaks -- carried five Mexican nationals and one Nepali pilot.\n\nEarlier in the year, a Yeti Airlines crash in January claimed 72 lives and was later attributed to the pilots accidentally cutting off power. This was the deadliest air crash in the country since 1992.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times, Singapore Edition"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_ghosh@ibtimes.sg", "name": "R.

The only survivor is the pilot, who is currently receiving medical treatment.\n\nThe aircraft, operated by Saurya Airlines, was conducting a technical or maintenance flight from Kathmandu to Pokhara. Among the passengers were two crew members and 17 airline staff. The plane caught fire around 11 am, shortly after skidding off the runway during takeoff. According to a Nepali police spokesman, Dan Bahadur Karki, the fire engulfed the plane after it slipped off the runway, fell down an embankment, and failed to gain altitude.\n\nThe CRJ200 aircraft, designed to seat 50 passengers, was engulfed in flames near the airport. Videos from the crash site show massive plumes of smoke rising from the wreckage. Firefighters and Nepal Army personnel quickly responded to the scene to control the blaze.\n\nThe cause of the fire remains unknown at this time. Tribhuvan International Airport, known for its challenging location atop a plateau surrounded by deep gorges and valleys, is considered one of the riskiest airports globally.\n\nNepal's aviation sector is notorious for its poor safety record, often attributed to inadequate training and maintenance. This latest crash follows the 2023 Yeti Airlines disaster, where 72 people, including five Indians, lost their lives. It was Nepal's deadliest air crash since 1992, when a Pakistan International Airlines plane crashed near Kathmandu, killing all 167 people on board.", "source": {"uri": "lagatar24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lagatar English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saurya_Airlines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saurya Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribhuvan_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tribhuvan International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Runway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokhara", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Takeoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Levee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepali_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nepali Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeti_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yeti Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_International_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan International Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canyon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canyon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plateau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_accidents_and_incidents", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aviation accidents and incidents"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://lagatar24.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/img_2097-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758495", "eventUri": "eng-9758495", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

All those on board - 18 Nepalis and a Yemeni citizen - were employees of the carrier, according to police.\n\nImages from Nepal police showed thick smoke billowing from the burning aircraft on the the airport runway.\n\nThe aircraft crashed during takeoff from Kathmandu to the city of Pokhara around 11 a.m. local time, Bhul said. The plane was en route for technical maintenance, he added.\n\n\"Rescue efforts were started immediately and the situation was brought under control,\" the aviation authority said.\n\nThe crash once again highlights the dangers of air travel in Nepal, a country often referred to as one of the riskiest places to fly due to multiple factors including its mountainous terrain.\n\nThe Himalayan country, home to eight of the world's 14 highest mountains including Everest, has a record of air accidents. Its weather can change suddenly, and airstrips are typically sited in difficult-to-reach, mountainous areas.\n\nAircraft with 19 seats or fewer are more likely to have accidents due to these difficulties, according to a 2019 safety report from the Civil Aviation Authority.\n\nWhile the country has made improvements in safety standards in recent years, challenges remain, and a lack of investment in aging aircraft only adds to the risks of flying.\n\nLast year, Nepal saw its worst plane crash in more than 30 years when at least 68 people died when a Yeti Airlines flight went down near Pokhara.\n\nIn May 2022, a Tara Air flight departing from Pokhara crashed into a mountain, killing 22 people.\n\nIn early 2018, a US-Bangla Airlines flight from Bangladesh's capital Dhaka to Kathmandu crashed on landing and caught fire, killing 51 people.\n\nAnd in 2016, a Tara Air flight crashed while flying the same route as the 2023 crash.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

They also showed the plane flying a little above the runway and then tilting before it crashed.\n\nOther visuals showed rescue workers rummaging through the charred remains of the plane, strewn in lush green fields. Bodies were carried to ambulances on stretchers as residents looked on, the television showed.\n\nOfficials said the airport was closed temporarily.\n\nA Saurya Airlines official said the plane was a 50-seater CRJ200 aircraft.\n\nAccording to Flight Radar 24 flight tracking, Saurya currently operates two CRJ-200 regional jets, a program owned by Canada's Bombardier but bought by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in 2020.\n\nSaurya says it has another CRJ200 in its fleet, but it has not flown for a long time.\n\nBombardier referred questions about the incident to Canada-based MHI RJ Aviation Group (MHIRJ), which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nEstablished in 2014, Saurya says on its website that it has introduced the \"jet experience\" on Nepal's domestic routes and that it flies to five destinations.\n\nNepal has been criticized for a poor air safety record, and nearly 350 people have died in helicopter or plane crashes in the Himalayan country since

It's believed that only the pilot survived and is currently receiving treatment for injuries.\n\nThe aircraft, owned by domestic carrier Saurya Airlines, was en route from Kathmandu to the resort town of Pokhara, as reported by Nepal Television. The cause of the plane's skid remains unclear and the final casualty count is yet to be confirmed, reports the Mirror.\n\nAccording to the Himalayan Times, the 19 individuals on board were technical staff, with no commercial passengers present.

We are in the process of taking them for post-mortem.\"\n\nThe flight was being conducted for either technical or maintenance purposes, Gyanendra Bhul of Nepal's Civil Aviation Authority told AFP without giving further details.\n\nBahadur and Bhul were unable to confirm the nationality of the sole foreigner aboard.\n\nImages of the aftermath shared by Nepal's military showed the plane's fuselage split apart and burnt to a husk.\n\nAround a dozen soldiers in camouflage were standing on top of the wreckage with the surrounding earth coated in fire retardant.\n\nThe plane crashed at around 11:15 am (0530 GMT), the military said in a statement, adding that the army's quick response team had been lending assistance with rescue efforts.\n\nNews portal Khabarhub reported that the airplane had caught fire after skidding on the runway.\n\nThe plane was scheduled to fly on Nepal's busiest air route between Kathmandu and Pokhara, an important tourism hub in the Himalayan republic.\n\nSaurya Airlines exclusively flies Bombardier CRJ 200 jets, according to its website.\n\n- Plagued by poor safety -\n\nNepal's air industry has boomed in recent years, carrying goods and people between hard-to-reach areas as well as foreign trekkers and climbers.\n\nBut it has been plagued by poor safety due to insufficient training and maintenance -- issues compounded by the mountainous republic's treacherous geography.\n\nThe European Union has banned all Nepali carriers from its airspace over safety concerns.\n\nThe Himalayan country has some of the world's trickiest runways to land on, flanked by snow-capped peaks with approaches that pose a challenge even for accomplished pilots.\n\nThe weather can also change quickly in the mountains, creating treacherous flying conditions.\n\nNepal's last major commercial flight accident was in January 2023, when a Yeti Airlines service crashed while landing at Pokhara, killing all 72 aboard.\n\nThat accident was Nepal's deadliest since 1992, when all 167 people aboard a Pakistan International Airlines plane died when it crashed on approach to Kathmandu airport.\n\nEarlier that year a Thai Airways aircraft had crashed near the same airport, killing 113 people.\n\npm/gle/mtp", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paavan_mathema@ktbs.com", "name": "Paavan

Fire engines and ambulances were rushed to the spot after the incident.\n\nThe deceased were identified as co-pilot S Katuwal and employees of Saurya Airlines and a Yemeni national (Aref Reda). Pilot Captain Manish Shakya, 37, is undergoing treatment at Kathmandu Model Hospital.\n\nOf the deceased, 15 died on the spot while three died during treatment at a local hospital, authorities said.\n\nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli and Home Minister Ramesh Lekh separately visited the accident site to gather details about the incident and provide necessary directives.\n\nOli said he was deeply saddened by the tragic deaths in the crash and was at the site to inquire about the cause of the air crash with the Civil Aviation Authority's officials. He urged all for patience at this hour of grief.\n\nAccording to Tribhuvan International Airport chief Jagannath Niraula, the plane flying from Kathmandu to Pokhara turned in the wrong direction.\n\n\"As soon as it took off, it turned right instead of turning left,\" Niraula was quoted as saying by the BBC News Nepali.\n\nHowever, \"the cause of the accident has not been revealed yet,\" he said.\n\nThe accident happened less than a minute after the plane took off, Niraula said.\n\nThe aircraft \"suffered a runway excursion and burst into massive flames immediately\", the Search and Rescue Centre of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal earlier said.\n\nThe aircraft, manufactured by the Canadian company Bombardier in April 2003, was the sixth of its kind purchased for use in Nepal, according to information from planesspotters.com.\n\nFollowing the accident, services at the Kathmandu airport were halted briefly before being resumed, the airport authorities said.\n\nAccording to the company's website, Saruya Airlines operates flights to five tourist destinations within Nepal, with a fleet of three Bombardier CRJ-200 jets.\n\nNepal has been criticised for its poor air safety record in recent years but the reasons also include partly sudden weather changes and partly airstrips located in hard-to-access rocky terrains apart from human error.\n\nAccording to Nepal's civil aviation body, 914 people have died in air crashes in the country since the first disaster was recorded in August 1955.\n\nIn January last year, all 72 people on board, including five Indians, were killed when a Yeti Airlines aircraft crashed in the resort city of Pokhara. The crash was attributed to a human error.\n\nYeti Airlines' 9N-ANC ATR-72 aircraft crashed on the bank of the Seti River between the old airport and the new airport minutes before landing on January 15, 2023, which was the 104th crash in Nepali skies and the third biggest in terms of casualties.\n\nThe only incidents in which more people were killed took place in July and September 1992. Those crashes involved aircraft of Thai Airways and Pakistan International Airlines and left 113 and 167 people dead, respectively.\n\nOn May 29, 2022, all 22 people on board, including four members of an Indian family, were killed as a Tara Air plane crashed in Nepal's mountainous Mustang district.\n\nIn 2016, all 23 people aboard were killed when a plane of the same airline flying the same route crashed after takeoff.\n\nIn March 2018, a US-Bangla Air crash occurred at the Tribhuvan International Airport, killing 51 people on board.

Out of the 19 people onboard, only one - the pilot - survived the horror crash. Images show the passenger plane erupting into flames, with plumes of thick black smoke filling the air. Airport staff on the tarmac could only look on in fear as the aircraft nosedived into a field, shouting out in terror.\n\nBrave individuals on the ground rushed to the smouldering wreckage, while rescue teams desperately tried to save crew and passengers who, just seconds before, had been flying through the air, en route to Nepal's tourist hotspot, Pokhara.\n\nEmergency services managed to extinguish the furious fire that had engulfed the plane and all those onboard, but it was too late. For the majority of those on the decimated jet, nothing could be done.\n\nPolice official Basanta Rajauri has since confirmed that sole survivor, named by The Sun as Captain MR Shakya, suffered injuries to his eyes, but otherwise escaped unscathed. He has since been taken to Kathmandu Medical College Hospital, in Sinamangal, for treatment. His co-pilot was amongst the deceased.\n\nHarrowing footage taken at the scene of the crash shows lifeless bodies being carried to ambulances on stretchers as locals looked on. The remains of all those who perished have since been taken to the T.U. Teaching Hospital in Kathmandu, where autopsies will be carried out.\n\nReuters reports that the plane had been carrying two crew members and 17 technicians, and had been travelling to Pokhara airport, for regular maintanence. The new airport, which only opened in January, is equipped with aircraft maintenance hangars. Out of the 19 individuas on the doomed flight, 18 were citizens of Nepal, while one engineer was from Yemen.\n\nIn a statement, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal said: \"Shortly after takeoff ... the aircraft veered off to the right and crashed on the east side of the runway.\" Meanwhile, Mukesh Khanal, Saurya Airlines' marketing chief, stated: \"The plane was scheduled to undergo maintenance for a month beginning Thursday ... It is unclear why it crashed.\"\n\nFollowing a temporary closure, Kathmandu airport reopened within hours of the tragedy, according to officials. A Saurya Airlines official has confirmed that the destroyed jet had been a 50-seater CRJ-200 aircraft with the registration 9N-AME\n\nNepal has previously faced criticism for its poor record when it comes to aircraft safety, with the country recording nearly 350 fatalities due to plane or helicopter crashes since 2000. The deadliest crashed occurred in 1992, when a Pakistan International Airlines Airbus collided into a hillside while approaching Kathmandu, resulting in the deaths of 167 people.\n\nDo you have a story to share?

Visibility was low across the capital, however.\n\nThe Kathmandu airport, the main airport serving Nepal, is located inside a valley surrounded by mountains on most sides. It is considered a challenging airport for pilots as bigger planes have to come through an opening on the mountain to land. It is right next to the city, and is surrounded by houses and neighborhoods.\n\nThe bodies have been taken to the T.U. Teaching Hospital in Kathmandu for autopsy. The airline manifest showed there were two pilots and 17 passengers on board. The crew and 16 passengers were Nepali nationals and one passenger was identified as a Yemeni national.\n\nTribhuvan International Airport, the main airport in Nepal for international and domestic flights, has been closed as emergency crew and investigators began their work.\n\nSaurya Airlines operates the Bombardier CRJ 200 on domestic routes.\n\nIn 2019, a Bangladeshi airliner crashed at Tribhuvan airport, killing 51 people while 20 on board survived. An investigation confirmed the plane was misaligned with the runway and its pilot was disoriented and tried to land in \"sheer desperation\" when the plane crashed.\n\nIn 2015, a Turkish Airlines jet landing in dense fog skidded off a slippery runway at the airport.

In fact the European Airlines has banned all Nepali airlines from entering its airspace since 2013, due to safety concerns. After Wednesday's crash in Kathmandu, it does not seem that this ban is going to be lifted any time soon.\n\nJuly 2024: The plane crash at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu involved an airplane of the Saurya airlines. The plane was headed to Pokhara. There were 19 people onboard the plane, of which 18 are reportedly dead. The plane caught fire during take, said initial reports. Though how exactly did it catch fire, remains unknown.\n\nJanuary 2023: In January 2023, a Yeti Airlines plane flying from Kathmandu to Pokhara, crashed while landing. There were 72 people onboard the flight, all of whom lost their lives in the accident. The flight crashed on the banks of the Seti Gandak River. The crash reportedly happened in the Gandaki Province between the old Pokhara Airport and the new Pokhara International Airport.

Seventeen of the passengers were Nepalis -- including one child -- while one passenger was Yemeni, the airport's rescue coordination center said in a news release.\n\nMost of those on board were airline maintenance workers, Karki said, adding that the pilot, the sole survivor, was admitted to a hospital in stable condition.\n\nThe Bombardier CRJ 200 was flying for maintenance to Pokhara, a resort town that is a 25-minute flight west of Kathmandu, said Subash Jha, a spokesman for Tribhuvan International Airport.

Fire engines and ambulances were rushed to the spot after the incident.\n\nThe deceased were identified as co-pilot S Katuwal and 17 employees of the Saurya Airlines, including a Nepali female and a Yemeni national. Pilot captain Manish Shakya, 37, is undergoing treatment at Kathmandu Model Hospital.\n\nOf the deceased, 15 died on the spot while three died during treatment at a local hospital, authorities said.\n\nFollowing the accident, services at the Kathmandu airport were halted briefly before being resumed, the airport authorities said.\n\nSaruya Airlines operates flights to five tourist destinations within Nepal, with a fleet of three Bombardier CRJ-200 jets, according to the company's website.\n\nNepal has been criticised for its poor air safety record in recent years but the reasons also include partly sudden weather changes and partly airstrips located in hard-to-access rocky terrains apart from human error.\n\nAccording to Nepal's civil aviation body, 914 people have died in air crashes in the country since the first disaster was recorded in August 1955.\n\nIn January last year, all 72 people on board, including five Indians, were killed when a Yeti Airlines aircraft crashed in the resort city of Pokhara. The crash was attributed to a human error.\n\nYeti Airlines' 9N-ANC ATR-72 aircraft crashed on the bank of the Seti River between the old airport and the new airport minutes before landing on January 15, 2023, which was the 104th crash in Nepali skies and third biggest in terms of casualties.\n\nThe only incidents in which more people were killed took place in July and September 1992. Those crashes involved aircraft of Thai Airways and Pakistan International Airlines and left 113 and 167 people dead, respectively.\n\nOn May 29, 2022, all 22 people on board, including four members of an Indian family, were killed as a Tara Air plane crashed in Nepal's mountainous Mustang district.\n\nIn 2016, all 23 people aboard were killed when a plane of the same airline flying the same route crashed after takeoff.\n\nIn March 2018, a US-Bangla Air crash occurred at the Tribhuvan International Airport, killing 51 people on board.

The airline manifest showed there were two pilots and 17 passengers on board.\n\nGrieving relatives gathered at the hospital forensics department to collect the bodies of their loved ones, though they are not likely to be released for a day or two.\n\nThe co-pilot Sasant Katuwal had been flying only for the past three years after completing training in France, his uncle Dhyan Bahadur Khadka said at the hospital. He had just received a visa to go to Germany for further training and was excited about that, Khadka said.\n\nKhadka said his nephew had a bright future in aviation. \"His parents are grieving the loss of their only child,\" Khadka said. \"He was unmarried.

The pilot has injuries to his eyes but his life is not in any danger, said a doctor at Kathmandu Medical College Hospital, where the pilot is being treated. The doctor spoke on condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to speak to media.\n\nA press statement issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal said the Saurya Airlines domestic plane, which was scheduled to head to the resort town of Pokhara, took off at 11:11 a.m. local time from Kathmandu airport and turned right but crashed moments later in the eastern section of the airport.\n\nIt is monsoon rain season in Kathmandu but was not raining at the time of the crash. Visibility was low across the capital, however.\n\nThe Kathmandu airport, the main airport serving Nepal, is located inside a valley surrounded by mountains on most sides. It is considered a challenging airport for pilots and bigger planes have to come through an opening on the mountain to land. It is right next to the city, and is surrounded by houses and neighborhoods.\n\nThe bodies have been taken to the T.U. Teaching Hospital in Kathmandu for autopsy. The airline manifest showed there were two pilots and 17 passengers on board. The crew and 16 passengers were Nepali nationals and one passenger was identified as a Yemeni national.\n\nTribhuvan International Airport, the main airport in Nepal for international and domestic flights, has been closed as emergency crew and investigators began their work.\n\nSaurya Airlines operates the Bombardier CRJ 200 on domestic routes.\n\nIn 2019, a Bangladeshi airliner crashed at Tribhuvan airport, killing 51 people while 20 on board survived. An investigation confirmed the plane was misaligned with the runway and its pilot was disoriented and tried to land in \"sheer desperation\" when the plane crashed.\n\nIn 2015, a Turkish Airlines jet landing in dense fog skidded off a slippery runway at the airport. The plane was carrying 238 people but there were no serious injuries.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Its weather can change suddenly, and airstrips are typically sited in difficult-to-reach, mountainous areas.\n\nAircraft with 19 seats or fewer are more likely to have accidents due to these difficulties, according to a 2019 safety report from the Civil Aviation Authority.\n\nWhile the country has made improvements in safety standards in recent years, challenges remain, and a lack of investment in aging aircraft only adds to the risks of flying.\n\nLast year, Nepal saw its worst plane crash in more than 30 years when at least 68 people died when a Yeti Airlines flight went down near Pokhara.\n\nIn May 2022, a Tara Air flight departing from Pokhara crashed into a mountain, killing 22 people.\n\nIn early 2018, a US-Bangla Airlines flight from Bangladesh's capital Dhaka to Kathmandu crashed on landing and caught fire, killing 51 people.\n\nAnd in 2016, a Tara Air flight crashed while flying the same route as the 2023 crash.", "source": {"uri": "nairaland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nairaland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Runway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saurya_Airlines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saurya Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribhuvan_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tribhuvan International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyanendra_of_Nepal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gyanendra of Nepal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nepal Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Takeoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Himalayas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Everest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mount Everest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_accidents_and_incidents", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation accidents and incidents"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokhara", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US-Bangla_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US-Bangla Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tara_Air", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tara Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeti_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yeti Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aerodrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 50}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758495", "eventUri": "eng-9758495", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

On Wednesday (July 24), 18 people died in a Saurya Airlines accident when the Pokhara-bound aircraft suffered a runaway excursion during takeoff from Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport.\n\nThere were a total of 19 people, including two crew members, in the flight when it took off around 11 am on Wednesday to get its broken engine repaired at Pokhara, but only the pilot of the aircraft could be saved while all others have died.\n\nNepal is known for its picturesque landscape that lures tourists but the country's air transport sector has been plagued by multiple accidents and crashes.\n\nSince 2000, as many as 360 people have been killed in Nepal in at least 19 air crashes. Wednesday's crash at Kathmandu's TIA has added to the long list.\n\nNepal and its bitter history of plane crashes\n\nOn January 15, 2023, Nepal witnessed its worst aviation disaster since 1992 after a Yeti Airlines twin-engine ATR 72-500 aircraft which took off from Tribhuvan International Airport with 72 people, including four crew members, on board crashed on the Seti River gorge between the old and new airport in central city of Pokhara.\n\nFor the unversed, in 1992, all 167 people aboard a Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) plane were killed when it ploughed into a hill as it tried to land in Kathmandu.\n\nRescue officials could only manage to recover 71 bodies with the other missing passenger presumed to be dead. Among those who were killed in the accident, five were Indians.\n\nAlso Read: 18 dead as plane with 'broken' engine crashes during takeoff in Nepal's Kathmandu\n\nAs per the earlier reports the Yeti airplane had crashed just '10 to 20 seconds' before landing. An analysis of the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder had shown the propellers of both engines went into \"feather in the base leg of descending.\"\n\nHowever, in December last year, a government-appointed investigation panel revealed that the Yeti Airlines crash in 2023 was due to \"pilot error\".\n\nWhy are there so many plane crashes in Nepal?\n\nThere are a host of reasons why flying in Nepal is not just tricky but dangerous. The top-most being the country's topography.\n\nNepal, situated between India and China, boasts of having eight of the world's 14 highest mountains, including Mt Everest, and the country's beautiful rugged landscapes make it a popular tourist destination for trekkers.\n\nBut as much as it is good for tourism, it is risky for airplanes. An earlier report by ANI quoted Captain Amit Singh, a commercial pilot and founder of Safety Matters Foundation, as saying that Kathmandu is a valley, it is like a bowl and the airport in the city is in between, surrounded by mountains, high mountains on all sides. \"So it is a very challenging airfield,\" he added.\n\nAirports in the country are built in mountainous regions and therefore, have shorter runways.\n\nIn 2019, Nepal's civil aviation authority released a safety report where it admitted that the country's \"diversity of weather patterns together with hostile topography are the main challenges surrounding aircraft operations in Nepal due to which the number of accidents related to small aircraft... seems comparatively higher\".\n\nThe take-off and landing statistically are more dangerous in Nepal than other parts of flight as it has to be done at high altitudes. The low air density decreases the performance of a flight and makes it more difficult to slow down.\n\nNot just this, Nepal also experiences sudden changes in weather. Also, with odd weather conditions, visibility becomes a major hurdle for pilots flying in the region.\n\nPilots, earlier, have even voiced concerns saying that the smaller aircraft used in the region aren't equipped with the technology to detect the unpredictable conditions, making flying an even riskier proposition.\n\nAging fleet\n\nNepal, one of the poorer countries in the world, depends heavily on aging airplanes for its domestic flights. Surprisingly, almost all of these aircrafts are not equipped with the mandatory modern devices including radar and GPS technology that can help mitigate problems with visibility or weather.\n\nThe Yeti Airlines plane which crashed in January 2023 was 15 years old.\n\nNepali airlines banned by EU\n\nSince 1960, Nepal has been a member of the UN's International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) which obliges the country to abide by the international conventions, regulations, standards, and recommended practices in aviation safety.\n\nDespite making significant efforts to enhance safety, Nepal aviation industry's safety record still does not match up with the requirements of other civil aviation authorities.\n\nTherefore, Nepali airlines have been banned from operating in the European Union's airspace since 2013 and Nepal, till date, remains on the EU Air Safety list.\n\nA look at Nepal plane & helicopter crashes history\n\nJuly 24, 2024\n\nAt least 18 people were killed when a Bombardier CRJ 200 plane crashed and caught fire while taking off from Kathmandu.\n\nJuly 11, 2023\n\nSix people were killed in a helicopter crash in central Nepal.

The plane had 19 people on board, and only one pilot survived. It has now been reported that three members of the same family were among those who lost their lives in the crash.\n\nAccording to a statement from the airline, the ill-fated flight was carrying flight maintenance staff Manuraj Sharma, his wife Prija Khatiwada, and their four-year-old son Adhiraj Sharma. All three perished in the crash. The statement added that Prija was also a government employee, working as an assistant computer operator in the Ministry of Energy. Notably, 17 of the deceased were staff members of Saurya Airlines.\n\nCaptain M.R. Shakya, 37, was the sole survivor of the crash and has been rescued from the crash site. He is currently receiving treatment at the hospital. The aircraft involved was a Bombardier CRJ-200ER, built in 2003, and was being transported for maintenance. The airline stated that the plane was heading to Pokhara for a technical inspection after repairs. The plane took off from Runway 2 but crashed on Runway 20.\n\nAlso Read: Watch: CCTV Footage Captures Plane Crash At Kathmandu Airport\n\nPlane crashes are not a new issue in Nepal.

Additionally, they displayed the jet hovering just above the runway before it tipped to the right and crashed.\n\nVideo from Reuters showed locals watching as rescue personnel searched through the burned out wreckage of the aircraft, which was scattered across verdant fields, and as bodies were transferred to ambulances on stretchers.\n\n\"On Thursday, the aircraft was to undergo a month-long maintenance program. The cause of the crash is unknown, according to Saurya Airlines' marketing head Mukesh Khanal.\n\nThe accident momentarily shuttered the Kathmandu airport, but authorities reported it reopened in a few of hours.\n\nThe aircraft, registered 9N-AME, is a 50-seater Bombardier CRJ-200, according to a Saurya Airlines representative.\n\nAs per the flight tracking provided by Flightradar24, Saurya is presently flying two CRJ-200 regional planes, which were previously held by Bombardier Canada before being acquired by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in 2020.\n\nA second CRJ-200 is reportedly in Saurya's fleet.\n\nThe Canadian company MHI RJ Aviation Group, to which Bombardier forwarded inquiries regarding the incident, did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nSince its establishment in 2014, Saurya has reportedly brought the \"jet experience\" to Nepal's domestic routes and offers flights to five locations, according to its website.\n\nMany airlines in the Himalayan nation operate to tiny airports in isolated slopes and close to cloud-covered peaks, contributing to Nepal's dismal record for air safety. Eight of the world's fourteen highest mountain summits are located in Nepal.\n\nThe nation's primary airport is surrounded by mountains and is situated in the centre of the Kathmandu Valley. This affects the direction and strength of the wind in the area, making takeoff and landing difficult for pilots.\n\nSince 2000, there have been about 350 fatal plane or helicopter crashes in Nepal.

safety concerns.\n\nThe Himalayan country has some of the world's trickiest runways to land on, flanked by snow-capped peaks with approaches that pose a challenge even for accomplished pilots.\n\nThe weather can also change quickly in the mountains, creating treacherous flying conditions.\n\nNepal's last major commercial flight accident was in January 2023, when a Yeti Airlines service crashed while landing at Pokhara, killing all 72 aboard.\n\nThat accident was Nepal's deadliest since 1992, when all 167 people aboard a Pakistan International Airlines plane died when it crashed on approach

Fire engines and ambulances were rushed to the spot after the incident.\n\nOf the deceased, 15 died on the spot while three died during treatment at a local hospital, authorities said.\n\nThe bodies of the deceased have been shifted to Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital for post-mortem. The relatives of the victims are gathered outside the hospital, mourning their loss.\n\nPilot Captain Shakya, the 37-year-old who is the lone survivor in the crash, is undergoing treatment at Kathmandu Model Hospital.\n\nOfficials at the Kathmandu Medical Hospital (KMC) said that Captain Shakya remains in critical condition following injuries sustained in the accident.\n\nCaptain Shakya is currently undergoing a crucial eye and spinal cord surgery and is admitted to the Neuro-Intensive Care Unit (ICU), as reported by the KMC Hospital.\n\nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli and Home Minister Ramesh Lekh separately visited the accident site to gather details about the incident and provide necessary directives.\n\nOli said he was deeply saddened by the tragic deaths in the crash and was at the site to inquire about the cause of the air crash with the Civil Aviation Authority's officials. He urged all for patience at this hour of grief.\n\nAccording to Tribhuvan International Airport chief Jagannath Niraula, the plane flying from Kathmandu to Pokhara turned in the wrong direction.\n\n\"As soon as it took off, it turned right instead of turning left,\" Niraula was quoted as saying by the BBC News Nepali.\n\nHowever, \"the cause of the accident has not been revealed yet,\" he said.\n\nThe accident happened less than a minute after the plane took off, Niraula said.\n\nA Cabinet meeting held in Singhadurbar decided to form a five-member committee led by former director-general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal Ratish Chandra Lal Suman to investigate the crash.\n\nThe committee includes Captain Deepu Jwarchan from Nepal Airlines, engineer Sanjay Adhikari from Shree Airlines, assistant professor Sudip Bhattarai from Pulchowk Engineering Campus, and technical officer Mukesh Dangol from the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation.\n\nThe committee has been given 45 days to submit a report.\n\nThe aircraft, manufactured by the Canadian company Bombardier in April 2003, was the sixth of its kind purchased for use in Nepal, according to information from planesspotters.com.\n\nFollowing the accident, services at the Kathmandu airport were halted briefly before being resumed, the airport authorities said.\n\nAccording to the company's website, Saruya Airlines operates flights to five tourist destinations within Nepal, with a fleet of three Bombardier CRJ-200 jets.\n\nNepal has been criticised for its poor air safety record in recent years but the reasons also include partly sudden weather changes and partly airstrips located in hard-to-access rocky terrains apart from human error.\n\nAccording to Nepal's civil aviation body, 914 people have died in air crashes in the country since the first disaster was recorded in August 1955.\n\nIn January last year, all 72 people on board, including five Indians, were killed when a Yeti Airlines aircraft crashed in the resort city of Pokhara. The crash was attributed to a human error.\n\nYeti Airlines' 9N-ANC ATR-72 aircraft crashed on the bank of the Seti River between the old airport and the new airport minutes before landing on January 15, 2023, which was the 104th crash in Nepali skies and the third biggest in terms of casualties.\n\nThe only incidents in which more people were killed took place in July and September 1992. Those crashes involved aircraft of Thai Airways and Pakistan International Airlines and left 113 and 167 people dead, respectively.\n\nOn May 29, 2022, all 22 people on board, including four members of an Indian family, were killed as a Tara Air plane crashed in Nepal's mountainous Mustang district.\n\nIn 2016, all 23 people aboard were killed when a plane of the same airline flying the same route crashed after takeoff.\n\nIn March 2018, a US-Bangla Air crash occurred at the Tribhuvan International Airport, killing 51 people on board.", "source": {"uri": "siasat.com", "dataType": "news",

The EU had barred all Nepal airlines from operating in European airspace in December 2013; a decade later, the blanket ban continues.\n\nA major plane crash took place in Nepal's Kathmandu on Wednesday (24th July). According to a report in Kathmandu Post, an aircraft belonging to Saurya Airlines crashed during takeoff at the Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) in Kathmandu. 19 people, including crew members, were onboard the plane when it crashed at around 11 am. As per preliminary information, eighteen bodies have been recovered from the crash site while several reports have confirmed multiple casualties, some reports have claimed that these 18 people have died in this crash.\n\nAccording to a report in the Himalayan Times, the plane was only carrying the technical staff of the airline. An information officer at the TIA, Gyanendra Bhul said that there were no passengers on board but the plane was carrying a few technical staff.\n\nTIA Spokesperson Subash Jha said that the accident occurred after the Pokhara-bound flight suffered a runway excursion during takeoff. Jha added that Captain MR Shakya was rushed to the hospital without giving further details.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, the plane suddenly flipped when it was taking off from the Southern end of the runway (Koteshwor side). Moments later, its wing tip hit the ground and the aircraft immediately caught fire. It then plunged into a gorge on the eastern side of the runway between Buddha Air hanger and the radar station, the eyewitnesses recounted.\n\nPolice and firefighters are carrying out rescue operations at the accident site. According to reports citing officials, the fire has been doused.\n\nMeanwhile, the flight was en route to Pokhara, an important tourism hub in Nepal. According to its website, Saurya Airlines exclusively flies Bombardier CRJ 200 jets.\n\nThe aviation industry in the Himalayan nation has been witnessing significant growth in recent years but it has been plagued by concerns about safety.\n\nLast year in January, Nepal suffered one of the deadliest plane crashes in more than 3 decades. The accident took place when an ATR 72 aircraft belonging to Yeti Airlines crashed near Pokhara. 72 people, including passengers and crew members, were onboard the plane when it crashed. All of them lost their lives in the crash. In an alarming display of the lack of pilot training, the crash investigation later revealed that the plane crashed because the pilot pulled the 'wrong lever'.\n\nAccording to data from the Aviation Safety Network (ASN), it was the third-deadliest crash in Nepal's history. Around 167 people died after Pakistan International Airlines crashed in Nepal in September 1992. A few months earlier, the country lost 113 people when Thai Airways crashed in July 1992.\n\nMeanwhile, on 29th May 2022, a Tara Air plane crashed in the Mustang district. All 22 passengers onboard the plane had lost their lives in that crash.\n\nIn 2018, around 51 people died and 20 others sustained serious injuries when a US-Bangla Airlines flight crash-landed incidentally at today's crash site, Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) in Kathmandu.\n\nStrikingly, on average, Nepal has suffered one flight disaster a year. Since 2010, the country has witnessed at least 12 fatal plane crashes, including today's crash. Additionally, according to the ASN database, Nepal has witnessed about 27 plane crashes over the past three decades, excluding today's crash. According to some reports, Nepal has seen over 100 crashes overall in its aviation history.\n\nConspicuously, the European Union has banned all Nepali carriers from its airspace citing significant safety concerns. The EU had barred all Nepal airlines from operating in European airspace in December 2013; a decade later, the blanket ban continues.\n\nIn December 2023, the European Commission (EC), part of the European Union executive, extended the decade-long ban on Nepalese airlines. The EC continued its ban on Nepali airlines through an updated \"EU Air Safety List,\" the list of non-European airlines that do not meet international safety standards. Such airlines are subjected to an operating ban or operational restrictions within the European Union.\n\nNotably, the EU Air Safety List is based on the opinion of aviation safety experts of its member states. After a meeting of the EU Air Safety Committee was held in Brussels on November 14-16, the body extended the ban on Nepalese airlines.\n\nAccording to an official document dated 30th May 2024, all Nepalese airline carriers (in Annexure-A) getting approval from Nepal's civil aviation authority have been banned from operating in Europe.\n\nMeanwhile, according to The Kathmandu Post, insiders said that the extended ban spoke volumes about the negligence that had resulted from the corrupt system in Nepal.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that for a long time, over 15 years, the Nepalese government has been dilly-dallying on safety concerns and mitigation steps suggested by the global aviation watchdogs. They have constantly raised questions on the civil aviation body's dual role and urged the Himalayan nation to split the organisation into two entities - one that will provide services and another that would regulate it to enhance the safety of flyers. While the bills have reached Parliament on several occasions in the last decade, no government has so far passed them to lose the dual benefits they enjoy because of it.\n\nInsiders said that there is larger politics that prevent the bills from becoming law. They stated that once the civil aviation body is separated, some top position holders will lose the dual benefits they have been enjoying.\n\nAccording to the Kathmandu Post report, the existing system allows the Director General of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) to issue tenders for multi-billion-dollar projects. The DG also oversees compliance with projects and aviation regulations governing the issuance of licences to airlines and crews, making it prone to overlooking concerns of mismanagement and corruption.\n\nAn aviation expert said, \"We cannot blame airlines when the role of the regulator itself has come under question.\"\n\nAn aviation expert, who wished not to be named, said, \"Why would the EC lift the ban? There have been no substantial improvements in Nepal's aviation sector.\"\n\nThe expert added, \"People are dying in the world's safest mode of transport. Crashes in Nepal keep happening and there are no concrete efforts to prevent them.\"\n\nThere are concerns about corruption, poor training manuals for airline staff and pilots, data management, and lack of oversight by independent experts. As highlighted above, one of the deadliest plane crashes, in January 2023, was a result of the pilot's inaction as he pulled the 'wrong lever' leading to the death of 72 individuals.\n\nAdditionally, there have been allegations and reports that Nepalese airline carriers opt for old fleets and purchase retarded or old planes at junk prices, overlooking safety concerns.\n\nIncidentally, Nepal's anti-graft body, the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) has been probing a case against 30 individuals and two firms in connection with the 2017 purchase of two wide-body aircraft for the Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC), the national flag bearer. The allegations involve corruption, tweaking terms of agreements to purchase cheaper planes for profiteering and corruption rather than modern-state of the of-the-art planes.\n\nIncidentally, for several years, Nepal has been trying to discard 6 planes it had brought from China less than a decade ago, from 2014 to 2018. However, it has failed at least twice to sell these planes even at junk prices.\n\nAccording to The Kathmandu Post, one of the 'Chinese' planes crashed in Nepalgunj. The five planes have been grounded at the remote parking bay on the eastern side of TIA in Kathmandu since 2020 and had been gathering rust.\n\nWith an alarming one plane crash every year on average, the Himalayan nation has again suffered a major tragic accident killing reportedly 18 people. For Nepal, it is a call for action time to overhaul its aviation sector to safeguard itself from aviation disasters.", "source": {"uri": "opindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OpIndia"},

Its aviation safety record is so poor that all its airlines are banned from flying to most of Europe.", "body": "18 people have died after a small passenger plane crashed during takeoff in Kathmandu, Nepal. Nepal has a poor aviation safety record and all of its airlines are banned from European airspace. Kathmandu's challenging weather and high altitude make it a difficult place to fly, an expert told BI.\n\n18 people have died after a small passenger airplane crashed during takeoff in Nepal's capital city, Kathmandu.\n\nThe plane's captain is the only remaining survivor of the 19 onboard, including two crew members and 17 technicians of the airline, who were traveling to Pokhara, reportedly for aircraft maintenance.\n\nThe Saurya Airlines flight skidded off the runway at approximately 11.15 a.m. local time, according to The Kathmandu Post.\n\nAll 18 bodies have been recovered from the crash site at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Nepal. The pilot, Captain Manish Ratna Shkya, was rescued and is being treated for injuries at Kathmandu Medical College and Teaching Hospital.\n\nVideos and photos posted online showed billows of black smoke emerging from the wreckage of the plane, then on fire but since put out by firefighters.\n\nThe search and rescue coordination of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal said in a recently released statement that the plane \"veered off to the right and crashed on the east side of the runway.\"\n\n\"Rescue operations were initiated immediately,\" it said. \"The fire was brought under control,\" the statement added.\n\nNepal has a poor aviation safety record and is often regarded as one of the most dangerous countries for air travel. All Nepali air carriers are banned from entering the airspace of any European Union country, per the EU Air Safety List.\n\nThe European Union Aviation Safety Agency bans airlines from operating in the EU for \"failure to adhere to the applicable international safety standards.\"\n\nProfessor Ron Bartch, chairman and founding director of aviation consultancy firm AvLaw, told Business Insider that one reason for its poor safety record is that the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal is \"not a terribly well-resourced safety regulator.\"\n\nThe CAAN did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nNepal's mountainous terrain, unpredictable weather, and remote runways have contributed to the country's reputation as one of the most difficult places to fly.\n\nKathmandu's high altitude makes for a \"challenging operating environment,\" Bartch added, noting that this means a greater distance and an accelerated approach speed are required for takeoff and landing as the air is less dense than at sea level.\n\nHe also said Nepal's monsoonal conditions affect the country's aviation safety.\n\nThe deadliest plane crash in Nepal in three decades occurred in January 2023, when at least 72 people were killed after a Yeti Airlines flight went down near Pokhara, which government investigators later attributed to the aircraft's pilots accidentally cutting off the power.\n\nIn 1992, all 167 passengers on board a Pakistan International Airlines flight to Kathmandu died when the Airbus crashed on approach to the airport.\n\nSince 2000, more than 350 people have died in Nepal in 19 air crashes.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"},

The weather in these regions is also notoriously unpredictable, further complicating aviation safety.", "source": {"uri": "ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "samiran_mishra@ndtv.com", "name": "Samiran Mishra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saurya_Airlines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saurya Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribhuvan_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tribhuvan International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Takeoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Runway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kathmandu_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Kathmandu Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokhara", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_CRJ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bombardier CRJ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aviation safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airspace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Himalayas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-07/onqi86h8_nepal-plane-crash-_625x300_24_July_24.jpg?ver-20240615.100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758495", "eventUri": "eng-9758495", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

The incident led to the deaths of 18 people abroad, including a foreigner, while the pilot survived with major injuries. According to news agency PTI, the Nepalese domestic plane N9AME, belonging to Saurya Airlines, was bound for Pokhra for regular maintenance service when the accident occurred at 11.11 a.m..\n\nRecounting the harrowing experience of witnessing the crash, the eyewitnesses said that if the plane hadn't hit the container, it would have definitely hit the residential area.\n\nAccording to news agency ANI, eyewitness Aadesh Lama, who witnessed the crash, said, \"I was working here at my garage in the morning, and then I heard a loud sound. We thought a tyre had burst, but we came to know that a plane had crashed. It had knocked on a container, if it wasn't the container, then it surely would have slid down and hit the residential area. The container saved us. It struck the container and came to the ground and got engulfed by fire.\"\n\nAnother witness, Krishna Bahadur Thapa, detailed his initial reaction.\n\n\"I heard a loud bang, about three to four of us were here. We first assumed it to be a vehicle accident but it turned out to be an aircraft that had crashed. The plane slid down and stopped, at first there was the sound, then after the smoke billowed and then it was engulfed by fire. I rushed near to the site where the plane crashed and there again was an explosion and then I ran backwards with fear,\" Thapa said while speaking to ANI.\n\nThe accident took place when the plane was scheduled to leave for Pokhara from Kathmandu.\n\nThe Tribhuvan International Airport, in an official release, said that 18 dead bodies were recovered from the site and only 1 person survived the crash. The TIA said, \"CRJ7 (Reg-9NAME) of Sourya Airlines took off from Kathmandu at 11:11 am local time during the flight to Pokhara, turned right and crashed at a place on the east side of the runway.\n\nThe pilot of the Saurya Airline plane that crashed at the Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) in Kathmandu is the lone survivor of the crash.The plane 9N-AME (CRJ 200) was only carrying technical staff of the airline, with no passengers on board. Gyanendra Bhul, information officer at TIA, confirmed that the plane was carrying a few technical staff members.The plane crashed shortly after taking off from the runway, at around 11:00 AM today. Following the crash, smoke was seen coming from the plane. Firefighters and security personnel, including Nepal Police and the Nepali Army, were deployed to the crash site.", "source": {"uri": "english.jagran.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jagran English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saurya_Airlines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saurya Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribhuvan_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tribhuvan International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_News_International", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asian News International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Takeoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Krishna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokhara", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepali_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nepali Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_CRJ100/200", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bombardier CRJ100/200"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyanendra_of_Nepal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gyanendra of Nepal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nepal Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Runway"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://imgeng.jagran.com/images/2024/07/24/article/image/nep-1721822228362.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758495", "eventUri": "eng-9758495", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Sharma Oli, visited the crash site and asked people to \"be patient\" in a social media post, without elaborating.\n\nAn emergency cabinet meeting was called to form a panel to investigate the incident, a government spokesman said.\n\nTHICK, BLACK SMOKE\n\nTelevision footage showed fire fighters trying to put out the blaze as thick black smoke rose into the sky. Images also showed the plane flying a little above the runway and then tilting to its right before it crashed.\n\nOther visuals showed rescue workers examining the charred remains of the plane, strewn in lush green fields, and bodies being carried to ambulances on stretchers.\n\nKathmandu airport was closed temporarily following the crash but reopened within hours, officials said.\n\nAccording to Flightradar24 flight tracking, Saurya currently operates two CRJ-200 regional jets, a programme that was owned by Canada's Bombardier but which was bought by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in 2020.\n\nBombardier referred questions about the incident to Canada-based MHI RJ Aviation Group.\n\n\"We are committed to cooperate with the authorities in the investigation to get an understanding of the cause of this accident,\" MHI said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nPOOR SAFETY RECORD\n\nNepal has been criticised for its poor air safety record, where many airlines fly to small airports in remote hills and near peaks shrouded in clouds. The country is home to eight of the world's 14 tallest mountain peaks.\n\nThe country's main airport is ringed by mountains, affecting wind direction and intensity and making takeoff and landing a challenge for pilots.\n\nThe deadliest incident occurred in 1992, when a Pakistan International Airlines Airbus crashed into a hillside while approaching Kathmandu, killing 167 people.\n\nMore recently, at least 72 people were killed in a Yeti airlines crash in January 2023 that was later attributed to the pilots mistakenly cutting off power.\n\n(Reporting by Kathmandu newsroom; Additional

It is reported that the fire was brought under control and the rescue work was started immediately. The dead bodies of 18 people were recovered and 1 injured person was rescued and taken to the hospital.\"\n\nThe Pilot of the Saurya Airline plane that crashed at the Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) in Kathmandu is the lone survivor of the crash.\n\nThe plane 9N-AME (CRJ 200) was only carrying technical staff of the airline, with no passengers on board.

All those on board - 18 Nepalis and a Yemeni citizen - were employees of the carrier, according to police.\n\nImages from Nepal police showed thick smoke billowing from the burning aircraft on the the airport runway.\n\nThe aircraft crashed during takeoff from Kathmandu to the city of Pokhara around 11 a.m. local time, Bhul said. The plane was en route for technical maintenance, he added.\n\n\"Rescue efforts were started immediately and the situation was brought under control,\" the aviation authority said.\n\nThe crash once again highlights the dangers of air travel in Nepal, a country often referred to as one of the riskiest places to fly due to multiple factors including its mountainous terrain.\n\nThe Himalayan country, home to eight of the world's 14 highest mountains including Everest, has a record of air accidents. Its weather can change suddenly, and airstrips are typically sited in difficult-to-reach, mountainous areas.\n\nAircraft with 19 seats or fewer are more likely to have accidents due to these difficulties, according to a 2019 safety report from the Civil Aviation Authority.\n\nWhile the country has made improvements in safety standards in recent years, challenges remain, and a lack of investment in aging aircraft only adds to the risks of flying.\n\nLast year, Nepal saw its worst plane crash in more than 30 years when at least 68 people died when a Yeti Airlines flight went down near Pokhara.\n\nIn May 2022, a Tara Air flight departing from Pokhara crashed into a mountain, killing 22 people.\n\nIn early 2018, a US-Bangla Airlines flight from Bangladesh's capital Dhaka to Kathmandu crashed on landing and caught fire, killing 51 people.\n\nAnd in 2016, a Tara Air flight crashed while flying the same route as the 2023 crash.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Here is why it may have happened, and why Nepal sees so many plane crashes.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, July 24, a Bombardier CRJ200 aircraft crashed during takeoff at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, Nepal. Tragically, eighteen people were killed in the crash. The plane, operated by Saurya Airlines, was carrying two crew members and seventeen technicians. They traveled from Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, to Pokhara for maintenance checks. Sadly, only the pilot, Manish Shankya, survived the crash. He is currently being treated for a head injury at a nearby hospital.\n\nAccording to the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN), the aircraft took off from Tribhuvan International Airport at 11:11 am (Nepal Standard Time). Shortly after takeoff, the plane veered to the right and crashed on the east side of the runway. Witnesses reported that the plane flipped after its wing tip hit the ground during takeoff. The aircraft then caught fire. Videos on social media show the plane flying low above the runway before sharply banking to one side and crashing.\n\nThe factors that led to the crash are still unclear. But according to experts who have reviewed the footage of the incident have said that behind the crash was what is known as a 'climb failure'. The plane was unable to successfully climb and gain altitude after takeoff. This can happen due to several reasons including engine failure, faulty pre-flight planning,, other technical issues, or even pilot error. A proper investigation will shed further light on exactly what was behind the mishap on Wednesday. Conditions at the airport were not too bad. Even though it is the monsoon season in Kathmandu, it was not raining at the time of the crash. However, although visibility was low across the capital.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives (B3A), Nepal has experienced 68 aviation accidents since 1946, resulting in 900 deaths. The Aviation Safety Network reports 41 fatal accidents since 1919, with 878 fatalities. These numbers are high compared to the relatively low number of flights in Nepal. Several factors contribute to Nepal's high accident rate such as rugged mountain terrain which makes flying difficult with poorly maintained aircraft. Airports and runways are often inadequate and weak and regulatory oversight fails to enforce safety standards. Other reasons could be difficult Airport Conditions. Nepalese airstrips are often located on plateaus or carved into mountains, making landings challenging. Tribhuvan International Airport, despite having a relatively long runway, is situated in the narrow Kathmandu valley, surrounded by high mountains. This geography limits pilots' maneuvering space and leads to sudden weather changes.\n\nMany aircraft in Nepal lack modern maintenance and standard safety equipment. This has led to the European Union banning all Nepal-based aircraft from entering European airspace since 2013 due to the Nepal government's failure to improve aviation safety regulations and implementation.", "source": {"uri": "pagalparrot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PagalParrot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arpita_mackelvy@pagalparrot.com", "name": "Arpita Mackelvy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Takeoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Aviation_Authority_of_Nepal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribhuvan_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tribhuvan International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_accidents_and_incidents", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aviation accidents and incidents"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Runway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saurya_Airlines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saurya Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_CRJ100/200", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bombardier CRJ100/200"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokhara", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pilot error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monsoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Altitude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_Safety_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight Safety Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu_Valley", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu Valley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aviation safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plateau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airspace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aerodrome"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.pagalparrot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/hjk-6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758495", "eventUri": "eng-9758495", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 136, "textEnd": 143}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

We are in the process of taking them for post-mortem.\"\n\nThe flight was being conducted for either technical or maintenance purposes, Gyanendra Bhul of Nepal's Civil Aviation Authority told AFP without giving further details.\n\nBahadur and Bhul were unable to confirm the nationality of the sole foreigner aboard.\n\nImages of the aftermath shared by Nepal's military showed the plane's fuselage split apart and burnt to a husk.\n\nAround a dozen soldiers in camouflage were standing on top of the wreckage with the surrounding earth coated in fire retardant.\n\nThe plane crashed at around 11:15 am (0530 GMT), the military said in a statement, adding that the army's quick response team had been lending assistance with rescue efforts.\n\nNews portal Khabarhub reported that the

people between hard-to-reach areas as well as foreign trekkers and climbers.\n\nBut it has been plagued by poor safety due to insufficient training and maintenance -- issues compounded by the mountainous republic's treacherous geography.\n\nThe European Union has banned all Nepali carriers from its airspace over safety concerns.\n\nThe Himalayan country has some of the world's trickiest runways to land on, flanked by snow-capped peaks with approaches that pose a challenge even for accomplished pilots.\n\nThe weather can also change quickly in the mountains, creating treacherous flying conditions.\n\nNepal's last major commercial flight accident was in January 2023, when a Yeti Airlines service crashed while landing at Pokhara, killing all 72 aboard.\n\nThat accident was Nepal's deadliest since 1992, when all 167 people aboard a Pakistan International Airlines plane died when it crashed on approach to Kathmandu airport.\n\nEarlier that year a Thai Airways aircraft had

According to the Aviation Safety database, there have been at least 27 fatal plane crashes in Nepal over the past three decades.\n\nTimeline of plane crashes in Nepal:\n\n* May 2022: A Tara Air flight carrying 22 passengers, including four Indian nationals, crashed in Nepal's Mustang district. The bodies were recovered three days later, and an investigation pointed to poor weather as a potential cause.\n\n* February 2019: An Air Dynasty helicopter, with seven passengers including Nepal's Tourism Minister Rabindra Adhikari, crashed into a hill while attempting to return to Kathmandu in cloudy conditions. The preliminary report cited violations of operating procedures, including improper weight distribution and seating arrangements.\n\n* March 2018: A US-Bangla Airlines flight from Dhaka crashed at Tribhuvan International Airport, killing 49 people. The aircraft caught fire after veering off the runway and crashing into a football ground. The investigation suggested pilot disorientation as a probable cause.\n\n* February 2016: An Air Kasthamandap flight crashed in Kalikot district, resulting in the deaths of two crew members and injuries to nine passengers.\n\n* May 2015: A US Marine Corps helicopter crashed in the Charikot region while delivering aid after two earthquakes, killing all eight occupants, including six US Marines and two Nepali soldiers.\n\n* May 2012: A Dornier aircraft crashed near Jomsom Airport, killing 15 people, including 13 Indian pilgrims. The plane was en route from Pokhara to Jomsom.\n\n* September 2011: A Buddha Air Beechcraft 1900D on a sightseeing trip around Mount Everest crashed, killing all 19 people on board, including 10 Indians. The accident occurred during adverse weather conditions with thick monsoon clouds enveloping the Kathmandu area.\n\n* September 2006: A Shree Air helicopter carrying 24 passengers, including World Wide Fund for Nature officials, crashed in Eastern Nepal.\n\n* June 2006: A Yeti Airlines aircraft crashed, resulting in multiple fatalities.\n\n* November 2001: A chartered helicopter crashed in Western Nepal, killing Princess Prekshya Shah and five others.\n\n* July 2000: A Twin Otter operated by Royal Nepal Airlines crashed en route to Dhangadhi Airport, killing 22 passengers and three crew members.\n\n* July 1993: An Everest Air Dornier aircraft crashed near Chule Ghopte hill, killing 19 people.\n\n* September 1992: A Pakistan International Airlines Airbus A300 crashed while landing in Kathmandu, killing all 167 people on board. The aircraft struck a mountain ridge 11 km from the airport.\n\n* July 1992: A Thai Airways Airbus A310 crashed during its approach to Kathmandu, killing all 113 onboard. The plane collided with a mountain in heavy monsoon rain due to a minor failure in the plane's flaps and miscommunication with air traffic control.\n\n* July 1969: A Royal Nepal Airlines flight crashed en route to Sinara Airport, killing 31 passengers and four crew members.\n\nNepal's aviation sector continues to face challenges in improving safety, underscoring the need for investment in

Nepal has a woeful track record on aviation safety and the Himalayan republic has seen a spate of deadly light plane and helicopter crashes over the decades.\n\nThe Saurya Airlines flight was carrying two crew and 17 of the company's staff members, Nepali police spokesman Dan Bahadur Karki said. \"The pilot has been rescued and is being treated,\" he said. \"Eighteen bodies have been recovered, including one foreigner. We are in the process of taking them for post-mortem.\" The Civil Aviation Authority said the dead foreigner was a Yemeni engineer.\n\nA news release from the airport said the aircraft \"veered off to the right and crashed on the east side of the runway\" shortly after take-off. The survivor was in serious condition in hospital, it said. Ram Kumar K C, who runs a tyre store near the crash site, told AFP the plane caught fire after hitting the ground. \"We were about to run to the site but then there was an explosion so we ran away again,\" the 48-year-old said.\n\nNepal's Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli visited the crash site and asked people to \"be patient\" in a social media post, without elaborating. An emergency cabinet meeting was called to form a panel to investigate the incident, a government spokesman said.\n\nThe flight was being conducted for either technical or maintenance purposes, Gyanendra Bhul of Nepal's Civil Aviation Authority told AFP, without giving further details. Images of the aftermath shared by Nepal's military showed the plane's fuselage split apart and burnt to a husk. Around a dozen soldiers in camouflage gear stood on top of the wreckage, the surrounding earth coated in fire retardant.\n\nDozens of grieving relatives gathered later outside a nearby hospital where the bodies were transported from the crash scene. \"I am heartbroken,\" Rajan Acharya, the brother of a safety officer aboard the flight, told AFP. \"He was my brother, but even more than that, we were best friends.\" The plane was scheduled to fly on Nepal's busiest air route between Kathmandu and Pokhara, an important tourism hub. Saurya Airlines exclusively flies Bombardier CRJ 200 jets, according to its website.\n\nNepal's air industry has boomed in recent years, carrying goods and people between hard-to-reach areas as well as foreign trekkers and climbers. But it has been plagued by poor safety due to insufficient training and maintenance, issues compounded by mountainous Nepal's treacherous geography. The European Union has banned all Nepali carriers from its airspace over safety concerns.\n\nNepal has some of the world's trickiest runways on which to land, flanked by snow-capped peaks with approaches that pose a challenge even for accomplished pilots. The weather can also change quickly in the mountains, creating treacherous flying conditions. Nepal's last major incident involving a commercial flight was in January 2023, when a Yeti Airlines service crashed while landing at Pokhara, killing all 72 aboard. That was Nepal's deadliest since 1992, when all 167 people aboard a Pakistan International Airlines plane were killed when it crashed on approach to Kathmandu airport. A Thai Airways aircraft crashed near the same airport earlier that year, killing 113 people. - Agencies", "source": {"uri": "kuwaittimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kuwait Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "https@kuwaittimes.com", "name": "https", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saurya_Airlines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saurya Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Aviation_Authority_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aviation safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Himalayas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyanendra_of_Nepal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gyanendra of Nepal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Runway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_CRJ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bombardier CRJ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeti_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yeti Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_Airways", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thai Airways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_International_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan International Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airspace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokhara", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://kuwaittimes.com/kuwaittimes/uploads/images/2024/07/24/134607.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758495", "eventUri": "eng-9758495", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

It was not raining when the plane went down, though visibility in the capital was generally low at the time.", "source": {"uri": "unilad.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UNILAD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribhuvan_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tribhuvan International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saurya_Airlines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saurya Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepalis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nepalis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Runway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokhara", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyanendra_of_Nepal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gyanendra of Nepal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepali_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nepali language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu_Medical_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu Medical College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Aviation_Authorities", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Aviation Authorities", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blt949ea8e16e463049/bltb5e9c5c5f86ac288/66a0cb880a09df8b81fddc79/footage-captures-passenger-plane-crash.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758495", "eventUri": "eng-9758495", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 305, "textEnd": 312}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

It is not possible to confirm the status of others on board right now. Many have not survived,\" he added.\n\nEighteen Nepalis and one foreigner were aboard the flight, Gyanendra Bhul of Nepal's Civil Aviation Authority told AFP, adding he did not have any details on the latter's nationality.\n\nBhul added that the flight was being conducted for either technical or maintenance purposes, without giving further detail.\n\nImages of the aftermath shared by Nepal's military showed the plane's fuselage split apart and burnt to a husk.\n\nAround a dozen soldiers in camouflage were standing on top of the wreckage with the surrounding earth coated in fire retardant.\n\nThe plane crashed at around 11:15 am (0530 GMT), the military said in a statement, adding that the army's quick response team had been lending assistance with rescue efforts.\n\nNews portal Khabarhub reported that the airplane had caught fire after skidding on the runway.\n\nThe plane was scheduled to fly on Nepal's busiest air route between Kathmandu and Pokhara, an important tourism hub in the Himalayan republic.\n\nSaurya Airlines exclusively flies Bombardier CRJ 200 jets, according to its website.\n\n- Plagued by poor safety -\n\nNepal's air industry has boomed in recent years, carrying goods and people between hard-to-reach areas as well as foreign trekkers and climbers.\n\nBut it has been plagued by poor safety due to insufficient training and maintenance -- issues compounded by the mountainous republic's treacherous geography.\n\nThe European Union has banned all Nepali carriers from its airspace over safety concerns.\n\nThe Himalayan country has some of the world's trickiest runways to land on, flanked by snow-capped peaks with approaches that pose a challenge even for accomplished pilots.\n\nThe weather can also change quickly in the mountains, creating treacherous flying conditions.\n\nNepal's last major commercial flight accident was in January 2023, when a Yeti Airlines service crashed while landing at Pokhara, killing all 72 aboard.\n\nThat accident was Nepal's deadliest since 1992, when all 167 people aboard a Pakistan International Airlines plane died when it crashed on approach to Kathmandu airport.\n\nEarlier that year a Thai Airways aircraft had crashed near the same airport, killing 113 people.", "source": {"uri": "sg.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

areas as well as foreign trekkers and climbers.\n\nBut it has been plagued by poor safety due to insufficient training and maintenance -- issues compounded by the mountainous republic's treacherous geography.\n\nThe European Union has banned all Nepali carriers from its airspace over safety concerns.\n\nThe Himalayan country has some of the world's trickiest runways to land on, flanked by snow-capped peaks with approaches that pose a challenge even for accomplished pilots.\n\nThe weather can also change quickly in the mountains, creating treacherous flying conditions.\n\nNepal's last major commercial flight accident was in January 2023, when a Yeti Airlines service crashed while landing at Pokhara, killing all 72 aboard.\n\nThat accident was Nepal's deadliest since 1992, when all

Its weather can change suddenly, and airstrips are typically sited in difficult-to-reach, mountainous areas.\n\nAircraft with 19 seats or fewer are more likely to have accidents due to these difficulties, according to a 2019 safety report from the Civil Aviation Authority.\n\nWhile the country has made improvements in safety standards in recent years, challenges remain, and a lack of investment in aging aircraft only adds to the risks of flying.\n\nLast year, Nepal saw its worst plane crash in more than 30 years when at least 68 people died when a Yeti Airlines flight went down near Pokhara.\n\nIn May 2022, a Tara Air flight departing from Pokhara crashed into a mountain, killing 22 people.\n\nIn early 2018, a US-Bangla Airlines flight from Bangladesh's capital Dhaka to Kathmandu crashed on landing and caught fire, killing 51 people.\n\nAnd in 2016, a Tara Air flight crashed while flying the same route as the 2023 crash.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

These crashes resulted in the loss of 935 lives.\n\nThe recent crash of a Saurya Airlines aircraft at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu is not an isolated event, as Nepal has a history of aviation accidents.\n\nNepal, otherwise known for its breathtaking Himalayan landscape, however has long been a challenging terrain for pilots.\n\nThe challenges of flying in Nepal are multifold.\n\nThe country's rugged terrain, with towering mountains and deep valleys, creates unique challenges for pilots.\n\nAnd it's not just the terrain, it is the weather conditions and the air that makes Nepal airports tricky for aviators.\n\nWeather conditions, too, can be highly unpredictable, with sudden changes in wind direction and speed, making it difficult for pilots to maintain control of their aircraft.\n\nAdditionally, given the high altitude and thin air, some aircraft engines might fail to provide the required lift.\n\nKathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport itself has seen hundreds of casualties from plane crashes either during landing or take-off.\n\nThe most fatal of them was the crash of a Thai Airways International aircraft in 1992, which crashed into a mountain while approaching Kathmandu, killing all 113 people on board.\n\nMonths later, another Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) aircraft crashed the same way, while approaching Kathmandu.\n\nIt's smack in the middle of the city, which isn't the best choice due to the surrounding mountains. However, this might be the only flat land available for such a facility. Despite this, the runway is over 3,000 metres long, which is adequate for most airliners.\n\nThe Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, although acts as a gateway to the Himalayan nation. Despite being the only operational international airport in Nepal, the Kathmandu airport terminal is not very big and is serviced by a lone bumpy runway.\n\nThe single runway struggles to keep up with the volume of traffic flying in and out.\n\nThe airport is known for long lines, inadequate facilities, and poor cleanliness, as highlighted in a survey by SleepinginAirports.net, a website for stranded airport travellers.\n\nThe airport also faces significant limitations due to its central location. It is right in the middle of the city in the Kathmandu Valley. Expansion and development of the infrastructure has been largely proved ineffective.\n\nFrom planes skidding off the runway to fog-related incidents, Kathmandu Airport has seen more than 20 major and minor plane mishaps, resulting in a toll of over 400.\n\nIf the Kathmandu Airport is dangerous, another airport in the higher reaches of the Himalayas is among the \"most dangerous airports in the world\".\n\nThe notorious Tenzing-Hillary Airport in Lukla is often referred to as the \"most dangerous airport in the world\", by a bunch of avgeeks, is located at an altitude of 2,860 metres.\n\nThe airport is the gateway to the Mount Everest base camp, and is known for its steep and short runway, and unpredictable weather conditions.\n\nThe table-top-slant runway at Lukla's Tenzing-Hillary Airport is in fact a bit longer than a standard soccer field. In tricky airports such as Lukla, the pilots require special training to operate there.\n\nNepal's aviation safety record has been a concern for flyers and regulators for years. So much so that the Nepal-based airlines came under the scanner of international regulators as well.\n\nIn December 2013, the European Commission imposed a blanket ban on all Nepali airlines from flying into the 28-nation bloc due to safety concerns. The ban still exists.\n\nBetween November 1960 and May 2022, a total of 106 aircraft crashed in Nepal, resulting in 590 deaths, according to the country's Civil Aviation Authority.\n\nMany of these accidents involved twin-engine planes, which are commonly used in Nepal to reach remote airstrips.\n\nThough it is more than the terrain that makes Nepal tricky for pilots, there is much that the Himalayan kingdom can do to make its aviation record better.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The dramatic event was captured on video and shared on social media, though the authenticity of the footage remains unverified. Other footage displayed rescue workers sifting through the burned wreckage scattered across green fields, with bodies being transported to ambulances on stretchers as local residents observed. Officials reported that the airport was temporarily closed.\n\nThe plane was transporting two crew members and 17 technicians to Pokhara for aircraft repairs. \"Only the captain was rescued alive and is receiving treatment at a hospital,\" stated Tej Bahadur Poudyal, spokesman for Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport. Television broadcasts depicted firefighters battling the blaze and thick smoke, along with visuals of the plane flying low and tilting before crashing.\n\nRescue workers were seen combing through the charred wreckage in green fields, with bodies being transported to ambulances on stretchers. Local residents watched the rescue operations unfold. The crashed aircraft was identified as a Bombardier, operated by Saurya Airlines, which has two Bombardier CRJ-200 jets in its fleet, both around 20 years old. A Saurya Airlines representative identified the plane as a 50-seater CRJ200. According to Flight Radar 24, Saurya operates two CRJ-200 regional jets, with one being inactive for an extended period.\n\nNepal's air safety record has faced criticism, with nearly 350 fatalities in aviation accidents since 2000.

The Saurya Airlines plane crashed around 11.15 am after it skidded off the runway during take-off from the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu.\n\nThe airline pilot was the sole survivor in the crash, who was transported to Kathmandu Medical College Hospital for treatment. According to a doctor cited by Associated Press, the pilot sustained injuries to the eyes but is not in any danger.\n\nAccording to airport security, the airport was en route to Pokhara city carrying two crew members and 17 technicians for maintenance checks.\n\n\"The plane skidded off the runway and crashed into a field east of the runway,\" airport security chief Arjun Chand Thakuri said as quoted by Reuters.\n\nIn January 2023, a Yeti Airlines aircraft carrying 72 people, including four crew members, crashed a few kilometers away from Pokhara International Airport. Fifty-seven of those on board the aircraft were Nepalis and 15 were foreigners.\n\nIn May 2022, a Tara airplane crashed killing all 22 on board. In the last decade alone, there have been 20 crashes.\n\nIn 2019, a Bangladeshi airliner crashed at Tribhuvan airport, causing 51 fatalities while 20 survived. An investigation revealed that the plane was misaligned with the runway and the pilot was disoriented, attempting to land in \"sheer desperation\".\n\nIn 2015, a Turkish Airlines jet skidded off a slippery runway at the same airport while landing in dense fog. Although the plane was carrying 238 people, no serious injuries were reported.\n\nThe Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) has recorded at least 68 plane accidents in the country since 1955, about 44 of them deadly, including Yeti Airlines passenger plane crash.\n\nWeather\n\nThe weather changes quickly due to the mighty Himalayas, which makes it tricky for even the seasoned pilots to fly the plane. That is why Nepal's aviation largely depends on a limited type of aircraft such as Twin Otters, Let-L 410s and Dorniers.\n\nThese planes require shorter takeoff and landing (STOL) airfields in high-terrain areas, as opposed to the so-called trunk sector -- the region with better airports where bigger planes can fly.\n\nA senior pilot of national carrier Nepal Airlines said the \"high terrains are difficult and on top of that we lack good equipment and facilities\", a senior pilot of Nepal Airlines quoted Al Jazeera as saying.\n\nPoor Aircraft and Pilot Indiscipline\n\nAs per an article by The Diplomat, Nepali aircraft operators cannot afford to buy new aircraft, forcing many to opt for cheaper used aircraft. These flight operators have close links to influential political leaders who shield them from scrutiny, even when they flout the safety regulations. Some airports lack simple fencing, parking, and emergency vehicle standards, as per the report.\n\nThe report also mentioned the lack of discipline of the local pilots. Three Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) pilots were barred from flying after they disobeyed instructions from the air traffic control (ATC) specialists in Hong Kong. Two more pilots have been grounded for failure to adhere to ATC's instructions.\n\nAn investigation by Al Jazeera reported that most of the aircraft operating in Nepal are not brand new. They cost a lot and flying them may not be viable in an economically backward nation.\n\nBefore an aircraft is bought, a standard process of \"type certification\" is carried out by the civil aviation authorities such as the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or any contracting state authority before it receives a certificate of airworthiness for operations.\n\nCorruption\n\nThe Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) is the service provider and regulator of the aviation sector in Nepal. Ironically, the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation has not complied with about half the accident investigation recommendations directed to the ministry, as per a report by The Diplomat.\n\nThese risks have made it the European Union to impose a blanket ban on Nepali airlines flying in European airspace.\n\nTwo aviation-related bills calling for a split in CAAN's duties and a restructuring of the national aviation sector are pending before the Nepalese parliament since 2020.\n\nOnce they are separated, one part will be responsible for aviation regulatory issues such as safety and inspections while the service provider will venture towards managing infrastructure and airports.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [],

Nepal has a woeful track record on aviation safety and the Himalayan republic has seen a spate of deadly light plane and helicopter crashes over the decades.\n\nThe Saurya Airlines flight was carrying two crew and 17 of the company's staff members, Nepali police spokesman Dan Bahadur Karki told Agence France-Presse (AFP). \"The pilot has been rescued and is being treated,\" he added. \"Eighteen bodies have been recovered, including one foreigner. We are in the process of taking them for post-mortem.\" The Civil Aviation Authority said the dead foreigner was a Yemeni citizen.\n\nA press release from the airport said the aircraft \"veered off to the right and crashed on the east side of the runway\" shortly after take-off. The survivor was in serious condition in hospital, it added. The flight was being conducted for either technical or maintenance purposes, Gyanendra Bhul of Nepal's Civil Aviation Authority told AFP without giving further details.\n\nImages of the aftermath shared by Nepal's military showed the plane's fuselage split apart and burnt to a husk. Around a dozen soldiers in camouflage were standing on top of the wreckage with the surrounding earth coated in fire retardant.\n\nThe aircraft crashed at around 11:15 am (0530 GMT), the military said in a statement, adding that the army's quick response team had been lending assistance with rescue efforts. The plane was scheduled to fly on Nepal's busiest air route between Kathmandu and Pokhara, an important tourism hub in the Himalayan republic. Saurya Airlines exclusively flies Bombardier CRJ 200 jets, according to its website.\n\nPlagued by poor safety\n\nNepal's air industry has boomed in recent years, carrying goods and people between hard-to-reach areas as well as foreign trekkers and climbers. But it has been plagued by poor safety due to insufficient training and maintenance -- issues compounded by the mountainous republic's treacherous geography.\n\nThe European Union has banned all Nepali carriers from its airspace over safety concerns. The Himalayan country has some of the world's trickiest runways to land on, flanked by snow-capped peaks with approaches that pose a challenge even for accomplished pilots. The weather can also change quickly in the mountains, creating treacherous flying conditions.\n\nNepal's last major commercial flight accident was in January 2023, when a Yeti Airlines service crashed while landing at Pokhara, killing all 72 aboard. That accident was Nepal's deadliest since 1992, when all 167 people aboard a Pakistan International Airlines plane died when it crashed on approach to Kathmandu airport. Earlier that year a Thai Airways aircraft had crashed near the same airport, killing 113 people.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Monde.fr"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@lemonde.fr", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saurya_Airlines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saurya Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Aviation_Authority_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aviation safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Himalayas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_accidents_and_incidents", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aviation accidents and incidents"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyanendra_of_Nepal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gyanendra of Nepal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camouflage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Camouflage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Runway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_CRJ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bombardier CRJ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeti_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yeti Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_Airways", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thai Airways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_International_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan International Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airspace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokhara", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://img.lemde.fr/2024/07/24/346/0/4160/2080/1440/720/60/0/6490d68_388b8a9b90ad48c2afde0dfba8aa3f5f-0-8c0ea2d6ad89491fa51bca2fa9d66ace.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758495", "eventUri": "eng-9758495", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 65, "textEnd": 72}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

We are in the process of transporting them for post-mortem.\"\n\nGyanendra Bhul of Nepal's Civil Aviation Authority told AFP that the flight was for technical or maintenance purposes.\n\nBahadur and Bhul were unable to confirm the nationality of the only foreigner on board.\n\nThe Nepalese military published images of the aftermath, which showed the plane's fuselage torn apart and burned to a husk.\n\nAround a dozen soldiers in camouflage stood on top of the debris, with the surrounding ground doused in fire retardant.\n\nAccording to a military statement, the jet crashed around 11:15 a.m. (0530 GMT), and the army's quick response team was assisting with rescue efforts.\n\nKhabarhub said that the plane caught fire after skidding on the runway.\n\nThe jet was scheduled to fly between Kathmandu and Pokhara, Nepal's busiest air route and a major tourist destination.\n\nAccording to its website, Saurya Airlines exclusively operates Bombardier CRJ 200 planes.\n\nNepal's air industry has expanded in recent years, transporting goods and people between remote places, as well as foreign trekkers and climbers.\n\nHowever, limited training and upkeep have resulted in poor safety, which is exacerbated by the mountainous republic's dangerous topography.\n\nDue to safety concerns, the European Union has barred all Nepali carriers from its airspace.\n\nThe Himalayan country features some of the world's most difficult runways to land on, flanked by snow-capped peaks and approaches that provide a challenge even for experienced pilots.\n\nThe weather can also change quickly in the highlands, making flying hazardous.\n\nNepal's latest major commercial flight accident occurred in January 2023, when a Yeti Airlines service crashed on landing in Pokhara, killing all 72 people on board.\n\nThat was Nepal's bloodiest accident since 1992, when a Pakistan International Airlines plane crashed on its approach to Kathmandu airport, killing all 167 persons on board.\n\nEarlier that year, a Thai Airways flight crashed near the same airport, killing 113 people.", "source": {"uri": "howafrica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "How Africa News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The pilot of the private Nepalese domestic plane carrying 19 people survived the crash and was admitted to hospital with injuries. The Saurya Airlines plane bound for Pokhara, a popular tourist destination in the Himalayan republic, crashed at the Tribhuvan International Airport after it veered off the runway and burst into flames.\n\nNepal, which is home to several high mountain ranges, including Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, has recorded at least 69 plane accidents in the country since 1955, - 45 fatal ones - including today's crash of the Pokhara-bound plane, according to the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN). These crashes claimed more than 900 lives. The last deadly commercial flight accident was reported in the country in January 2023, when a Yeti Airlines service crashed while landing in Pokhara, killing all 72 aboard.\n\nThe latest plane mishap has stoked debates around air travel safety in the Himalayan nation, hugely popular among foreign tourists, mountaineers and skiers. According to aviation experts, factors like mountainous terrain, weather condition, lack of investment in the aviation industry have possibly made the country prone to air disasters.\n\nNews9 details 4 possible factors that are behind frequent plane crashes in Nepal.\n\nChallenging mountainous terrain is one of the key reasons for the rampant incidents of plane crash in Nepal. Nepal is home to eight of the world's 14 highest mountains, including Mount Everest, Kanchenjunga and Annapurna. More than half of the country is surrounded by mountains and several airlines fly to small airports in remote hills shrouded in clouds and cut off from roads. The country's topography, with its mountain peaks and narrow valleys, raises the risk of accidents and sometimes requires pilots to fly by sight rather than relying on instruments.\n\nThe erratic weather of Nepal is one of the reasons for the plane tragedies. The country's \"diverse weather patterns\" were the major challenges, according to a 2019 safety report from Nepal's Civil Aviation Authority, also resulting in a \"number of accidents\" to small aircraft. The weather changes quickly in the mountains, creating treacherous flying conditions. Most of the plane accidents reported in the country in the past were attributed to bad and cloudy weather. According to an aviation expert, most of the plane accidents happen in the country owing to the sudden change in the unpredictable weather in the high terrains between takeoff and landing.\n\nMost of the airports in Nepal, including its main Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu -- located in a narrow valley at an altitude of 4,390 feet -- have tricky topography, making it difficult for the pilots to turn and navigate in very tight space. Experts have long blamed airstrips located in rugged mountainous terrain as the reasons for the deadly air disasters in the country. The Himalayan country has some of the world's trickiest runways to land on, flanked by snow-capped peaks with approaches that pose a challenge even for accomplished pilots.\n\nThe Tenzing Hillary Airport also known as Lukla airport, is situated at an altitude of nearly 9,500 feet. It has a single runway. The Pokhara airport, where the Saurya Airlines plane was to land today, Pokhara, sits at an elevation of some 2,700 feet.\n\nLack of proper maintenance of equipment and aircraft training, and lax enforcement of regulations blight Nepal's aviation industry. Ageing aircraft are also one of the factors that raise the risk of plane crashes in Nepal. According to aviation experts, Nepal's air industry has a poor track record for safety due to insufficient training and maintenance.\n\nNotably, all Nepali carriers have been banned from flying into European airspace since December 2013. The European Union barred all Nepal airlines from operating in its airspace citing significant safety concerns. \"On the basis of safety information from various sources and a hearing both with the Nepalese aviation authorities as well as with a number of Nepalese carriers, the Commission decided to put all airlines from Nepal on the EU air safety list,\" the European Commission had stated in 2013.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "siddhi_gaharwar@news9live.com", "name": "Siddhi Gaharwar", "type": "author", "isAgency":

We are in the process of taking them for post-mortem.\"\n\nThe Civil Aviation Authority said the dead foreigner was a Yemeni citizen.\n\nA press release from the airport said the aircraft \"veered off to the right and crashed on the east side of the runway\" shortly after take-off.\n\nThe survivor was in serious condition in hospital, it added.\n\nRam Kumar K.C., who runs a tyre store near the accident site, told AFP the plane caught fire after hitting the ground.\n\n\"We were about to run to the site but then there was an explosion so we ran away again,\" the 48-year-old said.\n\nThe flight was being conducted for either technical or maintenance purposes, Gyanendra Bhul of Nepal's Civil Aviation Authority told AFP without giving further details.\n\nImages of the aftermath shared by Nepal's military showed the plane's fuselage split apart and burnt to a husk.\n\nAround a dozen soldiers in camouflage were standing on top of the wreckage with the surrounding earth coated in fire retardant.\n\nThe aircraft crashed at around 11:15 am (0530 GMT), the military said in a statement, adding that the army's quick response team had been lending assistance with rescue efforts.\n\nThe plane was scheduled to fly on Nepal's busiest air route between Kathmandu and Pokhara, an important tourism hub in the Himalayan republic.\n\nSaurya Airlines exclusively flies Bombardier CRJ 200 jets,

The flight, operated by Saurya Airlines, was en route to Pokhara when the plane \"skidded off the runway\" in the eastern section of the airport.\n\nThe plane was carrying two crew members and 17 technicians to Pokhara city in the Himalayas for maintenance checks. Authorities have recovered the bodies of all 18 victims.\n\nFootage showed firefighters battling the flames as thick black smoke rises into the sky, engulfing the airport while rescue operations continued. The cause of the crash remains unclear, though visibility was low due to monsoon conditions.\n\nTej Bahadur Poudyal, the spokesman for Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport, told the Evening Standard:\n\n\"Only the captain was rescued alive and is receiving treatment at a hospital.\"\n\nSince 1955, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) has reported 68 plane accidents, with 44 being fatal.\n\nIt was a Bombardier CRJ 200 jet which crashed and burned during take-off in Kathmandu. It follows the deadly January 2023 crash of a Yeti Airlines plane in Pokhara, which killed 72 passengers. Nepal's treacherous terrain, including the narrow valley and tabletop runway of Tribhuvan International Airport, contributes to these frequent disasters.\n\nOver the past three decades, Nepal has seen 27 deadly plane crashes, killing more than 600 people. Notably, in 1992, a Pakistan International Airlines crash near Kathmandu killed a shocking 167 people. All Nepali airports, including Tribhuvan International in Kathmandu and the newly opened Pokhara airport, possess a challenging landscape which makes navigating difficult.\n\nIn 2019, a Bangladeshi airliner crashed at Tribhuvan Airport, killing 51 people. In this instance, investigators did confirm that it was a misalignment with the runway as the disoriented pilot desperately tried to land before crashing. The Pokhara airport is set against the Annapurna Mountain range. This adds to the risk in Nepal's dangerous aviation environment.\n\nNepal relies on small aircraft like Twin Otters and Dorniers for their short runways and high altitudes. Plus, the mountainous environment and low air density proves a challenge for aircraft performance. This makes landing and take-off extremely risky.\n\nThe pilots face limited manoeuvring space and often rely on visual flight rules (VFR), which are difficult to follow in changing weather. For instance, in 2018, 51 out of 71 passengers died in a Bangladeshi airliner crash due to cloudy weather. But that cannot be the only blame as the country's aging fleet lacks modern technology and sees operators even ignoring safety regulations.\n\nNepal's aviation safety reputation suffers from several issues. The country deals with outdated infrastructure, including old aircrafts and subpar airports. Not to mentions the challenging mountainous terrain and unpredictable weather which may create a hazardous environment for pilots. But this would be less severe with the correct pilot training, something Nepali airlines lacks. Evidently, there is a shortage of experienced pilots which leaves Nepal with less skilled crews.\n\nMoreover, limited investment in modern technology and regulatory oversight exacerbates these problems. This could be due to economic constraints impeding effective enforcement of safety protocols. Therefore, Nepal's aviation sector still faces major safety challenges.\n\nHarsh Vardhan, a Delhi-based aviation expert, has stated the link between Nepal's deadly air disasters to privatisation in 1992 and inadequate infrastructure. He claims that safety was relatively good before privatisation, but the rapid growth outpaced regulatory organisation. He said that:\n\nThe moment you have pilots who gain some experience on their craft and the machines, they immediately get picked up by bigger airlines ... so these aircraft or operations have become virtually a training ground for them. In terrain like Nepal, pilots require longer experience\" to cope with the demands of the weather and associated events\n\nAs Nepal relies on a struggling aviation sector, improving safety standards and investing in infrastructure must be a top priority to prevent future disasters.\n\nConsequently, it is believed that the ongoing issues with Nepal's aviation safety is potentially one of the causes of the crash on the 24 July 2024.\n\nThe lack of modern technology and experienced pilots remains critical. Furthermore, the region needs better regulatory oversight and updated equipment to ensure pilots can battle the demanding terrain and weather conditions.", "source": {"uri": "thecanary.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Canary"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribhuvan_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tribhuvan International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Runway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokhara", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Aviation_Authority_of_Nepal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saurya_Airlines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saurya Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_CRJ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bombardier CRJ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeti_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yeti Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Himalayas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monsoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_runway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tabletop runway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapurna_Massif", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Annapurna Massif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Canada_DHC-6_Twin_Otter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_flight_rules", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Visual flight rules"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_International_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan International Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aviation safety"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://www.thecanary.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Untitled-design-2024-07-24T171951.919.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758495", "eventUri": "eng-9758495", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

The rugged mountainous terrain, unpredictable weather, dearth of investment in new planes and infrastructure and poor regulation have contributed to these unfortunate incidents. A Saurya Airlines aircraft crashed during takeoff at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu on Wednesday. According to Nepal Police, at least 15 people have died while four others were rescued. The Pokhara-bound plane, carrying nineteen people including the aircrew, slipped off the runway and crashed at around 11 am.\n\nLet's take a look at the history of plane crashes:\n\nJanuary 2023: At least 68 people died after an ATR 72 aircraft belonging to Yeti Airlines carrying 72 people crashed in Nepal's Pokhara at 11 am on January 15. The plane, carrying 68 passengers and four crew members, crashed a few miles from Pokhara, just 20 minutes after it took off from Kathmandu, according to early reports.\n\nMay 2022: On May 29, Sunday, a Tara aircraft carrying 22 people -- including four Indians from Thane -- crashed in Nepal's rugged Mustang province. All of the passengers' bodies were found on Tuesday, three days later. In their investigative report, the Nepali authorities found that the tragedy could have been caused by the terrible weather.\n\nFebruary 2019: In gloomy weather in February 2019, an Air Dynasty chopper attempted to make its way back into Kathmandu and collided with a hill. Rabindra Adhikari, the minister of tourism for Nepal, was one of the seven victims of the accident. According to the investigation's preliminary assessment, there were operational procedure infractions, including weight imbalances brought on by the fuel tank's location and improper passenger seating arrangements.\n\nMarch 2018: On March 12, 2018, a US-Bangla plane carrying 67 passengers and 4 crew members crashed at Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International airport, resulting in the deaths of 49 people. The aircraft returning from Dhaka burst into flames after it skidded off the runway upon landing, landed on a football pitch close to the airport, and burst into flames. A panel tasked with investigating the incident determined that the pilot's bewilderment was possibly the accident's most likely cause.\n\nFebruary 2016: An Air Kashthamandap plane carrying eleven passengers crashed in Nepal's Kalikot area. Nine passengers were hurt in the event, while two crew members died.\n\nMay 2015: All eight people on board a US Marine Corps squadron perished in the accident in the country's Charikot area. While en route to provide relief to victims of two earthquakes, the UH-1Y Huey carrying two Nepali troops and six US marines vanished from sight.\n\nMay 2012: A Dornier jet carrying twenty-one passengers crashed into a mountaintop in northern Nepal while trying to land at a high-altitude airstrip, killing fifteen people, including thirteen Indian pilgrims. The plane was travelling from Jomsom Airport to Pokhara Airport.\n\nSeptember 2011: A Buddha Air Beechcraft 1900D transporting passengers on a sightseeing flight over Mount Everest struck a hill. All 19 passengers, including 10 Indians, perished on board. The disaster was caused by unfavourable weather circumstances since heavy monsoon clouds were engulfing the Kathmandu airport and the surrounding region at the time of the crash.\n\nSeptember 2006: All 24 passengers and crew members were killed when a Shree Air helicopter crashed during a chartered flight in Eastern Nepal. A World Wide Fund for Nature expedition was returning by helicopter from a conservation event.\n\nJune 2006: A Yeti aircraft with six passengers including crew members crashed on the ground.",

The fatalities included five Mexican nationals and one Nepali pilot.\n\nJanuary 15, 2023: A twin-engine ATR 72 aircraft belonging to Nepal's Yeti Airlines crashed in Pokhara, killing all 72 people onboard.

Fire engines and ambulances were rushed to the spot after the incident.\n\nOf the deceased, 15 died on the spot while three died during treatment at a local hospital, authorities said.\n\nThe bodies of the deceased have been shifted to Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital for post-mortem. The relatives of the victims are gathered outside the hospital, mourning their loss.\n\nPilot Captain Shakya, the 37-year-old who is the lone survivor in the crash, is undergoing treatment at Kathmandu Model Hospital.\n\nOfficials at the Kathmandu Medical Hospital (KMC) said that Captain Shakya remains in critical condition following injuries sustained in the accident.\n\nCaptain Shakya is currently undergoing a crucial eye and spinal cord surgery and is admitted to the Neuro-Intensive Care Unit (ICU), as reported by the KMC Hospital.\n\nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli and Home Minister Ramesh Lekh separately visited the accident site to gather details about the incident and provide necessary directives.\n\nOli said he was deeply saddened by the tragic deaths in the crash and was at the site to inquire about the cause of the air crash with the Civil Aviation Authority's officials. He urged all for patience at this hour of grief.\n\nAccording to Tribhuvan International Airport chief Jagannath Niraula, the plane flying from Kathmandu to Pokhara turned in the wrong direction.\n\n\"As soon as it took off, it turned right instead of turning left,\" Niraula was quoted as saying by the BBC News Nepali.\n\nHowever, \"the cause of the accident has not been revealed yet,\" he said.\n\nThe accident happened less than a minute after the plane took off, Niraula said.\n\nA Cabinet meeting held in Singhadurbar decided to form a five-member committee led by former director-general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal Ratish Chandra Lal Suman to investigate the crash.\n\nThe committee includes Captain Deepu Jwarchan from Nepal Airlines, engineer Sanjay Adhikari from Shree Airlines, assistant professor Sudip Bhattarai from Pulchowk Engineering Campus, and technical officer Mukesh Dangol from the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation.\n\nThe committee has been given 45 days to submit a report.\n\nThe aircraft, manufactured by the Canadian company Bombardier in April 2003, was the sixth of its kind purchased for use in Nepal, according to information from planesspotters.com.\n\nFollowing the accident, services at the Kathmandu airport were halted briefly before being resumed, the airport authorities said.\n\nAccording to the company's website, Saruya Airlines operates flights to five tourist destinations within Nepal, with a fleet of three Bombardier CRJ-200 jets.\n\nNepal has been criticised for its poor air safety record in recent years but the reasons also include partly sudden weather changes and partly airstrips located in hard-to-access rocky terrains apart from human error.\n\nAccording to Nepal's civil aviation body, 914 people have died in air crashes in the country since the first disaster was recorded in August 1955.\n\nIn January last year, all 72 people on board, including five Indians, were killed when a Yeti Airlines aircraft crashed in the resort city of Pokhara. The crash was attributed to a human error.\n\nYeti Airlines' 9N-ANC ATR-72 aircraft crashed on the bank of the Seti River between the old airport and the new airport minutes before landing on January 15, 2023, which was the 104th crash in Nepali skies and the third biggest in terms of casualties.\n\nThe only incidents in which more people were killed took place in July and September 1992. Those crashes involved aircraft of Thai Airways and Pakistan International Airlines and left 113 and 167 people dead, respectively.\n\nOn May 29, 2022, all 22 people on board, including four members of an Indian family, were killed as a Tara Air plane crashed in Nepal's mountainous Mustang district. In 2016, all 23 people aboard were killed when a plane of the same airline flying the same route crashed after takeoff.\n\nIn March 2018, a US-Bangla Air crash occurred at the Tribhuvan International

We are in the process of taking them for post-mortem.\"\n\nThe Civil Aviation Authority said the dead foreigner was a Yemeni citizen.\n\nA press release from the airport said the aircraft \"veered off to the right and crashed on the east side of the runway\" shortly after take-off.\n\nThe survivor was in serious condition in hospital, it added.\n\nRam Kumar K.C., who runs a tyre store near the accident site, told AFP the plane caught fire after hitting the ground.\n\n\"We were about to run to the site but then there was an explosion so we ran away again,\" the 48-year-old said.\n\nThe flight was being conducted for either technical or maintenance purposes, Gyanendra Bhul of Nepal's Civil Aviation Authority told AFP without giving further details.\n\nImages of the aftermath shared by Nepal's military showed the plane's fuselage split apart and burnt to a husk.\n\nAround a dozen soldiers in camouflage were standing on top of the wreckage with the surrounding earth coated in fire retardant.\n\nThe aircraft crashed at around 11:15 am (0530 GMT), the military said in a statement, adding that the army's quick response team had been lending assistance with rescue efforts.\n\nThe plane was scheduled to fly on Nepal's busiest air route between Kathmandu and Pokhara, an important tourism hub in the Himalayan republic.\n\nSaurya Airlines exclusively flies Bombardier CRJ 200 jets, according to its website.\n\nNepal's air industry has boomed in recent years, carrying goods and people between hard-to-reach areas as well as foreign trekkers and climbers.\n\nBut it has been plagued by poor safety due to insufficient training and maintenance -- issues compounded by the mountainous republic's treacherous geography.\n\nThe European Union has banned all Nepali carriers from its airspace over safety concerns.\n\nThe Himalayan country has some of the world's trickiest runways to land on, flanked by snow-capped peaks with approaches that pose a challenge even for accomplished pilots.\n\nThe weather can also change quickly in the mountains, creating treacherous flying conditions.\n\nNepal's last major commercial flight accident was in January 2023, when a Yeti Airlines service crashed while landing at Pokhara, killing all 72 aboard.\n\nEarlier that year a Thai Airways aircraft had crashed near the same airport, killing 113 people.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com",

The footage captures the jet's final seconds before impact.\n\nThe video begins shortly after take-off, with the plane already out of control and only a few hundred feet above the ground. Within moments, the Saurya Airlines flight to Pokhara, which was tilting to the right, suddenly veers left and crashes, erupting into flames.\n\nAuthorities have confirmed that there were 19 people on board -- two crew members and 17 passengers. Tragically, 18 people have died. The sole survivor, the pilot, has been taken to a local hospital, according to an airport security official.\n\nThe cause of the crash remains unknown at this time.\n\nEarlier today, another shocking video captured the exact moment the plane hit the ground.\n\nVIDEO | Exact Moment Saurya Airlines Plane Crashed At Kathmandu Airport\n\nThis 18-second video, recorded by a CCTV camera at the airport, shows the plane slamming into the runway, skidding across the ground, and bursting into flames.\n\nNepal's aviation sector has seen rapid growth recently but is plagued by poor safety standards, inadequate training, and maintenance issues. Consequently, the European Union has banned Nepali airlines from entering its airspace. The country's challenging topography, featuring high-altitude runways surrounded by mountainous terrain, poses significant risks even for experienced pilots.\n\nThe weather in these regions is also notoriously unpredictable, further complicating aviation safety.\n\nREAD | Kathmandu Crash: Nepal Home To Some Of World's Trickiest Runways\n\nIn January last year, a Yeti Airlines plane crashed while landing in Pokhara, killing all 72 people on board. That incident was Nepal's deadliest plane crash since 1992 when a Pakistani jet crashed in Kathmandu, killing all 167 passengers. That same year, a Thai Airways flight also crashed, resulting in 113 fatalities.\n\nThis recent crash has also drawn attention to the dangers of tabletop runways in India.\n\nTabletop runways are located on top of hills or elevated terrain, creating a steep drop on one or more sides and leaving very little room for error if a plane overshoots the runway.\n\nREAD | Nepal Crash Red-Flags Table-Top Runways Risk, India Has 5\n\nIndia has five airports with tabletop runways -- Shimla, Kozhikode, Mangaluru, Lengpui (in Mizoram), and Pakyong (in Sikkim).

Fire engines and ambulances raced to the crash site immediately afterward.\n\nAirport chief Jagannath Niraula said the crash at around 11:15 a.m. local time \"happened as soon as it left the ground, after less than a minute.\"\n\nHowever, authorities have yet to comment on any possible cause.\n\nPoor visibility amid rapidly changing weather conditions produced by Nepal's high terrain, landing strips perched on mountainsides and aging fleets in one of Southeast Asia's poorest countries all contribute to making it one of the most difficult places for aircraft to operate.\n\nNepal has seen many aviation disasters over the years, most of which have been blamed on bad weather and weak enforcement of regulatory standards.\n\nIn January 2023 when at least 68 passengers and four crew were killed after a Yeti Airlines turboprop aircraft went down in a gorge near Pokhara.\n\nThe deadliest year was 1992 when a Thai Airways Airbus A310 crashed at Kathmandu Airport in July killing 113

Television visuals showed fire fighters trying to put out the blaze and thick black smoke rising into the sky. They also showed the plane flying a little above the runway and then tilting before it crashed.\n\nNepal averages about one flight disaster a year. Nepal has seen an unusually high number of plane crashes in the last decade. The deadliest plane crash in the country took place on January 16, 2023, in Pokhara, where 72 people died. In the last 12 years, the Kathmandu plane crash is the 13th plane crash reported in Nepal.\n\nOne of the most common reasons why Nepal has seen over a dozen aircraft accidents in the last decade is because of the lack of proper maintenance and aircraft training. Nepal is a struggling economy, and there is a lack of infrastructure for proper maintenance of aircrafts, and proper training of staff.\n\nNepal also has a tricky topography which makes it difficult for pilots to navigate to the small and remote airports in the country. Nepal also lacks the infrastructure for accurate weather forecasts, especially in remote areas and mountainous terrains, where some of the most deadly plane crashes of the country have taken place.\n\nThe weather in Nepal is unpredictable and changes quickly in many areas due to the hilly terrain, and can make for dangerous conditions for a flight.\n\nIt is currently the monsoon season in Nepal but it was not raining at the time of the plane crash in Kathmandu today. However, weather agencies said that there was low visibility in the area.\n\nThe Kathmandu airport, the main airport serving Nepal, is located inside a valley surrounded by mountains on most sides. It is considered a challenging airport for pilots and bigger planes have to come through an opening on the mountain to land. It is right next to the city.

The country is home to eight of the world's 14 tallest mountain peaks.\n\nThe country's main airport is ringed by mountains, affecting wind direction and intensity and making takeoff and landing a challenge for pilots.\n\nThe deadliest incident occurred in 1992, when a Pakistan International Airlines Airbus crashed into a hillside while approaching Kathmandu, killing 167 people.\n\nMore recently, at least 72 people were killed in a Yeti airlines crash in January 2023 that was later attributed to the pilots mistakenly cutting off power.\n\n(Reporting by Kathmandu newsroom; Additional

In the incident, 18 people onboard were killed and the pilot, the only survivor, was seriously injured. The plane flying from Kathmandu to Pokhara turned in the wrong direction.\n\nNepal has been criticised for its poor air safety record in recent years. But reasons for plane crashes also include partly sudden weather changes and partly airstrips located in hard-to-access rocky terrains apart from human error. In January last year, all 72 people on board, including five Indians, were killed when a Yeti Airlines aircraft crashed in the resort city of Pokhara. The crash was attributed to a human error.\n\nAccording to Nepal's civil aviation body, 914 people have died in air crashes in the country since the first disaster was recorded in August 1955. But why does Nepal witness frequent airplane crashes?\n\nThe first reason is Nepal's geographical challenges. According to the safety report of Nepal's Civil Aviation Authority, Nepal's mountains and narrow valleys are a big challenge for pilots.\n\nThe second reason is Nepal's weather - Rain and fog are common in Nepal, which makes landing and takeoff of planes dangerous.\n\nNatural challenges are not the only reason for plane crashes in Nepal. A major reason for this is also the lack of technology in Nepal. Most of the planes of Nepali Airlines are old and second-hand, which have outdated systems installed.\n\nDespite being old, the lack of maintenance of planes is also a big problem which poses a safety risk. Apart from this, a big reason is also the lack of pilots. This lack is so big that inexperienced pilots are allowed to fly planes, which increases the risk of accidents.", "source": {"uri": "dnaindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokhara", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeti_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yeti Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribhuvan_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tribhuvan International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aviation safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_accidents_and_incidents", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation accidents and incidents"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aerodrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Takeoff"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2024/07/24/2642442-dna.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758495", "eventUri": "eng-9758495", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Its weather can change suddenly, and airstrips are typically sited in difficult-to-reach, mountainous areas.\n\nAircraft with 19 seats or fewer are more likely to have accidents due to these difficulties, according to a 2019 safety report from the Civil Aviation Authority.\n\nWhile the country has made improvements in safety standards in recent years, challenges remain, and a lack of investment in aging aircraft only adds to the risks of flying.\n\nIn early 2018, a US-Bangla Airlines flight from Bangladesh's capital Dhaka to Kathmandu crashed on landing and caught fire, killing 51 people.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Only the pilot has survived. The ill-fated flight, bound for Pokhara, met with disaster around 11am today, according to news agency PTI.\n\nPremnath Thakur, spokesperson for the airport, confirmed the crash and reported the tragic loss of lives. Police and firefighters immediately launched rescue operations at the scene. A security official revealed that the pilot was rushed to hospital but refrained from providing further details.\n\nEyewitness accounts described the harrowing moments as the plane caught fire, releasing a significant plume of smoke, reported news portal Khabarhub. Emergency services swiftly extinguished the blaze, but the damage had already been done.\n\nThe aircraft, a Bombardier CRJ 200 jet, was part of Saurya Airlines' fleet, primarily used to connect hard-to-reach areas and tourist destinations across Nepal. Despite the country's burgeoning air industry, safety concerns remain prevalent due to inadequate training and maintenance. Consequently, the European Union has banned all Nepali carriers from its airspace.\n\nNepal has a troubling history of aviation disasters, averaging one flight catastrophe per year. Since 2010, there have been at least 12 fatal crashes.\n\nIn January 2023, a Yeti Airlines flight tragically crashed near Pokhara, killing all 72 people on board. Similarly, in May 2022, a Tara Air plane went down in the Mustang district, resulting in 22 fatalities.\n\nAnother notable disaster occurred in 2018, when a US-Bangla Airlines flight crash-landed near Kathmandu, claiming 51 lives and seriously injuring 20 others, reported Hindustan Times.\n\nIn related news, Taliban officials confirmed that a plane, en route from Pattaya, Thailand, to Russia, crashed in Afghanistan on January 21, resulting in the loss of two lives, while four passengers managed to survive. The chartered Dassault Aviation AM.PA Falcon 10 aircraft took off from the U-Tapao International Airport in Pattaya on January 20 with six passengers bound for Moscow, Russia.\n\nIn other news,

The doomed flight had 19 people on board, including technical staff members and two crew members. This incident highlights ongoing concerns about Nepal's aviation safety record, which has been criticized for years due to factors such as unpredictable weather conditions and lax regulatory oversight.\n\nThe crash occurred at approximately 11:15 local time (05:30 GMT), just minutes after the plane took off. According to a statement from the Nepal Civil Aviation Authority's search and rescue coordination center, the flight was headed to Pokhara, a popular tourist destination known for its scenic beauty and as a gateway to the Annapurna Circuit, a renowned trekking route.\n\nJagannath Niraula, the airport chief, informed BBC Nepali that the accident happened almost immediately after takeoff. \"It happened as soon as it left the ground, in not even a minute,\" he said. While the exact cause of the crash has yet to be determined, preliminary assessments suggest that the aircraft veered in the wrong direction. \"As soon as it took off, it turned right, [when it] should have turned left,\" Niraula explained.\n\nRescue workers were quickly on the scene, navigating through the charred wreckage. Photos from the site depict large portions of the plane blackened and burnt, with earlier visuals showing the aircraft engulfed in flames and smoke. Fire engines and ambulances responded rapidly to the emergency, but despite their swift action, 17 Nepali nationals and one Yemeni national, who was working as an engineer, lost their lives.\n\nEyewitnesses reported hearing \"some cracking noises\" from the plane before the crash, adding to the speculation about potential mechanical failure or pilot error. The exact sequence of events leading to the disaster will be the subject of a thorough investigation by aviation authorities.\n\nNepal's aviation industry has a notorious reputation for poor safety standards. This latest incident adds to a grim history of aviation disasters in the country. In January 2023, a Yeti Airlines crash resulted in the deaths of at least 72 people. That tragedy was attributed to the pilots mistakenly cutting off the power, marking the deadliest air crash in Nepal since 1992. In that earlier disaster, all 167 people aboard a Pakistan International Airlines flight perished when the plane crashed on approach to Kathmandu Airport.\n\nSaurya Airlines, which operates a fleet of three Bombardier CRJ-200 jets, flies to five destinations within Nepal. The airline's website states that it aims to provide safe and reliable air transport, but this incident casts a shadow over those claims.\n\nThe broader issues plaguing Nepal's aviation sector include a challenging topography, unpredictable weather patterns, and inadequate infrastructure. The country's mountainous terrain and rapidly changing weather can make flying hazardous, particularly for smaller aircraft. Additionally, the regulatory framework governing aviation in Nepal has been criticized for not enforcing stringent safety protocols and for being slow to adopt international best practices.\n\nIn response to past incidents, there have been calls for comprehensive reforms to improve aviation safety in Nepal. These reforms include upgrading airport infrastructure, enhancing pilot training programs, and implementing more rigorous maintenance procedures for aircraft. International aviation bodies have also urged Nepal to align its safety standards with global norms to prevent future tragedies.\n\nAs the investigation into this latest crash unfolds, the families of the victims and the sole surviving pilot face a long and difficult journey ahead. The pilot's testimony will be crucial in understanding what went wrong and in ensuring that lessons are learned to prevent similar accidents in the future.\n\nThis tragedy serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with air travel in Nepal. Despite the beauty and allure of the country's landscapes, the safety of its aviation industry remains a pressing concern. Ensuring the safety of passengers and crew must be the top priority for airlines and regulatory authorities alike.\n\nIn the wake of this disaster, there will undoubtedly be renewed scrutiny of Saurya Airlines and the overall safety practices within Nepal's aviation sector. The international community and aviation experts will be watching closely to see how Nepal addresses these challenges and works to improve its safety record.\n\nFor now, the focus remains on supporting the families of those who lost their lives and on conducting a thorough investigation to uncover the causes of the crash. Only by addressing the underlying issues and implementing necessary reforms can Nepal hope to prevent future aviation tragedies and restore confidence in its air travel industry.", "source": {"uri": "bbntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bbntimes.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rayson_choo@bbntimes.com", "name": "Rayson Choo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Takeoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saurya_Airlines", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saurya Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribhuvan_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tribhuvan International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapurna_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annapurna Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aviation safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_and_rescue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search and rescue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_accidents_and_incidents", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aviation accidents and incidents"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokhara", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_CRJ100/200", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bombardier CRJ100/200"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeti_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yeti Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_International_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan International Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pilot error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_travel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air travel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Topography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.bbntimes.com/images/articles/society/Pilot_Only_Survivor_of_Nepal_Plane_Crash_-_Tragedy_at_Kathmandu_Airport.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758495", "eventUri": "eng-9758495", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

the EU for \"failure to adhere to the applicable international safety standards.\"\n\nProfessor Ron Bartch, chairman and founding director of aviation consultancy firm AvLaw, told Business Insider that one reason for its poor safety record is that the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal is \"not a terribly well-resourced safety regulator.\"\n\nThe CAAN did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nNepal's mountainous terrain, unpredictable weather, and remote runways have contributed to the country's reputation as one of the most difficult places to

The tragic accident occurred around 11 am while the plane was en route to Pokhara. As of now, Reuters has reported that 18 bodies have been recovered from the wreckage.\n\nThe aircraft, which included passengers and aircrew, faced the mishap leading to immediate and chaotic rescue operations. Rescue teams, including police and firefighters, are diligently working at the crash site to locate and assist any survivors. The pilot of the aircraft has been rushed to a hospital, a security official deployed at the airport confirmed.\n\nA fire that ignited from the aircraft upon crashing has been extinguished, adding a layer of relief amidst the chaos. However, the current conditions of the remaining passengers are still unknown, creating a tense atmosphere for the families awaiting news of their loved ones.\n\nThis tragic event is eerily reminiscent of a previous accident involving a Yeti Airlines flight last January. In that incident, a plane crashed near Nepal's Pokhara, killing all 72 people on board. The aircraft plunged into a steep gorge, disintegrating before bursting into flames. A government investigation later attributed the crash to pilot error.\n\nThe recurring nature of such accidents within Nepal's aviation sector raises serious concerns about the safety protocols and operational standards of airlines operating in the region. For passengers, this incident not only highlights the inherent risks associated with air travel but also instills a profound sense of fear and uncertainty. The thought of a plane slipping off the runway and crashing during what should be a routine flight creates a horror scenario that is every traveler's nightmare.\n\nThe aftermath of such crashes leaves a lasting impact on passengers' psyche, influencing their future travel choices. The fear of flying is exacerbated by news of these tragic accidents, potentially leading to a decline in airline passenger numbers. For those who have experienced such trauma, either directly or through the loss of loved ones, the emotional scars can be deep and enduring.\n\nMoreover, this incident casts a shadow over the operational integrity of Saurya Airlines and similar carriers. Passengers will demand greater transparency and stringent safety measures to ensure such tragedies are not repeated. The aviation industry must respond with enhanced safety protocols, rigorous training for pilots, and comprehensive maintenance checks for aircraft to restore passenger confidence.\n\nThe psychological horror of a plane crash is profound, extending beyond the immediate physical dangers. Passengers boarding a flight do so with an inherent trust in the airline's ability to transport them safely to their destination. When this trust is shattered by such catastrophic events, it leaves an indelible mark on the collective consciousness of air travelers.\n\nIn the wake of this crash, Saurya Airlines faces the daunting task of not only addressing the immediate needs of the victims and their families but also rebuilding its reputation.

The country has seen 19 fatal aviation incidents since the turn of the century, with a total of 359 fatalities. Today's accident follows the crash of Yeti Airlines Flight 691 in January 2023, Nepal's deadliest in 30 years.\n\nAll Nepalese airlines have been banned from European airspace since 2013 over their poor safety records and while aviation regulators have noted some improvements in recent years, they say issues remain.\n\nHere, we consider why Nepal remains one of the world's most dangerous places to fly, and ask what passengers looking to travel there can do to minimise their risks.\n\nWhat caused the latest crash?\n\nThe causes of the latest crash remain unclear, but more details are likely to emerge in the coming days.\n\nThe plane crashed at around 11:15 am (05:30 GMT), the Nepali military said in a statement. News site Khabarhub reported that the aircraft had caught fire after skidding on the runway.\n\nThe plane was scheduled to fly on Nepal's busiest air route between Kathmandu and Pokhara, an important tourism hub in the Himalayan republic. Saurya Airlines exclusively flies Bombardier CRJ200s, according to its website. The crash leaves it with a fleet of just one aircraft.\n\nDoes Nepal suffer more crashes than other countries?\n\nYes. The crash is Nepal's 12th fatal air accident in as many years, a remarkable stat considering its relatively modest flight schedule.\n\nWhile there is no definitive global reference of aviation safety by country, by most metrics Nepal is one of the world's most dangerous places to fly.\n\nAs mentioned above, all Nepalese airlines have been banned from European airspace since 2013 over their poor safety records.\n\nAn International Civil Aviation Organisation audit of aviation safety in 2022 found that the level of implementation of certain elements of safety management in Nepal remained below the global average.\n\nAirlineRatings.com ranks Nepal Airlines in its bottom 14 airlines for safety, with just one star, alongside carriers from Iran and Suriname.\n\nWhat are the causes of Nepal's poor safety record?\n\nA combination of factors have led to Nepal's worrying record. AirlineRatings.com Editor-in-Chief Geoffrey Thomas lists three key reasons, including \"treacherous flying conditions in and around the Himalayas\", sometimes \"substandard pilot training and thus skills\", plus \"poor and dangerous airports which are often below world standards due to the mountainous terrain.\"\n\nThe country is home to many of the world's highest mountains, which makes it uniquely hazardous for pilots, who must navigate both the peaks and rapidly changing weather. Back in 2015, the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization prioritised the country for technical assistance, subsequently stating its \"beautiful but rugged terrain makes the safety of air operations more challenging than in other areas of the world.\"\n\nMountainous airports generally have shorter runways, which require higher pilot skill and can only accommodate smaller, sometimes less reliable aircraft. Nepal's Lukla Airport, the gateway to the Everest region, has previously been dubbed the world's most dangerous, an unwelcome but unsurprising title given its accident rate. The airport's runway is just 1,729 feet long (Heathrow's shortest is 12,008 feet) and ends abruptly at a brick wall. With rising mountains all around there is little opportunity for an aborted landing so pilots must get it right the first time. The airport's altitude also means the air is thinner so planes have no choice but to arrive faster, too.\n\nAs Nepal remains one of the poorest countries in Asia, it's unsurprising that some of its airlines have ageing fleets and its pilot training programmes might not rival those of western countries. Industry insiders have observed some older planes don't even have GPS systems. Still, according to the website Planespotters.net, the Saurya Airlines Bombardier CRJ200 aircraft involved in the latest crash (registration 9N-AME) was 21 years old - a fairly typical age for a commercial plane. The Yeti Airlines aircraft involved in the 2023 crash was only 15 years old.\n\nSome feel Nepalese authorities could do more to increase safety in the skies. After a 2022 crash involving Tara Air, Ashok Pokharel, president of the Nepal Association of Tour Operators, told the Guardian: \"The older aircraft don't have modern weather radars. That could be mandated so the captain has real-time weather information for what he is flying into.\"\n\nWhat can travellers do to lessen their risks?\n\nThose hoping to head out on bucket-list Everest trips or other Himalayan trekking holidays may be anxious about booking internal flights in the country, which, given the poor state of its roads, are hard to avoid.\n\nThe Foreign Office (FCDO) travel advice page for Nepal states: \"Air crashes can have a variety of causes and are not necessarily linked with poor safety standards or non-compliance with international safety standards. However, there have been a number of fatal accidents and air crashes across Nepal in the commercial air transport sector (involving planes and helicopters). Over the last five years, this includes a number of separate incidents and at least 100 deaths.\n\nIt adds: \"The UK Air Safety List (ASL) lists all known airlines in Nepal that do not meet international safety standards and are banned from operating commercial air services to or from the UK. Check the UK Air Safety List when considering whether to fly and which airlines to fly with. The list is maintained by the Department for Transport, based on advice from the UK Civil Aviation Authority.\n\n\"Currently no Nepali airline meets the international safety standards and so all are listed on the ASL. This means they are all banned from operating commercial air services to or from the UK.\"\n\nIn the end, tourists set on a trip may simply have to assess their own appetite for risk. As Geoffrey Thomas states: \"For travellers and adventure tourists there is little choice. Everest is dangerous to climb and so is flying there.\"\n\nThis article was first published in January 2023 and has been revised and updated.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

Captain Manish Ratna Shakya survived the incident.\n\nThe pilot, who was pulled from the flaming wreckage on Wednesday and he is the only survivor of the tragic accident and is presently undergoing treatment in a hospital.\n\nTwo crew members and seventeen corporate personnel, including technical staff, were on board the Saurya Airlines test flight. It was headed west, to Pokhara, the popular tourist destination in the Himalayas.\n\nThe aviation sector in Nepal has a poor safety record, which has been ascribed to a number of things over the years, including erratic weather patterns and loose laws.\n\nAs part of a routine maintenance check, the aircraft was headed for Pokhara when it crashed a few minutes after take-off from Tribhuvan International Airport. The crash occurred at approximately 11:15 local time (05:30 GMT), according to a statement from the search and rescue coordination centre of the Nepal Civil Aviation Authority.\n\nThe pilot got lacerations on his forehead and eyes, according to police spokeswoman Dan Bahadur Karki, but his life was not in jeopardy.\n\n\"There was a very loud noise, it sounded like maybe a truck had overturned on the road. The plane then hit the ground and caught fire. We were about to run to the site but then there was an explosion so we ran away again,\" a man present in a shop near the crash told the news agency.\n\nAccording to Saurya Airlines' website, Captain Manish Ratna Shakya, who pilots the CRJ200 regional aircraft has survived the crash. He serves as the airline's chief of operations. He worked for Simrik Airlines for over three years before joining Saurya Airlines, according to his LinkedIn profile. His time at St. Xavier's School is now over.\n\nAccording to the police, Captain Shakya, 37, was pulled from the wreckage and brought to KMC Hospital in Sinamangal for medical attention. With the verified deaths of eighteen of the nineteen passengers on board, he is the only survivor of the disaster.\n\nPrevious to this incident, on May 29, 2022, a Tara aircraft carrying 22 passengers including four Indians from Thane crashed in Nepal's rugged Mustang province, killing every person on board. It appears that the primary cause of aviation crashes in Nepal is bad weather. The weather in this hilly region fluctuates frequently, making it challenging to conduct flights without an accurate weather forecasting system.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsgrail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsGrail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vanshika_sharma@thesportsgrail.com", "name": "Vanshika Sharma", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakya", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shakya"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(armed_forces)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (armed forces)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokhara", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saurya_Airlines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saurya Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Himalayas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribhuvan_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tribhuvan International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Aviation_Authority_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noise pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_and_rescue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Search and rescue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinamangal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sinamangal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_airliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Regional airliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Province"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weather forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustang_District", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mustang District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mustang District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thane", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Thane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://thesportsgrail.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CHILLING-CCTV-FOOTAGE-SHOWS-RICHARD-RUSSELL-STEALING-PLANE-BEFORE-FATAL-CRASH.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758495", "eventUri": "eng-9758495", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Wednesday's crash is the latest addition to the series of crash witnessed in the mountainous region over the last few decades. The plane was en route to the resort town of Pokhara.\n\nAccording to preliminary reports from Nepal state media, 18 people have succumbed to the crash. Nepal has been working to overcome its challenges in aviation.\n\nDespite the tragic casualty record, Nepal has stepped up its efforts to improve aviation safety.\n\nThe Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal has been focusing on improving safety in Nepali aviation - such as building improvements at airports, upgrading safety equipment, and fostering a positive safety culture by encouraging hazard reporting.\n\nNepal's considerable improvement in safety measures and compliance with international standards was recognised by ICAO in 2018. However, the country must continue work on its aviation reform to make its skies safe for everyone.\n\nThe ATR 72 aircraft is one typical aircraft used by Nepali carriers. It is a turboprop-powered regional aircraft with a capacity between 44 and 78 passengers. These aircraft are manufactured by a joint venture of Airbus in France and Leonardo in Italy.\n\nChallenging topography\n\nNepal, situated between India and China, is home to eight of the world's 14 highest mountains, including Mount Everest. For flight operations, it's an almost unrivalled, harsh environment with sudden weather changes that can make for hazardous conditions.\n\nAviation experts say commercial aircrafts in Nepal never get to a point where they are not fit to fly and still in operation. Most of the aircraft operating in Nepal are not brand new. They cost a lot and flying them may not be viable in an economically backward nation.\n\nThe unpredictable weather changes in the high terrains between takeoff and landing is the reason for most accidents. In these routes, most domestic flights use visual flight rules (VFR) in which the pilot controls and navigates the plane using visual references from outside.\n\nWhy 'table-top runways are prone to accidents\n\nTable-top runways are often constructed by excavating the peaks of hills create what is known as a table-top. Kathmandu airport is one with a table-top, making the runway vulnerable to air tragedies.\n\nSuch runways have steep drops at one or both ends, increasing the possibility of injuries and fatalities if pilots under or overshoot their approach, either through human error or mechanical failure.\n\nThey are most commonly found in mountainous areas where flat land is scarce, or in low-lying areas like Kozhikode in India where space is at a premium or there is fear of waterlogging at ground level.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"}, "authors": [],

Only pilot Manish Shankya survived the crash -- he is currently being treated at a nearby hospital for a head injury.\n\nNepal is notorious for its poor aviation safety record with multiple factors -- the country's challenging mountainous terrain, unpredictable weather, aging aircraft, poor infrastructure, and inadequate regulatory oversight -- leading to frequent accidents.\n\nWhat do we know about the crash on Wednesday?\n\nThe Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN), in a press release, said that the ill-fated aircraft took off from the Tribhuvan International Airport at 11.11 am (Nepal Standard Time) on Wednesday. \"Shortly after takeoff from runway 02, the aircraft veered off to the right and crashed on the east side of the runway,\" the press release said.\n\nAccording to eyewitness accounts, as quoted in The Kathmandu Post, the plane flipped after the wing-tip hit the ground during takeoff. Witnesses said that the aircraft immediately caught fire, and plunged deep into a gorge to the east of the runway. Multiple videos doing rounds on social media show the aircraft flying slightly above the runway before banking sharply to one side and crashing.\n\nWhat caused the crash?\n\nThis can happen due to a number of reasons including engine failure (the sharp bank could have been caused by one engine failing/stalling), faulty pre-flight planning (the plane was heavier than expected), other technical issues, or even pilot error. A proper investigation will shed further light into exactly what was behind the mishap on Wednesday.\n\nConditions on the airport, however, not all too bad. It is the monsoon season in Kathmandu, but it was not raining at the time of the crash although visibility was low across the capital.\n\nWhy does Nepal have such a poor aviation safety record?\n\nAccording to the Geneva-based Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives (B3A), Nepal has seen 68 aviation accidents since 1946, which have claimed a total of 900 lives. The Aviation Safety Network puts the number of fatal accidents (since 1919) at 41, with 878 total fatalities.\n\nThese numbers are very high, when taking into account the relatively low number of flights Nepal has seen takeoff or land on its soil. The rugged mountainous terrain, dearth of investment in new planes and infrastructure, and poor regulation have contributed to these crashes.\n\nIn Nepal, airstrips are often precariously placed on plateaus or cut mountains. They require a high degree of skill to land on, and are conducive to frequent accidents simply on the basis of pilot errors. Smaller runways are also capable of handling lighter, often single-engine, aircraft. These, however, are more susceptible to inclement weather which is common across Nepal.\n\nThe Kathmandu airport too is challenging for pilots. Although it boasts a relatively longer 3,350 m runway (compared to other Nepalese airports) allowing heavier aircraft to operate, this is still shorter than most major international airports. Given the altitude (1,338 m) at which the airport is located, this is more of a challenge -- in higher altitudes, aircraft need more speed to takeoff due to the thinner air.\n\nMoreover, constructed in the narrow, oval-shaped Kathmandu valley, the airport is sandwiched between jagged high mountains on all sides. This means pilots have less room in which to maneouvre their aircraft. The mountains also impact local weather conditions, and can lead to sudden turbulence and weather changes.\n\nAccording to reports, many of the aircraft operating in Nepal are aging and lack world class maintenance. Many lack equipment and facilities which are nowadays considered standard in other countries.\n\nThis is why all Nepal-based aircraft were banned from entering European airspace by the European Union in 2013. The Kathmandu Post reported in 2022 that behind the ban (which is still active) was the Nepal government's failure to act on improving aviation safety regulation and its implementation.\n\nCentral to this problem is the fact that Nepal's aviation regulator, CAAN, is also the country's primary service provider in the areas of 'air navigation services' and 'aerodrome operations'. This is a serious conflict of interest because effectively, CAAN is policing its own operations. In India, for example, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is the regulator whereas the Airports Authority of India (AAI) provides air-navigation services and runs airports.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "explained_desk@indianexpress.com", "name": "Explained Desk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aviation safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Takeoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Runway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Aviation_Authority_of_Nepal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_accidents_and_incidents", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aviation accidents and incidents"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saurya_Airlines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saurya Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribhuvan_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tribhuvan International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pilot error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokhara", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stall_(fluid_dynamics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stall (fluid dynamics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_Safety_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight Safety Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kathmandu_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Kathmandu Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monsoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu_Valley", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu Valley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airports_Authority_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airports Authority of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorate_General_of_Civil_Aviation_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Directorate General of Civil Aviation (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plateau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airspace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turbulence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_navigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air navigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Aeronautical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Aeronautical", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/07/PTI07_24_2024_000165B.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758495", "eventUri": "eng-9758495", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

In 2023, there were no fatal crashes involving passenger jet aircraft on scheduled flights.\n\nOf the two fatal accidents - both involving propellor aircraft - the first and deadliest was in Nepal. Yeti Airlines flight YT673 from Kathmandu crashe on approach to Pokhara. All 72 passengers and crew died in an accident attributed to pilot error.\n\nWe have yet to find out what went wrong with the latest tragedy, which took place on the same route. The Saurya Airlines commuter jet was taking off from the Nepali capital when it rolled and crashed into a ravine. The pilot survived but the remaining 18 on board did not.\n\nThe calamity takes Nepal to a tragic score of 14 crashes in 14 years - a rate way beyond any other country in the world.\n\nThe current sequence began in August 2010, when 14 people lost their lives on an Agni Air domestic flight from Kathmandu to Lukla, which had turned back due to a technical problem.\n\nTwenty-two more people died aboard a Tara Air Twin Otter during a domestic flight to Kathmandu in December 2010.\n\nIn September 2011, 19 people lost their lives on the approach to Kathmandu on a Buddha Air Beechcraft.\n\nA year later, seven British passengers were among the 19 people who died aboard a Sita Air Dornier 228 that came down shortly after take off from Kathmandu, destination Lukla. They were at the start of what was to be a three-week trek.\n\nThe crash was blamed on \"a combination of factors, including an overweight aircraft with too much luggage stowed on board\".\n\nThe litany of tragedy continues. Crashes in parts of Africa, South America and the former Soviet Union are far from unknown. But accident rates in Nepal are a different order of magnitude - resembling those from the early days of mass passenger air transport in the 1950s rather than the ultra-safe 2020s.\n\nThe challenging terrain and weather in Nepal demand pilots and engineers of the highest standards, but time and again they fall short.\n\nThe nation's airlines tend to use old, ill-maintained aircraft; the Saurya Airlines plane was over 20 years old, which is not an issue with good technical support. But Nepal has inadequate training in, and enforcement of, international aviation norms.\n\nAll Nepali airlines are banned from the European Union because of safety shortcomings.\n\nFor the past decade, the International Civil Aviation Organization has sought to improve safety under its \"No Country Left Behind\" initiative. The aim of this UN body is to harmonise \"Standards and Recommended Practices\" - those vital norms that keep the vast majority of passengers and crew. The aim is to give every nation \"access to the significant socio-economic benefits of a safe and reliable aviation system\".\n\nTravellers to the mountain kingdom must continue to weigh the risks of flying - while also being aware that Nepal's roads are lethal, too, with an accident rate six times higher than in the UK.\n\nThere is little hope that this litany of tragedy will end soon.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saurya_Airlines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saurya Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeti_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yeti Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pilot error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Domestic flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_airliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jet airliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lukla", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lukla"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lukla"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokhara", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pokhara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dornier_228", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dornier 228"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agni_Air", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agni Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sita_Air", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sita Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha_Air", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buddha Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tara_Air", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tara Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Canada_DHC-6_Twin_Otter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Soviet_states", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Post-Soviet states"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_magnitude_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moment magnitude scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Civil_Aviation_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Civil Aviation Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/3e84aaf01858153c782c563a1b856ea6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758495", "eventUri": "eng-9758495", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-08-", "textStart": 832, "textEnd": 843}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-12-", "textStart": 1082, "textEnd": 1095}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-09-", "textStart": 1101, "textEnd": 1115}], "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

Both Calicut and Mangalore airports have experienced major crashes in the past.\n\nA tragic plane crash in Nepal that claimed as many as 18 lives has once again brought attention to the dangers linked with table-top runways, which have been the sites of several plane accidents globally. Table-top runways are elevated above the surrounding terrain, creating steep drops on one or more sides. This elevation leaves pilots with little margin for error, as overshooting the runway can result in the plane plummeting down the slope.\n\nIndia has five airports with table-top runways: Shimla, Calicut, Mangalore, Lengpui (Mizoram), and Pakyong (Sikkim). Both Calicut and Mangalore airports have experienced major crashes in the past. On May 22, 2010, Air India Express Flight 812 from Dubai to Mangaluru crashed on landing, killing 158 people, including six crew members.\n\nSaurya Airlines aircraft crashes in Kathmandu: Revisiting history of fatal plane crashes in Nepal\n\nTen years later, on August 7, 2020, another table-top runway in India became the site of a tragedy. An Air India Express flight from Dubai to Kozhikode, part of the Vande Bharat mission to repatriate Indians stranded by the COVID-19 pandemic, skidded off the runway and crashed. The accident claimed 19 lives, including both pilots, but 169 passengers survived.\n\nCivil aviation regulator, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) periodically reviews table-top airports to ensure passenger safety. In 2022, a DGCA official said that these reviews aim to prevent unforeseen incidents and make landings at these challenging airports safer.\n\nTable-top runways have also been the sites of crashes outside India. For instance, Madeira airport in Portugal witnessed a deadly accident in 1977 when an Air Portugal Flight 425 overshot the runway and crashed onto a beach, killing 131 people.\n\nNepal, with a poor air travel safety record, has also seen crashes on table-top runways. On May 27, 2017, a cargo plane crashed at Tenzing-Hillary Airport in Solukhumbu, another airport with such a runway.\n\nCaught on camera: Dramatic moment when out-of-control Saurya Airlines plane crashed in Kathmandu (WATCH)\n\nIn the recent crash in Nepal, a Bombardier CRJ 200 flight skidded off the runway at Tribhuvan Airport in Kathmandu and burst into flames. The airport, located atop a plateau surrounded by deep gorges and valleys, is considered one of the riskiest to land at.\n\nIt was also the site of a devastating crash in 1992 when a Pakistan International Airlines plane crashed, killing 167 people. The Saurya Airlines flight involved in the latest crash was en route to Pokhara and had crew and technical staff on board.", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

This means there is a steep drop on one or more sides of the runway and this leaves a very slim margin of error for the pilot because if the plane overshoots the runway, it will crash down.\n\nFive airports in India have table-top runways -- Shimla, Calicut, Mangalore, Lengpui (Mizoram) and Pakyong (Sikkim). Of these, Kerala and Mangalore airports have seen big crashes in the past. On May 22, 2010, Air India Express Flight 812 from Dubai to Mangaluru crashed on landing at and 158 passengers, including six crew members, were killed.\n\nTen years later, on August 7, 2020, another table-top runway became the site of a tragedy. The Air India Express flight from Dubai to Kozhikode was part of the Vande Bharat mission to bring back Indian nationals stranded due to Covid pandemic. The plane skidded off the table-top runway and crashed below. Nineteen passengers and both pilots died, but 169 others survived.\n\nCivil Aviation regulator, Directorate General of Civil Aviation, holds periodical reviews of table-top airports to ensure passenger safety. Back in 2022, an official of the DGCA had told the media that the objective behind the review was to prevent any unforeseen incidents and look for ways to make landings in these airports less challenging.\n\nPortugal's Madeira airport, which has a table-top runway, reported a crash back in 1977 when an Air Portugal Flight 425 overshot and crashed onto a beach, killing 131 people.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nEven Nepal, which has a poor air travel safety record, has reported crashes involving table-top runways in the past. On May 27, 2017, a cargo plane at crashed at the Tenzing-Hillary airport in Solukhumbu, which has such a runway.\n\nIn the crash that took place this morning, the Bombardier CRJ 200 flight skidded off the runway and burst into flames, a spokesperson of the airport has told NDTV. Tribhuvan airport in Kathmandu, where the crash took place, is on the top of a plateau and is surrounded by deep gorges and valleys on all sides. Kathmandu airport is among the most risky airports to land and was the site of a huge crash back in 1992, when 167 passengers of a Pakistan International Airlines plane had died.

Nepali state is least bothered", "body": "A plane flies above the wreckage of the Saurya Airlines aircraft that crashed shortly after takeoff at the Kathmandu airport on Wednesday. Angad Dhakal/TKP\n\nThere is a saying about Nepal's aviation industry: Every new tourism minister is greeted by at least one crash.\n\nThis is because the industry is beset by deep-rooted corruption and mismanagement as the country builds airports worth billions of rupees but fails to attract flights. Improving safety remains a far cry.\n\nOn different occasions, global aviation watchdogs have voiced serious concerns about the capability of Nepal's civil aviation authority to oversee safety issues.\n\nIn the past year and a half, more than 100 people have lost their lives in plane crashes -- despite air travel being the world's safest and most regulated industry in the world.\n\nWednesday's crash is the seventh under Pradip Adhikari, the director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal who fits into all political systems, and the fourth fatal one of his tenure.\n\nHere are a few examples of how policy corruption has paralysed the Nepali aviation industry, the lifeline of the country's tourism industry and transport in the mountain region.\n\nA few years back, a parliamentary sub-committee headed by Madhav Kumar Nepal had ordered the government to immediately split the civil aviation body due to its dual role of doing business and regulating the sector.\n\nNepal, the CPN (Unified Socialist) leader, sent Prem Ale to head the tourism ministry a few months later. Ale stopped the bills from being tabled in the lower house for discussion, although the upper house had passed them.\n\nThen, Jeevan Ram Shrestha was appointed tourism minister. On his first day, he announced that he would wait to meet the European Commission's request to separate Nepal's civil aviation into regulatory and service-providing organisations.\n\nAfter that, Sudan Kirati was picked as the tourism minister by the Maoist Centre. He took the initiative to register the civil aviation bills in Parliament.\n\nKirati had accused Director General Adhikari of consistently failing to ensure aviation safety, as five aircraft incidents and accidents, including three major disasters, have occurred under Adhikari's watch.\n\nSources said then-prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal summoned Kirati and Adhikari and ordered them to work \"in tandem\". Kirati then stopped talking about the separation.\n\nThe issue was then taken up by the parliamentary International Relations and Tourism Committee, which directed Dahal, then prime minister, to table the civil aviation bills in the House of Representatives as soon as possible. The directive was issued in December last year.\n\n\"The bills have been languishing for a long time. As we doubt the civil aviation ministry will table them in Parliament, we have directed the Prime Minister's Office to do so,\" Raj Kishore Yadav, chairman of the committee, had told the Post.\n\nA few months later, when the Post approached Yadav to inquire about any progress on the bills, Yadav replied that a split \"was not necessary\". The budget for this fiscal year, too, makes no mention of the plan to split the aviation body, after including it in the federal government's document for three consecutive years.\n\nIn April, lawmaker and member of the International Relations and Tourism Committee Udaya Shumsher Rana told an interaction that he was informed by a former tourism minister that there is an \"invisible\" hand preventing the passage of two crucial civil aviation bills.\n\nIn August 2022, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the United Nations aviation watchdog, formally asked Nepal to split the civil aviation body and ensure a proper regulatory system. However, the Civil Aviation Authority chose to keep the report secret.\n\nA former director general said the tourism industry is bearing the repercussions as planes come down each passing year due to a lax regulatory system. \"People are dying due to 'policy corruption.'\"\n\nOn a sunny Wednesday, nineteen people, including two crew members, were on the Saurya Airlines flight to Pokhara. The 50-seater bombardier CRJ 200 with registration mark 9N-AME was flying 15 technicians to the city, where the jet's heavy maintenance C-check was planned.\n\nAt 11:11 am, the plane took off from the runway's southern end (Koteshwar). But just a few seconds after the takeoff, people around the airport heard a loud \"bang\".\n\n\"That was an unusual sound. It was a big bang like a bomb [exploding],\" said a top official of a private airline, who was a close witness to the crash.\n\nVideo footage obtained by the Post shows that the jet rolled and climbed around 80-90ft from the ground. It then tilted towards the right and instantly came down. It hit the ground and burst into flames.\n\nThe plane then rolled down into a ravine.\n\nThe cockpit slammed into a cargo container, and it was stuck there, which observers say saved the pilot-in-command, Manish Ratna Shakya, the chief of the operation department at Saurya Airlines.\n\n\"The pilot survived. He is in stable condition,\" said DIG Dan Bahadur Karki, spokesperson for Nepal Police. \"It was a miracle.\"\n\nThe fuselage came apart, hit the slope of the tabletop airport, and ricocheted 50 metres away, finally coming to rest on the muddy ground.\n\nEighteen people, including the co-pilot and a foreigner, died. The cockpit and tail were intact.\n\nThe 21.4-year-old aircraft was inducted into the Saurya Airlines fleet on March 14, 2017.\n\nCCTV footage shows that the nature of the crash was similar to last January's Yeti Airlines crash in Pokhara.\n\nExperts suspect many factors, including an engine failure, a bird strike, and poor maintenance.\n\n\"The investigation will tell the truth,\" said Subash Jha, spokesman for Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport. This is the second biggest crash inside the Kathmandu airport after the US Bangla, a Dhaka-based airline, accident in March 2018 killed 52 of the 71 passengers aboard.\n\nExperts observing the crash closely say that, given the nature of the plane's fall, the right engine might have stopped working and the aircraft eventually lost the \"control panel\" mode. This narrow panel, located centrally in front of the pilot, can be used to control heading, speed, altitude, vertical speed, vertical navigation, and lateral navigation.\n\n\"The aircraft has banked,\" said an aircraft engineer. A banked turn (or banking turn) is a turn or change of direction in which the aircraft banks or inclines, usually towards the inside of the turn.\n\n\"Had it been the left engine, it could have potentially crashed into at least two big planes parked at the tarmac of the airport and the domestic terminal. The impact was huge. The plane just exploded.\"\n\nOne official at the safety department of the civil aviation body suspected a potential bird strike. \"What happens when a bird enters an aircraft engine? If an aircraft engine ingests a bird, it can result in engine failure.\"\n\n\"In such a case, if the pilot failed to judge and identify which of the two engines is the problematic one, it could lead to such a situation.\"\n\nBut a senior airline executive countered the argument.\n\n\"The aircraft has two engines. Even if one engine fails, it would be difficult to climb, but only if it has a full load. The 50-seater plane was carrying just 17 people, a third of its capacity. I don't believe a bird strike downed the plane.\"\n\nHe, however, suspects poor maintenance. On Wednesday, the plane had taken off after 30 days on the ground.\n\nIn many cases, a plane stored for several weeks or months could encounter problems if it is flown without a proper inspection. Saurya does not have a hangar in Kathmandu.\n\nA civil aviation body official confirmed that the 9N-AME had been on the ground for 30 days.\n\n\"The engine exploded. Given the nature of the explosion, foreign object damage (FOD) to an aircraft engine can be suspected. FOD happens when a foreign object impacts the engine. Since there are no proper hangers for the storage of its planes in Kathmandu, FOD cannot be ruled out,\" said the expert, dismissing the bird strike theory.\n\nA senior air safety specialist, who wished not to be named because the investigation is ongoing, said both events -- a bird strike and FOD -- cannot be ruled out.\n\n\"Only the flying captain, the lone survivor, and the black box can tell us what exactly happened,\" said the air safety specialist. \"However, to stop unnecessary rumours, the investigation team should record the captain's statement and release a preliminary report immediately.\"\n\nAviation analyst Hemanta Arjyal wrote on the social media platform X: \"We do not know what actually happened in today's crash, but engine seems to be the culprit. And technically, IF a multi-engine aircraft suffers an engine failure during the takeoff roll, THE AIRCRAFT WILL YAW TOWARDS THE FAILED ENGINE.\"\n\nThe airline company has been in a financial crisis for several years. Its financial health deteriorated especially after the Covid pandemic.\n\nLast year, it submitted a plan to the civil aviation body to switch to ATR-72-type aircraft and promised to maintain safety standards of the existing fleet until it imported the ATR planes. However, airline officials say they could not secure investment to replace their fleet.\n\nHowever, the civil aviation body overlooked the airline's financial condition, which is obviously a major safety concern.\n\n\"With Nepal's key festival just over two months away, Saurya, which had a total of three aircraft, was planning a full maintenance of the Bombardier that crashed on Wednesday to remain afloat. The Bombardier CRJ200 had 200 engine hours left for full maintenance,\" according to insiders. Full maintenance alone does not necessarily ensure full safety of flights.\n\nNow the airline is left with just one airworthy plane, and authorities are unlikely to allow the company to operate for the same reason. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli paid a rare visit to the crash site on Wednesday.\n\nSaurya Airlines had also laid off staff due to financial problems last year. Despite several attempts, the airline officials could not be reached for comments.\n\nAccording to insiders, poor aircraft maintenance could be one of the potential crash factors, as keeping planes airworthy is costly.\n\nEngineers who wrote \"fit to fly\" too died in the crash.\n\nYet in the immediate aftermath of the crash, there is also a lot of confusion.\n\nAnother aviation expert ruled out the possibility of poor maintenance. \"The entire maintenance team was on the plane. Why would they be on a suicide mission if the plane was ill-maintained?\"\n\nHowever, the crash has shed light on different aspects of regulatory failure.\n\nIt was later found that among the entire maintenance team, two passengers [one child and a woman], the son and wife of a Saurya technician, were flown in the plane cleared for maintenance, which is against the rule.\n\n\"This suggests the regulator's negligence,\" said Sanjiv Gautam, former director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. \"How can the regulator allow passengers on the ferry flight? That's sheer negligence.\"\n\nA ferry flight involves flying an aircraft from one location to another without passengers or cargo, typically for maintenance purposes.\n\nAviation in Nepal is beset with deep-set corruption and mismanagement.\n\nThe frequent crashes have deterred foreign tourists. Especially high-end tourists have been avoiding travel outside Kathmandu by air because they worry about safety, according to tour operators.\n\nGlobal aviation watchdogs have questioned the civil aviation body's dual role and urged Nepal to split the organisation into two entities -- service provider and regulator -- to enhance the safety of flyers.\n\nHowever, successive governments have not shown much interest, although they have spent over Rs 500 million on drafting the civil aviation bills.\n\nFollowing the September 2012 crash of Sita Air Flight 601 in the Manohara river, which killed 19 people, including seven British citizens, the European Commission imposed a blanket ban on Nepali airlines from flying into the 27-nation bloc in December 2013.\n\nIt's been 11 years, and the ban has not been lifted as Nepal has failed to address safety deficiencies.\n\nAccording to Nepal's civil aviation body, nearly 950 people have died in air crashes in the country since the first disaster was recorded in August 1955. And just in a year and a half, more than 100 people have perished in air crashes, indicating higher casualties as bigger aircraft are involved in recent accidents.\n\nIn January 2023, a Yeti Airlines plane crashed in Pokhara, killing all 72 people on board, in the third biggest air accident in terms of casualties. The crash happened two weeks after the inauguration of the China-funded airport.\n\nThe first big air accident in Nepal happened on September 28, 1992, when an Airbus A310 belonging to Pakistan International Airlines slammed into a hillside at Bhattedanda near the Kathmandu Valley, killing 167 people on board.\n\nBefore that, on July 31, 1992, an Airbus A310 of Thai Airways crashed in Ghyangphedi, killing 113 on board.\n\nThe government on Wednesday formed a five-member commission headed by Ratish Chandra Lal Suman, former director general of Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, to investigate the crash.", "source": {"uri": "kathmandupost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "kathmandupost.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saurya_Airlines",

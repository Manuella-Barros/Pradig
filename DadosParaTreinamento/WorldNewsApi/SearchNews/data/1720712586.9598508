Results are rolling in from across the country in the local elections, with Sinn F\u00e9in struggling and the government parties very pleased indeed with their results, while the electorate\u2019s preference for Independents has emerged as another clear trend. Here\u2019s a few snaps from the count centres, where hundreds of candidates await their fate. Rolling News Rolling News Sinn F\u00e9in leader Mary Lou McDonald tells reporters earlier this afternoon she\u2019s disappointed at the party\u2019s results so far in the local and European elections. A surge in the popularity of Independents and heavy splitting of the Sinn F\u00e9in vote due to its record high number of candidates have contributed to the party\u2019s failure to capture the anti-government vote.

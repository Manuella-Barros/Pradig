Budenholzer and the Hawks parted ways after the 2017-2018 season and he took over as the head coach of the Milwaukee Bucks. He led the Bucks to an NBA championship during the 2020-2021 season, beating the Hawks in six games in the conference finals along the way.

An announcement could arrive next week. According to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, Budenholzer is already working to assemble a coaching staff with the momentum building.\n\nThe Suns fired Vogel after one season in which Phoenix finished 49-33 and was swept out of the NBA playoffs by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round.\n\nVogel, Kevin Young and Doc Rivers were the three finalists for the job last year after Monty Williams was let go, although Budenholzer interviewed to be the Suns' head coach back in 2018.\n\nBudenholzer is an Arizona native from Holbrook. He was an assistant coach under Gregg Popovich with the San Antonio Spurs from 1996-2013 where he won four titles.\n\nHis record with the Hawks was 213-197 over five seasons, and he won the 2014-15 Coach of the Year award. The Bucks hired him after he and the Hawks parted ways, and he won Coach of the Year in his first season there.\n\nBudenholzer was Milwaukee's head coach for five seasons, including their NBA championship run in 2020-21 when the Bucks defeated the Suns in six games.\n\nHis record in Milwaukee was 271-120 where he coached two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, but he was dismissed after a first-round exit in 2022-23.\n\nThe Suns have had six head coaches in the past nine seasons, with Williams sticking for the longest tenure of four years.\n\nOwner Mat Ishbia has fired two head coaches since taking over the team last year with championship aspiration falling short.\n\n\"We are here to win a championship and last season was way below our expectations,\" president of basketball operations and general manager James Jones said in a statement Thursday. \"We will continue to evaluate our operation and make the necessary changes to reach our championship-caliber goals. We all take accountability, and it's my job, along with Josh (Bartelstein) and ownership, to build a championship team.\"\n\nGambadoro reported former player J.J. Redick will not be part of the search, as his name has popped up in other coaching searches this cycle.\n\nPortland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups would have support from the Suns' players, according to Yahoo Sports' Jake Fischer.

The team wants to correct its mistakes from the past few coaching hires and is being diligent with its search.\n\nSome names that have been leaked include former Milwaukee Bucks head coach Mike Budenholzer, Golden State Warriors assistant Kenny Atkinson, and former NBA guard JJ Redick, among others. Los Angeles is likely to prioritize experience with this hire after Ham was a first-time head coach.\n\nThere have been all sorts of rumors flying around about who the team should hire and everyone has a different opinion. Former NBA lottery pick Evan Turner gave his opinion while on his podcast \"Point Forward' and advocated for the Lakers to hire Budenholzer to lead this team forward.\n\n\"I'm randomly a Budenholzer fan and I'm not going to lie. Budenholzer, former hooper. Budenholzer has a way of communicating with people and to deal with Bron you have to really be able to deal with Bron. Not so much manage but you just got to be a confident indivudual and Bron has to be able to trust you.\"\n\nBudenholzer is probably the most accomplished coach available right now, winning the 2021 NBA title with the Bucks. But the issue with him is that he is the one who taught Ham all he knows about coaching. Ham worked on Budenholzer's staff while in both Milwaukee and Atlanta so it could be more of the same.\n\nWhile Budenholzer wouldn't be a bad hire, most don't expect the Lakers to pull the trigger on it. Los Angeles may be better suited looking elsewhere, even if it means bringing in another first-time head coach. The team has to get this hire correct, otherwise, they run the risk of being in the same place again in a few years.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_levine@si.com", "name": "Matt Levine", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Budenholzer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Budenholzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Atkinson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Atkinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evan Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft_lottery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft lottery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2691,h_1513,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/all_lakers/01hxfk3ejwywem5y34pz.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555138", "eventUri": "eng-9555138", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

You've made my dream come true, thank you. I don't know if this is protocol or not, but I wanted to ask you, could I keep your shirt or a towel or something?\" Cachin asked Nadal at the net.\n\nNadal, who claimed a 6-1 6-7 (5) 6-3 win over Cachin, came through for the Argentinian, giving the 29-year-old one of his shirts. Later, Cachin pictured the gift and posted it on his Instagram Story and also humbly expressed grattitude to Nadal for his gesture.\n\nWhile many thoughts of Cachin's act as something that was done in a humble manner, there were some who thought of the Argentinian's move as something that a competitor should never do.\n\nMost notably, Jiri Lehecka - who sent Nadal packing out of Madrid in the round-of-16 - said he thought of Cachin's act as \"weird\" and something that he would not do after a match.\n\n\"That was pretty fun from Pedro. I felt like it was a classy move, which we don't have in tennis. I don't think I ever had it,\" Medvedev told The National.\n\nWhen addressing the Cachin and Nadal situation, former world No. 1 Medvedev revealed that there was also one situation in the past when a player asked him for a shirt. At the time, Medvedev had no issues in giving one of his shirts but he was short-handed on his shirts and politely told the player to ask him after the tournament ends.\n\nAlso, Medvedev shared that he is not into asking others for souvenirs because if he started doing that, he would start collecting it in a big way and not just from a few players.\n\n\"I think someone once asked me, it was in a Grand Slam. I don't think I gave him because I had like five T-shirts, it was like in Australia or US Open, one of the two, and it was humid and I said, 'Look, after the tournament ask me and I'll do it no problem,'\" Medvedev added.\n\n\"I would never have wanted to from one person. If I would do it, I would start collecting, five, 10, here and there. Not my thing to do it with one person. So I would collect many, if it would become a thing.\"\n\nJust like Medvedev, three-time Grand Slam finalist Jabeur also thought that Cachin didn't do anything wrong in asking Nadal for a souvenir.\n\nAfter making that clear, former world No. 2 Jabeur revealed that she will likely be doing similar things in the future.\n\n\"I think because he's Argentinian, and he's into football a lot and that's what they do in football, but I think it was a very sweet thing to have,\" Jabeur said of Cachin asking Nadal for a souvenir.\n\n\"But now basically I'm going to ask every player for their T-shirt maybe. I think the most common thing in tennis would be a racquet, not a T-shirt, but definitely one day I would want to have a souvenir of the players that I like and enjoy, maybe for my academy to keep it for sure.\"\n\nEarlier in the week, world No. 1 Iga Swiatek also spoke very positively of Cachin and his move. Swiatek, who grew up idolizing Nadal, admitted in a funny way that she would also pull a Cachin if she was in a situation to do so.\n\n\"If I would play against Rafa, for sure I would ask for a T-shirt. But that's not possible,\" Swiatek said with a smile on her face.\n\nAgainst Nadal, Cachin had the entire stadium against him as the Madrid crowd was heavily rooting for the Spaniard in the hopes of seeing him extend his presumably last campaign at Caja Magica for at least another round. In the end, Cachin didn't go down without a fight but Nadal managed to escape with a win and reach the round-of-16 before losing to Lehecka.\n\nCachin may have lost to Nadal but he competed well and took home something that will always be an outstanding piece of memorabilia.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dzevad_mesic@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Dzevad Mesic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Cach\u00edn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Cach\u00edn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji\u0159\u00ed_Lehe\u010dka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Lehe\u010dka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Abu_Dhabi)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The National (Abu Dhabi)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaniards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spaniards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caja_M\u00e1gica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caja M\u00e1gica"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image148363.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542772", "eventUri": "eng-9542772", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

Pedro Cachin asking for Rafael Nadal souvenir causes a racket", "body": "Swapping jerseys in football is commonplace, and part of a tradition that dates back almost 100 years. It gives opponents the chance to show mutual respect, while keeping a special memento from a certain game.\n\nThat tradition has spread across sports, catching on in basketball, NFL, and other sports. This week in Madrid, Argentina's Pedro Cachin may have just started the trend in tennis.\n\nIt wasn't a jersey swap per se, but after he lost a gruelling three-hour match to Rafael Nadal at the Caja Magica on Monday, Cachin expressed his admiration for the Spanish 22-time major champion and made a surprise request.\n\n\"You have fulfilled a dream for me. Can I keep your shirt or something of yours?\" Cachin asked Nadal as they shook hands at the net.\n\nNadal then went to his bench to collect a used match shirt and gave it to Cachin.\n\nAs Nadal resumed his farewell tour this spring in what is very likely the last season of his professional career, Cachin knew how special it was to be drawn against the Spaniard for the first time, and in a goosebump-inducing atmosphere no less, as the roaring home crowd on Manolo Santana Stadium rallied behind their greatest ever champion.\n\nIt was a beautiful moment and a warm gesture that took the tour - and social media - by storm, with many players weighing in over the past few days here in Madrid.\n\n\"If I would play against Rafa, for sure I would ask for a T-shirt,\" said women's World No 1 Iga Swiatek.\n\nThird-seeded Daniil Medvedev thought the request from Cachin was \"classy\", one that perhaps might inspire others to begin collecting shirts from their opponents.\n\n\"That was pretty fun from Pedro. I felt like it was a classy move, which we don't have in tennis. I don't think I ever had it,\" said Medvedev.\n\n\"I think someone once asked me, it was in a Grand Slam. I don't think I gave him because I had like five T-shirts, it was like in Australia or US Open, one of the two, and it was humid and I said, 'Look, after the tournament ask me and I'll do it no problem'.\n\n\"I would never have wanted to from one person. If I would do it, I would start collecting, five, 10, here and there. Not my thing to do it with one person. So I would collect many, if it would become a thing.\"\n\nTunisian Ons Jabeur is also a fan of the idea, and said she'd love to display kit worn by her opponents to display at her own academy one day.\n\n\"I think because he's Argentinian, and he's into football a lot and that's what they do in football, but I think it was a very sweet thing to have,\" Jabeur said of Cachin.\n\n\"But now basically I'm going to ask every player for their T-shirt maybe. I think the most common thing in tennis would be a racquet, not a T-shirt, but definitely one day I would want to have a souvenir of the players that I like and enjoy, maybe for my academy to keep it for sure.\"\n\nHaving a souvenir from a specific match is something many players would like to have but rarely thought of much in the past.\n\nOutside the ceremonial pre-match photo taken at the net, there aren't that many opportunities to personally commemorate a tennis battle.\n\nArgentina's Horacio Zeballos once took a selfie with Novak Djokovic after he lost to the Serb in a match in Doha, and he did the same with Nadal in Barcelona a couple of months later.\n\n\"The picture is better than taking something from them. I don't want to tell them, 'Give me one T-shirt' or something like that. So a picture allows me to remember them for all my life,\" Zeballos told ATP Uncovered.\n\nFormer US Open finalist Madison Keys said she would have loved to find a special way to commemorate a match she played against Serena Williams in New York in 2015.\n\n\"I don't know if I have ever wanted to take, like, a souvenir, but there have been moments where in the moment I was, like, 'Wow, I wish I could bottle this moment so I could revisit it',\" recalled Keys.\n\n\"I think that one moment for me that really stands out is when I played Serena on Labor Day Weekend on [Arthur] Ashe [Stadium], and it was packed, and it was the year she was going for all four [grand slam]. So everyone was there.\n\n\"It was honestly the coolest experience to be able to walk out. Obviously I lost, which kind of sucked, but I mean, just that moment is something that I think will always forever be one of my favourite tennis memories.\"\n\nWilliams donned a coral pink tie-dye dress during that US Open; surely Keys would have loved to have one of those hanging in her closet, or at least the accompanying yellow bandana?\n\nNot everyone was on board with Cachin's move. Jiri Lehecka, who knocked out Nadal in the fourth round on Tuesday, marking the Mallorcan's last appearance on the ATP Tour in Madrid, said asking for a shirt was the farthest thing from his mind.\n\n\"It's tough for me to say, because I went on the court to win, you know?\" said the Czech No 30 seed.\n\n\"Then it's tough for me to run after him and to ask him if he can give me something. I don't want to sound disrespectful or something - that's the last thing I would like to - but if you are playing a match and you are thinking about asking the guy to give you something, then why you are there? It's kind of weird, in my opinion.\"\n\nNick Kyrgios does not agree, and responded on X to a pundit who made that same argument, saying: \"NBA players, soccer players do it all the time? It's a memory, an experience that took a lifetime of work and that less than one per cent of humans get to.\"", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"},

Austrian content creator Lukas Knapp, who looks a lot like Nadal, made a video on Instagram recently where he imitated the Spanish legend of all his mannerisms on the court. Fans couldn't get enough of him as it was superbly entertaining.\n\nThe imitation video began by Knapp waving to a few people when entering into a clay court by wearing a white headband, orange jacket, purple shorts, and white Nike shoes, which Rafael Nadal exactly adorned at the Madrid Open 2024. The Austrian was also seen holding a Babolat racket in his right hand, a brand Nadal has famously used throughout his career.\n\nTo make matters more interesting, Knapp clubbed the video to the song 'Mary on a Cross' by the band 'Ghost'. A loud voice announces 'Nadal's' name and on that, Knapp took off the jacket and started warming up. From there on, Knapp nailed Nadal's left-armed power shot, his style of argument with the chair umpire, and his repetitive 'lawnmover' celebration style.\n\nMost importantly, Knapp bounced the tennis ball with his racquet before serving, whilst touching his nose, ears, and face, exactly like Rafael Nadal. He also wiped the sweat off his face with his wristband. In the end, he bowed out exactly like Nadal bid adieu to the Manolo Santana stadium.\n\nLukas Knapp shared this video with the caption, \"Adios Madrid\".\n\nMost people found themselves joyous with the pinpoint mimicry of their idol. Here are some top reactions from the post.\n\n\"If they made a contest that looked more like Rafa Nadal you would win and Rafa would come second haha\"\n\n\"#austrainrafa on fire\"\n\n\"Great ! It was sweet time to see him all this years with his mimics!\"\n\n\"Austrian Rafael Nadal\"\n\nSome, even in this entertaining video, found subtle flaws to complain about it.\n\nHowever, it was all done in good humor and Knapp laughed about it. Surely, when Rafael Nadal sees it, he too would mostly enjoy it a lot.\n\nBesides his achievements and prowess on the tennis court, Rafael Nadal is also a perfect gentleman. He is a good example of someone being humble and behaving well on and off court. But the Spaniard enjoys a good laugh or joke about himself here and there too.\n\nThere are several examples peppered over the Internet, where fans, comedians, and tennis players alike have mimicked him. Some of them have done it in front of him too. Nadal never frowned or got irritated, but instead enjoyed it to the fullest.\n\nFrom his oldest rivals Roger Federer and Andy Roddick to a famous Rafa impersonator Elliot Loney, many have imitated Rafael Nadal. Novak Djokovic too imitated him on numerous occasions.\n\nHere's a clip from the 2009 Italian Open trophy ceremony, where Djokovic was adjusting his t-shirt to make it sleeveless, and then imitating his unique style. Nadal had a good laugh with Djokovic about it.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tanmay_roy@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Tanmay Roy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji\u0159\u00ed_Lehe\u010dka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Lehe\u010dka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babolat", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Babolat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Santana", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Santana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Roddick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Roddick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/c2abdcde-rafael-nadal-impersonator-lukas-knapp.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542772", "eventUri": "eng-9542772", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

The Spaniard has won the prestigious ATP Masters 1000 tournament a record 10 times, and has entered the main draw of this year's edition on a protected ranking.\n\nNadal managed an injury-free run at the Madrid Open recently, where he reached the Round of 16 before being ousted by eventual semifinalist Jiri Lehecka. While Lehecka defeated the former ATP World No. 1 in straight sets, across the prior rounds, Nadal looked back to his best at times.\n\nThe highlight of the 22-time Grand Slam winner's Madrid Open run was his win over No. 10 seed Alex de Minaur in the second round. Now, Nadal's sights are firmly set on mustering a similar, if not better, run at the Italian Open.\n\nRecently, Andy Roddick assessed the Spaniard's chances at the Italian Open during an episode of the Served With Andy Roddick podcast. However, before that, the 41-year-old said that he witnessed Nadal's recent Madrid Open run without worrying if the Spaniard would get injured.\n\n\"I forgot to look for injuries at a certain point this week (at the Madrid Open) with Rafa, and it was just watching him play tennis,\" Roddick said.\n\nRoddick went on to say that if Nadal can manage another run of two or three matches in Rome, the Spaniard would be, to some extent, confident about his chances at the French Open.\n\n\"Says he's going to play Rome, which he should. He's won it 10 times, and then I think, if he can get two or three matches in at Rome, I think he's actually, it's not the preparation (for the French Open) that's perfect, but it's as good as it could be,\" Roddick added.\n\nRafael Nadal drawn against qualifier in Italian Open first round; will face Hubert Hurkacz if he progresses\n\nNadal is set to begin his 2024 Italian Open campaign against a qualifier. While it's still not confirmed which qualifier he will play against, if he beats his first-round opponent, he will face ATP World No. 9 Hubert Hurkacz in the second round.\n\nHubert, the No. 7 seed, has received a first-round bye. If the Spaniard does go on to face the Pole in Rome, it would be the pair's first ever meeting on the ATP tour.\n\nHurkacz, similar to Nadal, was eliminated from the Madrid Open in the Round of 16 by another eventual semifinalist in Taylor Fritz.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sudipto_pati@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Sudipto Pati", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Roddick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andy Roddick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji\u0159\u00ed_Lehe\u010dka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Lehe\u010dka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_de_Minaur", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex de Minaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Conferences", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/4a35e-17150074237624-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542772", "eventUri": "eng-9542772", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

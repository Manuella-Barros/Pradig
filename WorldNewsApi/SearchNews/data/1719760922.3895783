Sounds straightforward enough, but there are dozens of different steps and sub-steps involved in that life cycle\u2014and when there\u2019s that many processes, there are inevitably various blind spots and bottlenecks that impact efficiency and, ultimately, profitability. Fortunately, by creating a digital blueprint of every process in the vehicle life cycle, FMCs can get better visibility into their operations, wring out inefficiencies and start making better business decisions. Inability To See The Full Picture Blind spots and bottlenecks take many forms. A newly ordered vehicle can sit in title and registration days or even weeks longer than it needs to because the fleet manager doesn\u2019t have real-time visibility into the status of that particular vehicle\u2019s registration. As a result, they have to make repeated phone calls and emails to get a status update, and things inevitably fall through the cracks\u2014the old \u201coh, the title actually came through a week ago\u2014didn\u2019t we email you?\u201d MORE FOR YOU Trump Trial Prosecutor Ends Closing Argument After Nearly 5 Hours\u2014Jury Instructions Set For Wednesday Gas Explosion In Downtown Youngstown Ohio Injures At Least 7 Trump Lashes Out At Robert De Niro After Actor Calls Him A \u2018Tyrant\u2019 Outside Courthouse The net result is delays in getting the vehicle to the customer, which means more idle days where that vehicle isn\u2019t generating revenue. Pitfalls lurk around the upfitting and vehicle prep phase as well. After placing an order for a pickup truck, for example, the FMC might need to get it kitted out with a carbon truck bed liner and a lockable storage box before it is delivered to the customer. However, what if once the vehicle arrives at the upfitter, those specific parts are on back order and will take several weeks to arrive? Voil\u00e0: another delay in getting the vehicle to the customer\u2014one that could have been avoided if the upfitter had received a heads-up about what new vehicles were coming down the pipeline so that they could plan ahead with ordering parts, preempting any supply chain bottlenecks. Similar blind spots arise when it comes to determining what to do with a vehicle when its lease is up. Sell it off? Fix it up and lease it to another customer? What is actually the most profitable decision for the business? Blueprinting For Success If FMCs create a digital blueprint of their fleet business\u2014a flow map that traces the path of a vehicle through each step of the vehicle life cycle\u2014they can start to gain visibility into where the blind spots and bottlenecks exist within their organization. This is not necessarily a new concept. Business improvement methodologies like Six Sigma process mapping have been a mainstay of organizational improvement for decades, using everything from pen and paper, to Excel spreadsheets and PowerPoint decks. What\u2019s new is that technology can help pull together ever greater amounts of information about the business, creating more comprehensive process maps. Getting Started As a first step, organizations should ensure they are including all the right departments and teams in their blueprinting efforts. Operations, customer experience, finance and IT are all critical to properly blueprinting the process workflow because each department impacts the others. (For instance, a breakdown in the operations workflow can cause delays to delivery, which can impact revenue and customer satisfaction. The fallout from an operational snag is not limited to just the operations department.) Once they\u2019ve mapped out processes, FMCs should be clear on what specific issue they\u2019re trying to move the needle on. Less idle time for vehicles? Faster delivery to customers? Building key performance indicators for each step in the life cycle is important so you can measure how long a vehicle is remaining in a particular stage or step in the process. Connecting data from different systems like CRM, ERP and fleet systems will allow you to better track performance. There are also plenty of business intelligence tools on the market that can consolidate data and provide reporting. This consolidation is valuable, but these tools still require someone to take action on the information they provide in order to improve KPIs. In other words, they\u2019ll provide information about \u201cwhat\u2019s going on,\u201d but they won\u2019t automatically initiate the logical next step toward improving the status quo and moving a KPI in the right direction. A platform that can orchestrate automations can be useful here in helping vehicles move more smoothly through the life cycle\u2014for example, by triggering certain actions to take place as soon as a specific step or sub-step has been crossed off, which will then optimize completion of the remaining steps. (Disclosure: My company provides an automation platform, as do others.) While the various steps of a process can be performed manually by organizations via checklists and consistent, ongoing communication, automation reduces the chances of anything being inadvertently missed. Companies may experience some challenges when getting started with automation platforms. For example, some employees are too busy being overworked to take even more time to set up a platform to make their life easier. Other employees may resist the idea of automating part of their jobs. But positioning this technology as getting digital workers to offload their grunt work helps. For smaller companies, the initial investment may also be a deterrent to moving forward with the initiative. Since it\u2019s a new platform, I recommend you look into which group would have this already baked into their budgets. Additionally, it can be daunting to think about automating workflows across your entire company at once. Breaking it up into smaller groups first is one mitigating approach. Given how quickly one suboptimal step in the vehicle life cycle can ripple outward and cause a negative impact on the business, it\u2019s well worth FMCs taking a second look at their organizational processes and creating a digital blueprint\u2014one that allows them to find and eliminate the blind spots and bottlenecks that might be holding them back. Ultimately, this is a case where you can\u2019t fix problems if you can\u2019t even see them.

A statement read: \u201cRuth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes have confirmed their marriage is over and they are in the process of divorcing.\u201d The Sun on Sunday reported that Langsford will not be in her anchor position on Loose Women this week, despite Holmes continuing his work with GB News. A source told the newspaper the TV presenter knows fans will want to hear from him and he will not shy away from sharing his side of the story. They said: \u201cEamonn is always frank on camera and knows it will be odd for him to discuss the day\u2019s news without mentioning his split so he\u2019ll say a few words. \u201cHe is putting on a brave face and will be the true professional he always is. Focusing on work will be a welcome distraction.\u201d A source also told the Mail Online: \"Ruth and her team have been telling their friends to look out for the comments, which they are planning to put on social media. \"It's a very sorry tale. \"They are both so loved by the British public, they won over so many people on This Morning which they hosted for more than a decade.\" Holmes broke his silence following news of the split emerging at weekend by celebrating Manchester United's FA Cup win just hours after it was announced that he and Langsford are going their separate ways. Celebrating Man Utd's shock 2-1 over rivals Manchester City, Holmes said: \u201cMy God, what a Cup Final, what a Result! #MUFC European football next season too. The Magic of The Cup. Congratulations to the whole squad.\u201d He was then inundated with replies on the Instagram post from fans expressing their shock and sadness over his relationship break-up. \"Quite apart from the footie, I'm really sad to hear about you and Ruth,\u201d one user posted alongside a crying emoji. It comes just days after Langsford spoke of her fears her husband may never walk again unaided. GB News presenter Eamonn and Loose Women star Ruth, who married in 2010 after 13 years of dating, have one son, Jack, who was born in 2002. The celebrity couple first began presenting ITV daytime programme This Morning together in 2006, before leaving the programme in 2021 and being replaced by Dermot O\u2019Leary and Alison Hammond. He also presented Channel 5 programmes with Langsford including How The Other Half Lives, Do The Right Thing With Eamonn And Ruth and Eamonn And Ruth\u2019s 7 Year Itch. Holmes, who has also fronted coverage on GMTV and Sky News\u2019 Sunrise, launched Breakfast With Eamonn And Isabel on GB News in January 2022. Eamonn also has three children, Declan, Rebecca and Niall, from his first marriage. He and his first wife Gabrielle, who fell for one another in the summer of 1976, split up in 1996 after a 10-year marriage. In his 2008 book, This is My Life: The Autobiography, he discussed how the marriage broke down in the period following the death of his father Leonard. He wrote: \u201cGabrielle was increasingly indifferent and I didn\u2019t know why. \u201cI needed her close, I needed her to reach me and ease my pain, but she had concerns of her own, principal of which was an impending birth.\u201d Former Strictly contestant Ruth also regularly presents Loose Women, having begun on the show in the 1990s. In an interview last week Ruth said she was worried Eamonn \u201cmight never be 100 per cent right\u201d amid his health struggles. She told Women\u2019s Weekly: \u201cI don\u2019t know how much Eamonn\u2019s mobility will improve. We live in hope. He does the physio, but there might have to be some acceptance that this might never be 100 per cent right. \u201cWith any care situation \u2014 and there are millions of carers in this country \u2014 it isn\u2019t always easy. It\u2019s testing, but we manage as a family.\u201d The Loose Women host said her husband\u2019s struggles had made her think about her own health. She added: \u201cI look at Eamonn, who\u2019s had his health and back problems, and it makes you realise how important your health is.\u201d Eamonn himself admitted earlier this year that because of back surgery that went wrong he couldn\u2019t dress himself and feared he could be confined to a wheelchair for the rest his life. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s as if somebody up there is playing with my life. In the past year I\u2019ve had an operation on my back which went wrong and has confined me to a wheelchair. I\u2019ve fallen and broken my shoulder. Honestly you could not make it up.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Northern Irish TV presenter Eamonn Holmes is reportedly set to address his split with Loose Women star Ruth Langsford when he returns to GB News on Monday.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/style/celebrity/celebrity-news/eamonn-holmes-set-to-address-ruth-langsford-split-on-gb-news/a1609604219.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/zknDB7Fh_YLYU7l29aSVxG11u-c=/0x40:3120x2120/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/516a9885-ecd9-470f-8b14-d978fcccd98e/ffe5e54c-e469-46e6-b5c1-3cd6027a11c1/516a9885-ecd9-470f-8b14-d978fcccd98e.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:15:23", "author": "Christopher Leebody", "authors": ["Christopher Leebody"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.144}

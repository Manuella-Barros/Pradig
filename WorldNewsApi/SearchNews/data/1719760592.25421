Science has finally solved ... [+] the mystery of its origin. getty The cockroach, contrary to popular belief, isn\u2019t one species. There are over 4600 varieties of cockroaches, of which 30 are considered pests\u2014largely due to their unintended \u201cdomestication\u201d by thriving in human environments. The diversity among cockroach species is a result of parallel evolution, where different species evolve similar traits independently, often as a response to similar environmental pressures. This evolutionary mechanism has enabled cockroaches to colonize a range of ecological niches around the world. For example, the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) is known for its large size and is commonly found in commercial environments like restaurants due to its preference for warm, humid conditions. The Oriental cockroach (Blatta orientalis), on the other hand, thrives in dark, moist areas such as basements, earning it the nickname \u201cwater bug.\u201d Other species, such as the Australian cockroach (Periplaneta australasiae), prefer outdoor environments. Of the 30 species that dwell in our homes and other buildings, the German cockroach (Blattella germanica) is the most prevalent. These pests are found primarily in kitchens and bathrooms within human homes, thriving in environments where food and moisture are readily available. They often hide in small cracks and crevices during the day and come out at night to forage for food. German cockroaches are most commonly found in kitchens and bathrooms.

Consider the American cockroach, for instance, which traces its roots not to the Americas, but to North Africa or the Middle East. Roaches are notorious for hitching rides in the warm, humid and dinghy food-rich environments of ships. And this is precisely what happened with \u2018German\u2019 cockroaches, according to a recent paper published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It was about 250 years ago, during a period marked by the aftermath of the Seven Years War and widespread poverty across Central Europe, that the German cockroach was classified by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus. Linnaeus named the insect the \u201cGerman\u201d cockroach (Blattella germanica) based on the specimens he collected in Central Europe. The German cockroach is named after the region it was first classified in, not after its origin, ... [+] which happens to be South and Southeast Asia. getty Today, German cockroaches are ubiquitous. If you\u2019ve ever encountered a cockroach in your home, it\u2019s highly likely it was Blattella germanica. To understand its widespread presence despite a localized name, researchers behind the paper conducted an extensive study, sampling genome-wide markers from 281 cockroaches across 17 countries spanning six continents. Here\u2019s what they found: German Cockroach Are Notorious Hitchhikers From South And Southeast Asia The German cockroach is believed to have evolved from the Asian cockroach (Blattella asahinai) around 2,100 years ago, likely within human settlements in India or Myanmar. Genomic research has mapped out two major pathways for the global spread of German cockroaches: an older route that took them westward to the Middle East around 1,200 years ago and a more recent eastward expansion during the European colonial era about 390 years ago. The westward expansion may have been significantly influenced by the intensifying commercial and military activities of the Islamic Umayyad or Abbasid Caliphates. These dynasties, known for their extensive trade routes and military campaigns, likely facilitated the spread of cockroaches across their territories. The eastward expansion, occurring approximately 390 years ago, was likely driven by the European colonial powers\u2019 commercial activities, particularly those of the Dutch and British East India Companies. These companies established extensive maritime trade networks between South and Southeast Asia, providing ideal conditions for the transportation and establishment of German cockroaches in new regions. While Europe wasn\u2019t originally pivotal to the \u201cdomestication\u201d or early dispersal of the German cockroach, European innovations in long-distance transport and climate-controlled environments have significantly increased their chances of successfully moving to and establishing in new regions. The current genetic makeup of German cockroach populations reflects the political boundaries of countries today. This pattern suggests that as international trade expanded, different regional populations of German cockroaches were established. These regional populations likely adapted and evolved somewhat independently, leading to genetic differences that align with the geographic and political divisions seen in human societies. Essentially, as humans moved and traded globally, they inadvertently helped distribute and establish different genetic groups of German cockroaches in various parts of the world. As successful as German cockroaches are in evolutionary terms, many people are understandably repelled by German cockroaches. These pests pose significant public health risks. They are notorious for spreading diseases by contaminating food and surfaces they come into contact with. Additionally, German cockroaches are known to exacerbate asthma and trigger allergic reactions in many individuals. Their ability to proliferate rapidly in various environments makes them a persistent threat to hygiene and health wherever humans reside.

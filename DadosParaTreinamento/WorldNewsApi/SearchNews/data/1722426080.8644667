{"id": 243287034, "title": "Shocking ER Experience During Spain Vacation", "text": "Shortly afterward, the doctor returned to share my results: No brain damage. He suspected that my headaches were being exacerbated by the anxiety and tension I had developed as a result of the injury, and he handed me a prescription for a common Spanish painkiller. He instructed me to return if my symptoms worsened or didn\u2019t clear up. Checking out at the front desk, I braced myself for the grand total, knowing from bitter experience that a CT scan can cost thousands of dollars in the U.S. I was pleasantly surprised when the receptionist told me that the final tally for my ER visit was 729\u20ac. After I paid, she handed me a disc with a copy of my CT scan for my records. She also gave me the documentation I needed to provide to my insurance company for reimbursement. Walking back to our car, I was overwhelmed with relief \u2014 both that I didn\u2019t have a brain injury and that we didn\u2019t have to pay thousands of dollars to confirm that I was going to be OK. Although an unexpected 729\u20ac bill is indeed a hardship for most people (myself included!), I was comforted by knowing that it would be reimbursed and that it wasn\u2019t as much as it could have been back in the States. I also felt sad and frustrated thinking about the extreme shortcomings of our healthcare system in the U.S. \u2014 how even a basic doctor\u2019s visit comes with the worry of not knowing how much you\u2019ll have to pay to get the care you need. Far too often, Americans must choose between prioritizing their health or financial stability. The cost of an emergency room visit can vary greatly depending on the location; the average bill can easily be over $2,000 without insurance. Even with insurance, the numbers can be astronomical for the average American family. If critical care is required or surgery is performed, those costs could skyrocket to $20,000 or more. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that recent polls found that 40% of Americans carry some healthcare debt, despite more than 90% of the U.S. population having health insurance. How do you prepare for an emergency before going abroad (and what to do if it happens to you)?", "summary": "<h1>\u201cI braced myself, thinking back to past experiences in American hospitals.\u201d</h1><p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-06/26/19/enhanced/b2d4cf2d67c4/original-813-1719429726-3.jpg?crop=2121:1414;0,0\" /></p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/ericajacksoncurran/er-visit-abroad-us-health-care\">View Entire Post &rsaquo;</a></p>", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/ericajacksoncurran/er-visit-abroad-us-health-care", "image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-06/26/19/campaign_images/51a69f143c8f/i-ended-up-in-the-er-during-a-vacation-in-spain-h-3-1312-1719429742-6_dblbig.jpg?resize=1200:*", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 03:16:02", "author": "Erica Jackson Curran,https://www.buzzfeed.com/about", "authors": ["Erica Jackson Curran", "https://www.buzzfeed.com/about"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.499}
